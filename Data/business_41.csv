I make several trips to Las Vegas a year for work and I have stayed at many of the other casinos.  I had heard from many people that it was by far the best in Las Vegas.

It is not the best, but it is pretty good.  The guest rooms are large.  They are laid out quite well.  My room gave me a great view down the strip.  The floor to ceiling windows is a nice touch.  The rooms are nicely appointed through out.

The bathrooms are large.  I always enjoy the small flat screen television in the bathroom.  Several hotels do this now, but the television in my bathroom was loud enough for me to hear it while showering.  That simple fact made me happy.

The reason I did not give the Wynn five stars is the choice of patterns and colors.  I find them quite tacky.  I know I am in the minority in this, but I find the decor at the Venetian & Palazzo quite nicer.  The carpet in the hallways is brutal.

I am not a gambler so I can not say much to that.  There are several great food options.  Parking is easy.  I found a spot quickly and had a short walk to the guest room elevators.

I have many friends that always go the cheap route and stay at scary places like Excalibur and Luxor.  Trust me on this.  Spend the extra money and stay at a good hotel\/casino.  There are many to choose from.  Treat yourself to the Wynn, Venetian or Bellagio at least once.  Depending on your tastes one of those will be perfect for you.  I lean toward the Venetian, but Bellagio and Wynn are no slouches.",2,2,2

The shopping is mah-velous. 
Your lobby pomander path is lovely and reminds me of a favorite bag.
Its kinda neat albeit it telltale to have a red card in your wallet - ha ha with my first 50 points I won lots of slot play! YAY!
The room was gorgeous - brown wallpaper and vanilla furniture, bright prints lit individually, remote controlled room temp, shades. The bathroom's double sink and middle vanity were nice, shower and soaking tub and TV and phone - and your toilet seats are my favorite of ALL the hotels I've ever enjoyed.
Everyone, from bell at our taxi, registration, red card, game floor assistance, cocktail waiters, was wonderful. I was surprised to get greeted by a couple staff just walking through.
I'll have to try the spa and pool one next time.
Its close to hot clubs of the moment - surrender and XS.
Only thing I'd say to my fellow yelpers - at check-in ask which side you're on and opt for a upgrade to a higher floor if you aren't planning on staying out all night. It got kinda loud because of the club and stayed loud until 3am. =) good for us - just might not work for some.",0,0,0

The time were were there also were offering $10 free-play slot.  They got many different kind of slot, included some heavy license one like Iron Man 3 and Avatar, never know there's a slot for that.

Everywhere in the Casino was clean and felt comfortable playing here, as with most casino.  They bring free drinks while you are playing here.  This one actually offer you alcohol drinks unlike most other just gave you water or juice.  I would definite come back to stay here and try their famous Buffet.  You can walk to Encore inside without stepping out the sun.  Their play club booth was near the entrance, unlike other casino is hidden some where in the casino floor.",17,15,16

It's not overdone at all, and the zen like centerpiece, the waterfall and reflecting pool, is really great.  The shops are well presented and clean, and of course it's very pricey, as you would expect. 

I visited Tryst, which is one of the nicest nightclubs around, and is a beautiful, beautiful setting.

This is certainly not the place for kids.  Brought my son in a stroller, and the security guard said there weren't really any places for kids, and suggested we go elsewhere, which was rude.  

The Ferrari dealership prohibits the taking of photographs, and when I fired off one shot from like 40 feet away, they acted like they were going to take my camera and beat me up.  

Come to think about it, maybe the problem here is the security...Hmm.",0,1,1

The rooms, as may yelpers note, are fantastic.  Large, and ours was clean.  The bed was very comfortable, it wasn't too soft, which is something I usually find at hotels.  The lights and shade are operated by wall panels that are very easy to operate.  Every time we needed something, be it room service, the bell desk, linens, they arrived very quickly.  I also got a late checkout with no issues, so that was appreciated.

Wynn is beautiful, it's clear the details were important while the property was being built and designed.  That being said, stuff isn't cheap.  From drinks to the gaming tables, it's pricey.  There are some good restaurants, La Cave was a favorite of ours before we stayed here.

Even though everything was great, I had to subtract a star because the air conditioning in our room was not consistent.  It was very difficult to get the room cool, even when it was on 68 and high fan.  So, that was frustrating.  But, overall, very friendly staff and great service.  Just don't get sticker shock.",2,0,1

This hotel has the best of BOTH! WOW! The pool at the Wynn, which is shared with the Encore, is the best and most relaxing pool that I have ever been to. I had such a great time laying down in the heat, enjoying a great drink, and hopping in and out of the pool, that I lost track of time and ended staying at the pool for about 6 hours. 

Very European feel to this pool, and it even has a European section (21+ topless). The water was at perfect temperature, and you can get into the water straight from the get-go without worrying about if it's too cold or not. 

I have been fantasizing about returning to Las Vegas simply for this pool. Would definitely enjoy a trip back here.",2,1,2

I don't know how they got my info because it showed up at my parent's house under my maiden name- I'm celebrating my 2nd anniversary and I've been in AZ for almost that long so it was weird- but I they offered 2 Le Reve tickets, a free meal for 2 at The Buffet, and an amazing room at a great price so I was happy to book a visit.

We booked it at the beginning of summer so when we found out the fight was going to be on the same weekend we were a little anxious about it. We had specifically chosen this weekend because rates were the lowest which I figured would translate into bookings also being the lowest of the season. Nevertheless, we kept our reservations and were determined to stay in the hotel to avoid the crowds once we parked. We spent an entire weekend in the Wynn and there was never a dull moment. 

We also didn't end up spending half as much as I thought we would on alcohol because their alcohol policy is very relaxed. You can bring alcohol into the pool area (just no glass), into Le Reve, and into the restaurants. We ended up getting a pitcher (equal to 5 drinks) at the pool because what is a vacation without a pina colada and I didn't have a blender to make one myself and it was only $60 which was great for Vegas drink prices. The pools were great, there were a ton of them and even with all of the people from the fight, there was plenty of room. Some of the guests were belligerent, but the staff handled it well and it was expected since that is the type of clientele fights attract to Vegas.

My only complaint is the security deposit that the hotel took out was a bit insane. I had put the hotel charge on my debit card without thinking and the deposit was equal to the hotel cost so it felt like getting double charged and when checking in there was no mention on the security deposit (I was ready for the taxes, resort fees, and the room cost, but there was nothing about that charge). It was reversed as soon as I checked out, but it was a shock. I think that might just be a Vegas thing because I haven't had a hotel do that to me anywhere else before and when I mentioned it to a friend they told me that they always noticed that in Vegas.

I recommend downloading the Wynn app while you stay there and to take advantage of the Concierge. Also see Le Reve! It was absolutely breath-taking! My husband was never the show going person until I started dragging him to Circ du Soleil shows when we started dating and even still he only goes in exchange for us going to a sports game, but he was just as entertained and fascinated by this show as I was. Allegro is a great restaurant we enjoyed next to the Le Reve Showroom and there are plenty of onsite dinning options. This place has it all and there is no need to leave the property in order to have a great time.",1,0,0

The only place we stayed was by the stripper pole. And compared to all the females that danced around it, we worked it. Then come to find out, they never clean that damn pole, funny after everything happened, but gross for an upscale club. Hah. You couldn't walk anywhere without getting cut off. Girls bumpin' into you like it's nothing, and elbowing cause they can't dance. Surprised that we didn't fight anyone. I realize Vega's clubs are crowded, but this was worse than our night at Tao's on a Friday. And that was just about it. We were unsatisfied that we just left. Good thing we were all VIP.",2,0,0

The man and I wanted to check out this gorgeous hotel. It is gorgeous and we enjoyed walking around and taking in all the sites. Since we were new to the casino, we decided to sign up for their promotions card called RED which was toting sign up and get $10.00 worth of free slot play.

So, many of you know I am a girl who plays poker and other live action games. I do not typically play slots, but if I do, there is one type of slot I will play (Jackpot Party) and I will do the $0.25 draw poker machines. I decided to put $20 into a draw poker machine, bet the max $1.25 and kept hitting small stuff. My guy was off at another machine and when he finally found me (20 minutes later), and sat down next to me, I was about $40.00 up. Next thing I know, bam, I hit a royal flush and win the jackpot for the day which was about $1,100.00. Talk about fun luck! I then took that $10.00 free slot play to the Jackpot Party machine, put in their $10.00 and a $20.00 bill of mine and ended up cashing out of the $.05 machine for $230.00! 

Long story short, I came home with just as much money as I left for Vegas with and I paid for all of our tips, taxis and misc. stuff with other winnings. 

I love the Wynn!

Their high level of customer service is benchmark to others on the Vegas Strip. Accommodations were excellent. (I was on the 40th floor.)  If you're a seasoned traveler the view of the golf course is most relaxing vs. the Strip view. What a great place to stay!!!

The Wynn Buffet is still The Best Buffet in Vegas - the variety of food, preparation and the environment, all were excellent. (Outstanding rack of lamb, veal and 5 different ceviches. All could stand alone at any fine dining establishment and this is their buffet!) Don't forget to get the bar drink menu.  They have an unlimited ""sparkling wine\/champagne and\/or mimosas deal for $10. available all the time not just at brunch. A GREAT VALUE.

The Tryst nightclub is one of the best in town. DJ Spider was there performing (he's a Chicago regular at places such as Sub51) Groups of attractive women usually no cover charge. Men on the other hand $$. Drinks $10 - $16. Bottle service $500+ (There are deals to be had if arrangements are made in advance...birthdays, bachelorette parties etc.) Check it out!

Le Reve - the Dream at the Wynn Theater was a fantastic production. Simply amazing 75 minute show.

This hotel is simply amazing! Their Tower Suites have their own exclusive check-in counter separate from the General check-in, a private escorted entrance, and a well-trained staff who will cater to your every need and treat you like a royalty.

Right when you enter the exclusive entrance to the Tower Suites, you automatically marvel at the lavish decor and drool over the luxurious designs while you are greeted by a cheerful staff who opens the door to the entrance of the check-in stand.  The counter rarely have any wait and you are instantly offered drinks--bottled water or cocktails and a nice cold or warm (depending on the season) hand towel to freshen you up and soothe you from your long drive or flight.  A true celebrity treatment!  So different from the General check-in stand where normally there is a wait.  After check-in, an attendant walks you to the exclusive elevator and provides you with instructions and directions to your room.  The Tower Suites are floors 60 and above of The Wynn Hotel.  The rooms have breath-taking  views of the strip and loaded with amenities apart from the norm such as TV in the bathroom, phone next to the toilet, bar filled with snacks and drinks, remote controlled curtains, luxury plush mattress and pillows, multi-level spray spa shower head, jacuzzi, complementary Wi-Fi with IT customer service for people like me who are tech-challenged, fax machine, and many more.  The rooms are on the pricey side, which ranges from $450 to $3,000 per night (depending on room size and dates you check-in), but it is worth every penny!  When you stay at The Tower Suites, you have full access to their Concierge who are able to book your dining, spa, show, club, golf, and casino reservations both for Wynn and Encore.  You can also take full advantage of their beautiful and magnificent resort with multi-floor pools free of charge.  As an ordinary guest, you get charge $50\/day for resort fees, but if you stay at the The Tower Suites, those charges are waived.

The interior decor all throughout the hotel is simply marvelous! I totally love every detail of it.  The waterfalls are spectacular and a must-see! It's perfect to have a cup of coffee or cocktail drink at one of their restaurant, bar, or coffee shop spread-out around the hotel and marvel about the dazzling beauty of the falls.  The shops in the hotel are top-of-the-line designer boutiques (Chanel, Dior, Alexander McQueen, Rolex, etc.). The service everywhere in the hotel is first class! You get royalty treatment everywhere you go. Wynn Las Vegas is also filled with the most notable and acclaimed restaurants in Las Vegas from fine dining to casual and even vegan ( for complete list and see more photos: http:\/\/www.wynnlasvegas.com\/Restaurants).  The buffet is one of the best in Las Vegas.

Words can't describe how beautiful and luxurious The Wynn Hotel is especially if you stay at The Tower Suites.  The entire hotel is absolutely stunning!  The service is impeccable.  It's one of a kind, and truly an amazing experience.  It defines what a 5-diamond hotel really is!",10,7,14

Once we were there we were told there were no more non-smoking rooms available and were switched to a room with a strip view on the 59th floor (I believe there are 60 floors in this hotel).  The room was very clean and I couldn't tell if it had ever been smoked in since there was no smell of cigarettes at all.  The view was spectacular especially in the evening.  The bathroom was all granite with separate tub and shower.  This was by far the best hotel I've ever stayed in and would highly recommend staying there again.",0,0,0

Fast forward some years later and I get sent here by work for a conference. Hadn't been to Vegas in a while, and prefer to stay at Mandalay. But my oh my, when I walked into my room on the tower side of the Wynn it felt like the heavens opened when my floor-to-ceiling-to-wall-to-wall shutters automatically opened to reveal a view of downtown from the 36th floor. it was a room that easily would've fit four of the same room I'd just stayed in during my last business trip to Germany.

 I did one of those kid freak-outs onto the bed. 

For the room alone I'd go back. The restaurants are great - try Sugar and Ice -, conference space expansive, and just oh so we'll done. I can't truly do this place justice simply because I didn't have time to see it all.

One of our favorite hotels in Vegas, if not our favorite. Not the party out of hand and get crazy spot. Best for pure relaxation, having a good time and getting pampered. 

When you are spending a good amount of money service is key and the service here is 1st class. Impeccable service all around (even the bathroom attendants), except the check-in lines, but there is a bar to order drinks while you wait..

Amazing selection of tier one restaurants (Tableau, Alex, SW and Chocolat). Tryst night club is both impressive (two story waterfall, dancing inside\/outside) and filled with good times - not a single incident or complete idiot found (ya know the kind trying to rub up on your girl).

Awesome pool and spa - not over crowded and few kids. Gambling poolside, nice fluffy towels and  misters for the really hot days.

And I may be a little bias because I tend to win playing poker there consistently. Great poker room where you can put your name on the list and watch the queue from your hotel room - woo hoo.

The rooms? Pretty disappointing. We stayed in a basic room at the Wynn- I was intrigued that they brag about how the room took five years to design, but I think most of that time was spent at the craps tables, because there were some fairly shocking basic design flaws. 

First of all, the toilet part of the bathroom is dark, and paneled in dark wood. If you like the feeling that you are peeing in a 1970s closet, you're all  set here. 

There is no easy way to turn off the lights from the bed, which, I'm sorry, should be illegal.

Rented a movie, which kept switching on and off- almost like a bandwidth overload was occurring. Quite infuriating, given the price tag. 

Small details overlooked: the towels were the roughest, oldest pieces of sandpaper I've ever encountered in a hotel, there is no coffee machine or even free water, no fridge- so forget about bringing home that leftover for later- and even the housekeeping was spotty. They forgot to remove used towels that were clearly left out for them every single day. 

You seem to get nickeled and dimed here quite a bit. Room service was polite, but the $20 continental breakfast fails to mention that you are getting miniature pastries, not full size ones. Don't let the minimalist zen packaging on the toiletries fool you either- check the ingredients on the same products in the gift shop- they are full of petrochemicals and parabens- very cheap ingredients.  I understand charging to use spa facilities, but asking someone to pay $20 a day for a run on the treadmill? Internet at $14 a day? Cheap!!

Also, the pool is blocked from the sun after about 2 pm. Not a problem in August, I imagine, but it was the #1 complaint I heard on the elevators. 

These may seem like little details, but this is meant to be one of best hotels on the strip. If I was staying at a Ramada, I wouldn't complain, but at these prices, I expect a little luxury, or at least decent towels. I have stayed at the MGM Signature previously for about the same price, and was expecting the same quality- in almost every aspect, this place lacked the class, style and basic luxuries that place offered.

That all said, the view was great, the grounds gorgeous, and the champagne brunch fantastic. Le Reve is the most incredible show on the planet, and I liked that valet parking was free. Also, don't miss the 25 cent wheel of fortune slots- they seem to hit regularly! 

I'll definitely back to visit the casino and hit the buffet, but I'm returning to the wonderful Signature next time.",2,0,0

Elevator ride with John Cleese and Kevin Nealon

A few minor complaints (what kind of yelper would I be if I couldn't bitch about SOMETHING?): 
1. Problems with temperature control. The hallways are either stifling or freezing.
2. They need a monorail from the rooms to the casino. We were honestly discouraged from going down to gamble because of the Long Mile to and from our ""Villa.""
3. Couldn't find a decent meal. The room service was awful. Really bad. Someone ordered a breakfast pizza. With 9 people there, it went uneaten. And I already Yelped about Bartolotta's. Worst $300 spent yet.

Anyway, it's a brilliant use of space. It's splashy without being theme-y. The drunk douche bag factor is way low. The service is so good you have to keep pinching yourself.

I upgraded to a parlor suite room in the tower suites. Pretty sweet! It's 1280 ft.² and it has a bathroom bigger than my first apartment. I chose a room overlooking the Strip. It's beautiful. You can see the mountains, and at night, you can see the lights of Las Vegas really clearly. 

The room cost a fortune. I really never would've paid face value for this thing, but I managed to talk the front desk into letting me upgrade. It really does pay to join the Wynn insider club. I think that they take you a little more seriously. At least they figure you'll be coming back, they don't want you to be unhappy.

The room has everything. All the way from a fax machine to a really fancy toothbrush. And seriously the views can't be beat. I had a whole bunch of attorneys here for a cocktail party in the living room and there was plenty of room.

If you are not spending your money or if money is really not an object, this is a really nice way to live. They really do treat you very, very, very well. You have your own concierge, entrance, parking attendants, the works. And even room service is delicious, if you don't mind spending $200 on room service. And that's without any alcohol.

Downside: WHAT IS UP WITH THE $20 per night resort fee?  Most other hotels are screaming for business and either waive the fee or no longer charge that.  Find other ways to make more money than charging this per night.  They already get that back and then some when people gamble there.

The video blackjack machines were not setup to double down or split.  We were told that we could turn on our service light and a floor manager would come to reset them.

It exceeded all of my expectations! Try the nice Restaurant at the Wynn for a Romantic evening  (Alex) very nice but be prepared to shell out $1000.00 for 2. Last night we were there I met Flavor flave he was staying on our floor with his family, ugly bastard I might ad LOL.

If you enjoy staff walking in your room whenever they feel like it, this is not the place for you.  If you don't mind hearing your neighbors doorbell go off in your room, again, this is not the place for you.
Our room was serviced today when we got back from being out and about (hotel room service cleaners are great), this was around 2pm.
At 4pm, we were relaxing in our room, changing, taking showers etc. a room maid decided to come in... No reason, but just entered our room, that was just awful.
If your neighbors doorbell goes off, you will 100% hear it.  Neighbors bell gets rung at 7am, we get awaken to think someone's at our door, been happening all week while we have been here. I decided to call down and ask why I need to hear my neighbors bell, not a feint ring but as if it's going off in our room while our privacy setting is on. They said they will call maintenance.  We are in bed, I just want the ringing to stop. Maintenance comes up, knocks on the door and before I can throw shorts on and get to the door, he enters our room.
This is ridiculous, there is no privacy. I will not be back. 
Again, beautiful hotel but the lack of privacy, the people just entering our room at free will, I've never experienced this and never want to again.",4,1,0

But afterwards, they asked me where I wanted to go and I told them two places, Circus Circus, and that shiny white and gold Mirage place.

That was when I fell in love with Steve Wynn. 

Yeah, he's like... older than my dad and even my current imaginary boyfriend, Geddy Lee. But it's not like that; it was because walking into the Mirage took me somewhere else so beautiful I still remember the impact it had on me at 12 years of age. I knew that I was somewhere special. I was no longer in a building in the middle of hot, dusty, ugly Las Vegas, no. 

The Wynn does the same thing to me at 30. 

I've been to quite a few beautiful places in my life time, but nothing like this. This is the most breathtaking man-made place I have ever been in and I am so in love. 

Not only did Mr. Wynn build me a casino with stunning red crystal chandeliers and stick my favorite flowers, hydrangeas, everywhere, he covered things in glitter, glass mosaics, and gold. And then he said ""Hey Amanda, I know you're trying to hard to be a good vegan so we'll throw in a vegan menu at all of the restaurants okay baby?"" 

And I was like ""Okay.""

And then Mr. Wynn was all like, ""I know you used to work for Tiffany & Co. and you've seen everything there so I'm going to give you something better and put Graff jewelers in there for you. But baby, I know how much you like shoes so I'm going to give you a store that has Christian Louboutin and Jimmy Choo and then you get a Louis Vuitton, too.""

The rooms are very secured, guarded, so you can't have random's come up without a room key, 'tho if a guest does come, they simply call from the front guard area to your room and you can give the guard permission to let 'em up.  So, if you have any in-call services, know that system in advance.

Aside from it being the biggest pain in the ass to get to, having to take the monorail then WALK in the insane heat to a shuttle stop and WAIT to be picked up (Walking in 110 degree heat and waiting don't make me happy), this place really blew me away.

The whole atmosphere is just classy. Classier then the overrated Bellagio. Big whoopies, you have a crazy ceiling and a good club, you mean nothing to me Bellagio!  

Definitely a whole other class of people stay here. Which was a nice change to see instead of Grandma and Grampa monopolizing the nickel slots in their green poker visors and matching fanny packs at the Tropicana. Nothing against the Tropicana though, I did enjoy myself there. Just an observation.

Where to eat lunch????
UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
Our reaction exactly. 

I think my friend and I spent more time deciding where to eat then actually eating. After speaking with a friendly staff member he helped us choose a french place that overlooked a beautiful waterfall.

The guys and I were fortunate enough to stay in one of the fairway villas for a bachelor party. Our 2 bedroom ""apartment"" came complete with a massage room, 3 bathrooms (2 of which had infinity tubs and were the size of a small Vegas room), big entry hallway, massive living room for shenanigans, full bar setup and a balcony the whole length of the villa with lounge chairs overlooking the 18th green of the Wynn country club and its waterfall. There were ducks walking around the greens below. Lucky ducks... It didn't feel like Vegas. Huge LCD screens in each bedroom and living room. LCD screens on a swivel arm in the bathrooms as well. Very nice, indeed. There was also a separate powder room(?) as well, which got no usage from us.

This was easily the nicest hotel room\/suite I've ever stayed in on the strip. The villas are located a little bit of a walk from the main entrance or south valet. It's past the gambling floor, past the Wynn buffet and past the pools. Keep walking towards the country club and you'll see these nondescript double-doors on your right side, right before the golf pro shop. These doors led to the elevators that allowed access to the fairway villas. Key card needed, of course. You wouldn't even know it was there.

The only issue we had with the villa was... since we were having a bachelor party there, was that we needed ice for our drinks. Searched the hallway outside the room. Nada. Looked downstairs by the pro shop. Nothing. So we call concierge and they inform us that ice is available to be delivered to the villa for $50 or we can walk across the casino floor to the other suite towers. That's right... FIFTY. Hahha... So we had some ice delivered and it comes in this gigantic Stanley Cup of a container, for lack of a better word. Nice ice!!!... LOL... with some Fiji water bottles. So it made spending that much for ice almost worth it... Almost.

The Wynn is great. The rooms, the shops, the staff, the service, best buffet on the strip, everything is tops. I highly recommend staying here. Their other suite area also very, very nice.

My sister and I came stayed here for our first trip to Las Vegas and from the moment we pulled up to the hotel we experienced first class service all the way. We arrived a few hours before check in, so we gave our bags to the bellman and gave the front desk our phone number so they could call us if our room was ready early.

We had a room on the 16th floor overlooking the Lake of Dreams, and it was gorgeous for a standard room! Floor to ceiling windows, comfy bed, flat screen tv, modern decor, large closet and a huge bathroom.  

The only reason the Wynn doesn't get 5 stars is because it's across the street from the Fashion Show Mall which was playing an ipod commercial 24\/7 from it's jumbotron thing and was loud enough that we could hear it in our room the whole weekend!!!

However, a plus to the Wynn is that doesn't have a "" theme"", so fewer tourists come wandering into the lobby and casino, which gives the place an exclusive feel. The table dealers are awesome and patient for newbies like myself so I just kept playing at the blackjack table and lo and behold I won $300!

We checked in late on a Friday and maybe the woman that helped us was tired or something because she was not very friendly. I asked for a room on a high floor - we got the 8th floor - so that didn't work.

The room itself was nice but like I said I guess I was expecting more. It was just very ordinary, like a room you expect to find anywhere. I thought with the Wynn I would get a ""wow"" factor but I didn't. The window shades are controlled by a remote panel which is fun for the first few minutes but that's about it. 

The bed was very comfortable though so I'll give them that.

I also did like the pool area quite a bit. It's large with lots of great places to lay out. We went later in the day so it was pretty quiet. I'm not into the pool party scene so I liked that it was more laid back. I think the Encore is where the party is at if that's your thing.

The other downside to the Wynn is that it's on the end of the strip so it's just that much more walking to get to the action.

The prices are exorbitant, but that is not unique to the Wynn, and I do not hold it against them. Ten dollars for a bottle of water seems more or less standard on the Strip. 

We partook of the in-room dining for breakfast both mornings, and the service was prompt, professional, and efficient. The actual food was wonderful, albeit ridiculously priced. We also elected to have the wine and cheese plate upon arrival, a choice that we do not regret at all. If you are as passionate about wine and cheese as my man-friend and I are, I would strongly recommend coughing up the extra $80. 

I will say one more thing: in a somewhat compromised state, I did inadvertently abandon my ID and credit card at one of the clubs in the Wynn, Intrigue, and the hotel's lost and found\/security personnel were of the utmost help in retrieving those items. I imagine that they are accustomed to dealing with the shenanigans of inebriated guests, and it was such a relief to be reunited with these essentials in a relatively painless fashion.",3,3,0

CLUBS: Tryst is amazing!!! I love the huge waterfall, outdoor tables, multiple bars, good dj's, etc

RESTAURANTS: Fabulous! Both Asian restaurants are superb, the pool cafe is amazing (especially the huge Chinese chicken salad), the little casino cafe has pretty good sandwiches and salads, and I'm sure everything else is great too

SHOWS: Cirque de Soleil show is awesome!

CASINO: Love it! Usually the minimums are pretty high but I found a $5 craps table because a high roller had reserved it and requested the minimum be $5 to keep it busy... tend to be lucky at the Wynn too and the drinks come out fast!

POOLS: Main pool gets very busy but it's fun to swim 1\/4 mile (or longer) extreme laps! The VIP pool is small but much less busy

GYM: Expensive (about $25\/day) but nice, very clean gym with good equipment and TV's!

Wynn, Venetian, Aria, Caesars, Bellagio, etc. One cannot reasonably compare a middle market property like Bally's or Excalibur to these luxury driven, top tier palaces. It simply would be unfair. Now having said that, and being a Vegas tourist turned local (some 13 years ago), I feel that I am indeed qualified to properly assess the quality of the Wynn resort as I have stayed here as a hotel guest, dined in 7 restaurants here, played many casino games, and visited casually to enjoy the atmosphere on multiple occasions (including at this exact moment as I write this review. 

It is my opinion that the Wynn (and its sister property, Encore, truly defines the utmost luxury that Las Vegas has to offer, and on multiple levels, the Wynn crushes its most formidable competition because of its extreme attention to detail. 

Allow me to elaborate by bringing in a most formidable competitor to contrast with: The Venetian. 

First of all, I intentionally did not want to compare Bellagio to the Wynn as Wynn himself built the Bellagio some 20 years ago, and I wanted to compare it to a property that Mr. Wynn had truly nothing to do with. The Venetian, owned and operated by Sands Corporation, under the direction of Sheldon Aldelson is nothing short of a spectacular property, but when compared to the Wynn, detail by detail, you infinitely see the differences. 

Vegas is known for its faux luxury. Fake marble. Tapestries that are nothing more than cotton blankets. Aluminum painted to look like gold. Glass cut to appear as if it's crystal. This is the standard at Venetian. This is not the standard at the Wynn. The Wynn, for lack of a better term, is LEGIT. 

Though I fully respect the standard room at Venetian being over 700 square feet, with sunken living rooms and an ostentatious class that awes you as you whimsically gaze at the gondolas coasting by faux Venice canals outside your window, it truly defines the fakery that the Vegas luxury stereotype conjures.

Walking around the Wynn, take note first of the floral. A large floral staff constantly updates and prunes the thousands of flowers, bushes, and trees that surround the property. The floors are interwoven with both industrial grade ostentatious carpeting you find everywhere with hand laid Italian mosaics. The walls aren't just covered in faux mahogany or painted, they are covered in imported silk, and further adorned with silk tassels and draperies from Europe. The tapestries and artwork are commissioned and individual works of art, not printed copies of known works. 

Steve Wynn sold off his interest in MGM Mirage corporation years ago and bought the venerable Desert Inn. He demolished that (while keeping the Golf Course) and focused all his efforts into the Wynn Las Vegas. This is the same man that built the Mirage in 1989, truly reinventing Las Vegas. He did it again with Bellagio. Now, Bellagio has taken steps down as it is corporate run and has lost some of its luxurious luster. The Wynn takes the Vegas standard of luxury and catapults it to a level that it almost doesn't deserve. The Wynn Las Vegas, without question, sets the top tier resort and casino standard in Las Vegas, and it is doubtful that any property will be able to take that accolade away from them while Steve Wynn still runs the joint. Couldn't recommend the Wynn any more highly.",15,7,9

We got to lie in the sun and got served coffee and took a dip in the pool. We would've had a chance to eat at the cafe on the side of the pool, but we decided to wait for the buffet. There was a bar we went to with the waterfall next to it. I bought my wife a Malibu hurricane and myself a long island while lounging on the couches. We had a blast at club XS and Blush. We danced, drank some more alcohol, and really enjoyed the luxurious casino. It's not a cheap place to be so make sure you bring a good amount of spending money.  Service was very good and everyone was friendly - but it's like anything else, you get what you pay for.

The WYNN located across the street of the fashion show mall, and very close the palazzo and treasure island. It does kinda seem located out far, but it's actually located much better than where we stayed before at the Mandalay Bay.

Thank you for taking all of my money. You lured me in with a special rate for labor day weekend at only $120 a night along with a $50 room credit, and I came excited to partake in staying at the famous Wynn. 

I arrived at your hotel to see beautiful decor and a nice marbled area with lots of (presumably fake) trees and Christmas lights. The different color umbrellas hanging from the ceiling are an interesting touch. 

I now see that these decorations were all a ploy to bedazzle and put me in a dream like state. Once in my Vegas trance, I would make up for all my savings on the hotel room and then some by losing at your high minimum $25 Blackjack tables. 

Well played Wynn. Well played.

Every time they asked for ID, I would ask for water, and never receive my water. The thing that really got to me was the second day, I would cash in a $5 chip, and they would ID me? really for five whole bucks? I came back and they took my ID went off with it for 5 minutes and took up a whole bunch of my time, then when I would just want to break a bill, they would check for my ID as well.  Even in the toilet i get ID. Okay, I was still okay at this point but what really got to me was the guy who was watching the front door, I was simply asking where the valet was and where I would pick up my baggage for the bell service, so this guy stared at me with a disgusted look for about a minute of silence when he finally says pick it up over there.

I definitely agree about the modern and sophisticated decor, especially the holiday display in the lobby, it's definitely a nice artistic touch. However, I've experienced several problems on this trip and it's unacceptable.

The bellman was extremely courteous and funny, cleaning ladies were super nice, but I didn't get the same service from the front desk.  The front desk lobby was crowded at check-in, wasn't organized and had no apparent lines. There was a host directing ""traffic"" to the imaginary lines, which I didn't like at all. We were at the head of the ""line"" for 20 minutes until a couple walked in and was helped right there and then in front of us (the host directed them to our line). I was frustrated and was in utter confusion...WHAT THE F***?! 

Finally, after check-in, I got my suite and a view of the golf course, great. The room had my all-time favorite chair, a chair I can't seem to find anywhere for sale, 2 queen beds (which were oddly small), a double vanity bathroom with a separate toilet enclosure, a flat screen tv, and a little business desk area. Back to the bathroom, it had no locks, no locks on the main bathroom door and no locks on the toilet door, WHAT THE F***?! 

There were many nice Red Card employees before meeting the meanie. Anyway, back to business, the Red Card desk did not inform me of the program itself, all they did was ask for my ID and spin their wheel. There was no brochure about introductory gifts and the program itself, so that was no bueno. On one of the nights, I headed to the Red Card desk and asked if I could use my points for buffet passes, and that's where I met the meanie. She was extremely mean in her tone, face, and gestures. She said that I don't qualify for any free buffets and it was only for introductory members. Well duh, I was a new member and I had won free buffets from the wheel earlier in the trip.  Her name started with a D, and I dislike her. She could've been more polite and said something like, I'll check that for you, and here are the promotions. But she didn't say that, she just blew me off like I wasn't important. WHAT THE F***? 

Talking about the buffet, it was definitely tasty; I suggest going for breakfast and staying for lunch! Dinner wasn't worth it. The hostess at the buffet was so extremely nice, they saw that my grandma has problems walking and suggested that we sit closer, no problem! A+ buffet, they totally made my day especially after the meanie ruined it. We also tried their room service, they didn't have much variety and the prices were outrageous. I ordered a clam linguini, burger, side of au gratin potatoes and chicken wings. The potatoes were fantabulous, cooked in a super mini cast iron pot and everything else was just eh. The dinner breads were hard and stale, bleh. I actually saved the baguette and kept it as a safety weapon, because it was so hard and pointy lol. There aren't many good eats at the Wynn, I can only vouch for The Buffet. So that's that.

As for the gaming, half of the slots were under maintenance, and there was a weird uncomfortable gaming spirit lurking in the air...I'd also like to add that drink runners were basically nonexistent. And if there was, we would see them walk to a certain point and then walk back, so lame. That's when I decided to just purchase a drink from The Drugstore, so much better. 

My overall experience at the Wynn was a fail, it was definitely not what I expected, especially as a VIP.  I can honestly say I'll be happy staying at the New York New York hotel...",6,5,2

Overall, the bed and comforters were warm & snuggly, artwork was awful, bathroom very spacious, gambling was still fun, the atmosphere was fairly clear of secondhand smoke, the staff was courteous, the hotel was well managed, the large kiddie pool was way too shallow but the roses enroute looked and smelled absolutely beautiful. 

And with perfect company, would I like to stay there again?  Definitely...but I might have to bring my own towels :P",1,2,1

However, upon entering my room, there was diarrhea stains on the top and bottom of the toilet seat, the bathtub had water in it and the refrigerator had a drink missing.  We told the front desk about this and they said they would have someone clean the room again while we at their restaurant.  A lady next to me in line said that her room was dirty too when she heard me complain.  I have never been checked into even a 1 star hotel with a dirty toilet seat before.  When we got back to the room, it had not been cleaned so I went back downstairs to ask for my money back.  They refused at first.  Then they offered me half back.  I complained loudly.  Security came over.  They gave me a heck of a hard time.  Remember, that there was crap on the toilet seat from somebody else.  The front desk guy told me that he talked to housekeeping and they said there wasn't.  We went up to photograph the poo on the toilet seat and he finally relented, not before me getting totally upset.  No real apology, no wanting to comp me, just wanting to steal my money and waste my time.  You would think in that circumstance, they would have been bending over to keep me happy, but instead they wanted to keep my money.  Quite unusual.  When I got my stuff to leave the room, I ran into the housekeeping person who told me that he had been called to my room by the front desk an hour before and had checked the SINK and it was totally clean!",0,1,0

They also have a full length mirror and humongous bathroom for getting ready.

But if you like this sort of game, the Wynn is a really nice place to do it.  It's close to the parking garage and all the seats are big and comfy leather.  There's a great deli next door.  They've got big screens.  Everything's just gorgeous and nice and the experience that you expect the best casino in the world to be.  You can walk a few hundred feet next door to Encore and see the new ""Sinatra"" and ""Botero"" restaurants.  Classy.

But the sports betting is a tough game - you can say I should wear a tin foil hat, and be watching JFK murder conspiracy movies.  But the Detroit Lions, first team to go 0-16 in the NFL ever, a really awful team, were playing at Green Bay today.  A pretty good team  to bet against, eh?  They're awful.  Away.  You might say, hey, I'm not a big bettor, but this is a giveaway, I'll take the Packers at -10.5.  You would have lost by half a point.  Here's the point spreads:

The casino is not that crowded so it's easy to find a slot machine or table to gamble. We tried a few of their amazing restaurants and were pleased with all of them. Everywhere you look there is beautiful, fresh flowers. It's absolutely breath taking!! 

I visited the spa and was amazed by how beautiful it was. It felt very European. Their services are first class and absolutely one of the best massages I have ever received. I highly recommend the spa and hotel. 

The pool area was not my favorite. It's not that big and it felt crowded and the food and drink service was lacking for such a nice hotel.

It was a two night stay that we had looked forward to for months.  We booked the room directly with the hotel and told them we were celebrating our 18th wedding anniversary.  In the past, at other Las Vegas hotels, we have enjoyed upgrades or some little nice acknowledgement of the happy occasion.  One time we received a little hand written note from the GM wishing us the best.  I can't imagine that cost anything but we appreciated it. Wynn did nothing. I've never seen it before but about a month after I booked the room I received an email pushing upgrades for my stay.  I thought it was interesting they were still trying to upsell after I had said no over the phone.

I don't care much for the décor of Wynn.  I'm not into red and it is definitely more contemporary than the classic looks I'm normally drawn to in other 5 star properties. At check in we had a distracted un-interested & emotionless front desk clerk.  Its was a surprisingly bad first impression.  I don't understand this given that we are in a great mood due to the occasion.  You'd think it would be easy to interact with a happy guest.  I mentioned once again we were celebrating our anniversary and asked if she would give us a free upgrade. She said sorry she could not do that and proceeded to take out a folder with paid upgrades starting at $25\/night.  She does this in front of my wife and embarrasses me to no end.  I'm thinking to myself... What I'm not paying enough right now for the hotel room, taxes and resort fees? $25 is cheap but I know I will be dropping a couple $1000 over the next two nights on food drinks and gambling.  Why do you want to ruin our good mood over $25?

On the upside our room was great: clean spacious and well appointed.  Nothing better or worse than the other great properties in Vegas.  The staff we encountered around the hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful.  We ate in the hotel several times including a memorable visit to Mizumi.  The Buffet was very disappointing but everything else was quite good, even the over priced drinks at the pool.  Check out was just as disappointing as check-in with an equally non emotional monotone speaking front desk clerk.  

I wrote a letter to Wynn expressing our concerns with our stay. We received a half hearted response so they must not see a problem in all this.",1,3,0

As for the buffet, first night of crab legs was exciting, so we were highly disappointed that they were mediocre crab legs.  Very nice that they were split lengthwise to save time cracking and gnawing, but the way they were served cold took the taste and left them bland and tasteless  There wasn't as large of a variety of foods as the Bellagio, as the quality of food wasn't as great either.  That piece of sushi was TINY! We actually shared the same sentiments with an older couple who sat next to us, where the lady actually observed, critiqued and compared EVERYTHING to the Bellatio buffet.

We received an offer for a 3 night stay, buffet for 2 and 2 tix to La Reve for $349.  Yes, all of that for so little.  Basically what you would call a steal of a deal.  Steve Wynn must have been feeling REALLY generous.  He must be having pity of the ""little"" people such as ourselves.

Now on to my review and I will not be redundant. What a resort!  You do not have to ever leave it because everything you need is on premises.  The room was awesome with a spectacular view on the 37th floor, room 3749 to be exact.  It was a King Deluxe and my fav features were the tub for 2 with waterfall filler, separate toilet (which is good when you live with a man).  The furnishings were quality down to the note paper stock.  The service was great, with friendly, courteous staff.  The atmosphere despite it's elegance was comfortable and not too snooty.

My not so fav features were the loud booming music waves from the clubs at 4am but that was easily solved with earplugs.  Other not so fav thing was that you have 60 seconds to pick-up a stocked food item before you are charged.  Really?!  I mean, really?!  I felt like a kid being watched by mom as she warned, ""Don't touch a thing, you hear!""

The buffet, oh, the buffet.  It was our first buffet on this trip and after going to the Rio, Paris and Planet Hollywood buffets we realized we were spoiled and didn't appreciate it's quality.  As crab lovers, we were disappointed that they only had snow crab and not king as I had read on reviews.  To top it off, some were very salty with an occasional one here and there that was just right.  The peeled, fresh shrimp were perfectly cooked.  Our favorite by far, was a trout Roulette on a crostini which was so flavorful and literally is making my mouth water as I type this.  All the food was fresh and presented nicely.  For free, the price was right but we both agreed that we will visit it again and it's worth the 40 bucks. 

Without a doubt, if we get another deal we will make the Wynn our home.  It was a great experience!",1,2,1

Checking in was easy ... although there were about 10 people in front of me, I was on the way to my room in under 20 minutes. Nice.

Room was beautiful, with floor to ceiling windows and a terrific view of The Strip that allowed us to view the TI pirate show from a very cool vantage point. We could even see the Lake of Dreams below us and the light show that goes off every 30 mins or so at night.  Very cool.   The bed was super comfy, huge bathroom with a vanity and makeup mirror (being a girl, I LOVE that) and even a small TV. In addition, there was a phone in the little adjacent loo room too - CLASSY STUFF!  

We loved the remote control console on the nightstand that allowed us to operate the lights and curtains with a single touch.  So cool.

For dinner, I pre-ordered room service for a 6:30 delivery time and they were only about 7 minutes late, which I thought was impressive.  The food that room service prepares is awesome! We had ... Angus Beef Sliders, Chicken Fingers, Spring Rolls, a side of Fries and a side of Onion Rings. For dessert, I went with the Warm Apple Tart with ice cream on the side and a slice of Cheesecake.  Oh my, oh my ... No kidding my friends, each and every item was fantastic! The service was super elegant and attentive to the little details.

1.  The service is top-notch here.  Not sure if it's because we had a room in the Tower Suites or not, but the staff is very attentive here and always smiling.  We were upgraded from a one king-bed room to a 2 double-bed room without having to ask for it .  What a great way to start off the stay in Vegas!  Oh, just as a FYI, there are no ice machines in the Tower Suites, you will need to call front desk and a huge bucket of ice will be delivered to your room and set up all nicely.  If you want to check in for your flight and don't want to pay for Internet services, just ask the front desk, they'll check in and print the boarding pass for you. 

2.  It smells so lovely...even the lobby in the reception area smelled so great!  My bf thought they used Febreze and a friend thought they used Glades plug-in.  Haha.  I thought it was more of a sweet scented candle.  I love the fact that it's not filled up with cigarette smoke, which usually makes my nose very itchy and my eyes watery, as is the case with many of the hotels.

3.  The graceful design of both the Wynn and Encore buildings.  Look around the strip, how many hotels have the sleek, tall, curved building?  Only the Wynn and Encore (well Bellagio too but it's not as sleek)!

4.  There's a private pool with the private entrance and complimentary fruits are served as you laze around enjoying the sun.  How fabulous is that!

5.  Rooms are nicely decorated with huge mirrors in the hallway (very important for that one last check before heading out to the swanky restaurants and clubs!) and marble floor.  The floor-to-ceiling view of either the strip or the golf course is amazing.  It's even better when enjoyed on the 58th floor.

6.  The extremely comfortable bed and pillows.  Best hotel bed I've ever slept on!",2,2,2

My father always had a summer tradition of taking me to Disney Land and then going to Vegas (because ""adults need to have fun too""). In any case, I don't know what I expected, if anything, since my memories of that time are quite blurred. However, if there is one thing I am certain of, it's that I am glad that my husband and I had stayed at the Wynn.

When we initially arrived in Vegas, it was about a day or so earlier than we had anticipated, mainly because back on Oahu (where we are from) there was a tropical storm brewing and we were offered the opportunity to change our flights free of charge. As such, we figured we might as well take the offer. I don't think we realized how difficult or expensive it would be to stay another night despite the fact that the night was technically over. When we arrived a the Wynn, both valet and concierge were nothing but kind, but to pay $800 for an extra night (again, that was practically over) didn't sit well with us, so we pretty much roamed from lounge to lounge at nearby hotels and casinos until we could check in later that morning (the most atrocious thirteen hours we could've ever spent together). Once we were finally able to check in, however, the wait was more than worth it. 

If you've from Oahu like I am, you'll know that even our nicest, most expensive hotels are still average at best especially in terms of room accommodations, amenities, and all that good stuff. So my husband (fiance at the time) and I weren't expecting much despite the price that we paid, but I can honestly say that both of us were speechless once our key card allowed us entry into our suite. Not only was the hallway spacious, but the room was tastefully decorated with all the right furniture, placement, and everything you could need. The view from the floor to ceiling windows was magnificent and you could see all the way to the horizon (see attached photo). The bed was especially comfortable wish plush sheets an extra pillows. The bathroom was also a nice touch as well since it gave you both a tub, a shower, and two extra sinks for a his and hers type feel. If I could, I would honestly live in one of their King Suites--it's that amazing!

Now, the real reason why my husband and I decided to stay at the Wynn was because we had decided to get hitched along with another couple who we've known for quite sometime. As such, we had been in talks with Darlene from their Wedding Salon as well as her assistant Jennafer, though I should give credit to my husband since he did all the planning with the aforementioned two women and I couldn't have asked for a better wedding experience. Whether it be from the minister we were given (who honestly made us tear up at the beautiful words of advice he had for us), the actual venue, our photographer, and everything in between, it was truly an experience of a lifetime and for that, The Wynn will always have a special place in my heart.",1,0,0

My friends and I miraculously got some deal here for spring break and it worked out to be super cheap for us to stay here for a week. We were probably the only people there under 35 and were definitely the only spring break students. This suspicion was only proven when we called the front desk one night at 4am asking for late night pizza delivery places and they had no idea who to call (they ended up looking in the phonebook for us). 

All kidding aside, this is an absolutely magnificent hotel. The lobby, clubs, and shops were all beautiful, expensive, and of the highest quality. Our room was extremely spacious and we had a breathtaking view of The Strip out the window. Whenever you laid down on the bed you could not help but melt into it and fall instantly asleep since it was so comfortable. There was enough space in the bathroom to handle the cosmetics and toiletry items five college women on spring break with no problem. 

Although the pool was closed when we visited we did have access to the Encore's amenities instead so we were able to use their pools. Both the standard and ""adult"" pools were lovely and the jacuzzi was extremely relaxing. With the mall across the street you can also easily go shopping, find some cheap things to eat, or drop by the liquor store inside.

From our first trip -simple examples: 

Check-in\/cafe.  For the suites, there is a separate reception area that is on the other side of the casino.  We arrived a little after 1pm, and our room was not ready.  So, we went and had lunch at their cafe.  Slow, slow, slow service.  15 minutes to order.  Another 20 before we got our food.  And forget about actually getting the bill.  We approximated our total and left money on the table.  At  2pm our room still wasn't ready.  We usually don't get suites - so I was pissed that I was paying 3 or 4 times the regular room rate and we don't have a room at our second time in line.  So, we gamble for about 45 minutes and then try again.  Hallelujah - a room is ready, but not OUR room.  Another room, on a lower floor.  Our room was supposed to be on 50 (so they kept telling us).  We ended up on 36.

Two - turn down service offers the usual turn down of the bed, the chocolates on the pillow, dimmed lights, and the radio turned to a classical station.  Extra nice touch was having complimentary slippers placed next to the bed.  The bad part was turning off  the radio and still hearing music. WHAT?!?   It was coming through the thin walls of the suite next to us.  

Three - 3:30am, someone is drilling - sounds like it's coming from above our bathroom.  Called the front desk.  The 20 year old eye-candy girls they hired there, had no idea what to do.  Thanks for offering us the free buffet, but we'd like the drilling to actually stop so we can get some sleep.  My husband changed and went out into the hall and luckily found a security guard making the rounds.  He brought the guard back to our room to hear the screeching drilling, who immediately called maintenance.  Turns out they were repairing an elevator nearby.  The drilling stopped immediately.  The next morning, the pretty girls at reception couldn't\/wouldn't do anything to compensate our much disturbed night.  We went out to a casino host before checkout and retold our story to him.  This is how we ended up with our wonderful slot host,  Alan.  He took care of one night for us, and comped us on show tickets for our next visit.

Four - the buffet.  The food is delicious, but you want a refill on your soda?  Someone to clear your table of the dirty dishes?  Good luck finding anyone.  It's not that the people who work there are lazy.  I'm not saying that at all.  They just don't have enough staff there.  This was the first time that I saw guests at other tables pick up their own dirty dishes and place them onto another table that was already piled with dishes that hadn't been picked up yet.

Like I said, the hotel is beautiful.  The flowered walkways, the waterfall, the restaurants, the overall magnificence of the building itself.  It's amazing.  They just need to take some customer service classes and hire some people at reception who know how to take care of their clients, not just look pretty.  And yes, I admit, we've been back twice.  Service was still lacking, but we expected it.  We got outrageously generous offers that couldn't be turned down.",1,0,1

Just got home from another stay at the Wynn, we arrived late Tuesday and headed home Saturday. All in all, it was a great stay. Service was good and check in was quite pleasant. The suites are amazing with their own pools and spacious accomodations. 

The pool this time was pretty crowded but we had a cabana which I highly recommend. They are a bit pricey, but it's nice to have one if you spend a lot of time at the pool. The Wynn really doesn't have a lot of shade so having the cabana to retreat to is nice. The pool also (unfortunately) had more kids in the main pool this time than on other visits. Don't get me wrong, there were still quite a few less children than many other other hotel pools though so this still wasn't terrible. The Cabana Bar makes a great margarita and other great drinks, but as with everything at the Wynn, keep in mind that they are pricey ($12-14 for most blended drinks.) 

I wasn't disappointed aside from the experience at Chanel, but I don't blame that on the Wynn. I'll return.

============
I'll be perfectly honest: one of the reasons I LOVE the Wynn is because of the ""No Stroller"" policy. No strollers = fewer people who bring their whining little monsters along = great thing in my book. I can see why this wouldn't appeal to some, but I personally appreciate it. 

That said, Steve Wynn is known for being over the top and liking excess and this place is definitely just that. I hate your typical Vegas ""theme"" hotels in general and so if you're the same way, this place, a long with the Four Seasons are the best of the bunch if you actually want to stay in the the area of the strip. The Wynn however does have the Four Seasons beat as far as having a central location.

Even the regular rooms are pretty spacious and if you like luxury, you really can't go wrong with this hotel. Huge tubs, spacious bathrooms... All in all, I recommend it. Particuarly if you don't have children or if you're just not a fan of them in general.",1,1,3

High-end designer shops abound that will make the average Joe feel poor, such as the Hermes shop I browsed while I was waiting for the rest of the family. This casino is very clean with an expensive feel all over that extends even to the bathrooms! 

The bathrooms caught me in shock by how impeccably clean and classy 
they looked! It was like I was in a palace!

We came here to see the Sinatra show, so I got to experience the theater. It's quite small, but I only have the Pantages in LA to compare it too. But I didn't experience any comfort issues so I have nothing to complain about.

There's also a Ferrari\/Maserati dealership here to contribute to the high-end atmosphere, and a Ferrari store that sells many unbelievably overpriced goodies. I guess these stores only exist at places like the Beverly Center and London's Regent Street (the other two I've been to) for a reason...

Bellman takes off with my bags and sets the claim ticket on the seat of my car because I guess I was taking to long unloading the skybox on top of the car, thing is,  he left without 2 of the heaviest bags so I had to lug those in and up. Nice job sparky!
#2
On the way in a door lady was arguing with a lady with a new baby in a stroller who was apparently trying to meet someone for lunch, her problem was that ""the owner does not like strollers so if she wanted to come in she would have to carry her infant in and leave the stroller out""
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT CRAP? What an A-Hole.
I mean, I agree that Vegas and kids dont mix but come on?
You make a lady carry in a newborn who was sleeping peacefully because some pompus jerk doesn't like strollers? What a dork.
Obviously, childless.
I should have known right then.
#3
Check in was not long but was screwed up, the guy did not have the right conformation, tried to make me sign a bill charging $110 per night OVER my confirmed rate, luckily I caught it and when I asked him why it happened he said ""uhh,,...I dunno"" ....Ummmm......ok?
#4 
Room was nice but did not have 2 beds as I had confirmed when I made the reservation 5 months prior.
I called down and they apologized and said they would send up a pull out for an additional $50, WHAT!!!
I freaked and requested another room with 2 beds like I confirmed and they said they were sold out of those rooms, Yeah right it was a Tuesday and the place was dead?.
They then put me on hold for 9 minutes and came back and said ""sorry but all we can do is send you up a roll away and will waive the fee.
Well gee,  thanks. 
3 phone calls and 6 hours later the bed arrives.
Great job!
#5 
Gambling was average, high limits were expected at the tables, playing video poker at the bar with no comp booze was not expected, but whatever?
Guy at the blackjack table was pretty funny and really did not have anything good to say about the hotel either, he said pretty much all the dealers hated the managing staff and called them a bunch of ""dill weeds"" whatever that means?
I did notice that no one there was exceptionally friendly and have no idea where the hell they got a 5 star rating from ,maybe Tiajuana?
It is Vegas, maybe they greased the palms of the reviewers as this place does not have anywhere near the service as many of the other fine choices on the strip.
#6
Dinner, ate at Okada or whatever the sushi rest is there, was decent, nothing to get excited about, truth is I have had better sushi at some of the strip mall sushi shops.
The Toro was horrible and way overpriced.
I should have known better than to eat sushi in the desert?
The real fun came 4 hours later when I was trying to sleep.
Ummm can you say there was a waterfall but it was not the one outside the window.
Yeah, on the pot all night, stomach cramps and all.
Called down in the a.m. and let them know, had to file a report.
Ruined my entire day.
Got a call later in the day by the Manager a Mr. Evan Spiegel who after telling that I had to stay in the room all day said ""Thats not good for anyone"" because ""I wasn't spending money at his hotel since I was stuck in the room"".
Oh yeah, here is the kicker, instead of doing what any normal manager would do, like maybe really apoligize and tell me that he will erase that horrible stomache turning meal from my bill  he asked if he can ""help me out with some crackers to help my stomach""? WTF???? CRACKERS?  
No you moron, you just poisioned me !!!
I want some serious apoligies at the very least.
I don't want some F-ing crackers?
Maybe you should go  investigate that contaminated fish in your restaurant before someone else meets my fate?
That might be a good start?
Then upon arriving home I was totally again shocked to see that they actually kept that diarrhea dinner on my bill? Again, WTF?
Needless to say I don't think you should have to pay for a dinner that pretty much ruined your stay in Vegas.
Can you say incompetent CLUELESS manager?
Either that or what I read is true, they actually ARE desperately hurting for money?
#7
Room service,(The morning we left) actually was very good and the server was really nice.
FINAL,
My advice, go to the Wynn to look around at your gawdy rich Grandmas decor on steroids and do not give them any of your money.
Go back to The Hotel or 4 seasons @ Mandalay or shoot even the Venetian has better service than that place
THE SERVICE SUCKS and the Manager Mr. Spiegel is either really stupid or very incompetent  when it comes to customer satisfaction.

I stay at the Wynn once a year for an annual conference. I have heard much about it before coming - the grandeur, the size, the facilities. I would use other words: smelly, noisy, unpleasant service, constantly looking for ways to remove money from your pocket.

The pros: Indeed lavish rooms, great views, and there is no real need to leave the hotel if you have the money to afford what is offered within. The pool is really nice.
The cons: Disclosure - I do not care for Vegas. But many of my problems with the Wynn are specific. First of all the internet situation - In 2012 I do not think charging $14 a day for internet is ethical. Especially as free WiFi is scarce and poorly located (perhaps on purpose). Second, The place stinks. It smells of cigarettes and some sort of synthetic odor that does a pretty poor job at masking the cigarette smoke. Thirdly, the staff is unpleasant. True - they will all constantly smile and ask you how you are. But this is a plastic exterior. It is more than obvious this is what they were told to do. From my experience they did not go out of there way to help several problems I have encountered including checking in to a room on time, for instance (they had the wrong kind of room and I had to check my bags in and be late for a conference). Another example is the pool. The pool is awesome. But the hours are uncomfortable (9 AM - 6 PM). That is not enough. And for some reason the staff kept asking that we leave a few minutes ahead of time toward the end of the day (and always once the end of the day is approaching several of them suddenly appeared and kept asking us to finish swimming.

That aside, Wynn is an amazing place to spend some time. I really would like to golf next time we go.",0,0,0

We usually stay at the Riviera because of free rooms.  The Wynn is the next casino down...well technically its Encore but same difference.  We always head down here the morning after we get into Vegas. 

The Wynn is a beautfiul casino.  My lady and I mostly play slots and the Wynn has a nice selection.  There are 3 things that I absolutely love about the Wynn and here they are.

1.  Excellent drink service.  No matter if you are a high roller or a penny slot person, the waitresses are plentiful, beautiful, and always on top of things.  They actually give you your mixed drink in a nice round glass that you would use at home.  Not a tall skinny, full of ice glass.  A nice touch.  They bring the drinks fast and are appreciative for any tip you give them.   The booze is always flowing and that keeps customers happy.

2.  The buffet.  Best buffet I have been to....havent been to many....but this one is at the top.  If you sign up for a players club card you have to gamble something like a few hundred dollars(points) to get enough for a buffet.  Its awesome and easy to accomplish the free buffet within an hour or 2 playing.  I think its like 35 bucks for the dinner one if you have to pay for it.  It has everything you could want including gigantic crab legs which cant be beat.

3.  Sometimes its the little things that matter most.  This may sound odd but my number 3 favorite thing here....the bathrooms.  If you have to drop a deuce they have very private stalls that look like a closet sort of.  Total privacy.  And my favorite thing in the bathroom are the urinals.  They have strategically placed ""pads"" in the urinals.  One up top and one at the bottom.  This kills 2 birds with one stone.  You have to take a mean leak and you go to piss and you get some brushback....guys...you know what I mean.....your piss hits the bowl and then sprays back at ya....you try to avoid it but some urinals it just happens.  Well these urinals here at the Wynn use the pads to  a. cover up odor...and b. to prevent sprayback.  No matter how hard you try , if you hit the pad, it like absorbs your piss with no shrapnel flying everywhere.  Its awesome and its my favorite bathroom to take a leak in.  Its the little things in life.....the small victories.........and that my friends is why the Wynn gets 5 stars.",9,9,9

I got married in Vegas and we stayed at the Wynn. My husband picked this place after much research. It is a small hotel in comparison to some of the older monstronsities nearby.  This is not a gimmicky place. They have the show La Reve which was amazing. If you stay there or not see the show. Our room was bigger than our apartment. There was a television in the bathroom. Say what? Soft beds. Oh yeah!!!  And we had a nice view of the strip. This is simply a classy place which is why his name is on it.

Now I totally don't appreciate the rigged snack bar but it is helpful when you are on a budget I guess. Just don't get drunk and go back to your room and stumble around.

I definitely rank it as one of the better hotels on the strip but far from the best seeing as how it's not exactly the newest casino on the block anymore. I thought the check in process was a little slow, 4 people tending to a line of 20+ which made for a long wait. 

The food options were good, a lot of fine dining and contemporary options with a lot of good shopping very close, walking distance. The younger crowd is still coming out to stay here but it's not like the Aria\/Cosmo where it's nearly zero people older than 40 and looking for a bargain. Wynn wasn't exactly cheap but it's cheapER than the other two mentioned. 

I thought the pool area was nice, pretty large with a lot of seating. I heard there was going to be a DJ on Saturday and assumed that it was going to be a pretty energetic scene but turned out to just be some guy in a sky blue polo playing music from a laptop at medium volume. It was pretty meh. What kind of turned it around for the positive was the fact that a large breasted woman and her friend posted up next to us and let those fun bags fly. Shortly after started making out with her friend (another girl, not so big breasted) and telling my brother how she was looking for a threesome while in Vegas since her husband wasn't there. Not saying you should expect this kind of thing; ""jackpot"" was the first word that popped in to my head. We came back to the pool Sunday too. 

The casino itself was fine, nothing really special or different. The poker room was nice, not as busy as the hey-days of 2008 when we were around the peak of the poker boom. You're not going to see a 5-10 no limit game spread unless it's peak hours Friday or Saturday night and even then it'll be iffy. There may be one table of 2-5 in off peak as well, with 1-3 being pretty much your only choice. It's not exactly a high roller room, but these days the Aria is really the only game in town if you're looking for poker of many flavors. 

The room was ok, the new lighting system features were a little getting used to, but they worked fine once you got through it. ALL OFF by the way also turns off the air conditioning, so don't hit that in the morning unless you want to come back to a hot room. We learned that the hard way. The view from our room was of the Trump and the very end of the strip with the Palazzo squarely in our view of the rest of the strip so that left a lot to be desired. 

Overall I'll probably never stay here again but would probably be back to the poker room if I'm close enough. I really liked it over the temporary Venetian room (that's now in the Palazzo) but even that's a long shot since I'll usually be in the Aria and there'd be no reason to leave that room. If you're going to go high end with a casino you're pretty much going to have to go with Cosmo (my personal favorite), Aria or Vdara. Although at those pools I don't remember seeing as many big tittied topless whores so there's that.",0,4,0

Check in was easy. I had requested a high floor with a view of the Strip.

Although in my humble opinion the best part about the hotel was the ability to open the blinds electronically, the other amenities were probably even more memorable to the standard human being. 

First, the service. Whenever I called the concierge they were at our room in under ten minutes. The security guards\/bouncers at the hotel were also an unexpected highlight of our Vegas experience, since they were nice to males and respected our existence. Dealers were also helpful, and gave pointers when we had no clue what to do in card games. The cleaning service made our pringle-filled floor unpringled before we knew what hit us. Overall, service was a-ok.

Club XS definitely stands for ""excess"" and not ""extra small"" as I had previously thought. The music was great, and if you preorder your tickets you will be fine even if you are a group of 100 men. You still have to pay more money, but hey, that's Vegas. Try to get people to buy you drinks, because they are as expensive as anywhere. 

As a piece of advice, do all you can to get this hotel through priceline. We were able to pay about 25 dollars a person per night, which makes the value of the hotel off the charts. If we had to pay the normal price it's still a bargain, but as college students would have probably gone elsewhere.

I'd booked the panoramic deluxe corner room and was super excited to be wowed by this place. We checked in around 12:30 PM on a Friday and were happy that we could get a room before check in officially started at 3 PM. However, the room available was pool view and not strip view. I was told we could get a strip view room but we would have to wait and it could be way past official check in time when it could be ready. Because we had the Elton John show to attend I had to forfeit the strip view room. 

Regardless of the views, the rooms are stunning. The two huge floor to ceiling windows let in so much light and make the room feel huge! All the amenities are there like a safe, robes, and a substantial closet. I also thought the key pads were cool. They control the drapes and all the lights but they also served as your privacy setting for the room (no more ""privacy please!"" placard to attach to the door knob). 

Our view was fairly disappointing. From the 33rd floor, one window faced the Trump hotel and a ton of construction. Window two was a little more interesting with a view of the golf course and the pools. I can only imagine how amazing a strip view room must be from high up and through these huge windows, but ours was a let down. 

Despite the lack of views from our room, my husband and I would easily stay here again (especially now that he's gotten to see what the golf course looks like). The hotel is opulent and luxury to the max! The casino had all the games we could want and even though the hotel's location is on the far end of the strip, there's plenty to do with the Grand Canal Shoppes right next door! Do note that your taxi ride from the airport will be a bit more because it is one of the farthest hotels to drive to.",6,2,3

Not just meander about, checking out all the beautiful scenery. Finally that day has come where I carried my love through the doorway into their amazing all white rooms, as we rejoiced with a ""hallelujah"" as the automatic blinds opened to an awesome view of The Strip. I must have hit the open and close button for those blinds 50 times just to watch them in motion. All from the comforts of our plush, soft bed. Yes, I'm quite easily entertained.

My only regret, is I can't afford to stay here often. If I could live here, I would, seriously! I wouldn't even have to leave the grounds and I could die a happy man. From entertainment, high end window shopping, to exquisite Vegan dining, there's not much that my Vegan homie Steve Wynn hasn't thought to include in his opulent palace of excess. Yes, Gluttony thy name is Wynn Las Vegas!

I have to give him credit for including at least one Vegan option in every restaurant in the casino. Although my one minor gripe is that they don't always place the Vegan menu out front next to the other menu. You usually have to request to see it. Not a big deal since there's always a small army of hostesses waiting out front of each restaurant. My other gripe would be the exorbitant resort fee. Although most places on the strip now charge a fee so I guess I have beef with all of them as well.

About that room... Is it worth the price tag? You betcha! Everything is built with excellent quality while attention to detail is obvious in every nook 'n cranny. Although I could hear a pair of heels clickety-clacking in the room above us the next morning, along with a tv blaring in the room next to us. If the walls are that thin, our neighbors no doubt were bothered by us enjoying every feature of the room. Hey, those blinds are loud!

The casino itself is one of my favorite in Vegas. If you're mantra is ""go big, or go home"", this place is for you with its high minimum bets and classy dealers. While I'm not a major gambler by any means, so I may not know a lick of what I'm talking about. I played my first game of craps here and lost $60 in record time. I've since made that back and then some, on my favorite Top Dollar slot machine. In fact, my Top Doller winnings paid for our meal at Lakeside the next night. Then again, that just goes to show you that The Wynn as an entire resort will get back all of their money one way or another.

I'm so grateful that I was able to experience this place together with my love for our first trip to Vegas. It's always been my favorite casino to spend time in Vegas. Now I am able to see it in a whole new, much brighter light.

Pro tip: Join their Red Card program and they'll often send you pretty good deals through the mail.

Pro Tip #2: It's probably all in my head, but in my experience, inserting a fresh $20 into the slot machine instead of the paper ticket you get after cashing out, almost always yields better results. Hey, it's all mind over matter right?

Pro Tip #3: Don't take advice from a gambling n00b...",17,15,15

The room service was more than accommodating with our sleep schedule and never failed to come less than twice a day, regardless of irregularity in times.

the first trip truly deserves 5 stars.  the room (we had a panoramic view room) was breathtakingly beautiful, clean and beyond comfortable.  every single person we met worked hard to take care of us, ensuring that we had everything we needed.  it was an amazing experience, a 5 star experience and this experience was the catalyst to bring my son back the following week.  

the second trip really was a one star.  we still had the panoramic view room that was breathtakingly beautiful, clean and beyond comfortable. however, wynn is not kid friendly.  there are NO accommodations for kids.  meaning there are no kids menus, kids cannot go into about 1\/3 of the facility and there are employees there that are downright rude to children.  

on my first trip i asked katelyn at the spa if it would be ok if my son waited outside the gym while i worked out.  my son is 12 and very independent (we live in a city so he is very mature and wise for his age).  she said it was fine.  so you can imagine my absolute shock when we came the following week and she told me he is not allowed to sit there and not only that, called a very incompetent spa manager, trish, who proceeded to berate me and absolutely ruined our day and put a terrible cloud on the entire trip.  she was condescending, rude and implored me to hire a nanny to watch my son (for hundreds of dollars) while i spent 35 minutes at the gym.  to add salt to the wound, the spa's general manager, niki, told me she would look into a solution for me and promised to call me within 15 minutes.  3 hours later i never heard from her and so i called her.  she then told me she was sorry she didn't call, there was nothing she could do and then referred me to another manager tanner.  so i spent another 20 minutes explaining the entire thing to tanner only to find out that he is the front desk manager and could not help.  words cannot express my frustration and disappointment.  however, he did refer me to matthew who is the manager and he was incredible, logical and very helpful.  

i am not sure how they can have people working in the spa area that are so incompetent and downright rude.  my son was so upset by this that he was afraid to walk near where they were to go to the pool so he created a short cut through the spa store so as to not see them.  this is horrifying.  no human being should feel so terrible at the wynn and yet my son did.  

the experience really put a damper on our trip making us wonder if the first visit was just a one off and that the second visit is really what a wynn experience is like.  

i will say that there were some bright spots in the trip and those were thanks to mariana at the front desk (she was extraordinary),  matthew the hotel manager and vince (our waiter at lake side).  

with all of this said, wynn is a luxurious hotel with an amazing pool, stunning rooms and great restaurants and shopping.  i do not think it is kid friendly and i am very upset about how we were treated on our second trip and would consider going to the four seasons next time we visit.",1,3,0

My first visit wasn't too long after they opened, and my boss treated me to a Parlor suite in the Tower Suites section. It has its own entrance\/check-in and pool area, plus some other perks like complimentary breakfast off the lobby.

I've been staying there ever since. I still think The Bellagio is Wynn's masterpiece, but this is a close second and nicer rooms. Plus, they really discourage kids, great with me. It's pitiful when you go into a casino and see parents dragging around their kids or pushing them in a stroller at 1 a.m. Not here!

This visit, I was in the Salon suite on the 59th floor, almost 2000 SF, with 2 baths (talk about a Royal flush), dining area, bar, massage room and flat screens everywhere. Just like The Hangover, except no tiger:)

Major butt-kissing by the staff, great restaurants and pool area really make this place a winner-even if you are a loser. Can't comment on the clubs, because I come to eat, drink and gamble. I can see Brody Jenner drunk or some C-list reality star's vajay in clubs at home.

A couple tips: If you are planning on coming to Vegas regularly, sign up for their player's club (even if you're the type that just plays a hundred bucks in a quarter machine) AND charge all meals and drinks to your room. The email and snail mail offers you get will be increasingly good, since your over-all spending is taken into account. Before long, it will be free, at least while the economy sucks.

Also, the check-in people accept and like tips, just like everyone else. I usually slip $40 over ($20 works too) and it's amazing how they can suddenly check you in early or upgrade your room.

See you there!",3,2,1

Actually if you think in terms of square footage, MGM Signature or Venetian will be a much better deal because you will either get a mini kitchen or living room area. Bathrooms are about the same...tub + shower separated.

The bathtub here though did not have the jacuzzi feature like the rooms at the MGM signature do. The products were definitely very good - which makes sense since they are by Lather. They also have really nice towels and comfy beds. The furniture is very Vegas-like - plus chairs and soft, chic furniture. 

Overall, I still give this establishment 5 solid stars because I was able to stay in this hotel a full 24 hours without exiting which really impressed me- I'm usually never able to do that but Wynn designed this hotel very well though out. Every single dining area will have a view whether it's the pool, gardens, waterfalls, or golf area.

Here we go, HEAD TO HEAD COMPARISON:  Stayed at Encore one-year ago--slightly more stunning (bigger\/more stylish rooms in comparison to ""Wynn"").  This is uber-luxury as all the reviews will signal to you.  A couple reviews below, a gentlemen suggested that he would stay ""someplace nicer"" next time to LV.  Sir, I would like to fight you--such a place does not exist!

Wynn (and Encore also) is impeccably clean, doesn't cater to children, and will cost you at each turn.  Room service\/ minibar prices are out of sight.  We always eat a meal or two on the property and explore the Strip and Vegas for the rest (only so many meals you can schill before the receipts in your wallet start to haunt you).

The Wynn resort rooms were recently renovated in Fall, 2010, including updates on colorings of hallways, bedding, artwork, curtains in the room, and furniture upgrades. Spa (per the Wife) is lovely and service was top notch on a custom massage.  Nice ""private"" entry via the room elevators (Though she informs me that the spa at Encore feels more ""secluded"" vis-a-vis the Salon and people coming and going).

No real problem of note: the ludicrous $129 in minibar charges (ONLY 8 items!!) appeared on my television guest bill folio.  These were quickly removed with a single call to the front desk (and a single inquiry to me [""Sir is it possible that someone put anything\/ moving anything in fridge?""  Me: ""No ma'am, we only dared examine the $12 bag of potato chips; we didn't even open the fridge during our stay!""].  This too is illustrative of the attitude you'll find--you're the boss, you just have to pay SW's price (which BTW, slow season rates continue to bewilder--midweek under $150 per night= absolute bargain).

Restaurants are top notch at both properties.  But ""Wynn's Casino""  has the advantage, IMO, on size, feel, traffic, and most of all--the only poker room between the properties is housed at Wynn's casino space.

As for the rooms....I will let you in on a secret. The standard Tower Suite room and the Casino room are pretty much the same. Same size, same layout, same giant bathroom with flat screen TV, same amenities.......the only difference I noticed was the bedspread and the linens. The tower suite has some benefits though....separate elevators, separate check in and access to special pools.

The rooms were great, the amenities were good, but the service was very bad. It is definitely not a 5 star hotel, or even a 4 star. With service this bad I'd rate it a 3.5, even though it is beautiful. 

Here is the brief rundown of my experience. We arrived a bit early, around noon, and in general I'm okay with not being able to check-in if the rooms are not ready, but usually when you go to the front desk to check in they say ""hey, do you have a cell phone? I'll call you when your room is available"". I then go spend some time, eventually the phone rings and I get to check-in. At the Wynn the woman behind the front desk said ""I can try, but I'm off at 3 so you should just come back in a while."" Needless to say when I came back at 1, then 2 and finally 3 to see if a room was available yet, each time I had to sit through a huge line just to say, ""hey, I'm here could you just let me know when my room is available?"" I was very nice about it but I have to say that kind of service sucks. At the Waldorf in NYC I arrived early they were happy to give me a call and let me know that my room was available, At Mandalay Bay they were also happy to give me a call (I arrived at 9AM and had a room by 10). Even the Sheraton gave me a call when I arrived early in Austin.  

The next big flop in the service area was at the Cabana next to the pool that we rented. It is expensive to rent a cabana, and you would think that the service at the pool would be at least ""alright"".... well, after waiting an hour for the bottle of wine, and a half our for the beer I decided ordering from the staff was too much of a bother so I just started going to the bar myself. It wasn't like the staff was bad, it just doesn't seem like there is enough of them and they were never around. 

Next there was Dinner at Danniel Boulud. This was supposed to be a 4 star dining experience. I was with a small group of people so we made sure to have reservations far in advance, We showed up early to be sure that everything would be taken care of and to get seats outside. It seemed like all would be fine, however when the time finally came for us to go to dinner, we were asked to wait in the bar till our table was ready. We had a reservation, but we waited for nearly an hour for our table to become available. While waiting in the bar we sat and had drinks. A waitress spilled an entire glass of Champaign on one of our guests. Our guest handled it very well, wasn't angry at all, but wanted to get out of his wet shirt (a wet $300 shirt). The manager said he would bring a ""polo"" shirt down right away (standard procedure). Not quite the same as the $300 shirt, but would do so that our guest didn't have to sit in a wet shirt. After 30 minutes in the wet shirt it was clear that the ""polo"" was not coming... Another strike out on service and our guest ate dinner in a wet shirt. 

So an hour into it and a spilled drink and we are finally sat for dinner. The waitress comes up asks if anyone wants something to drink just as we are sitting down. I say ""I'd love a Grey Goose and soda"". She then turned on her heals and went to go get my drink. However she didn't get a single order from anyone else at the table. A bus boy came around and gave us some water. By the time I got my drink all the water was gone. The waitress then took an appetizer order and my partner Jason asked for the wine list. She handed it to him and left, again without getting anyone else's drink order. The appetizer came, she had not yet taken a drink order or our regular order. She came back, apologized and took the drink order. We order a very good bottle of wine and our guests finally get to order drinks and we put in our food order. The drinks did not come until after our main courses, the appetizers were all gone. I wish I could say that it got better but it didn't. We were a small group, and the service was similar to what you would get at Pizza Hut. I was disappointed. The food was good, but again they fell down hard on the service. And let me just say that I am an easy going guy, I don't often get upset about slow or poor service, but this was unbelievably bad. 

Next we had reservations and a table reserved at their night club called Tryst. The inside staff were great. But getting to the table was a nightmare. One of our guests went ahead of us and grabbed the table before we got there with the group because we had to pay for it before a specific time and with the slow service at dinner we were running late. Once we arrived with the rest of our guests we let them know that we had a table and we should have walked right in. Instead the short blond security\/bouncer at the club took us on a tour and tried to con $200 out of us to get sat at a table which we had already purchased. He asked for a bribe just to get back in the club, tried to have us pay for an additional table.. All in all the service was terrible.",2,0,0

The room was nice (from what I can remember) but it wasn't 5 star to me. I think I prefer the rooms at Encore better as they are newer and bigger than the room we stayed in at the Wynn.  

We ate at Red 8 and I was rather disappointed.  I had been wanting to try it for some time now and I was let down.  I felt that the food was greatly Americanized and lacking of flavor.  I've also dined at Alex, which is now closed, and it was exceptionally exquisite and a grandiose affair.  I loved the beautiful staircase entry way that led down to a romantic, ballroom style dining area.  I remember the food being better than our recent lavish dinner at Picasso at the Bellagio, however it was a few years ago so maybe I'm not remembering correctly.  Anyways, it's closed now so I guess it doesn't matter. 

My husband and I often do little staycations in Vegas. Here's a tip- Bring some bottles of booze with you so you can make your own drinks in your room before spending a fortune at the bars! We always stop by a fun bar\/liquor store called Office Bar (which is a half mile from the airport on the way to the Strip) and buy a few bottles before checking into our hotel. 

We've stayed at all of the nice hotels on the Strip and I would not say that the Wynn is the best.

it smells delish like expensive citrusy aftershave or something.  

at the outside cocktail lounge the woman taking ids addressed us all by name which i thought was a nice touch. 

the casino feels more like an afterthought instead of the main attraction like it is in all the other hotels.

I'm one of those people that's unfortunately sensitive to ambient light when trying to get to sleep. I don't need to be bathed in a constant LED glow.

The master control box on the night-table didn't seem to be actually connected to anything, and the lighting controls behaved differently depending on which panel you used. The climate control would reset itself to its defaults when you were out of the room for a certain amount of time, meaning you had to change everything back to the way you wanted it every night.

We stayed in the tower suites (both the Encore and the Wynn) and have enjoyed our stays.  

The service is great, and, for Vegas, it's kinda nice to feel welcome.  

Restaurants:  The restaurants are pretty good and the buffet is slightly above average.  The blue-collar blood in me likes basic food, but not for the Disneyland prices at Zuzu's deli\/cafe.  But, if you wanted to pinch a few bucks to play that extra slot machine, the location of Wynn gives you that freedom to go across the street for some food court action.  Also, it's a great place for the girls to go shop while the boys play that god-forsaken game of craps.

Gaming:  Most of the tables are 25+ at might, but you might find a few tables for 15.  I like the craps tables because of its social atmosphere, plus the guys running the tables are pretty cool.  So if I win a few grand, I leave a nice tip for making my gaming experience fun.  Heck, even if I lose, I'll tip them.  They're good peeps.

Clubs:  XS seems pretty popular amongst the 20 somethings.  

Pool:  great service but go early to get a spot

Gym:  very nice, but there's one lady at the desk who gave me a snippy attitude when I arrived in flip flops.  I just wanted use the yoga ball, and I understand the safety issues, but she didn't have to give me an attitude.  So wear shoes and avoid getting scolded.

Room:  The Tower suites give you access to a separate entrance and check-in desk which makes the wait for your room much more pleasant.  The rooms in the tower suites are also slightly upgraded with a separate living space from the bedroom, although there is no enclosure.  So if you have guests stopping by, and someone is taking a pre-party nap, they are still going to be disturbed.  Turn-down service is a nice touch, and the room has all your expected amenities for a 5 star hotel.  

The only issue I had that did not give this place 5 stars is the staff from gym were not super friendly, and the environmental service ladies (the ones vacuuming the lounge) were really rude when I was waiting for some friends in the bathroom.  I did not expect that- and I doubt that this would be expected behavior at St. Regis.

the players: michelle, ryan, scott, natalie, aaron, cameron, haley & maya 
the occasion: best friends trip, halloween, the SF giants in the world series
the mood: euphoric

so i've been to vegas more times than i can count. sometimes up to several times in one calendar year. what can i say, there is no place like this town.... no place.

for many years now, i've been an extremely satisfied patron of the venetian hotel. when i find something i really love, i stay with it. i'm loyal that way. this particular vegas trip was a last minute soiree though, and i let someone else take the reigns in planning it. well, high fives to cameron. he chose the wynn, and it was a great choice.

i never use this word, but the feeling you get when you walk in their front lobby is, opulence. everything is lush, the design is smooth and flawless. it feels like las vegas, but with more panache. 

this was a very special trip for us. first, this was a vacation with my nearest and dearest friends. my SF gang, my posse, my tribe. my best friends in the world.... (yeah, i know you guys are gonna read this, and i love you fucking hyenas more than life itself) 

this was also halloween weekend AND.... this is a very big AND, the giants were going to be playing games 3. 4 and 5 of the world series while we were there. as natives of san francisco, and all of us die hard giants fans, our schedule would obsessively revolve around these games.

cameron talked us into ""resort deluxe panoramic view"" suites... which means floor-to-ceiling windows and sweeping views of the vegas strip. yeah, i've seen it all before, but the view from our rooms just felt extra magical. especially after a few bottles of champagne before heading out for the night... you're all dolled up, the flashing lights glittering below you. it just sets the tone for the whole evening. the rooms were immaculate and offer cozy beds with fancy linens, a separate seating area with couches, a dining room with table, marble-rich bathrooms, remote controls for the lighting and drapes, etc etc etc. the works. service was top notch.

the rest of the hotel is exactly what you would expect for vegas. nothing is overlooked or spared, down to every snazzy detail. we spent a ton of time gambling in their casino areas, delightfully nursed our hangovers by their pool with our kir royales, partied like frat boys at XS and blush, dined like royalty at bartlotta (my second time there) and crawled back to our rooms at the break of dawn with nothing but an amused smile from the service staff.

cameron got a big, wet sloppy kiss for being such a great party planner. it was a trip i won't soon forget. do i still love the venetian hotel? definitely! will i stay at the wynn again though? absolutely!

What can you say that hasnt already been said about this beautiful hotel? Every detail has been articulately designed and polished which is consistant with the level of service you will get. The rooms are lovely and CLEAN. I have spent many days in high-end hotels and I like how they maintain cleanliness at the Wynn. 

The casino is also very good and quite busy, including the Poker Room, which I spent a hefty amount of time in. I guess when you join the tables around 3am, you should expect a bunch of guys loaded with booze and cash. My favorite type of opponents. Needless to say, I was among my own. Trashed. The highlight was that part of the hotel has room elevators that are adjacent to the Poker Room, so you can spend plenty of time watching the club-goers and hooker hunters walk back to their rooms with their night's ""winnings"". And for some, I do use the word ""winnings"" loosely.

SW, the fine-dining restaurant located near the lobby was also quite luxurious. The rib-eye was fantastic, foie gras amazing, beet salad wonderful and the duck impeccable. The highlight here, is that they have a light, video show about every half-an-hour that was borderline acid-trip and live art. Was entertaining to say the least, with my favorite being two extremely large, mechanical flowers that danced to the beat over the waterfall.

I have mixed feelings about my stay.  Obviously the bed was so comfortable that I wanted to buy it in the Home Store.  But instead bought my queen bed at Macys for about 1100 dollars cheaper.   We arrived late and check-in was a breeze.   It was checking out the day after XMAS that took about 30 mins.  The room service was top notch.  Probably the best I've ever experienced.  I'm still dreaming about that lobster the first night i was there.  I just felt like I wanted it to be breathe taking and I was surprised that my bathtub at TheHotel was larger.  I was surprised that there weren't more activities besides the nightclubs around XMAS time.  I tipped 20 bucks to see if I could get a better room but I realized later I don't think it worked.  I prebooked on booking.com months in advance.  The location on the strip I like a lot because you just start walking and not feeling like you're really far and you can hop on the bus.  It gorgeous inside.  I just get the feeling that maybe you get more perks with the towers or the nicer suites.   That maybe just getting a regular room here at the Wynn, can you get a really nice suite elsewhere.  And even for us working people paying 700-800 for 3 nights is a lot (w\/o room service included, and the spa) we just want the works.  I'll def be back.  I know my boyfriend who is vegan, was happy to have the options, but felt like it wasn't actually that great tasting of what he tried between Tableau, room service, and the buffet.

Don't get me wrong I'm a fan and had a great time.  I just don't know if we really got our moneys worth.

We upgraded ourselves as a treat and although we got a corner room and the views were amazing, the room itself wasn't anything special and the bathroom stunk of smoke. Plus, the hair salon there ruined my hair and I had to get them to bring me up some curling tongs to fix things myself (this was all quite an ordeal for me being that it was my wedding night and i had no girlfriends or family to fuss over me!). They got the orders wrong for some flowers that my parents had ordered to arrive in the room before we did, which didn't happen. Admittedly they eventually sent 2 lots by accident, but things like this should be spot on for the type of hotel they claim to be and for the prices they charge.

You can checkout right from the TV in your room so you don't have to stand in a long line before heading out. Will definately be staying again. 

The reason I didn't give the 5th star is because of the bad valet service when dropping off the car. I read the other reviews and experienced the same issue.  Unless you are in a Ferrari the valet guys just stare at you and walk by like if they are hoping you will go away.  I tried the south valet and the main gate and same thing.

2.

Front desk person who helped us apologized and asked us to wait longer instead of offering anything to make it up.  Unfortunately we had to ask to speak to someone of higher authority to get slight upgrade. Afterwards, they surprisingly sent complimentary chocolate upstairs after they knew we were celebrating special occasion.

3.  Love their design, high ceilings and beautiful and tasteful architectural design.  I also like how when we open the door the curtains open at the same time so we can see the entire view from the top.

After checking their web sites and reading up on it, I was excited about staying here.  The pictures were beautiful.  They were beautiful in person not incredibly beautiful.  

Similar to other people's comments, check-in is a pain. You are literally in line 45-1 hour.  I was so tired and this really made it worse. On top of that, while checking-in, they offer these upgrades or upsell as they call it.  They're always trying to sell you more. 

After checking-in, we went to our room.  The room was very nice. I liked it a lot.  It's very spacious.  I booked 3 rooms so I was able to check out the decor in each room.  They were all similar with a little variations in color scheme.    I love the bathroom.    I would like to have a bathroom similar to that: big bath tub (whirlpool), see-thru showers (but with 2 shower heads), 2 sinks, a vanity area, tv, and separate toilet room.  They even provide you with a scale, ear swabs, buffer, etc.  They also provide a bath robe. For a 5 star hotel, I was surprise that a 4 star hotel in NY provided a much nicer bath robe and slippers.  There were no slippers at Wynn.

I like their buffet.  They have better desserts than Bellagio.
Their staff were not that friendly. Some were rude.
You pay $30 a day to use their fitness center!!!!!  
If you so much as open the refrigerator or remove anything for more than a certain amount of time, they will charge you. (They do nickel and dime you on everything.)

The bed was so nice and comfy.  I can sleep there all day.

They have some nice restaurants. I didn't get a chance to try it but I definitely would check it out next time.

They have a few shops: Chanel, Dior, LV, but no gucci!!!!

The pool was nice. $10 for a tray of fruits and $16 for shrimp cocktails poolside.

And hyped up the Wynn was for me. I asked many people about it and most of them said it was amazing but many people said they only went to the casino and not the hotel so I didn't really know what to expect.

However, I had stayed at the Venetian and Palazzo and seen the inside of the nicer rooms at the Bellagio so I was not really prepared to be floored by the impressiveness that is Wynn. I suspect Encore would be much the same except perhaps slightly bigger but the Wynn was good enough for me. 

One of the things that I judge most hotels by is how thoughtful the designers were when they designed the rooms, bathrooms etc. Some places you don't have a choice because you know its a crappy hotel and you can't expect too much. But places like the Venetian and Palazzo even failed in some of the detailed thoughtfulness that went into creating the Wynn. It was as if somebody actually came in the room, lived here for a week, and said ... these are the things that REAL people need and now we need to design them into the room to make it functional AND luxurious. I love it! Everything from their showers and bath tiles to the beds and the flat screen TV's ... and I didn't even get a high floor either. 

Their pool is also equally amazing, I went there when it was 68 degrees and their pool was heated and their outdoor area was so beautiful. They have some of the best restaurants on the strip and everything is so accessible. When I stayed at the Wynn I didn't even want to leave; I've never felt this way about another hotel on the strip!

I can only conclude with this that despite all the five stars I've stayed at, and all the other hotels in on the strip, and even the W in New York and the Westin in San Francisco ... the Wynn is quite possibly the best hotel I've ever stayed at. Ever.",5,2,3

- The overall atmosphere felt pretentious and stuffy. Every restaurant has a different dress code which must be strictly abided by. This made it hard to just wander down to the casino level from our hotel room and grab a bite to eat.

- The room service food was pretty terrible but also ridiculously expensive. I don't think I've had worse room service food before. And it felt like we were getting robbed because it was so expensive. 

- At every turn, we felt like we were getting nickel and dimed. Every little thing cost lots of money. 

- This seemed to cater to an older crowd of people, which felt a little uncomfortable for my husband and I, in our early thirties. 

- Unlimited mimosas at the brunch restaurant is a lie. Each mimosa gets consecutively weaker. Lame.

Yes, this is an upscale hotel and I am all about upscale.  I love fancy things.  My issue with the general customer service at Wynn is that it's so pretentious.  I constantly felt like they would only be nice to me if I started flashing my money around, which is counter-intuitive to my general philosophy in life which is that you damn well better be nice to me if you expect to get even one little bit of my money.  There is way too much competition in Las Vegas to get my gambling dollars to be treated the way we were treated at Wynn.

First off, they messed up our reservation and gave us a king bed instead of two queens, and then tried to pass it off as my mistake.  Casino marketing reservations does not send confirmations so I could not either notice it in advance or prove anything different and they would not change it for us and attempted to sound all put out about sending a rollaway since they ""already have a long waiting list"" for rollaways.  I didn't want a damn rollaway but I requested one just for spite.  When we checked in, we were not alerted to the bed situation and when we asked where the sportsbook was the pompous desk clerk arrogantly said, ""Just follow the smoke"".  OK.  So, you sorta insulted us for hanging out in smoky places and you also dissed on your own property.  Nice.

Next, a sketchy incident occurred when we were still asleep the first morning and, despite our posting of a ""Privacy Please"" sign, someone entered our room, turned on the light, did *something* and left, all while we were still asleep.  I woke up but was so dazed and since we were pretty near the elevators, I didn't get to the hall in time to see who it was (and I was in my PJs so not about to go sprinting down the hall).

The rooms are nice but a bit dark with the dark brown walls.  But, they have a big window and they're fine but certainly not the nicest in Vegas.  The bathroom is very nice.  The walls are thin and we had noisy neighbors.  The beds are comfy (but honestly less so than at a few other places in Vegas).

The next major customer service fail was when I attempted to request a late checkout (on a Monday morning when they were not really that booked full from the night before) and I was denied a 30-60 minute extension.  I was told to contact a casino host to get an override.  OK, I'll check it out.  The casino host was one of the biggest assholes I've ever encountered in my lifetime.  He, of course, reviewed my account for the weekend and noted that I had a promotional rate so I wasn't going to get anything.  I hadn't asked for anything  - this was before I had even alerted him to my purpose for contacting him.  But, here's the thing.  If you send out promotional offers for good room rates, I'd be an idiot for not taking it and instead choosing to pay a much higher rate, wouldn't I?  And, if you're going to be completely rude to people who accept these offers (and screw up their reservations, too), why even send them out?  When I told him I really just wanted a later checkout time so I could just play a bit longer (i.e. give them money) before I went to the airport (without hassling with baggage check for only 30-60 minutes), he said, ""What's the difference between 12 and 12:30?"" ignoring my money losing potential for the added time, and I said ""You're right, and I have no desire to spend my money here"".  I went and spent it at Palazzo instead.

With that said, I thought the bartenders, cocktail waitresses, sports bet takers, and players' club people were very nice.  I do hate that the Wynn really has no place to eat that is mid-range.  I go to Vegas to gamble and, while I do enjoy fine dining, I'm just not always up for it when I'm there.  At Wynn, they have upscale dining and then they have cafeteria-style dining.  Stratta is sort of middle of the road but it's definitely not casual.  We found ourselves constantly venturing out for other food, particularly at breakfast since the casual breakfast at the Wynn does not seem to exist.

All in all, I would probably not choose to stay here again.  There are other upscale options in Las Vegas that are just as nice, where the customer service is better and they don't act like they are doing you a favor by letting you give them your money.",3,2,1

Every square inch of this hotel was well thought out.  Every little detail just falls into place in this beautiful hotel.

Yes, the room rates are on the higher end of Vegas hotels, but if you're young with money to spend, it's well worth it.  The nightlife has been popping since the day they opened, beach parties are still always at capacity, and you can't go wrong with any of the dining options.  Speaking of dining options, best buffet in all of Vegas.  Not the most options in comparison to other buffets on the strip, but options aren't the highlight, the quality is.

Built at a cost of $2.7 billion, it was the largest privately funded construction project in the nation. Roger Thomas was the interior designer for the hotel and he designed many of the public spaces as well as the majority of components of the Guest Rooms and Villas. 

Interestingly, the building is the first high rise to be cleaned by an automatic window washing system. 

I stayed here on my birthday in 08'. They put me in a room facing the strip on the 51st floor which was nice but I expected a little more like a bottle of wine or a fruit basket or something! I am a red card member and I don't gamble alot but I spend ALOT of money everytime I'm here after all! 

This is the most beautiful hotel, casino I have ever stayed at! Everyone was pleasant and helpful. The free shuttle from the monorail station is a nice touch (I heard they don't offer it anymore). The free drinks are good and stiff. The food was great everywhere I went! I didn't get to go to Tryst or the Lake Of Dreams this time but, I had a great time at Blush. 

The doorman even took a picture of my friend and I with my camera without even being asked! Now that's service! They now have a app for Android and the iPhone. They are also on twitter @WynnLasVegas. 

Wynn has just started to renovate all of their 2700 rooms starting from the top down at a cost of $99 million scheduled to be done by April of 2011. They are also scheduled to remodel the Baccarat area starting in October to be finished by Christmas 2010. Daniel Boulud Brasserie will be replaced by Lakeside Cafe by October 2010 as well. 

Insider Tip #1: Ask a cab driver to drive you down to the cab waiting area under the hotel. There are Indy race cars on the walls with sounds of the engines revving. A very cool thing to see! 

Insider Tip #2: Be sure to put in your info in the Guest Book section of the Wynn Las Vegas website. You will get all types of offers for discounts on rooms and food.

From the pool, to the service, to the casino, to the restaurants, to the clubs... This is the best property in Vegas.  I was previously torn between the Bellagio and the Wynn until we took a trip to Vegas to figure out what we wanted to get married....  I now have no desire to stay at the bellagio or anywhere else for that matter (unless it's the Encore)  

We visited the Bellagio after staying in the Wynn, and in comparison it looks old, dated and dirty. Im so happy with our decision to stay at the Wynn. 

My only complaints are:  We spent a LOT of money in the hotel over the weekend of our wedding.  We asked for an upgrade upon check in and they did not honor our request or really seem to give a shit about the amount of money we were spending.  This is in a recession, in Vegas.  

We requested a smoking room, got a non-smoking room and had to switch the next day which is not a fun event. Surprisingly, the smoking room was even nicer than the non. We stayed on the 50th floor with a great view. No where do they tell you that they will charge you $200.00 per night for a security deposit.  For some of our wedding guests who do not carry credit cards, only cash, this was a problem.  Not sure how they got this resolved but it's there job to make sure that they notify their guests of their policies.

It all begins at the dramatic main entry with brightly colored lush, gorgeous flowers and topiaries with well pruned gorgeous greenery as the backdrop, continues with very courteous service at check in where the ladies & gents in well-designed uniforms strive to make every visitor feel like a VIP and that the world is at their feet now that they are at the Wynn!  From there, it just goes on and on and on - it is a truly elegant property where anyone with an eye could draw much inspiration from.  I was taking design notes left and right as this is the type of luxury I like:  opulent but never overdone.

I must go and research who the interior designer of the rooms is, because even the standard room option where I have now stayed twice (once in the Encore, once in the Wynn) the spacious and luxurious layout is probably my favorite in Las Vegas where I have stayed at quite a few other hotels.  I love the lights and drapes opening and closing at the touch of a button from my bedside or at the entry to the room!  The toiletries in the bath are so wonderful and refreshing - the standard lemon scent as well as a few others are available in the gift shoppe or through the catalog in the desk if you just have to have some more.  Yes, I took a shower gel home with me ;)  The cleaning staff does such a great job that I do not fear walking on the beautiful carpet barefoot.  The linens and comfy bed is also available via catalog and you get such great rest here (even when jet-lagged from 3 hour time difference) that I am sure they have received several orders for the linens and the mattresses alike, no matter the price.

There are PLENTY of dining options available between Encore and Wynn and all are a delight!  My Vegan co-worker was especially happy that ALL restaurants within Wynn have a Vegan menu as Steve Wynn himself is a Vegan.  So everyone is happy!  The food is delish - pricey - but delish!  You will see my separate reviews for all the establishments within the hotel that I tried.   

The pool is spectacular and once again, gorgeous without being overdone.  I did not venture over to the European pool with the lily-pads though they look fun for lounging all day.  As I most recently stayed at The Wynn for business, I was only able to take in the Vegas sun and go for a dip over a few hours one morning as they opened.  The cocktail waitresses were very friendly and attentive, as were the staff at the entry and the towel bar.  Again, everyone on staff goes above and beyond to meet your needs.  I will need to come back again and rent out a cabana if I am here with friends.  On my first visit I had more pool-time and visited the pool at the Encore which was much more of a party atmosphere so take note that this pool was certainly more quiet, but again, I was there on a weekday morning with not a kid nor any partying 20-somethings in sight. 

I had several last minute packages sent to me via the business center where the standard Vegas handling fee is $25 per package so be warned, however, I have incurred the exact same fees at many other Vegas hotels so don't be alarmed if this is your first time.  And once again, the staff both here at the biz center, the valet and the taxi stand all corroborated in making package delivery to cars and cabs seamless despite the fact that they are located at opposite ends of the resort.  As usual when in Vegas (especially for business), be sure to keep lots of change on hand for tips!

I love roulette and could not resist playing a hand or two or ten even on the nights where the minimum per hand was $15 at one table and $25 at most others on the main floor.

However, My poor mother got poisoned as they assured us many times that it was safe for her to eat there. I know the first morning she ahd the gluten free pancakes and the second morning had eggs and toast with fruit. I will say they cannot make eggs to save their life! I do not eat eggs, so I had a dish that had eggs on it but it was covered in hallandaise sauce which is too much fat for myself, so i did not eat, but my mom said both days her eggs came cold but on a hot plate... can't  imagine how that is possible!

I stayed at the Wynn with a party of 10. We had five separate rooms all on the 15th floor. We had a number of issues during our stay, including a robbery in our room and a number of inconveniences.

I checked in second, and the three remaining rooms checked in after me (as we were all arriving on different flights from different parts of the country). When my friend arrived, his room was not ready, and so he left his luggage with the concierge. When I met him, I offered to allow him to leave his luggage in my room until his room was ready. We went to the concierge and they would not give us his luggage (even though we had the ticket)! The policy is that you cannot take your own luggage from the concierge; you must go upstairs to your room and call for it to be delivered. The concierge assured me that if we went upstairs and called it would be brought right up. So, we go upstairs and call. I speak to the SAME woman when I called for the luggage and she told me there would be an HOUR wait for the luggage. She also said that we must remain in the room. What an inconvenience! I could have carried it upstairs myself! We decide not to wait and tell them we will call back at a later time. When we call back, we are told that it will be 20 minutes for them to deliver the luggage. I think this is a reasonable time because the hotel is huge and it takes 15 minutes to walk from the concierge to the room anyway. The luggage is delivered AN HR AND TEN MINUTES LATER! Almost a full hour later than they quoted!

Another inconvenience included being comped buffets by a blackjack dealer. My friends and I sat at the same blackjack table for about 6 hrs. Two people in our party spent a significant amount of money at these tables and tipped the dealer well. They were each told that they were going to be comped 2 buffets and that they would show up on their room key. The next morning when we tried to go to the buffet, only 1 person was comped 2 meals. The other person was comped only 1 meal. Did anyone attempt to help us resolve this issue? No. Of course not. We had to walk all the way out to the concierge from the buffet and wait in line to get the matter resolved. For a 5-star hotel, they certainly don't make things easy on their guests (with comps and luggage delivery, at least!)

Lastly and most importantly, our room was robbed the first night we were staying at the hotel. I checked into the room at 930am. We were out of the room for most of the morning and afternoon, and from about 6pm-midnight we were in and out. At this time, we had guests in our room from our party and for about an hour (while we were in the room) had the door ajar so that our guests could easily get in while we all sat chatting and no one would have to answer the door. Then from about midnight until 4am (when I returned to the room) no one was in the room and the door was locked. During this time, someone entered our room and stole 2 bags: 1 bag was a Longchamp weekender bag and the other was a laptop case. In the laptop case was a computer, a gps, and an ipod.

We reported the missing items to security in the morning when we realized they were gone. They filed a report and provided my friend (who's longchamp luggage was stolen) a piece of luggage so that she could get home. After this encounter, it all went downhill. Later on that day, one of the people in my party was allowed into my room by hotel security (even though this person was a registered guest of another room in the hotel) and was not even asked to show ID or fill anything out. Security just let him right into my room and did not monitor what he was doing while inside. Granted, I would have allowed this person in my room myself, but SECURITY should not be so lax about who is allowed in rooms! Just because they knew that we had a large party, they let anyone that asks into my room? NO WONDER WE WERE ROBBED! I never told anyone from the hotel to allow this person into my room at any point over the weekend. They took it upon themselves to do so! 

When the Risk Management office opened on Monday (please explain to me why no one from risk management is available over the weekend when the CRUX of this business is vacation travelers?) our claim was denied. They said that we entered and exited the room too many times on Friday night. I was completely unaware that to be PROTECTED FROM THEFT, there is some little known limit to how many times you can enter and exit YOUR OWN ROOM! 

I WILL NEVER STAY AT THE WYNN AGAIN AND UNLESS YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT BEING ROBBED AND INCONVENIENCED, I SUGGEST YOU DON'T, EITHER!",7,0,3

I've been staying @ Wynn hotel for nearly 10yrs. Never gave me any problems & service there is always great, really living up to their 5 star standard. This yr. our hotel was paid for by friends, so we weren't able to stay @ Wynn but, we still went to gamble in their casinos. One night me & my friends decided to go while my husband took another friend home. We start @ baccarat. The minimum to gamble is  $50 so we start playing @ the minimum. We play for about an hour & move on to play blackjack &, their minimum is  $25. So we start @ the minimum for blackjack & play for about another hour at this table. My husband comes & we stay for only about a half an hour more before leaving.

This is where we ran into multiple aggravating problems. Before we could leave at all, we had to change out all of our chips. In the middle of doing so, I realize we needed parking validation so I asked the dealer @ the blackjack table & he tells me that the host would validate it for us. I go & find the host & when I do, he tells me he won't validate my ticket because we didn't play up to a $1000. I'm looking @ him confused, trying to explain that weve been playing all night but, he still argues w\/me & continues to tell me that I won't be getting the validation. I walk back to the blackjack dealer & he tells me the same thing I said. I take him w\/me back to the host & the host is STILL telling me no & he refuses to give me the validation. I ask to speak to a manager & he tells me I need to find him. By this time I've already walked back & forth about 3 times. I'm pissed. I'm out of breath. I'm mad. I asked him for his business card & he denied me that too. This happened on a Friday night around 930-1030. The front host is terrible. He didn't help the situation, but in fact MAKE IT INCREDIBLY MORE WORST. If there was a rating for 0 stars, it'd be for him.",3,0,0

The service wasn't that great... as our adjoining two rooms with double beds were not available.  They could only provide a King Bed and a cot.  What???  Apparently, just because you make a RESERVATION and pay for your room does not guarantee anything... it's simply a request.  I would understand if I had booked the room through a third party but we had called The Wynn directly.  Also, the fact that the clerk was snotty did not help.  Luckily, I went to another representative, as the snotty one was assisting my cousin, and she was able to give us the double beds.  Unfortunately, our rooms could not be adjoining and in fact were in such separate floors, we had to take different elevators.

As far as the rooms go, the beds were TINY.  We had four girls to a room, which I thought would've been fair, but I was WRONG.  The bathroom was nice, similar to the Venetian and Palazzo.  However, the bedroom was small, and there was no additional living area.  If any of you had stayed at the Venetian, you would know that they have a cool layout with a additional living room, sofas, TV, mirror, and desk.  The Wynn, the five star\/five diamond rated hotel, is merely two tiny double beds, the TV console and a desk.  I suppose it would be adequate... had we booked a room at the Holiday Inn... but it's not luxurious by any means.

To add more insult to injury... my cousin checked in before me, but took longer to obtain a room.  I went after her and received my room with a smile, more efficiency, and was about fifteen floor higher.  Trust me, I thanked the representative for doing her job and being so kind about it.  Secondly, my cousin called to request a late check out and they said that it was unavailable.  When she calls my room to tell me this, I call the front desk to make a similar request.  Surprisingly, it was a non issue for us.  Can you imagine her frustrations?!  Here she was, celebrating her 25th birthday, and getting shafted!  It showed us that the hotel was inconsistent and definitely not worth the price tag.  We will not be coming back - not when there are so many other options on the strip.

Ps.  The pool area was decent and the buffet was fabulous.",3,0,0

I was lucky to stay here for one comped night and i must say the standard room is great!... it had a 52"" lcd flat panel with adjustable wall mount... The most plush pillows I have ever squeezed (ask my about my Wynn pillow story)... and the bed felt so soft... its equivalent to being dipped in vat of cool creamy milk on a warm day... or even better, its like wallowing in a bed of silky smooth rose petals... sigh...

The amenities are immaculate... the service, ready and willing... and the ambiance, fit for James Bond... if I only had the money to play high end stakes poker, than my stay would have been complete...

They have a wonderful night waterfall show on an outdoor patio, centralized within the casino outdoors... I didn't have time to explore too much, considering you can just stay at one place in Vegas the whole time, but i would imagine the shopping and pool to be exquisite...

Of course, all this grandeur comes with a pretty penny... Seek your local travel agent for arrangements... come stay at least one night... you wont regret it...

Even the people staying here were more polite and better behaved than I have experienced at other properties, plus it is a smoke free hotel everywhere outside of the casinos and you can surely tell as it smells cleaner

We were upgraded from a regular Tower suite to a 980sq ft room that provided a stunning view of the golf course

The restaurants and the buffet were once again better quality than other properties I have stayed at.

If you can afford the 40-60% more costs to stay here over like the Luxor or MGM I would highly suggest you to do so

I watched Le Reve in the  Theater.
The theater is fantastic as well...the tiered seating makes it so no matter where your seat is you have a great view of the entire stage and what's going on.  Very well done! The stage is a circular built one in the center and seriously you can see everything and have no one's head in your way.  =)
the show was very creative and enjoyable.  I think the Le Reve show holds more or a story than Cirque De Soleil.
I definetely give all the performers props for what theyre doing performing in or with water takes lots of work!  *I was lucky enough to get discounted tickets (Military can get up to 50%)
If the tickets were full price $138.50 then I probably would not have felt it worth that much.  The show was just a little over an hour long but did include a lot, different acts and what not.  The music\/singing was live and I could see the singer in the small booth, that was cool.

I believe the attention to detail, caring, cleanliness, & customer service is severely lacking. We are so dissatisfied & will NEVER EVER stay here again!  When I booked our 2-night reservation with Rose in the phone to surprise my husband for his 41st bday and our 18 yr wedding anniversary, she said we would love it here and be spoiled. Nothing could be further from the truth.  Literally from the moment we landed and walked into your hotel we've had bad experiences after bad experiences. I will highlight a few for you:

When we first arrived we checked in and my husband had to use your lobby bathroom. He had to pass 3 empty stalls in order to find a clean one to use. Thought ""gross, this is a five star hotel?"" We honestly thought ""ok let's give them a chance and let it slide"" because we were so excited to see the hotel that several of my clients have told me was so beautiful and the best hotel in Vegas.  Again not the truth. 

We get to our room and it's nice but the Hilton Elara we stayed at for a Vegas Thanksgiving was nicer. Though I told your staff on the phone for reservations and at checkin why were here to celebrate I did not feel heard or valued as a customer because there was no note, card, complimentary dessert and bottle of wine waiting for us like we had when we stayed at another Hilton for an anniversary in the past.  I guess shame on us for having high expectations by thinking if the Hilton knew how to make us feel special then certainly the Wynn would!  Nope, wrong!  

Then we notice room has no fridge, coffee maker or even complimentary bottles of water!  I can honestly say this is the first in all our years visiting different hotels. The small comforts of being away from our home and our children are so important to us. Again we let it go and thought ""ok Wynn just doesn't do this sort of stuff but let's stay positive and see if we can enjoy our stay.""  We leave our room to go explore your hotel and we smell smoke. I thought we were on a non smoking floor?  If so apparently it's not enforced.  

We went to eat at your terrace point cafe for lunch. The staff seemed frazzled instead of friendly. After receiving a table I go to use the bathroom. As soon as I walk in to the first stall I'm repulsed by the smell and visual of literally poop smeared on the toilet seat and down the front of the bowl.  I immediately walk back out and flag down Karen your restaurant employee dressed in a black suit who happened to be steps from just outside the bathroom door. I told her about the filthy bathroom and she apologized and called someone to clean it. 

I go back in to use the bathroom & enter the second stall though it doesn't look very clean either. When I go to wash my hands in comes Claudia with one blue\/purple glove to clean the poopy stall with NO cleaner in hand to Kill the bacteria or relieve smell. She grabs a paper towel & runs it under the faucet heads to the stall to clean it.  I'm appalled, disgusted, and curious at the same time so I linger at the sink to see what she's going to do. After I hear several flushes she comes out, takes off her glove, doesn't even wash her hands!, wipes down counter again with no cleaner, only paper towels.  

OMG!  I'm so upset!  I go back to my table where my husband is waiting to order and I think to myself what am I going to do or say to him? It's his actual birthday and I want to stay positive and not ruin it for him. Do I tell him what I just saw or not? He can see that I'm clearly upset and asks me what's wrong. I break into tears and tell him what just happened and that I'm so grossed out and so upset I don't think I can eat here. I mean are they trying to have an Ecoli break out for their guests or what?!?  Coincidentally Karen walks past my table and I flag her over.  Through my tears I tell her how her staff handled my complaint and I wondered out loud if the kitchen is even clean if they can't keep the bathrooms clean.  She asked for a description and name of the bathroom attendant and assured me she would let that department know. She gave us a complimentary cup of ice cream after our meal since it was Shawn's bday. It felt like a very cheap way of appeasement over the ordeal I just witnessed and went through.  

We went to the Sinatra restaurant here at the Wynn. There's a wall of Frank Sinatra pictures I start to admire. Lo & behold one is up higher on the wall and so filthy like some one spilled milk or dirty water on it that it alone has dried drip stains running down it. Again another sign that the level and standards for cleanliness in the supposed best hotel is not there. 

Lastly I wish someone would've told me that coming here to rest, relax, & sleep is impossible here until after 4am. On our 36 floor we can hear the bass from the XS. Nightmare!  Never coming here again! Other hotels will have my biz now.",6,9,0

The hotel is, of course, gorgeous. From the flower lined trees in the entrance atrium to the cabanas alongside the pool, the Wynn is one of the nicest hotels in Vegas. 

Our first room was on the strip side and offered views of Treasure Island and the Mall (which, although it's a mall, is architecturally pleasant on the strip side). It was a bright salmony orange color, spaces with a full walk-in shower and soaking tub. (Contrary to other reviews, at the least in the standard rooms, the large tub is NOT a jacuzzi tub - it is a soaking tub.) Our second room was higher up on the golf course side, which was pleasant but not as fun to look at the the strip. It also had a walk-in shower and a soaking tub, but the walls were brown (which is where all the walls are apparently headed in the remodel). Both rooms offered stunning views of mountains in the distance by day. 

Why did we have two rooms? Oh yes. So we were two females who had booked a room with two double beds. We confirmed THREE TIMES that we had a nonsmoking with two double beds and that we would be checking in late. When we arrived we were told there were no more rooms with two beds by a woman who was rude and unapologetic. When my friend asked why we weren't notified when we confirmed she responded ""I can send a twin bed if you want it."" She did not offer to inform us if a room was later made available, we had to ask to be informed and to have a note made. Whatever, it was 11pm. We went up to the room and waited for the twin which never came. Thirty to forty minutes later we called and asked if it was coming soon and we were told yes. We then asked if we needed to be in the room when it arrived and we were told no so we went across the street for a very later dinner. When we returned an hour or so later, still no bed. We called again. We weren't told they'd check into it and call us back. No call back. We called again. We were told they had to see if it was ordered and they'd get back to us. No call back. We called again. The last woman was helpful, said she'd call back, and called back 15 minutes later. 5 minutes after that the bed arrived. 

This was one of MANY examples of shoddy service at the Wynn. (Don't get me started on the changing rooms debacle that could have been seamless and nice but, instead, turned into a dramedy.) The were several other instances where we where the wrong name was on the room, things did not work and they would send somebody up but nobody came. I could write paragraphs of examples. Although only that first woman was rude, many of the staffers at the Wynn were inept and lacking follow-through. There were a few standouts of excellence, like the woman at the Red Card counter near the room elevators (whose name I don't remember, but she was a pretty Asian woman if that helps), and Mike, who hailed us a cab that took credit cards with expertise and personality that made our last moments at the Wynn happy ones. 

The European pool was enjoyable until the sun started to ""set"" behind the Palazzo, and then, nothing but shade. 

Oh, and the beds were really comfy, well, when we finally had beds. 

I also enjoyed two restaurants here, but I will review and rate them separately. 

I don't know. The Wynn really is gorgeous, but I have experienced far superior service overall elsewhere. When I'm on vacation, I don't want to have to fight for the basic things I need, no matter how lovely my surroundings are. Especially at the prices they charge here. This may not be my last stay in Vegas, but it is most likely my last stay at The Wynn.

(Notes for the Wynn:   

Having an infomercial talking about all the things you can do while you're there is great; having Steve Wynn talk about it comes off as kind of douchey.   

In at least one of the write-ups for one of your night clubs in the book in the room it talks about how the place is a great place to take in both a sunset and a sunrise, right about the posted hours, which open after sunset and close before sunrise.  I'm just sayin'.  If you need a quality editor for your materials, I'm available at a reasonable price.)",3,3,1

and sad to say, this is really an overrated hotel

the exterior design as well as the lobby floor are very nice; clean, fresh, modern, eclectic, it is a nice atmosphere and setting
the room itself is nice too, comfy sheets and bed, nice layout and design

BUT that's about it...
first, our view.. it was such a terrible  view, even the fact we only returned to the room to change and sleep, it wasnt nice looking out to see the top of the connecting building..
second, the $30 charge for calls and internet? really? we didn't need or use any of it yet this ""hotel fee"" is mandatory..what a way to steal money
third, no breakfast\/brunch upgrade...when we initially wanted to make the booking, we were offered a two night stay with two breakfast coupons; we asked for friday and saturday night, then when we asked to purchase another breakfast coupon (we were a party of three) we were told they don't do breakfast, only brunch for the weekends and we would need to pay the difference for all the passes...seriously? you won't even offer us free brunch?

and lastly, upon check in we told them not to text us when the room was ready..and what did they do? they texted us. better yet, 5 minutes after we left!!!
we wandered vegas for 4 hours in the heat before returning to them saying they contacted us.. BS! they even put a note in the booking NOT to text us!

The reason I don't give it five stars. The air condition in the room didn't seem to work well. I called the front desk twice and they sent people up to fix it. It seemed to help temporarily but at time the temperature made the room uncomfortable. The prices for food (in the cafe and drugstore) and well as drinks are expensive even for Vegas. Finally, Wynn seems to have two very popular night clubs. I'm not into the club scene and it tends to attract a certain type of crowd that I'm not very fond of.

If these are the things you want then it is a great hotel. I wouldn't choose to stay here again. I would prefer to be closer to center strip and I also like a little more kitsch in my Vegas hotels. That's just me.

At the time of reservation, there was an option for a ""Deluxe Resort King"" (comes with one king bed) as well as an option for ""Resort Double Deluxe"" (comes with two full beds), among many other choices. The ""Resort Double Deluxe"" was roughly $200 more per night than the ""Deluxe Resort King"" but my friend and I thought we would spoil ourselves a little and each have our own bed. We booked the ""Resort Double Deluxe"". I booked six and a half months ahead of time. 

My girlfriend lined up for 15 minutes at 11:00pm to check in. The lady at the front desk informed us that the ""Resort Double Deluxe"" that we booked was no longer available and that they can provide us with a ""Deluxe Resort King"" and bring us a single rollaway bed. To compromise, I asked if there would be a two double bed room available at any point in our stay so we could move there once one becomes available. The lady said no. She said when we booked, it was only a preference that we wanted two full beds and that it was not a guarantee. I informed her that we specifically booked the ""Resort Double Deluxe"" room and we paid over $800 EXTRA for it as well. She then proceeded to say that because we booked through www.booking.com, she does not know how they list their bookings but regardless, she couldn't help us as no ""Resort Double Deluxe"" rooms were available. Should Wynn not be responsible for the websites that give rights to book for their hotel?

I asked to speak to the manager. She said she will talk to the manager herself and see what she could do for us. It took her 10 minutes to come back. At this time, it was already close to 11:30pm and our excitement to go out for the night has plateaued. We were bummed. When she came back, she informed me that the manager will waive the mandatory resort fee. This was a total of a $121USD credit for our four nights. We paid over $800 EXTRA to reserve the ""Resort Double Deluxe"" to get two full sized beds when I made the booking 6 and a half months ago. I was very unhappy with this service. I had paid a good premium to stay at the Wynn and was very excited. I asked if I could speak to the manager directly. She called him and Steven came up to the Registration Desk. 

He said there was nothing more he could do for me. When I said that I will agree upon the $120 credit but our moods were flattened. I suggested if he could throw in a cheap bottle of champagne or a small credit for food, my girlfriend and I could put this all behind us and consider staying at the Wynn again. He refused and insisted that he was already doing us a huge favor by waiving the resort fee for us. I again explained to him that I had indeed booked a guaranteed ""Resort Double Deluxe"" with two full sized bed( this was not a drop-down menu preference as he kept insisting it was) and not the King that they are giving me. 

My husband and I, both separately and together, visit Vegas 8 or 9 times per year in total and Wynn\/Encore was the last on my bucket list.

I rave to friends\/family about this place as to me it has always represented classy luxury-the kind of Vegas experience I am after!  I travel to get away for a nice break from it all, and usually the Wynn delivers.

My most recent trip was with my family (parents) as they needed a little getaway, too, and I thought why not take them to my favourite hotel?  (in recent years I've grown to love the MGM Signature Suites, which IMO is now better than the Wynn--much more private and better service & rooms).

It seems like many of my favourite things in life--there is no such thing as ""forever"".  It all began with check-in on a quiet Sunday night (we stayed here 5 nights, in two rooms I booked for us).  Usually when I arrive from a long flight i am tired, and simply want to get my keys and go up to my room to freshen up.  It is a huge turnoff when you show up with your luggage and family in tow, and you have to stand through a sales spiel to see if you want to upgrade to an even higher priced room than the one you've already booked.  NOTE TO THE WYNN: If I wanted a parlour suite I would have booked one, and unless you are giving it to me at a steal I cannot refuse (aka FREE) I am NOT interested.

After 20 minutes we finally got keys to our rooms, and they were not as nice as I remembered them.  The hallways still look clean and modern, but the interior of the rooms were starting to show their age.  Still clean, but the decor that I remembered as modern and easy on the eyes was not dated and still frozen from the era when Wynn was in its heyday.

Those days are gone.  NOTE TO INTERNET USERS:  You only get TWO devices with your $25 plus tax resort fee, and we did have an incident when the system was down.  Also we were misinformed at our lovely check-in that you opt out of the resort fee for $15\/device instead (ie. if you didn't intend to use the internet\/services you did not have to pay the resort fee).  We did end up having things clarified at checkout, but it would have been less stressful to not have these issues in the first place.

The sheets were as nice as I remember them, but my bed lacked the firmness that it used to have.  Instead it sunk badly and I had a bad back by the end of the week.  Thank goodness I already had massages booked when I got home--otherwise I would be spending a fortune at the spa to help my poor back!

Our room was cleaned nicely (we try not to make much of a mess anyway), and it was only one day when I had to call for them to clean our room).  We made use of our $200\/room food credit as well, and it was a nice gesture that helped us choose the Wynn.

Security was good and you always had to show your room card in the day and evening to get to the elevators.  I felt safe and the clientele here are a classy bunch.

Would I return?  With so many options here the Wynn might still have a chance, but they are slipping.  I hope they don't continue slipping, or I will have to say goodbye to one of my favourite getaways.",1,1,0

Wynn forces you to either get your coffee from room service for $9.00 plus the associated fees or go all the way down to the Casino and buy a cup fro the Deli. VERY inconvenient. Not to mention there is a $29.00 plus tax resort fee per day added to your bill. A decent place but I won't stay again.",0,0,0

The Wynn has always been a faovrite place of mine, i usually joke and call it my backyard since I am here most of the time relaxing and enjoying the fabulous lounges and restuarants.

A favorite spot of mine i highly reccomend is the Parasols down bar, located downstairs with a spectacular view of a water fountain which features a mini show every 15-30 min.

If your hungry and care for a snack indulge at the drug store cafe at the Wynn located near the Le Reve theater, cheap and portions are huge.

We stayed at the Salon Suite with an additional joining room.  The suite was definitely spacious and electic.  It had a very large living room, wet bar, private master bedroom and a bathroom that could be a room, it was so huge.

Staying at the suite has its perks: personal concierge, private entrance, access to tower suite pool and you'll also enjoy daily complimentary breakfast for two at Tableau, morning coffee and tea service, and no resort fees!

Shops, you are literally steps away from the shops!  A lot of high end stores at the Wynn and Encore but if you are looking for a tad bit  inexpensive dont you worry across the street is the mall with a huge food court!  

Even though I was on vacation I still needed to do a bit of work out, their gym is also on the upscale side.  With updated equipment, bikes, wieghts, machines, oh and did I mention that you could also get a personal trainer!? Hmm yeah might be a tad bit much if you are on vacation haha!

Sunny side up? I mean literally the SUN =)  Unfortunately, I didn't get to go swimming at their humungous european pools.  Their pools wrapped around the whole swimming area with cabanas, bar and spas.  I can't wait to go here during summer!

First off,  everyone we encountered was very polite and professional, however, we found that our room was not ready on our arrival.  They said they would text me when the room was ready.  One hour later, and nothing.  We drove from So Cal. so we really wanted to crash in our room for a while.  I went to check in, who informed me that they had a room available.  An hour seems a bit of a wait considering the Wynn is a higher end hotel.

Our room was a Tower King.  It was large and well appointed.  Our bags came to our room promptly, and the bell man explained the features of our room.  The room was quiet, comfortable and very spacious, almost a palace.  The floor to ceiling windows offer an amazing view of Las Vegas.

The room included coffee service between 7 am and 8:30.  If you have ever stayed on the Strip, you know the rooms don't have coffee machines and getting coffee in the mornings can be a project.  The coffee was great, but it would be nice if the service could run a bit later......  the coffee window is a bit narrow.

The room also included a complimentary breakfast, which was ok, but you should really make reservations the night before or you'll be eating a late breakfast.  Also, the ""potato"" that came with breakfast was little more than a tot..... come on people?

The gym is located on the spa floor and is well equipped and maintained.  It opens at 5:30 am, however someone overslept one morning and it opened 30 minutes late, to the annoyance of several waiting guests.

The casino is nice enough, but they need to work on getting that cigarette smoke pumped out.  We hung out at the slot machines, and the drink service was friendly and prompt.  The Konami slots are my favorite.... love the lucky dragon and the free spins.

Rooms:
The rooms were very pretty, spacious, and accommodating. No complaints here except that we were told that our two rooms would be adjoined and they weren't. They also tacked on an additional 100 dollar resort fee for each room when we checked out. Be careful and read the small print ahead of time because they aren't up front about the total cost.

Food: 
The buffet was great and included lots of choices. Food and service were great. Be ready to wait in line, but it will be worth it.

We had dinner at Jardin, one of the restaurants in the hotel. It was a beautiful restaurant, lots of flowers. We had high hopes for this place, but were highly disappointed when we literally waited an hour and a half for our food. One hour into the wait I had to ask the waiter for bread, I guess they had forgot. When we asked how much longer until our food arrived, they said a little longer because it was taking a while to cook the steak and chicken. When the food finally came out, the steak was incredibly rare, the blood turned one of the girl's mashed potatoes red--she had asked for medium. The two salmon entrees we ordered were not fully cooked--sushi status. When one person from the table asked to speak to the manager he did not really care to listen and just said ""thank you for your feedback"".

We also had brunch at Tableau. It was also a beautiful place, we were seated and served quickly. Service was great and everyone enjoyed their meals and pastries. 

Clubs:
A promoter had reserved us a table and two bottles for Saturday night. They still made us wait in line for 45 minutes. Multiple groups were let in before us. Once we got in, there were tons of open tables, so I don't quite understand what the hold up was. 

Check out: 
We had a sprinter bus reserved to take us back to LA. The bell hop asked our driver to move the bus into the driveway to load our luggage since it was raining. While our driver loaded the bus three men came and started yelling at him to move the bus. Our bus driver let him know that he had been asked to move to different spots by multiple people since he arrived, and asked them to get on the same page. More valet men appeared and started yelling at our bus driver to move. They were rude and it was unnecessary. We could hear them yelling at him from inside the bus. The valet worker proceeded to slam the bus door really hard and it splashed rain water on one of the girls. They continued to yell at our bus driver, and didn't even give him time to put on his seat belt. It was ridiculous and completely inappropriate. 

Overall, for the price we paid, the experience was not satisfactory. The room was nice, but the negative experiences we had here completely negated the positive.",7,2,0

The hotel room had a gorgeous view of the golf course. (Grass that green in Vegas? How?) We were on the 27th floor and were checked in by a very helpful and friendly staff member. The lobby was packed, but we never once felt rushed to be checked in. Even their bag check, which held onto our luggage after we had checked out and still had some time before our flight, was super friendly and helpful. We never once felt like we *had* to tip, but were rewarded with many thanks when we did. It does lose a bit, though, due to the dearth of connectivity options. Internet access? $14 a DAY! Come on - luxury hotel. Include these kind of things, it really goes a long way towards not making your customers feel nickel and dimed. 

Their restaurants are decent - we only tried a handful, but if you're on a budget, you might want to eat somewhere else. Only one of them is rated less than $$$$ for price. More details on the eateries in separate reviews.",1,2,1

There is a subtle floral fragrance that you are immediately captivated by at the front enternace when you are greeted by the source of the sent. Botanical gardens are all thru out the property! 

Children are kept to a minimum and required to be under control, which is a huge perk of the property. You can enjoy your experience without screaming untamed children. 

All resteraunts, including fine dining, have vegan options and menus. A MAJOR plus to the property. I only go to fine dining establishments here because of their accommodations. A must visit!",5,2,3

My new LV home. Having stayed there several times now since it's opening I can only say it has gone from Great to Unbelievable. While it is NOT the place to stay for everyone, it was never intended to be. It is ineed expensive, but, isn't luxury supposed to be? My rooms have always been clean & frankly the best size to price contrast on the Strip. The shower & oversized tubs are fantastic. If staying in a Fairway Villa, the soaking tub is out of this world. I love the flat screen TV in view from the tub. The bedding is the best I've encountered. Soft, subtle and simply like sleeping on a cloud. Do use your latch & Privacy Tag unless you want house keeping coming in bright & early. Also, Don't play with the mini-bar. As is becoming regular in Vegas, the mini-bar is WEIGHT sensitive. To anyone complaining of being charged erroniously by it, don't play with food you aren't going to eat, especially for the 2 minute lag it has. The in room fax machine has come in handy on more than one occassion. The pool & cabanas are nice. Some of the lounge areas pool side can be a little bit cramped, but, there are many open areas to be had. One just needs to walk to them. The service pool side is regularly top quality. The food, again, is spendy, but, wonderful. I fell in love with the Chocolate shop in the Wynn Collection. The shopping is evil, though they make my credit card providers happy. With designers like Brioni you know this isn't a typical place to bring the family shopping. Now for the reason we goto Vegas.....the Casino. It is indeed a casino. A nice one with good minimum & limit amounts. Some dislike that most tables are $25 min. bets. I like it. It sometimes keeps them less crowded than other casinos. This leads me to my only true complaint: Gawkers. While Vegas is becoming more a tourist destination than a gaming destination it is bringing more and more people there who spend too much time wandering & staring than eating & playing. I only wished there were less people bumping into each other & more people there who were doing something other than sight seeing & price gawking. I loved the gaurds checking room keys at the elevators, it made for a comfortable elevator ride. I found the staff to be very helpful. While there was a few times the computer had issues during my stays (Early on), everyone was taking it in stride; Some self-important guests aside. I found check-in\/out to be painless. The Concierge team has always come through for me, even last minute. The ony time I saw someone be treated less than five star is when they began treating a staff member like the janitor at a roadside motel; You can't buy class. I read of one reviewer feeling that other dressier patrons were catered to more than he. Well, Good. This is not a place to wear cut-offs & a TShirt to a five star dinner. I stated that this hotel isn't for everyone & I firmly feel that way. That is why many like it, simply, we can be around other like minded people. The bottom line is that Wynn is expensive, but, it delivers.",2,0,0

that day or lose our rooms. Danny Min was the manager who basically was handling this situation and in my opinion not very effectively. In the end I called my husband who was in Orange County, CA (we live in Camarillo) and used his credit card.  Danny Min claimed that the Wynn's policy is to require the prepaid card be presented at check-in. That doesn't even remotely make sense .

that the customer service is a deal breaker for me given 
that we always have stayed at the Venetian or Palazzo in the past.  Also beware of the $150 a day per room charge for contingency charges. This is not a ""pending""

Pros:
Great room, great service in the tower suites area. SW is also nice.
Casino is great, much better than other places. There are actually some good pay slot machines here and there. 
It is located at the edge of the strip, so it is not too busy and not too quiet.
I mean, Wynn and Encore simply looks much better than any other hotel.

Cons:
Service outside tower suites area is just average. You get rude service now and then, It's is more like the service you get in best western, not a five-star hotel. Probably because I don't dress up normally... You always get better service when you dress up, oh, people...

Room is not that clean, carpet has stains and bathroom floor has dirty spots.
The second morning, someone smoked in the non-smoking hallway (killer problem for me)

I don't like the fact that they replaced my 2 free buffet ticket with $50 credit (buffet are $50\/person).
They also replaced my $80 breakfast credit with just 2 entry and 2 beverage (worth only about $50)
Pool are closed and they also started charging the $35 resort fee for tower suites starting October.

The buffet is pretty bad, crabs are not fresh, rib eye is soo dry that it feels like chewing rubber. Service is also not even close to places like SW, it feels more like service you get in $15 buffet. Again, not a five-star hotel service",4,1,1

Through Amex, the rate was $760 on a weekend night versus $1000 through the hotel.  

The minute you walk into the lobby of the south tower it transports you back to the Four Seasons George V in Paris. Steve Wynn knows how to roll.

I came here years ago to see Avenue Q, then back for Le Reve, returned to stay here when in town for the Rock N Roll marathon a couple years ago and most recently this weekend to get out of town. The Venetian and Bellagio used to be my go-to hotels, but it feels like I may have jumped ship to the Wynn. 

This hotel is lovely, the people are lovely, the crowd is nice- you don't get the random questionable riff raff you get at some of the other non tolerable casino\/hotels on the strip, the casino is great. I'm loving the electronic Roulette machine. 

We've stayed here on two separate visits and both times have been great experiences. Our room is always extremely comfortable and welcoming. I love the TV's in the bathroom, the products are high quality, water pressure is perfection, the bed is super luxurious, sofa is great - absolutely no complaints.

I will say, with the Venetian I often feel there is a bit more at my finger tips (dining, shopping, etc.) than the Wynn, but this is still an Excellent choice! 

We have had the buffet before and missed dining at Andrea's this go around due to timing with our show but will definitely return soon and experience more of their dining options.

The hotel itself wasnt too crowded for holiday season. Check-in was smooth and painless. I was able to check-in at 9AM, even though the listed time is 3PM. Very convenient!

I stayed in a Deluxe Panoramic View room on the ""59th"" floor. Really I think its the 49th since the elevator skips 10 floor numbers. Not sure whats going on there. The rooms are pretty nice and definitely have a luxurious feel. The decor was okay, not really my style. No complaints at all about the room. The room controls are actually pretty cool. Make you you press ""ALL ON"" when you walk into the room. Most reno's on the strip are adding those features.

The Terrace Pointe Cafe at the Wynn is pretty good. The Sangria was reasonably priced and delicious.The Mahi Mahi Tacos were awesome! Not too filling which was good since we were hitting the buffet later on.

The Wynn Buffet is one of the best on the strip. I still think the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort Spa Casino in Henderson beats the Wynn's buffet hands down (and its cheaper). Check it out.

The 24-hour cafe is way overpriced. I got a Turkey\/Brie sandwich for $10.50 which was smaller than a Subway 6"". I'm glad it was on the Wynn's tab.

My group showed up to Blush lounge a little late (11, 11:30) and they tried to charge us full price ($30 guys, $20 girls) as hotel guests. Shady..no thanks. We took off and went to club Moon at the Palms and had an great time!

So, like a smart budgetnista I signed up for Wynn deals via email.  And BAM the deal of a lifetime came.  Well not so much of a lifetime, but you get my point.  I digress, so going to the Wynn you can't wait to check in.  Its a Status thing.  Here I am decked out at the check-in desk.  Normally I show up in a sundress and sandals.  Long story short we get our room key.

The Wynn has the most lively colors and fresh flower displays anywhere bar-none. The Elevator bouncer greeted us, checked our room key and said ""Have a pleasant stay Ms. Sanders"".  I was feeling special.. Note: I never had to show my room key again, he remembered me AND my name.  Now that's service.

Even the elevator was smooth.  Have you ever been on a janky elevator where you knew any moment the elevator was gonna plummet to the ground?  Well not here lol.

The Room was amazing.  59th floor, picture window, the most amazing bed.  Even better then the beds at the W.  For an hour I was in the bathroom trying to get ready.  Why you ask?  Because that damn TV had me distracted.  I couldn't leave... captivating programming in the tub!

Room service was.... expensive ($90 for breakfast), but when you are on vacation....vacation.  I got Watermelon Juice (my apologies to the black race).

Let me just say that I've only been to Vegas about four times and each time I've stayed in a different hotel - Caesars, Mandalay Bay, the Aria and the Wynn. The Wynn by far is my favorite of the for! 

While the others staying with me wanted to spend their time gallivanting around the Strip, I decided that since we were putting the money into our stay at the Wynn that I'd get everything I could out of it.

From dining (everything from the Maine Lobster Risotto at Sinatra's, calamari at Stratta, Crab Fried Rice at Lakeside and Vegetarian friendly Wynn burger available all over for casual dining) to entertainment (La Reve was out of this world!) and from the fitness room (so bright and energizing) to the room amenities (enjoyed a nice soak in the tub while watching TV and the wireless is included in the resort fee for last minute work projects) - the place is fantastic. 

I made an entire day alone of just shopping in some fantastic upscale boutiques located right in the resort and nearly caved and bought a pair of Manolos just because the sales girl was so wonderfully sweet and they were on sale!

The people there are very friendly and accommodating as well. If I go back to Vegas soon, you bet I'm going to splurge for a stay here again unless I try some place new like the Cosmopolitan. 

If I do stay there again I want to go without family and sample the night life a bit more. But the casino was also great and not at all too smokey or dark (as was my experience at the Rio and Aria).

First, I don't know how they got my information, and secondly, their deals aren't usually that great. For whatever reason, I decided to really look into one of the letters I got and it turned out to be a GREAT deal. We got Fri\/Sat night rooms, 2 Le Reve tickets, and 2 Buffet tickets (anytime) for a really low cost. I was surprised it turned out to be legit.

Checking in on Friday was a nightmare. We were early and a tour bus just dropped off a ton of people. Luckily the management really knows how to crowd control and continuously passed out bottled of water to us. We were able to get a corner room with an awesome view of the golf course but the room felt a bit off to me. There was so much space and very little furniture. I guess I shouldn't complain because MGM rooms are the complete opposite. The bathroom was sizeable and everything was top quality. Although I just remembered, we decided to upgrade to 2 fulls for +$10 a day and the beds were SOOO SMALL. Should've just had a king and pull out couch or something.

The casino floor is easy to navigate and there are many food and night life (clubs and shows) options to choose from. It's a bit far from the main part of the strip but there's plenty to do in the surrounding areas. If they offered another deal like that I might just have to say yes again.

So, for Valentines Day this year, the favorite Yelper and I thought it would be nice to take a little weekend excursion to good old Sin City. Airfare is dirt cheap these days, and we also noticed some pretty sweet deals on Hotwire for hotels. One of the offerings was a Five Star resort right on the Strip, and we knew we couldn't pass it up.

We were ecstatic that the confirmation sheet declared Wynn Las Vegas as our destination! The favorite Yelper was already making plans for our wonderful weekend, and we were counting the days until our vacation.

So, about two weeks pass, when I receive an e-mail from Hotwire. ""We are sorry, the Wynn has been overbooked this weekend, and you have been reassigned to the Trump International."" Uhh... what? Overbooked? And it took two weeks to figure this out? After we had already made additional plans in and around the Wynn area?

To say the least, we were not happy Yelpers. I'm sure the Trump is a fine resort and all, but it is not what we were promised, and in addition, it has no casino, and is a bit farther away from the Strip. I made a quick call to Hotwire, and much to their credit, they were willing to compensate one full night if we decided to stay, or even give us a full refund, something they NEVER do. Something must have been up.

Speculation was abound. I even located internet forum threads documenting similar cases. As much as Wynn would like to deny it, this is certainly NOT an isolated incident. Was it that we poor Hotwire chumps were merely placeholders until some classier folks willing to pay full price stepped in to take our spot? Who is really to blame for the snafu? Wynn or Hotwire?

And today, I noticed this in the news:
""Wynn 'walks' 300 paid Hotwire customers""
http:\/\/blogs.usatoday.com\/hotelhotsheet\/2009\/02\/wynn-walks-300.html

So, apparently, this whole thing involves that Wells Fargo fiasco, which is causing headlines amidst the current economic crisis. If it was them who bumped us in the first place, and now that the whole deal has been called off, I wonder what will happen to those rooms now? Put back on Hotwire?

In the whole scheme of things, I'm glad we found this out about Mr. Wynn and his shady business practices. Now I know never to patronize his casinos ever again (and encourage others not to as well). Even if the management did offer us our original rooms back, all they will get is a nice view of my backside.

So, I guess us 300 will march on over to the Hot Gates of the Trump International, battered, but certainly not beaten from our battle with the evil tyrant. All I have left to say is...

""Mr.Wynn... YOU'RE FIRED!!!",28,21,18

You can tell the aspects Steve learned from after the Bellagio: there's a waterfall\/water show, but you can't see it unless you're inside the property.  Restaurants offer outdoor seating.  The club scene is as good as it gets, if that's your thing.  There is the small conservatory section, but it's between the taxi entrance and the casino (not off to the side).  There must have been some psychological research to show that people prefer the Wynn's red color scheme to the Bellagio's yellow.  Le Reve's theater is very intimate, and every seat in the house is close to the action.    

With that said, if you're deciding between the Wynn and the Encore:

Encore is quieter, and I like the rooms more... but, it's also farther away from everything.  Wouldn't think the extra nudge north would matter, but those extra steps add up if\/when you explore The Strip.  

The Wynn is livelier, but some aspects of it are borderline (sometimes over that border) gaudy.  They have significantly more tables than the boutique Encore, so I usually find myself gambling at the Wynn if I'm staying at either.",0,1,0

My worries were quickly laid to rest. We got an excellent room on the 60th floor which was the highest floor on the non-Tower section. The staff was very friendly. I wasn't charged anything extra, although I did not mention kids. I did ask them if I could get a room with 2 Queen beds and they switched it without any issues.

Another thing I had read was that Wynn did not allow strollers, but I did have any problem using one for our toddler. The staff would check room cards when going towards the Resort elevators but would always do it with a smile and would joke with my 10 year old.

The rooms have a decent amount of automation which my kids loved. The swimming pool was open in early February and was heated.

I'm not a gambler, am allergic to cigarette smoke, don't drink  and really only visit Sin City for work purposes. I'm not a happy person when I have to visit this place. However, staying at the Wynn I had plenty to do and experience outside of the normal Vegas activities.

The pool area is fantastic. Clean and the DJ is jamming all day. Snacks and food is available poolside. 

My room had a gorgeous view of the golf course with floor to ceiling windows. Everything is automated in the room. Front the drapes to lighting. The bathroom is a woman's dream. Spacious and perfect lighting to put on my make up. And I watched tv while getting ready. 

The gym has a ton of machines. I woke up every morning around 6 am to work out and never waited for a cardio machine or the weights. But it could be the $15 usage fee that no one wants to pay. Frees up machines quickly. 

I didn't visit the buffets or restaurants as my company had everything catered while I was there. However, my compliments to the chef. Making edible food in mass quantities is not an easy feat.

The staff are always friendly - never have I had a bad customer service experience at any of the hotels, shops, restaurants, etc. I stay in the Tower Suites where there is a private VIP pool, VIP lounge, and concierge. 

There are several guards and security personnel around the property. They will remove anyone who is disruptive, which is really nice. They want the hotel to offer luxury and have a certain level of class. If you want to be really rowdy and inappropriate, this hotel is probably not for you. 

It has the best clubs in all of Vegas - on both the Wynn and Encore side. The restaurants are all amazing - my favorite for breakfast is either Tableau or the Terrace cafe. For a quick lunch, I favor Red8. Dinner at Sinatra's on the Encore side is another favorite, along with SW. But, like I said before, ALL of the restaurants are amazing!

I love to get room service when I come to the Wynn, too. I've never had to wait more than 30 minutes for my food and they always accommodate my every request. 

The rooms are VERY clean, and the housekeeping spends a good amount of time cleaning your room. In the evening, they offer turndown service where they will place slippers on the floor next to your bed, dim the lights, and have soft music playing. 

If you make a habit of coming here often (I usually come twice a year), the guards and staff will remember you and make you feel at home.

being a 5 star hotel you would think they would have better way to verify if the car was mine or not. Check the cameras and see who dropped off the car.

The decor is stunning.  I can't believe the floral action they have going on in there.  It's kind of French and Asian at the same time, I don't know.  Vegas-y.  

We are chatty people and when checking in we were telling the gal our sob story of how we already had to buy 4 tires on the way into town...boyfriends daughter driving on bald tires, she goes to UNLV so our Vegas trips involve making sure she's got her act together as well.  Soooo the front desk upgraded us to a better room, higher floor, better view.  NICE!!!

The room was wonderful, except we had a direct view of Trump Tower.  That part was lame.  LOL

Motorized Draperies?  HELL YES.  Thank you Wynn!  I design custom window treatments so maybe I appreciate that more than the average joe, but they were pretty sick.  Very lavish.

DO NOT TOUCH anything in the mini bar or display area...if you move it for 30 seconds, you just bought it.  

We went to the pool both Friday and Saturday.  Drinks are tasty and stiff, and expensive.  But that's typical.  Bar staff was friendly.  We saw a girl that seemed to be lost, trying to find the ""adult pool"" walking around drunk in the regular pool, topless.  Good times.  Oh Vegas, you can't just leave people alone can you? Gotta get 'em all cray cray?  

The staff we encountered anywhere, was courteous and helpful. I have literally nothing bad to say about this place.  We ate all of our meals in the hotel, we actually never left aside from a brief visit to Encore (which we took a taxi too, no one told us we could walk there through the hotel...I am sure the taxi driver thought that was pretty awesome, to drive us around a corner).

They are hurting for business bigtime because they recently introduced a resort fee that is charged per night of stay.  They want to charge me to use the pool and WIFI?  LMAO!!!  

What is the all the hype about this casino?  The food sucks.  The casino games are the same games found in any casino.  Do you guys really get excited by the architecture of the building?  Do you enjoy standing in a line of 100 people to get into a nightclub?  Do you guys enjoy being packed in a nightclub like a bunch of canned sardines?  

If you are not getting your rooms comped, save your money and stay at a place like Treasure Island.   

I am convinced that people stay here just to brag to their friends that they stayed at the Wynn.  Same type of suckers who go to those high end restaurants like that pathetic restaurant carnevino at Palazzo.  They just want to take pictures and upload it to their twitter\/facebook and try to rub it in their friend's faces.  I get comped to eat these places and I never do.  The food sucks.  I prefer the food court on the casino floor at the Venetian.  Believe me, the cheeseburger or philly cheesesteak at the food court tastes better than anything that carnevino can produce.

As much as we enjoyed hotel and casino at the Wynn, we did not like the pool side action.

This place is still a 5-star resort, but my experience was not so great this time.

1. PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK THE BILLS YOU GET FROM THE CASHIER
- They handed a fake $100 bill.  It felt strange in the hand so I put it to the light and could not find a strip or any signs of a valid $100 bill.  None of the slot machines accepted it either.  Upon bringing this up, the cashier changed it right away.

2. DON'T EXPECT TO WIN HERE
The toll on the shareholders is starting to squeeze the players.
This casino has really tightened up.
Craps only allow 2x odds now.  Yes.  $10 limit, double odds.  If you want the usual 3-4-5x, you need to go to a $50 limit craps table.  Craps players know how much of a disadvantage this is for the players that only play pass - come - max odds
The slot machines just weren't paying out at all.  I usually get a few machines to pay out, but I couldn't believe how tight these machines were.  I walked around and usually you'll see a few people hitting something big, but this time I saw nobody.  Just quiet slots with an occasional small win sound.

3. Had to wait 30 minutes for checkin
- The key printing machine had an issue which resulted in everyone waiting in front of the hotel clerk for 30 minutes.  It was 30 minute of ""It should be very soon"" ""this never happened before""

4. THE SNACKS IN THE FOOD WERE EATEN ON ARRIVAL
- Yes, check your snacks.  The boxes were open and eaten without it being removed from the tray.  This is not what you'd expect in a 5-star hotel you pay premium for.

5. MAKE SURE YOUR DOOR IS ALWAYS CLOSED \/ Deadbolted
- A friend once told me someone came in at night and took his money.  According to the front desk, the door was not closed all the way.

Other than those issues, it's a great resort.  One of the nicest on the strip.

Very similar to time share sales technique. To many questions. After checking in, the rooms are great, however do not touch any beverages in your room, for they will try to charge you. Almost idiotic that they do not put a small coffee machine in each room. Cup of coffee downstairs is about $ 5, so I guess they love the cash flow  Most people pay for the coffee but on the line they are complaining about the cheapness of this tactic. When gambling at the tables it takes awhile to get offered a drink. the old Vegas is dead here, for at the bar counter machine playing Deuces wild , they do not comp drinks.The new blackjack at the Wynn only pays 6 to 5 at blackjack unless you are playing $100 a hand you can find a table withe the old rules. So in reality they have changed the rules of blackjack where the dealer no longer hits  on 16 but on a soft 17. Play blackjack elsewhere.  They want people who are not aware of the rules of blackjack and of course they want high rollers. Their baccarat area looks empty most of the day until they get a few high rollers. the Sports book is nice but they have small screens for baseball and football and use the large screens for horse racing. takes about half an hour to find a waitress after making a sports bet. You may wait 45 minutes to get a beer. so you get a free drink ticket but the wait is a iong time. Nice deli but cost $ 25 dollars for a turkey sandwich and beverage and tip. Do not eat at their restaurants for they are overpriced. Sinatra's was overpriced and for a New Yorker had average food. Cute though . The design of the place was great. Another insulting tactic used by most resorts In Vegas is to charge a room rate and then a daily  fee of $ 35 dollars to use the pool. with tax and fee add $ 50 a day to your bill. I would prefer these additions to be advertised into the booking price when you make a reservation. Almost a con job.  For coffee and drinks add $30 more per person.

Unfortunately, we were absolutely floored by the behavior of one of the dealers on the casino floor who effectively ruined our stay at the Wynn.  We go to Vegas frequently, up to a few times a year, and my wife and I enjoy playing craps, betting in the sports book, and burning money playing slot machines.  On our second day we decided to go down to the casino floor to play the table games, and one craps dealer offended us so deeply, we avoided the tables in the Wynn like the plague so we didn't have to see her.  We played at one table in the Encore, but decided to not bet any more of our money at the hotel after that, and instead spent the rest of our gambling time\/money at an MGM property.

Here's what happened while I was playing craps.  I was at a table that had too few players, so I decided to move to another more lively table (I should note that the dealers at the first table were friendly... too bad that didn't carry over).  At the second table, I was positioned next to a female dealer from South Korea who seemed nice enough at first.  However, while we were playing, she was talking to a man from the Netherlands about how Americans don't travel, how there weren't any in Vegas even (which didn't make sense), how U.S. money is essentially worthless, and how America ""used"" to be a great country and basically how awful it is now.  At one point, I looked over at her in disgust to which she replied ""it's true!"" 

Regardless of what you think privately, it was a completely inappropriate conversation.  I don't go on vacation to spend my hard earned money at hotel to be insulted by its staff.  As I mentioned earlier, it was such an awful experience, that we actively avoided the tables at the Wynn because we would frequently see her there.  It got to the point where we just gave up and gambled elsewhere.  Had I not prepaid for the room, I would have checked out and gotten a room at an MGM property, or in the neighboring Palazzo.

I expect to find anti-Americanism abroad, but I didn't expect to find it here.  Furthermore, some of the comments were absurd.  The portion about U.S. currency, whatever.. Yeah the dollar's not exactly what it used to be, but it's what I get in my paycheck and it's what I'm spending at your hotel\/casino, and I would have spent\/gambled a whole hell of a lot more, so save it.  There were no Americans in Vegas?  I'm not sure what that was about.  Americans don't travel?  I travel... A lot.  Germany, Egypt, and the UK just in the past few months.  America used to be a great country?  Again, keep your opinions to yourself.  I'm not staying and gambling in this casino to hear you go on about your personal political beliefs... Furthermore, I don't expect many of your AMERICAN (remember, your hotel and casino are in AMERICA financed with AMERICAN dollars built with AMERICAN hands and frequented by AMERICANS) guests would appreciate this line of conversation.  But maybe Steve Wynn and Wynn Resorts doesn't want American guests and wants to market their properties solely to foreigners. 

I told a hotel employee all about this when I checked out, and she seemed apologetic, but in being an average customer, I doubt I'll even receive an email follow-up about my experience.  Needless to say, this incident so soured my experience, that I will be staying elsewhere on the next trip to Vegas.",15,8,5

Really, really nice and was able to accommodate four girls getting ready. That says a lot!

The hotel is quite nice, the pool area is pretty cool as well. A few things bugged me though, one being that a restaurant by the pool would not let my friend dine in a Missoni bathing suit cover. It was sort of see-through but nonetheless was not inappropriate. It was kind of annoying that they would not just let it slide. However, to an extent, I understand because then a lot of people in far more distasteful swim-attire would complain as well.

While XS, the famed nightclub, is right there. The hotel itself does not necessarily exude the most ""party party"" atmosphere.

At this particular dealership I was the hostess that greeted customers who came in looking to buy a car.  I learned very quickly that the most wealthiest consumers weren't the ones that looked the ""part"".  

Every single customer was greeted by me in the same respectful manner.  Yes we had a few that came in and based on their occupation (hair dresser at like a Super Cuts) most likely would not be buying a car that day-but the salesman still took him on a test drive and treated him like the ball players and local celebrities that came in on a regular basis.

I recall those days when I'm out luxury ""shopping"" or more like luxury ""looking"" and I always admire a respectful salesman that treats me well when I walk into their store.  

I found a lot of those wonderful salespeople at The Esplanade shops located inside the Wynn.  Sixteen stores of luxury to be only appreciated by those who can afford ultra high-end designer wares or those like me who walk in and admire each piece as if it were a work of art in a museum.

I was here for brunch after picking up my sister from the airport and we fell upon this lavish row of luxury.  My sister saw the Christian Dior store and wanted to see the new Diorissimo bag (this happened several times on this trip).  We were treated very very well by a salesman and shown the blue calfskin bag with all its fabulousness.

Then we walked across into Chanel where we fell in love with all the classic accessories.  Sales crew was also very friendly and this store offered shoes, makeup and clothes.  Louis Vuitton was a little more frosty which is ironic since I've actually spent money on a few bags here!

I didn't have time to go through all the stores but next time I'm here I would love to peruse more of them. 

A few stores that I saw include Chopard, Dior Homme,  Chloe, Cartier, Oscar de la Renta, Alexander McQueen, Hermes, Manolo Blahnik, Rolex, Graff Diamonds and Brioni.  Don't miss it!",28,21,28

Ambiance: what is not to love about the Wynn. From the decor to the shops, it's all beautifully done.

Review #15:
cha-ching is not the sound of slot machines, it's the sound of how much money you can spend here!; The Wynn is ultra-fabulous and high end; the first thing you see coming from the parking garage is the Ferrari dealer\/store; the shopping corridor is a who's who of high-end name brands (with very few shoppers inside); the restaurants are all beautiful and make you stop and gaze; the only good moderately-priced eating spot appears to be Zoozacrackers deli; the sports book is big & classy; you can hear a pin drop in the large poker room; beautiful outdoor grounds with a huge lagoon and lots of waterfalls; this includes some weird-ass performance deals at night - I saw a giant mechanical frog singing a country song over the waterfall (at least I think I saw this - I had been drinking); there is also a huge & classy wing of ballrooms & meeting rooms; best craft beer bet = it's surprisingly pretty lousy (I guess rich people drink crappy beer), but the bar next to the sports book has a few good selections in bottles only",2,2,0

My best memory strangely enough is  watching the cleaning staff up on the bamboo ceiling and wiping it clean. Today upon leaving I was reminded of that when I saw a staff member cleaning the top of the perfume store ceiling. The cleanliness of Mr Wynn's resorts are beyond compare and the feeling of calm and relaxation are only apparent in his resorts!  The food at the buffet FABULOUS!   The decor and atmosphere were great.  As a special treat for my father we took him to Sinatra as he is a big fan!
Our waitress was delightful bringing us books and pictures to look at of Mr. Sinatra  the food again FABULOUS!  This was probably the most expensive dinner I have ever had but worth every penny Thank you!
I think my most favorite thing, there are so many is the bed.  I do plan on buying some of the bedding.  What luxury!!!!!!!! Even though going to bed late every night falling into a cloud of pure delight and drifting off to sleep and waking so rested we were able to enjoy everyday to the fullest.
The room so clean and fresh. The furniture beautiful and comfortable. Loved the auto curtains. We had a  refrigerator for my husbands medicine within minutes of our arrival. Thank you! 
I enjoyed all the fresh flower arrangements around the Hotel as I am a professional florist in the Bay Area of California. Beautifully done and wished I could work for Mr. Wynn in such a lovely place.
I am also a mosaic artist and was so very impressed with all the mosaic art in the floors and walls of the cafe. Beautiful.
I especially want to Thank Mr. Wynn and the staff of the Wynn for the fantastic offer we received to stay there.    It gave us one of the best experiences ever at a beautiful hotel and will tell all our friends and my customers who are looking for honeymoon ideas about the AWESOME week at the Wynn.",1,0,1

Most of the food was fish and the fish was some of the worst I have had. I took one bite of the salmon and it was soo fishy tasting I couldn't eat any more fish for the night.

The room next to us had their tv on very loud and we could hear everything they were watching from gunshots fired to informercials. We finally fell asleep around 2am and to only wake up to more tv noise at 7am again!!! 

Don't people have better things to do than watching informercials in Vegas? 

We asked to switch rooms next day and had similar noise issues. This time was the  house keeping staff were vacuuming early in the morning. Please, let us sleep in...its Vegas!!

For a Vegas hotel, it is soothing, the air is fairly smoke-free and the views from the large windows facing the golf course in the Wynn tower are gorgeous.  

The rooms are beautiful and elegant with high quality bedding and an amazing bathroom.  The shower and large tub are like having an in room spa.  The separate water closet also adds to the elegance.

The pool is perfectly heated and well staffed.  

Short comings:
1) Breakfast room service said it would be 40 minutes and it arrived after 1.5 hours on a day my boyfriend was speaking at the CES conference and it threw off the entire schedule.  If room service had said that it would take an hour and a half, at least we could have worked around it.  I called over 4-5 fives times and they kept saying it was just about here but it wasn't.  They took off the $5 delivery fee.

2) We had used all our towels the evening before and needed towels for the morning.  I called housekeeping at 8 am and they said they'd be right up.  Over 2 hours later with no towels, I called again and housekeeping had no idea that I had even called.  Housekeeping sounded out of it.  Running out of time, I called the front desk to speak to a manager and ended up propping the door open with the pile of used towels and running down the hall in my robe to find a housekeeper who generously gave me the needed towels.  Just as we were climbing into the shower, housekeeping showed up with more towels.

3) I decided this could all be avoided if we had had turn down service where they refresh towels.  So, on day 2 I called at 8:00am to request turn down service that evening and they said we were all set.  I called again at 5:00pm to confirm that we were all set and they said they had us down.  We got back to the room at 9:40pm - I was looking forward to the neat room and chocolates on the bed...and the room was just as we left it with NO turn down service.  I called housekeeping and they said they had no record of our request.  They seem apathetic.  Either understaffed, under-supported with technology or they don't care.  I called the general manager for a second time that day and they showed up within 10 minutes.  The manager also helped us get into a restaurant out of courtesy for the delays.

Conclusion:  For a place that puts this much effort into beauty and service and charges $9 for a water, I expect them to keep their agreements and follow through on what they say and offer.  As I said before, it is the one hotel I feel is good for someone like me who neither smokes nor gambles and is fairly quiet, but their room service and housekeeping get a B and C- respectively.  Food and everything else is an A.

Small improvement:  The pool is amazing and you can wear your robe down over your bathing suit.  Like many, I am going to rinse off and change into other clothes before heading back to my room versus walking back up in a wet bathing suit with my robe over it.  The tiny women's changing room is really lacking.  It has about 6 bathrooms with one handicap shower.  There was no wall unit with soap, shampoo or conditioner in the shower to get chlorine out of hair.  There were no towels in the locker room to dry off after the shower.  No bags for wet swimsuits (I had to wrap mine in paper towels) and no blow dryer.  It really was just a bathroom with a shower.  Women like to feel pampered and this did not do it.  I'd have been happy with some shampoo and conditioner and plastic bags.  

But, the view.  We were on the 57th floor and the great view and elegant feel is worth coming back for.",0,1,0

Had they told us all these stipulations, we would have gladly booked elsewhere. The customer service was beyond subpar EVERYWHERE (except for the pool and le reve). Tryst bartenders are rude and act like they hate their job. The red card station attendants are the exact same way. The room service food is AWFUL I've had better at Luxor.

Although the check in line was long, almost each station was manned and they are very pleasant. Check in was a breeze. It was a comp stay, but they require a $150 per night credit card security deposit. One may think that is pretty steep but I say that is about right for the type of technology and amenities provided in the guest rooms. Your room key serves dual purpose as your Red players card which is convenient and signing up is as simple as providing the front desk agent with your ID.

The room was easy to find and from the moment I entered the room I was wowed. I am not easily impressed when it comes to hotel rooms, but this left me in awe. The first thing I noticed were that the lighting and curtains were all electronic. I had a blast opening and closing and stopping the sheer and blackout curtains. I was impressed with the bathroom as well. His & hers sinks with a vanity in the middle, bathtub and separate shower, and even a mounted mini tv! In the bedroom there is an iHome to connect your iPod, a large flatscreen mounted with a minibar area and stocked refrigerator. The desk area had a fax machine! The room has a lot of space and I feel the bedding could have fit 2 queens rather than 2 doubles. We had a lovely view of the pool, golf course and Encore.

The casino was very nice as well. A lot of slot and table options. They must have little elfs throughout the casino because I have never seen the chairs being straightened out so fast before. I leave a machine for a minute and the chair is already pushed in. Way to keep on top of it! This is also the only casino I have been to on this trip where the workers were on it about asking you if you had a Red card. They want you to sign up so they can track your activity and the Wynn was on it in that aspect too!

There are a lot of high end shops that made me feel like a high roller going in and trying out shoes and handbags. I love the red and butterfly theme throughout. I liked the  convenience of being connected to the Encore on one side and the bridge that leads to the Venetian on the other.

im no expert (well, actually i am), but to have a 5 star 5 diamond rating there has to be turndown service every night and they must offer to fill your ice bucket -- both of which were missed on our first night stay.

aside from that, i was pretty pleased with the wynn. could they have used a VIP area with refreshments similar to that of the Bellagio? yes...but the private pool partially makes up for that.

i stayed in the premier suite or something like that, complete with a his and a hers bathroom, the most comfortable bed in the world, and ceiling to floor windows of the golf course. 900 square feet!!! i think thats larger than my apartment in nyc.

overall, its a really well designed property on the north end of the strip so it isnt as hectic as if you stayed at say, the mirage. oh, and holla at shante (spelling?) who works the hertz car rental desk!",0,0,0

The best beds I have ever slept on, hands down. You can buy them for around $3000, worth every penny. This is pretty far from where we like to be on the strip (New York, New York is our spot to gamble) but it was worth the walk. Lobbies are all fantastic, rooms are super nice. When gambling on the floor we were drinking Grey Goose, not the cheap stuff that other casinos bring you. Only complaint I have is that the rooms facing the strip are loud almost all night. I know Vegas is loud, but for $250 a night on a corporate discounted rate I expect a certain level of quiet. We would stay here again if for nothing else the beds.",2,0,0

Long time employees are no longer there and the replacements don't have the dedication to service that the others did.

Everyone is very courteous and takes the time to answer any questions you have...even when they may be rushing off elsewhere to help someone else.
We had a standard room...but it was nothing close to 'standard'. Double sink bathroom, with an oversized shower, tv, huge tub..you will not be disappointed.

The automatic curtains were a great addition on the floor to ceiling windows....i wont say more about this because you will want to experience this treat for yourself:)
 The food-delish!!!! I will be writing a separate review of the restaurants, but really quick, food is YUM. You will want to go back for your fav dishes again and again. (The bbq chicken salad at Zoozacrackers was my fav)
On my last vegas trip I saw the wynn show, la reve, spectacular. Definitely the one i would recommend if you are deciding on one must-see show.
The spa at the wynn was incredible! Pricey for sure, but worth it! My advice, if you are looking to get two or more services, have them done on different days. Every time you book a service you get a day pass for the spa.

Our card had a block on it because of new charges when travelling for security purposes which we were not aware of, and instead of waiting until the next morning when we check out to settle the situation policy is to lock you out of your room with all your belonging inside. After speaking with reception manager Winnie thinking she would realize that the evening of our wedding anniversary 1am is not the best moment to run around to ATMs to withdraw money to pre-pay our charges before our check out.

The casino has its elegant look compare to other hotels. Casino staff as well as restaurant staff are very friendly and helpful. The room is very spacious. The sheets and beddings are soft and smooth to touch. The bathroom is also as spacious and it has a separate shower and tub and a separate toilet. Room service exceeds expectation. They even laid our personal toiletries on a towel which makes the counter sink clean and neat. 

The Buffet has great selection of food, not to mention buckets of crab legs (that you kind of have to fall in line for - but it's worth it) . Their steak is very tender and is well complimented with the quite salty string beans. And my favorite is their dessert bar!!! They have quite a variety of good sweets from cupcakes, chocolate coated marshmallows, chocolate coated strawberries, chocolate coated red apples, gelato, cakes, and those sweets in plastic shot glasses (I don't know what they're called but they're yummy - they have variety of flavors including lemon meringue, strawberry jam, custard, etc). Oh, and they also have creme brule which is my most favorite in the dessert bar. We went around 3pm and it was only $25. All worth it!

We stayed here for 4 days\/3 nights (03.28-03.31) for $120 a night. It was very convenient for us because most of our activities were held in the hotel. We went to XS for the first night then we watched La Reve for the second night (which I definitely recommend watching - it's a MUST see!). XS was awesome. We were able to skip the lines for buying our tickets early at the hotel's concierge (+++). Although, it was playing house music at first which refrain us from dancing but when the DJ started playing Jennifer's ""On the floor"" the dance floor was filled in a matter of a second. The club was very elegant. Too bad they didn't open the pool side. It would have been cool to be able to hang out by the pool after hours of dancing on heels.

The only two things I did not like is that it does not have free wifi. You have to pay (I think) $14 to be able to use their wifi in your hotel room. There is also a fee to use their gym for guests of guests (or non-registered guests which I guess is fair enough). BUT their European pool is way awesome!!! They have a pool side that is for adults only. And the jacuzzi, I love it!

I would definitely love to stay in this hotel again. Although, I'd also like to try other hotels as well. :)",1,1,0

I recently stayed here on a business trip and the half star would only be because they did not warn on the pre-authorization form that I would have to pay $150 a night for incidentals.  I thought the whole purpose of the pre-authorization form was so that all charges would go on the company card that I did not have in my hands.

But I have to first say - this is a HUGE step up from the Rio last year. The staff were all very friendly, the rooms were incredibly nice, and there are so many restaurants, bars, clubs, etc that I never had to leave the casino. 

For the conference that was also held in the hotel, they offered quite the extensive coffee\/tea bar for free that was much appreciated for late nights and early mornings that come with a conference.

The bathtubs are awesome - really big - and the flat screen in the bathroom makes for a perfect relaxing last night for a bubble bath, movie and glass of red wine :)

Over the last few years, I have averaged over 150 nights per year in hotels, and The Wynn is at the top of the list.  It blows away just about every hotel I've been to.  Just for comparison, here is a list of some of the nicest hotels I've stayed at:  The Beverly Hilton, The Palazzo, The Cosmopolitan, Aria, Four Seasons, suites at the W Austin and W Dallas, Hotel Adolphus, Magnolia, etc.  The Wynn is much better than all of these...

There are many reviewers who have done an excellent job with explaining why The Wynn is amazing, so I'll keep it short:   

Best features: 
- Elegant rooms with incredibly comfortable beds
- Large HD TV with just about every channel available in HD
- The best bathroom out of any hotel I've ever seen...fully equipped with a TV, the best bathroom products (they even offer free shoe polish), and the highest quality toilet paper...
- Great service (front desk, room service, etc)

Negatives: 
- The price - it's hard to get a room for below $200 a night.  On peak days, even a standard room is over $400.  At least internet is included with the $20 resort fee...

On top of having the greatest rooms, the Wynn property itself is my favorite.  I love the casino, the sports book, and the restaurants.  There are also a ton of shops.  Just be prepared to fork over a ton of cash, because everything is overpriced.  

Overall, I highly recommend The Wynn to just about anyone, especially couples looking for the perfect getaway in Vegas.  Enjoy!",5,0,3

Why?

1) Atmosphere is young & upbeat! So are the people.

2) Less trashy people due to higher prices. Great crowed in general.

3) Clean & less crowded casino - great music & better chances of winning!

4) CLEAN!  Everywhere you go smells good!

5) Less tacky! More modern, higher end design & classier over all.

6) Nice clean & maintained rooms

7) Less crowded.

8) Servers in casino are actually young, looks good, smiles at you, and wear barely nothing

9) Hotel staff is helpful.

10) Great SPA & Restaurants.

My other favorite hotels are Casar palace, Venetian & Bellagio.

I would prefer the Wynn over the Venetian because:
-The Venetian can get too crowded with curious tourists which is overwhelming.
- Staff in the casino are uptight, not welcoming & sometimes rude!

I would prefer the Wynn over the Caesar Palace because:
- Unless you stay at their new buildings, you could end up in one of their older suites which stinks!
- Casino is huge, dirty, smoky & average.
- It's easy to get lost, place is huge & overwhelming.
- It is insanely crowded with tourists who come to shop at the forum mall.

I would prefer the Wynn over the Bellagio because:
- The crowed at the Bellagio is way older, more snotty & can get pretentious. 
As a young guy, I never felt belong there & got  weired vibe at times, Although it is a good place to stay. SPA can be better.
- Not much to do beside watching the fountain, although you don't have to be a guest for that...

Yes the Wynn is at the outskirts of the strip but it is not that far at all.
Wear your nice clothes & have a walk on the strip or just drive wherever you need, you can valet for free in any hotel around.
That's what I do anywhere I stay.

Regarding Yasmin's 1 star review, I agree with her in general about her observation, yet wanna be's you have everywhere. including the venation, planet Hollywood etc..

When choosing a place to stay you gotta work with what you have, if the choice is between white trash ghetto 'look at me I'm 250 pounds & wearing barely nothing' hotels, pretensions 'Planet Hollywood' like hotels or some sober mellower hotels like the Wynn. Let it be the Wynn then! 

Wannabe's are a social problem in general, it is not the Wynn's problem.

I don't think I can ever stay at any other place in Las Vegas after spending a week here. As far as the hotel itself, the accommodations they have for their guest is amazing! Customer service was on it too.

My family, friends and I had a little trouble checking in and after a little miscommunication they accommodated us with an upgrade from a standard room to a suite at the Encore Tower. Originally we had reserved for a 3 day\/2night stay but extended our stay for the rest of the week (with no hassle\/problem at all).

Our suite was top of the line - our view overlooked  XS and the venues pool and further along parts of The Strip. Last but not least, the ambience and interior design was luxurious - from the set up of the bedroom and living room. In addition to that, they have mirrors all around the entire suite which we have benefited from so much during our stay (majority of us were girls so everyone had their space and we were almost always on time when it came to getting ready for our day\/night of events). 

As their guest, we were a very big group and we didn't have a problem when it came to having a place or spot to get our beauty sleep - beds are very large and comfortable, and their couch was also a pull out bed. They provided extra pillows and blankets in their closets. Never hesitate on calling the front desk\/room service - they were so generous when we requested for an extra pull out bed, a refrigerator and extra pillows & blankets.

Last but not least - ENCORE BEACH CLUB (EBC) and XS Night Swim (Summer experience). How can you say no to that?! It was such a great convenience to us just to take the elevator down and straight to the venue, (NO RUSH, NO LINE, NO COMMUTE). On top of that, Major Lazer was spinning the weekend I was there and Skrillex currently has residency on Monday's at XS. WIth a plug here and there (it's not very hard to find one in Vegas), my party and I were able to get free bottle service during our stay. The amount a typical person would spend on a room + having to get a taxi, Uber or Lyft to a hotel\/venue would be the same amount you would spend here with the luxury of staying at the Wynn\/Encore.

Our room was beautiful and had a great view.  Even the bedding felt great and luxurious.  I didn't want to get off my bed.  The bathroom was about the size of my master bedroom at home.  The swimming pools were so beautiful and not crowded at all.  We didn't have to fight for chairs like other cheap places I've been to such as Hard Rock or MGM Grand.
The hotel itself is top notch.  We didn't even have to leave the hotel.  The night club, shopping, buffet, and restaurants were all in one place.  We only left for other amusements that weren't offered at the Wynn.  It's one of the best hotels I've stayed in.",12,12,13

There are many irritating things, like you can't get from the pool area directly into the building and back to your room. You HAVE to go the long way through the shopping area! This gets old pretty quick and we agreed to not even look in any of the expensive shops. 

All the public areas surround the casino and the registration desk is always a mob scene. Nothing is designed for customer convenience; everything is done to make the hotel money. There is no way that this is a five star hotel, if only for the fact that the service is quite poor. This is a five star facility with two star service. 

I will say that the ice cream shop food was excellent and reasonably priced. The coffee shop by the casino was very good as well but was always mobbed! They want you to go to the sit down restaurant but who has time for that most days?

We looked around a lot while we were there for the builder's show, and agreed that next time we will stay at the Venetian. The shopping area is magnificent and has a lot of moderate food options,.",0,0,1

It's worth the splurge every now and then. If you're on a budget, join their Red Card membership and take advantage of their frequent specials. Weeknights are affordable. Weekends rates are definitely eye openers, if you're not a so called ""baller"", but if you book smart online it's attainable.

What do you say to convince people that this is one of the finest resort destinations in Las Vegas.
I got  a letter stating that the hotel was both luxurious and whimsical at the same time.
WHIMSICAL ????
I had to look up the meaning of whimsical just to know what they  were talking about.
The letter was on the money.... 
The entire hotel is full of light fanciful decorations, 
you act on a whim quite often in deciding your entertainment plans for the day and night.
Everywhere you look there is that little extra touch... 
I am sure that for most visitors that little extra goes unnoticed when you are astounded by the overall opulance of the hotal and casino.
Just the same - those touches are all over the hotel.
The employees speak to you, from the guy pushing the floor cleaner to the hostess in the lounges and restaurants.
It is amazingly a warm feeling generated throughout the hotel.
You simply enjoy your stay.
Great dining ....
Great shows ....

Je n'ai jamais vu un hôtel aussi beau, chaque centimètre a été décoré... Tout est dans le détail, c'est juste somptueux! Cet hôtel est digne d'un palace français.
Il est immense, des dédales de galeries avec des boutiques de très grand luxe(Chanel, Dior, Rolex...), beaucoup de restaurants excellents (mais cher!). Le casino est magnifique.
Pour accéder à l'ascenseur menant aux étages (où plutôt aux 7 ascenseurs), il faut montrer sa carte d'accès à la chambre.

Nous avons pris la chambre ""Deluxe panoramic view"" pour 3 nuits à la fin du mois de septembre et surtout en semaine (350 dollars la nuit). Un conseil, n'allez pas à Las Vegas le weekend, les chambres d'hôtels sont beaucoup plus chères que pendant la semaine.
La chambre était magnifique, très calme, au 34e étage. Elle était immense, le lit faisait 2 mètres de large avec un matelas (et un surmatelas) ultra confortable. Une vue imprenable sur le Strip. Rien de mieux que de profiter de cette vue avant de s'endormir et de pouvoir fermer les rideaux (électriques s'il vous plaît!) à distance sans se lever.
La déco des chambres est raffinée, pas rococo comme dans certains hôtels de la ville. Le raffinement lié à la technologie. Un grand écran plat est accroché au mur et peut se déplacer jusqu'en face du lit.
Sur la table de nuit, une base pour Iphone, la base quoi! Pratique pour recharger son téléphone.
Mais le plus hallucinant c'est la salle de bain. Elle doit faire la moitié de mon appartement! Il y a deux lavabos, un miroir qui prend tout le mur, une baignoire juste immense (rien de tel qu'un bon bain en amoureux) et une très grande douche à l'italienne.
Et attention, un écran plat face à la baignoire pour suivre ses séries préférées tout en se relaxant!
Les produits de toilette fournis dans la salle de bain sont terribles! Un odeur bien citronnée, on a envie de les manger. J'ai tout ramené en France tellement que ça sentait bon. Et puis les flacons sont énormes (75 ml) et chaque jour, les femmes de ménage remettent des produits neufs.
Ils ne sont pas avares en serviettes non plus! Il y en a bien plus que ce dont on a besoin. Il y a également des peignoirs. Le seul petit oubli dans tout ce luxe, les pantoufles... mais on les pardonne.
Il y a également des objets qu'on trouve rarement dans les hôtels mais qui sont bien pratiques en vacances : un sèche-cheveux professionnel pour les droguées du brushing comme moi (j'en ai marre des sèche-cheveux accrochés au mur sans embout et sans puissance!) et un pèse personne. Et oui, après 3 semaines de vacances, on sait jamais si on a fait des abus, enfin si, on sait très bien qu'on a fait des abus mais on ne connaît pas le verdict de la balance!
Il y a même un gros tabouret en cuir et un gros miroir sur pied grossissant et lumineux. En fait, c'est LA salle de bain idéale pour toutes les fi-filles.

Côté pratique, le parking souterrain de l'hôtel est immense et totalement gratuit, comme dans tous les hôtels du Strip. Tout le monde peut s'y garer gratuitement, même ceux qui n'ont pas de chambre. En fait, c'est surtout pour attirer les clients au casino.
En ce qui concerne la connexion wifi, elle est payante dans la chambre (et pas donnée) : 15 dollars par jour.
L'hôtel a également un théâtre circulaire où se produit la troupe du cirque du soleil avec leur spectacle ""le rêve"" : tout simplement sublime. J'avoue qu'en y allant, je ne pensais pas que ce serait aussi beau, j'ai été bluffée. Les places sont chères mais vraiment, ça vaut le coup.
En résumé, le Wynn est l'hôtel rêvé!!!",3,2,2

the hotel room keys have your names printed on them and the view from our room was spectacular.  super spacious room too, with a love seat, coffee table as well as a breakfast table.

service was very personable and if you pick up the phone to call the front desk, room service, spa, where ever... they call you by name too.

the pools were nice and enjoying a couple glasses of champagne by them in the sun was perfect after a long massage over in their spa.  the spa has a coed area right before you head into the massage rooms, but the rest of it is divided between genders. there were two attendants in the men's portion of the spa and he knew my name right when i stepped through into the doors. all types of juices, teas, and fruits were offered as well as any newspaper or magazine i wanted to read. there was also an area full of plush arm chairs and sofas reminiscent of those british gentleman's clubs. needless to say, i completely recommend the spa.

my gal pal said the exact same thing about the ladies side of the spa.

we also enjoyed breakfast one morning at their poolside terrace cafe. i had the lobster benedict that completely hit the spot.  my friend had their egg white spinach omelet that was pretty good as well.  the only downside were the birds that would zoom past your head and try to snatch food items off the bus stations.

we were also able to check out the nightclub at encore, XS. it's designed well, the people are fabulous to look at, but the beverages cost an arm and a leg, but hey... it's vegas... cie la vie.  the club's main focal point is actually divided between 2 points. the first is the dance floor, centrally located so you can see and be seen with the bottle service tables surrounding it.  the second is the pool bar and the large central pool adjacent to the dance floor.  the pool is surrounded by cabanas and located outside... so the club basically forms a figure 8. solid DJs and bartenders.

the rest rooms are pretty standard for a vegas suite.  two sinks, a vanity mirror for the ladies, a large soaking tub and an attached glass shower. pretty similar to the venetian and the hotel at mandalay.  although the wynn bathroom did seem a tad larger.

i ordered room service for us the morning before we left and it arrived promptly on time.  the food wasn't spectacular, but wasn't too bad either. being 7am, we didn't really mind. the coffee was good and the OJ was fresh. they even gave me a USA today and wall street journal to read. kinda felt like richard gere in pretty woman... having breakfast in a comfy robe with a hottie sitting across, looking out into the nevada desert during sun rise.

checkout was a breeze, we had the bell hops take our luggage down for us (hey, we were splurging... may as well). about the only thing i didn't splurge on was valeting my truck.

i definitely recommend the wynn to anyone, i had a fantastic time here.",2,2,1

The floor to ceiling windows are very nice, and the bed is very comfortable.  But the the size of the TV is way too small for the room - LCD flat screen or not.  Just killed it for me.  Shows that the planning\/design wasn't so great.

As for the small LCD in the bathroom, put it in the toilet so you can watch TV while doing a #2, or directly in front of the tub for enjoying while bathing, not on the side next to the sink.  Again, shows that the designer didn't think things through.",2,1,0

The Wynn is one of the nicest hotel\/casinos from top to bottom and from to back that you will find anywhere in the world.  And if you know Steve Wynn, he is all about catering to his players, guests and leaving nothing to pass.

As far as the rooms go, they are second to none!  Spacious, cozy, comfy, and gives you everything you could want in a hotel room, even though while here, you're not in it often!  Marble floors, top notch amenities, the most comfortable mattress and linens.  The shower and tub are awesome.  I love a large shower!!!! 

When it comes to the casino, that's where Mr. Wynn does it all!  He makes sure his players are well taken care of and accommodated at all times.  Ventilation is fine and the smoke is as good as it's gonna get in a vegas casino.  Old slot games to the latest and greatest!  He has it all!  There are a ton of tables, so always someplace to sit and a game for all price ranges.  The casino floor reminds me a little bit of Bellagio which Mr. Wynn is also responsible for.

If shopping is your thing, bring your wallet because this place is filled with all your favorite high end stores.  Chanel, Gucci, Ferrari, and Cartier!  

The food and entertainment are also great!  The sports book is almost hidden but their sports book restaurant is amazing.  The buffet is one of the best around and if a top notch spa is you then after going to Wynn, you will not want to enter another spa anywhere on earth.  This hotel has amazing, amazing cocktail waitresses!  Most of these women could be models!!!!  Hot!!!!!

Needless to say The Wynn is simply amazing.  You can't come to Vegas without visiting this place!  Right now during the holidays is the most amazing time to come here.  How they decorate their hotel for Christmas really makes me feel at home.  Warm, inviting and classy.  

The zest Mr. Wynn has for what he does, always shows through in the final results of one of his properties!  You will love the Wynn.",4,2,2

Concierge was incredibly friendly too--talk to her for guys' tickets\/passes to XS or Tryst and she may even throw in complimentary ones for Blush. You can even print your boarding pass with her.

Also Check in to Wynn on Foursquare and you'll get free champagne at Blush ;)",3,1,1

I realize that they are only a product of the Wynn Hotel's management and policies.  I went so far as to email them an apology for an unfortunate encounter we had, where it seemed everyone (including me) was at fault. The Wynn Hotel itself and most of the staff are nice. However, its management, culture, and policies are a disgrace and a disservice...not only to their paying guests, but to their employees. I will leave out some details of my previous review because I actually liked and respected most of the security staff, and I don't wish to embarrass anyone but the management that defines and\/or approves the hotel policies.
My fiancé and I recently stayed at the Wynn Hotel for our birthdays. I'd never stayed there, but, in the past, I always enjoyed having drinks off the golf course area patio and even gambling there a little. I never had any trouble before.  
But during the course of our recent stay:
1. We had a stranger key into our hotel room and open our door, which appears to be a theme in other reviews here.
2. I was detained against my will for wandering into a ""secure area"" looking for a restroom off the poolside area, as if I were sneaking around and breaking into doors...the door I entered was wide open.
3. We were constantly asked by staff to SEE our room keys, as if that were any guaranty that we were hotel guests. How hard is it to come by a room key, anyway? And they don't scan the keys or validate them in any way. I left mine upstairs one night and was issued a new one as soon as I provided my ID. What if, instead, I'd given my original key to a random gambler in the casino so he could enjoy the pool? Because that's all it takes, folks!
Aside from having a stranger key into our hotel room, the ""let's-see-your-key"" thing bothered me most about the hotel. That ridiculous policy only serves to inconvenience and annoy the REAL guests while doing little-to-NOTHING to protect the guests or the hotel's employees.
There are security guards in the elevator lobby that, at random, ask to SEE your key before you get on the lift. One night, after my fiancé and I returned to the hotel from dinner, we used the hotel lobby restrooms before we retired upstairs. I finished first. There was a shoeshine nook between the men's and women's restrooms with a chair. I sat down, kicked my feet up on the shoeshine stand, and rested my eyes until she came out. Suddenly, a gentleman accosted me and asked if I was a guest at the hotel. I assured him that I was, and he asked to SEE my room key. I didn't have mine on me, so he held me up until my fiancé appeared. Then, he asked to SEE her key. Off to bed we went. 
So, to borrow from my previous and more scathing review:
1. The Wynn Hotel shouldn't treat its paying\/staying guests like peons if they're going to let every local vagabond in town run all over their hotel. We personally don't mind the floozies and harlots (because it's Vegas), but the hotel forgets itself.
2. The Wynn Hotel needs to lock its doors and make sure they stay locked, whether they are guests' room doors or restricted poolside doors.
3. I'm not trying to extort any money from the hotel. If the hotel can assure me that they will never insult me with another junk email advertisement, I will remove this review.",1,1,1

But the logistics were less than perfect...

1. We booked two rooms through Expedia.com to have double beds. Expedia sends over the reservation to Wynn as 2 king rooms. 

2. Wynn was 130% booked for the night and there were absolutely no rooms with double beds. 

3. They give us king rooms with the promise of a roll-away double bed.

4. The king rooms were smoking when we requested non-smoking.

5. They transfer us to non-smoking king rooms and now the key cards don't work.

6. The roll-away arrives and it's a TWIN bed. Not a double as promised by the Registration desk.

7. We were told that we're on the priority list for a double the next night.

8. We double check about the priority list with another employee and only 1 room was on the list.

9. The next day, Wynn still has no double rooms.

10. Did any employee really care? Not really.

Oh yea, unlike other hotels that give you VIP access to the clubs inside their casino, staying at the Wynn doesn't provide you access to Tryst. Actually, staying at the Wynn doesn't even provide you a shorter line at the buffet!

Arrived at the Wynn 3\/25\/16 and departed 3\/28\/16.
This was our 4th time to Vegas and by far the best time we ever experienced. 
We stayed in the basic rooms at the Wynn and were a little hesitant if not we should upgrade the room. We stayed with our current reservation and I was extremely happy we did. 
Pulling up to the Wynn you can easily tell its a 5star hotel with all the details such as the carpet, paintings, architectural designs, service, and restaurants. When we checked in I asked if they had any complimentary upgrades and they happily gave us a great view of the strip on a higher level which I appreciated very much. 
The best part for Vegas for my girlfriend and I is the suspense going up in the elevator waiting to arrive at our room. We were a little nervous how nice the room was going to be because again it was the basic room at The Wynn. When we arrived at our door my girlfriend let me do the honors and open the door first (usually that's her job). 
Walking in we were amazed by how nice the room was decorated with such elligence. 
The room was spottles and clean. The bed was a comfortable king size which I need. The bathrooms were perfect with a wonderful shower and sinks. My girlfriend loved that the Wynn had a huge full body mirror so she can check her self our in her dresses. Overall we loved the room and spent a lot of time in the relaxing and getting ready for the day .

Location: Even though The Wynn is the end of the strip it was actually perfect walking distance to the malls and everything else that we needed. It is closer to all the day clubs so you can walk and save some money on taxi's or ubers. There is also a mall right across the street so in case you forgot something you can make a quick five minute walk. 

Gym: Outstanding gym with free weights, machines and pleanty of cardio. If you need a gym while your in vegas this is huge plus.

Buffet: The buffet at The Wynn is amazing!!!!!!!! After drinking all night there is no better thing than the buffet in the morning. We were so luckily to get the buffet breakfast included in our hotel rate. If Anyone comes across a deal where buffet is included jump on it. It is around 40 dollars a person if you don't get a deal with the hotel room, 

Clubs: This hotel has the best club XS which makes for a perfect night. You can drink, gamble, drink some more and than head right into xs without even leaving the hotel. Honestly, if you stay in this hotel there is no need to leave unless your sight seeing. This hotel has everything a vegas trip needs. 

Overall this hotel just bring class into Vegas. After staying here I can never stay in another hotel that's not equivalent to The Wynn. Everyone here knows how to act their age and have a good time. 

Ill be back next year Wynn.",2,1,3

The sign out front is very cool. It's basically a video screen with a bunch of advertising for La Reve (their Cirque show) and other attractions. And there's this big metal piece which says WYNN and travels up and down in front of the screen. This is not what makes it cool. It's cool because the metal part interacts with the video screen. So, for example, there will be gears and cranks on one side of the video screen, and as they turn the sign rises. Or a character from La Reve will appear on the screen and push the sign down. This is ultimate Vegas -- it's the APPEARANCE of something happening, rather than anything really happening. Sweet.

There's a big ass waterfall between the hotel and the Esplanade -- the Wynn Shopping Center. This is completely fake, of course. There are no waterfalls in Vegas; it's in the middle of the desert. The water is real, of course, as are the trees and shrubs clinging to the rocks along the falls. This is why residents of Las Vegas can only water their lawns for four minutes a day. The water collects in an unnaturally blue lagoon  in front of the Esplanade. And it's all fenced in. This, too, is typical Vegas: stunning beauty, completely inaccessible to human beings.

Finally, the bathrooms in the Esplanade are very nice. Brushed marble with inlaid brass accessories. No attendant, but spotlessly clean. Deep basin sinks; artwork in the entrance. But what sells it are the large, private stalls. Also made of marble, the walls of stalls start about 1\/2 inch from the floor (they are held up by little brass footings) and rise well over 6 feet. The door is of carved wood, with several panels. And set in the center is an antiqued brass door knob, so that you don't have to struggle with the lock mechanism to open and close the door. Very elegant.

I discovered all this about the bathroom because it is literally the only place to sit down in the Esplanade.",1,1,1

I must however make it clear that I have always stayed in the Tower Suites ( with its private entrance on Sands Ave) So what I write about the suites and the room service is not relevant for the resort rooms.

The first time I stayed was in 2003 when the resort had been operating for just years. We had booked a resort room for a reasonable rate, not knowing the Tower Suites even existed. Due to the change of plan in the Grand Canyon we decided to arrive in Vegas a night early. I called Wynn reservations who didn't have an free resort rooms. The kind lady upgraded us to a Parlour Suite in the Tower Suites. Usually these rooms cost hundreds of dollars per night, and we paid just $395.00 (PROMO)!

Upon arrival the valet was excellent and every time we went back to our car they had put complimentary bottles of chilled mineral water in the cup holders. Nice touch.

The rooms are the largest and most opulent of any hotel I have stayed in. The Parlour Suite is large enough for anybody, with a separate lounge, powder rooms, walk in closet, separate WC, rain down shower and a huge spa tub. The drapes are automatic and the lounge and bedroom have huge HD plasmas and even the bathroom as a small LCD TV. The in room internet is expensive but useful.

For the most luxurious and amazing Vegas experience stay in a Salon Suite. These are the size of most three bed homes. The lounge includes a huge wet bar, two sofa's, dining table and desk area. The beds are large and have excellent quality sheets. The bathrooms are the same size as the Parlour Suite, but a different lay out.

The decor is tasteful and has lovely prints , many of which Steve Wynn owns the originals.

The tower suites has its own elevators. I would not worry which floor I was on, as the elevators never take too long to arrive, due to the decreased volume of people in this part of the hotel.

Room service is great. Try a club sandwich, avoid the pizza. One problem was Wynn contacted me to asked if I wanted drinks on arrival. I asked for fresh fruit juice. They then tried to charge me $30 for a liter! I had this removed from the bill.

Restaurants that I know to be good are Tableau, great for breakfast or light lunch overlooking the pool. SW Steakhouse serves the best steak I have ever tasted. Contact the restaurant early as reservations are needed. The Country Club does equally nice steak, and overlooks the 18th hole on the Wynn Golf Course. Zoozocrakers Deli is nice for lunch and a beer.

The casino is as good as any in Vegas, I'm not a big gamer so I won't write what I don't know about.

The pool area is lovely and has a separate pool for Tower Suite guests, although the pool is smaller than the main one. You can reserve cabanas with Plasma TV's in if you wish. The bar on the main pool is a nice place to enjoy an afternoon Corona.

I don't play golf but a friend has played the course - very expensive but said it was the finest course he ever played, and has played some of the best courses at least. First rate service, I imagine however in the summer it would be too hot to play mid day.

Tryst is worth a visit if you enjoy a nightclub. Again it is hard to get in, try name dropping senior execs at the hotel if you can't get on the guest list. Works for me. Drinks are expensive so have a few before you arrive. The women staff are very attractive and have a habit of reliving you of your money in return for sambuca! The music is great, and unlike most LV clubs there is plenty of seating and secluded booths. The dance floor is not huge and extends outside into a lagoon, next to a waterfall. It takes your breath away.

Overall Steve Wynn is the King of Vegas. He built Mirage, TI, Bellagio and now Wynn, and Encore. Each time he builds a hotel is makes it better. So why stay at Bellagio when clearly Wynn is a much better hotel. In my opinion its only rival is Palazzo.

I know many people who didn't take my advice and stayed at Bellagio because in the US it is well known from Oceans Eleven. When they return they have told me - next time I'm staying at Wynn. The beauty of the building is first rate, just about the only credible architecture in Las Vegas.

Once you go you will return for years. I have been three times since this year, and am planning a trip this summer to try Encore. Good rates are on Expedia, but if you want the chance of an upgrade book direct and give the check in staff a $50 bill and ask for a tower suites with a spa tub. It should work, if not they will give you back and probably upgrade you to a strip view on a high floor.

My room was on the 60th floor, with a stunning view of Vegas. The curtains and shades were open literally the whole time. Just beautiful. The bed was super comfortable and the pillows heavenly. The tub is also brilliant (i wish i had the same one at home). The shower looks really cool, but the showerhead was loose and kept slipping down. 

The staff were all very nice and helpful (with the exception of one Roulette dealer who was quite grumpy). 

There are two reasons for the missing star. One is the cigarette smoke. It was not just on the main floor, but up in the elevator lobbies as well. I can't stand the smell  of smoke. I thought that the hallways upstairs would at least be smoke-free areas, but I guessed wrong. Second is the never ending charges for literally everything in the hotel. Want to charge your phone in the lobby? $1.99. Use of the Wifi? $19.99. Use of gym? $20\/day. This was the first time I've stayed in a hotel where I had to pay to use the gym.

This place is the bomb.  Everything from the opening of our door until the time we checked out was spot on.  We couldn't have asked for a better stay.
We had one of the corner suites that faced the Palazzo and TI, on the 55th floor.  What an amazing view we had of the entire strip.  The interior design and everything in it's place definitely impressed us (I'll add some pictures to my review to show you).

We aren't big gamblers, so I can't really speak for the casino, although it was large and pretty busy, I can't begin to assume knowing how great the casino is.

Played a round of golf at the course, and although $500 for 18 holes in incredulous, I figured, once in my life is worth it.  Great course, well manicured.  I was paired up with another single player and our forecaddie (can't remember his name, but he was great).  Played in around 3 hours, no holdups on the course.  The fairways and greens were very well manicured and completely enjoyed my round of golf.  Afterwards, they cleaned up my shoes, put my bag in storage for me and were supposed to provide me with a bag tag, but it was not included, they followed up with me later and mailed me a replacement.

The room service was adequate, although not spectacular, but I cannot take away a star because of one person having a bad day, we are all entitled.  He wasn't rude in any way, but just not talkative or over friendly.

The bell people scratched my limited edition bag and when I called to file the complaint they asked if I would be willing to let someone come to my room ""right now"" to get the report. I said ok. 30+min later still no one. I had just arrived for my ONE NIGHT trip so it's not like I had plenty of time to casually wait around for them. I called again and finally someone shows up. I asked why they didn't come when they said they would. They fed me some bs ""we had a medical emergency"" line. Oh really? For a property that big you have just ONE guy handling medical emergencies and guest property damage? I work at a hotel myself and know this is not the case. 

so this security guy is inspecting my bag. He's sweating up a storm while wiping his sweat with his bare hands and then proceeding to touch my bad repeatedly, transferring all that sweat onto my bag. Then he PICKS at the paint scuffs making it worse. I had to literally tell him to STOP. he kept insisting it was a transfer and could be picked off. It cannot. This is a limited edition bag and LV themselves told me it is screen printed and will get scratched if mishandled. 

He apparently thought he knew better by repeatedly trying to convince me it was dye. It's not dye. 

Anyway, I put in the complaint, two days later someone calls me to tell me they refuse to take liability for damaging my bag but ""AS A GESTURE OF GOOD WILL"" they will just pay for cleaning or give me $100. my bag was in PRISTINE condition and a cleaning will absolutely not remove the damage. This was confirmed by LV as well. The fact that this hotel devalued my property by way more than $100 and refused to do anything about it other than offer a measly cleaning\/pennies only cuz of ""good will"" with no apology whatsoever says a lot about them. 

So wasting my valuable vacation time, my time to travel down to LV to get it assessed, and of course the actual damage itself was only worth $100 or a cleaning to them. Wow.

Regarding the performance of Tony Bennett, I really enjoyed his singing and his show. The man is 91 years old, and he was able to perform, singing over a dozen songs for one hour! He  was incredible!! I can't rate him high enough, as I'd have to rate him about 100 stars. He really broke the house down, and it was a pleasure to hear him perform,  many old time favorites (i.e. ""I left my heart in San Francisco"", etc.).

I was really surprised that the Encore theater personnel permitted many in the audience to record the show using their Smartphones, as there was a prohibition on the tickets, against doing so.  

However, I'm only giving three stars to the Wynn, because it was a hassle to order the tickets, and to pick the tickets up in advance. I had  trouble ordering the tickets online, as it was impossible to select a row, which was designed for a person with mobility problems. Hence, I contacted their box office by telephone. The person I spoke to was helpful, and got us very comfortable seats. I have no problem with that. However, there seemed to be a problem in getting specific information pertaining to any stairs or elevators which might have been involved in getting to the seats. Fortunately, we ascertained that for our specific row, there were no stairs involved, and no elevators. We were told that the wheel transport chair which we brought would be removed, AND RETURNED TO US, at the end of the show. In fact, it was not returned. When the show ended, nobody at first seemed to know where it was. Finally, we located it, together with about two dozen other wheel chairs. One of the attendants wanted our ticket. I told them that we were not given a ticket for the chair, but that my wife's name was on the chair. Finally, they ascertained that it  was ours, and we were able to get it back.

It was a madhouse in leaving, as there were hundreds of people who were exiting; some of whom were not courteous about letting us leave our row, even though we were seated in the last row. One would have thought that the Wynn Management (of the Encore Theater), would have announced at the end of the show, to let  the people who were using mobility devices to leave first, in order to allow them to get to their wheel chairs, and wheel transport chairs.

It should also be noted that even after I paid for the tickets online, they would not e-mail the tickets to us. I had to waste time going to the box office, present identification, and wait for the tickets. Then, I had to sign something stating that ""I authorized charging the tickets"", even though the tickets had already been charged and paid for.

Surely, in the future, there should be a more user friendly way to get those tickets; other hotels regarding their shows,  either e-mailed the tickets out, or sent them out by U.S. mail.",0,0,0

Because of the Wynn I will go back, do I need to go on?
Recently in a magazine Nora Ephron wrote that this hotel is not Vegas incredible - it IS incredible. She was so right.
Now the decor throughout the hotel may not be what I normally look for in a hotel - but there is no denying that it is over the top amazing. Even the casino was a cut above the rest. 
The buffet - I scarfed my way through the buffet the morning we flew back to SF. I needed it - the night before involved more types of alcohol than you are supposed to consume in an evening. Fun. But alcohol poisoning was happening. The food at the buffet was delicious - all of it. I tried asian, spanish, american, french and what ever else they had. I visited every station and they were are presented beautifully and the service was friendly and informative.
So let's go back to the front desk - when I checked in on a Tuesday there were still quite a few other people checking in. The staff is extremely talented at expediting your wait - so much so that there is no wait. And everything I heard about hotels in Vegas proir to this trip indicated to me I would be waiting...for awhile. Never happened. In fact I never waited for anything at this hotel. That probably is what I appreciated most - they were always available to help you. 
The very pretty girl at the front desk offered a higher floor room to me - pointing out the advantage of the view. And then she proceeded to stick me up at the very top of the hotel - stunning view, beautiful suite, I couldn't have been happier.
One other thing about the room - the bathtub. Gigantic. I am not a bath believer. I have never understood the whole ""take a bath"" thing. But I found out why at the Wynn. No one makes a bathtub (that I can afford) that I can stretch out in. So why bother. The Wynn has the tub for me. I took a bath drunk as a skunk and it was incredible. I am going to miss that tub.
I got a pretty good deal on expedia for my fights and hotel - which was one of the reasons I chose this hotel. I will definitely spend what I have to to go back and stay at the Wynn again. Roll the dice - it's a great bet!",0,0,1

AND THEY DON'T ALLOW STROLLERS in their aisle ways (I do not hate children, I just do not the understand the concept of pushing a baby around at inappropriate places). 

I felt safe too, because they often checked for your hotel key card prior to entering the elevators that lead to the suites. They really monitor everything here, as I observed two ladies being stopped and diverted by hotel security when they appeared to be ""indecent"", wearing towels over their swimsuits in their heels. 

Our two bedroom suite was gorgeous, clean, and just heaven. The homebody in me wanted to stay in for most of the trip. Big LCD screen, soft beds and lots of pillows, and a gorgeous bathroom with two sinks and another tv-which was much appreciated when applying make up.

Great shopping, casinos don't smell so strongly of smoke, large clean pools.They often have some big name shows too.

Great food and Tryst was packed! 

A couple of cons by the pool. 
1) If you want to see the pool, or sit near it you have to reserve chairs which can be any where from $150 to $500 a day. I'm actually ok with this, but all the chairs directly around the pool were marked reserved! I've stayed there 10 or so times and gamble a fair amount, if I get to the pool at around 9AM I should get to sit directly around the pool! Quick translation: 9AM is like 5AM if not in Vegas. 
2) I'm all for saving the world from global warming, but what happened to the water bottles by the pool? Now you have to go back and forth to fill up your cup - and yes, God damn it I am lazy!

In the casino, there are always staff cleaning, pushing in the chairs, and serving drinks.  Whenever I go to any other hotel in Vegas, it always feels like a zoo and definitely not as clean! 

Minor things to note: the wifi in the rooms are not always stable.  There are no coffee machines in the rooms, however, the coffee at Wynn's Drugstore Cafe I bought everyday is great.

Aside from this, you get what you pay for..if it's in your budget, I would recommend staying at the Wynn or Encore.

Here are all the things we loved about the Wynn:

*Customer service-  everyone was friendly and eager to help.

*Food- Tons of delicious food options (will post individual reviews)

*The Bed- Slept like a baby every night in this amazingly decadent bed.

*The clientele- A bit more sophisticated than some of the other spots on the strip.

*The Pool- So lush, with amazing landscaping and scenery.

The whole shabang came out to be around $735 despite the ""starting price"" of the package that promised it to be around $300. This price hike might be due to the fact that I booked it on a veteran's day weekend, which happened to align with the timing for the rock n' roll marathon. During the booking process, I was told that I'd get a 50th floor deluxe panoramic king suite room facing the strip. As a disclaimer to the buffet deal, I was told that I wouldn't be able to use them over the weekend since they were only valid for weekdays.   

Once I got to the Wynn, I was told that the room I was supposed to get wasn't available and that I'd be getting a garden view double room instead. The guy who helped me (Shaq?) was very nice and accommodating in finding other options to satisfy my needs. Since my buddy and I were staying for a couple of nights, Shaq said he could help us switch to the strip-facing room on the next night of our stay. We were also told that we could actually eat the The Buffet even if it was during the weekend. At first, I was a annoyed and bitter that I wasn't getting the strip view that I was promised. However, I decided to go ahead with the arrangement. Once we got to the room, I was blown away when I found out that our room (#6048) was actually on the top floor of the building. I can't get over how flossy the room was. Call me a peasant, but I'm used to staying at ghetto motels where the only way to open the curtain is manually. At the Wynn, all you have to do is push a button for ""all on"", and voila, all the lights in the room were instantly on along with the opening of the curtain to reveal the magnificent view of the glittering Vegas skyline underneath. It was fantastic. The room was spacious and grand, and I loved how the TV even greeted me with my full name on it. My bed was so comfy, and I love falling asleep right next to the view of the city underneath me. In fact, I fell in love with the room so much that I decided to not change my room to the strip-facing one after all. 

The pool at the Wynn was also grand. I didn't plan on going for a swim so I didn't bring any of my bikinis with me, but I really wish I did since the water was so warm and perfect to swim in. Since guests have free access to the pool from 8AM-5PM, I'd highly recommend going there after The Buffet for a quick afternoon nap\/reading before heading out to the other adventures on the Strip. 

What made the Wynn experience amazing for me was that I felt like a VIP during the entire length of my stay. On our last night at the hotel, I even received a personalized card that's handwritten by the person who helped me make the reservation (John). Wynn won my heart for its elegant set-up without the snooty attitude.

I don't like that the walls are thin, and you can hear your next door neighbor if they are talking or playing their music.  Plus, some of the rooms are connected with a locked door to the next door neighbor, which causes us to hear the next door neighbor even more.  Our next door neighbor turned on their music loud around 3:00am in the morning, and it woke me up.  They lowered it a little, but it was still loud, and I could still hear the music.  I called the front desk to report the loud music, and the front desk said they would inform security.  I heard security walked by her room to talk to her, and a few minutes later, the next door psycho neighbor who sounded like she was black started cussing at us with her big mouth, shouting saying her music was not loud, and started using the ""f word"" cussing at us, saying ""those people should fukn leave"", when she is the one that started the loud music.  If I could hear music, then it was loud.  I can even hear the words to her music, so obviously that psycho woman doesn't realize it is loud.  I can hear almost every single word in her stupid song.  She should not have played music at 3:00am in the morning in the first place.  It is very inconsiderate and rude of her to play music at 3:00am in the morning when people sleep at that time.  She was cussing at us for more than ten minutes saying that we should leave.  I don't know if Wynn security gave her a hard time, which I didn't want, but maybe they could have talked to her in a nice way to prevent her from cussing at us afterwards.  Anyhow, the walls are thin enough you can hear from neighbors.  For the expensive price we payed for the July 4th weekend, it was not worth hearing loud music or our neighbors talking, and having our neighors cuss at us afterwards.

I'm not a big fan of buffets and even the Wynn's buffet didn't do anything to change my mind.  Yes, they serve a ton of food, but for the price you pay, it's not worth it.  There was nothing spectacular about  the food (it was neither terrible nor memorable)  and the service was atrocious!

On one hand it has some of the best rooms in Vegas on the other, the customer service is very hit and miss.  

The hotel is very clean and elegant. Steve spared no expense when he put his name on this venture.  

We ordered room service the day after my husband decided to go a little nuts because he was feeling a little groggy and eggs and pancakes and coffee and diet coke was $75!  OUCH.

The European pool was beautiful, but the ""bubbies"" that showed themselves ranged from good plastic surgeons to something out of national geographic.  At around 2pm when people have gotten all nice and drunk you see some pretty interesting things happening at the pool.  I saw everything from guys making out with other guys to girls making out with other girls to swapping.  

There are pool cabana's that you can rent and the pool beds start at about $500 for the day.  But, you can negotiate the price...

EJ was our ""pool boy"" and the word ""no"" never left his lips.  I love that.  

The front desk wasn't the most helpful and they seemed annoyed if you have a question.  We had some pretty rowdy neighbors (the walls are very thin) and everynight after the clubs would close, they would bring their party back to their room.  I could hear all about who the boys made out with, who rejected them, blah blah blah.  They must not have done that well because up until last night, I never heard girls in their room!  We called security after the third night of being woken up at 3am until they finally fell asleep at around 6.  And they seemed upset that we called security to ask them to send someone up.  It was the statement of ""what do you want us to do about it"" that kinda sent me over the edge.  Look, don't mess with my sleep!

The concierge was awesome.  She made reservations at Le Reve for us--which if you get a chance go see it, it's spectacular--and made all our dinner reservations with a smile on her face.  Loved it.  

I think if they could get their staff all trained to be helpful and to really make the guest feel wanted, this would be a five star experience instead of hit and miss.",6,6,6

The inside is similarly grand; a luxurious sprawling layout, as extravagant as anything else on the strip.

Calling it a hotel would be a bit of a misnomer. It's a full-blown resort, with an enormous pool (thumbs way up) and spa, about a dozen restaurants, live shows, a golf course and about a bajillion shops. If you wanted to, you could spend an entire trip to Vegas on their compound and be quite entertained. The rooms are spacious, clean, and futuristic. Just about everything was automated, and I appreciated the ability to turn off (or down) all the lights in the room with the push of a button. And those beds are comfy, son.

Now, for a five-star joint things weren't exactly flawless. Even an hour and a half after check-in our rooms were not ready for us -- though kicking up a mild fuss resolved the issue. I also wasn't a fan of the $80 ""resort fee"" tacked on to our bill as we checked out. Shouldn't this be included in our quoted rate? But with what we paid for the room via Priceline, it's hard to complain too much.

I was impressed with the Wynn. I probably would not pay full price to stay here (nor could I afford it) but if you are getting a deal, I'd go for it.

Obligatory Title Pun: For The WYNN.

Menu Readability: Let's talk about the tile mosaic inlays on the floor instead. Wooee!

I know that last part doesn't help you much but I just wanted to add it here. 

From check in to check out, everyone with whom we came into contact was cheery, upbeat, and always extended nice greetings. 

A couple of financial matters bugged me just a little. There is a $25 daily resort fee. This basically gives you the use of their gym. And there is a $150 security deposit PER DAY! I was surprised by this. My three night stay amounted to $450 in security deposits. Of course, I got it back after checking out. But I think that's a bit steep. 

But the rooms are quite nice, even the basic ones. Ours was the basic and had incredible views of the strip, a comfortable leather white couch, and a TV in the bathroom. Gotta love that. 

We booked straight through the Wynn and saw La Reve in the Wynn Theater. This show is amazing and a must see. You'll never look at the water the same again. Also, after seeing La Reve, you'll look at the carpeting in the room hallways a little differently. You'll see a connection. Just trust me on this.

I was annoyed given that this never should have happened. I first tried to pull out the nail, but it was really stuck under the carpet. I called the front desk and told them what had happened. They sent someone up with tools to remove it. They fixed it and the front desk called again to verify. I have never been one to complain, but I was very surprised when the hotel didn't even offer so much as a bottle of water for the incident. They really didn't even care that negligence from their builders caused a guest to get hurt. Mind you again that it was not serious luckily, however, I was very disappointed in how it was handled. I shouldn't have to worry about something like that when paying for room at a 4 or 5 star hotel. If it were my hotel I would at least send up a bottle of champagne or comp'd something... Perhaps I should have been one of those bitchy people that always seem to be complaining about something at the front desk. They always seem to get what they want. lol

Other than that, had a good time. Oh, also, they are VERY strict about not bringing up your own alcohol or food to the rooms. There are guards on 24x7 standby to ensure you do not sneak anything up that hasn't been purchased through room service. They try and make it out to say they're protecting their guests from strangers wandering the halls. A $30 bottle of Glenlivit 12 yr Scotch is $144 on their room service list. Pretty pricey hotel!

My experience there at that time gave me an entire new perspective on Vegas. I will never forget one detail, and I can't begin to describe my trip. In a word, impeccable.

So fast forward to the week of 3\/7\/13, my husbands birthday, and it was the total opposite. Starting with the room. There was a major electrical wiring issue in the panoramic suite we were assigned to, and so we were moved (thankfully we hadn't unpacked yet!). Instead of a comparable room, or even an upgrade to a suite for the inconvenience, we were changed to a standard room with a mattress that was YEARS past replacing. Absolutely no support, and it felt so worn out! Our sleep that night (and every night that followed) was restless, fitful, and exhausting. We spent our entire weekend at the resort. I went to the salon and the spa, my husband played a round of golf, and every meal was at one of their restaurants. At SW, we were informed that our reservation was made for the NEXT night, not the one we requested, and the host managed to scrounge up a table at a HORRIBLE spot for us. Instead of apologizing for the mix-up or trying to fix the situation, he made a joke about my husband's age and told us to ""enjoy"". The meal was fantastic, but we were squished in the middle of two other couples (one of which I'm almost POSITIVE was an escort date), and the other who fought the entire time. The seating is weird. There's a long bench with three small tables on the other side. Not private, not romantic, and certainly not worth a $400 meal. The steak  was fantastic! Too bad we will never be back! The casino bartenders were great, we were never thirsty. My salon\/spa experience were great! The only thing that saved the trip from being a complete disaster was the golf. Sure, it was pricey, but it was the first time we actually felt like ""guests"". Everyone was wonderful, the course was beautiful, and we had an amazing afternoon. The last straw was out last evening, Saturday. The serial nights of not-sleeping were REALLY dragging on our patience, and the exhaustion was so bad that we considered sleeping on the floor, desperate for some rest. The noise from the clubs (we were on the 58th floor) didn't help either. So, at 2am on Sunday, we'd had enough. It was time to go home.
At check-out, we expressed our dissatisfaction and disappointment, given the fact that we utilized nearly every amenity available, and would still rate our overall experience as terrible. The clerk, never made eye contact, and his auto-response of ""yes sir"", became annoying as it became clear that he was used to this, and we were getting nowhere. He took $100 off of our dinner bill, but nothing more. So, at 230am, we packed up the car and drove away. We were saddened, disappointed, and left, pretty sure we would never be back.
The WORST part of this? I sent a detailed email to the website, under the section for guest comments, nearly a week ago. Although I received an auto-reply that my email would be addressed, I have yet to hear one word from the Wynn. 
It is a gorgeous resort, no doubt about that. And perhaps we'd had a series of disappointing events, unreflective of the typical stay. I know my first experience was amazing. So, keep an open mind, but be prepared, just in case!",1,0,0

I'm Steve Wynn and this is my hotel- the only one I've ever signed my name to. The new Wynn hotel is definitely the epitome of luxury and style, the only 5 Star and 5 Diamond Rated Casino resort on earth.
The minute you enter this classy hotel you feel as if in a different world, as entering a fairytale. Originally named La Reve (the dream), named after one of Steve Wynn's favorite Picassos. Steve's last name though was the perfect match for a winning hotel in Las Vegas, or was it the allure that somebody staying at this hotel might win? One thing is for sure this Las Vegas Hotel Casino definitely aims to out-Vegas the most luxurious hotels on the strip. Perfect is also its location, next to the Venetian hotel resort casino and to any fashionista's enjoyment right across the Las Vegas strip from the Las Vegas Fashion Show Mall.
The rooms are nothing short of stunning, and fitted out to the highest standards. What sets them apart from any other Vegas hotel though are its size, they are particularly large. Big Warhol-like paintings bring style to the room. The whole ambiance reminded me straight out of an Alice and Wonderland movie. The rooms are painted in a dark color and fitted with over-sized beds and tables. The bathrooms are huge and stunning and come with own flat-screen TV.

One of our rooms was located under the club and when we realized it we asked if we could change rooms and they denied us and offered us ear plugs as compensation we called around 11, 2am and 3am. They dismissed our issues and we got no sleep and I brought it up again and they dismissed the issue. We stay at the Wynn multiple times a year with a group friends. On our last day the manager offered to allow us to check out late as compensation. I was shocked at how poorly we were treated and the manager said ""well it was your choice to stay here"". I can not believe that they felt it was ok to treat people like this. They did not even say sorry for the inconvenience. They just didn't care.

We were awakened before 5 am by the sound of concrete being sawed.  This went on for about a half hour.  Earlier, we had been awakened -- around 3 am -- by loud conversation either in the hall or next door.  Not at all as quiet as I would have expected.  Also, the location is not all that great.  We had to walk past hundreds of guys and a few women aggressively handing out cards with pictures of scantily clad women offering escort services.

That is saying something because they build something newer and better every year. When it comes to ""Class"" ... in Vegas... there really is no such thing, but The Wynn comes as close to it as you can get while still staying VEGAS at heart.

Everywhere you look there are amazing pieces of art and the decor is just lush upon lush.

The rooms however are very subtle by comparison to the deep reds and bright purples you see in the casino and bars...  they are very well thought out... with one wall that is completely windows in pretty much every room. I love that and you really don't have a bad view... either you are looking at the golf course and the pool or the strip...  so you can't go wrong.

Speaking of the pool. It's great. There are two large dipping pools connected by a long canal that you can walk through from one end to the other. I really loved drinking a pina colada and walking down the canal in the cool water...  my friend and i walked up and down in the pool and talked and people watched and tanned...

The pool side food is lacking though.. the only thing they need to improve at The Wynn.

Unfortunately, that was the past and this is now. I reserved a room with a king size bed and was told upon check-in that I had been upgraded. Great! When I got to the new room it had two beds instead of my originally reserved king bed. I immediately called the front desk and asked to be moved to my original room with a king bed, whereupon they notified me that there were a couple by the elevator on the same floor but also one above me on the 56th floor away from the elevators. My keys would be transferred over so there was no need to come back to the front desk and off I went.

This is where it gets interesting; and utterly unacceptable. As my keys didn't work for the new room, I called down again from a room across the hall that was being cleaned. This time the front desk notified me that when you make a reservation IT'S MERELY A REQUEST AND NOT A RESERVATION. Huh?? Furthermore, there was not one room in the hotel with a king bed that was available. I could just go back to my ""upgraded"" room - which is far as I could tell looked like any other room - or take nothing. Speaking to a supervisor changed nothing. How could anyone believe this explanation??

I finally got to stay at the Wynn! Before staying here, I have read 99% of the reviews and most of them talk about how the lobby is beautiful. If you are ever planning to be a guest and not just walk around, READ MY REVIEW :). I had to shorten my review because of the MAX Char.

Steve Wynn.. THANK YOU! You're hotel is exactly what I would have imagined a Las Vegas hotel should be. I wish that I could personally shake your hand. 

If you are in college on a low budget and need to cram 10 or more people in to a room, please skip this review. You may want to try Venetian or Palms maybe. If you don't sleep,, just drink and gamble all night long, any hotel will do, but if you want to live a little The Wynn Resort in Las Vegas is for you. I highly recommend the Wynn if you will be entertaining a Lady friend. It could be your girlfriend, your fiance, your wife, or your potential Ex-wife. A Resort should be more than a hotel. It should be a destination. You should find everything you need and more. Leave your car and luggage where it is, because hotel hopping a thing of the past. A Resort should an experience! Your accommodation should equal or exceed your personal living standard.

CHECK-IN: The Check-in area is a bit small compared to some of the huge Check-in areas of hotels on the Strip. It feels like a Airport Security check-in line, but instead of angry patrons waiting for a flight there are a lot of well dressed guest with designer luggage bags. It is still very claim and not too hectic. It was nice of the Wynn to open more Check-in stands.

THE ROOMS: *SPOILERS** (Please don't read this part of the review if you are staying in Wynn for the first time) I booked a standard suite and found a pretty nice rate around $130 a night, about $100 less than a standard weekend. The room is very simple, white, and clean. The very simplistic art style makes the room feel like home. It really isn't the largest room, because about 60% is entrance hallway\/ bathroom. The main attraction is the view. The Wynn tower is set up like a small apartment in Uptown New York. At most hotels, I keep the curtains shut the entire trip, but at the Wynn I kept the shades open almost the entire time with just a press of a button. The bathroom is easily any woman's fantasy and up to MTV Cribs caliber, but make sure to put on your complementary robe and slippers because that marble floor can get COLD! Central AC is the best invention ever so you know that it's on 24\/7. Since internet is include in the Resort Fee make sure to bring your laptop, and an Xbox 360 if you have one. I really like the desk chair and sofa. They are both very comfie and great place to conduct your business. I appreciate all the small details of the room. There's a ipod docking station so you can listen to some tunes, but more importantly it has a audio cord in the back. I like the little ""cocktail station"" with wine glasses, glass cups, and stainless steal icebox and pick. I this is a nice touch of class and it makes my Free beer and drinks taste that much better (BYOB). 

THE GYM: ""What's a Guy-m? Oh a GUY-M!""- Simpsons. Who works out at gym when your in Vegas? If you want to keep it real even on vacation, YOU DO! You don't say no to buffets, so don't say know to the gym. I wish that 24 hour fitness was like this gym. I like the free fruit plus the bottle of water with a towel on every workout machine. The staff is constantly refilling each station. The gym doesn't get overly packed, but you may want to go during the mid afternoon.

THE SPA: I accidentally walked in without a reservation. I'm not quite ballin' enough to go there yet, but I did use a ""bathroom excuse"" to walk around. There is men's and women's side. The Men's looks like a high class Exclusive Country Club for the elite. It has a fire place with couches and Men's magazines to read. Most women are probably use to a nice restroom, but this is a PIMP men's locker room. The showers and bathrooms have every possible grooming and bathing item. Everything is made with a dark maroon wood. I feel like I'm handing business when ""I'm handing my business"".

THE POOL: The pool is a little bit Cabana crazy. I felt like an idiot because I was probably the only one swimming in the Adult pool. I was just trying to avoid splashing kids. It's suppose to be more of a social pool. Yes, I believe pools are for swimming and not wading. I'm not a pervert, but it was creepy seeing so many guys there. If ladies want to get a European tan, let them be. After the men left more woman came.

I guarantee if you stay at the Wynn, you will actually relax. Unlike most of Las Vegas that doesn't sleep and runs around 24\/7. You will take your time and enjoy the little things in life. I spent a lot of time in slippers and rope, board shorts, and gym clothing. Spend a little less time gambling and invest in your room and dinning experience.",13,6,4

OK first when we were about to check in at the registry they assumed that we were off our rockers cause we were asking about two tower suites we had booked months in advance. They asked us ""are you sure"" like we were some bums on hallucinogens or something. After they realized that we did have two suites booked, they told us that it would take a couple hours. This is just the beginning. We finally get our keys to our tower suites, then right before we even get to the elevator you have to pass elevator security (which i have nothing against) but this ""elevator security"" stopped our group and said that he wanted to check my cooler. I cooperated fine. and he says that i have to much beer.""WHAT""!? i said. So confused as other groups of people have cases and  Tequila bottles as they walked right passed him. He finally said we could proceed after he makes these phony calls asking if it was OK to bring a cooler of beer to the room,apperently he wanted a payoff of some sort like he was doing me a big favor. So annoying, but we did. We proceed to the hotel which was really nice(ill give the Wynn that). We get ready and go straight to the pool party which we even paid extra for VIP. WE get to the pool and i dint know if they had it out for us or what, but again we deal with security!? This time there not letting my friend into the pool cause of his tattoos! Get this, the security guy ""Jason""had tattoos  just like my friend and he has the nerve to tell us ""paying customers staying at there hotel"" that we were not gonna be allowed in! We tried to reason by saying that he would put a shirt on but they were ignoring us ! We had to leave cause of the embarrassment. It took us about two hours to get reimbursed with no sorry or anything. After we spent two hours at the front desk speaking with managers, supervisors etc. I felt bad for my friend for being discriminated for having tattoos which half the people at the pool had! We were singled out and were probably a good laugh for there tattooed staff.Thanks a lot Wynn. I will NEVER EVER EVER STAY HERE AGAIN!",6,4,3

We went yesterday night and we're still not over the horrible experience we had at the buffet. My husband had asked for a seafood cracker to open his crab claws. The busboy (we won't name names here), had shown him to cut thru the sliced part of the claw, which I thought that was kind of nice. But when I came back, I found out he had brought a seafood cracker and told my husband, ""Chino, chino....here.""

We talked to the manager and she was nice enough to offer us champagne which we politely declined. We asked to be moved somewhere else instead. After that, enjoying dinner is just out the door even after an hour wait with hungry stomachs. Not to mention we had to explain to our son what just happened.

It was our first time at Wynn but not our first in Vegas (one of our frequent travel destinations). This has been one of our most enjoyable stays at a Vegas resort and that's why I am writing this review!
Nice spacious room, first of all. Comfy bed, leather couches and chairs, bath amenities were nice, bathtub was big! and the steam shower was awesome. There were robes in room but no slippers. However, we called for slippers and they were brought up within minutes. 
The gym was awesome, had bottled waters, towels, fruits, TV on all the machines. 
The pool was amazing! Very beautiful, serene, clean, with nice plush chairs and loungers. We relaxed here for 3-4 hours and it was very lovely.
We watched Le Reve, which is now our favorite show on the strip. We've seen Ka, O, Zumanity, and Zirkana, and Le Reve tops them all in our opinion. Highly recommend this show. 
We also went to Club XS and had an amazing time - definitely would go again.
I played a lot of slots at Wynn, although I didn't win any money :P I liked the slot selections at Wynn.
The only ""problem"" we had at Wynn was that we had pressed the SERVICE ROOM button in the morning around 9am but the room ended up not being serviced all day. We called right before we were leaving for dinner and show to get the room serviced and when we came back the room was turned down very nicely. There were chocolates, water bottles, and everything cleaned and organized perfectly. 
We even received an apology email about the ""problem"", which was not necessary because we were extremely satisfied with the turndown service and we were mostly at the pool and gym during the day anyway, but it was a nice touch. 
The buffet at Wynn was one of the best I have ever had. I was very impressed.
Overall, I think what sets Wynn above many of the other hotels is the service. The staff from the front desk to housekeeping, dealers, and even the ladies at the buffet line were all so friendly and cordial.

I was able to stay there during Christmas with my sister and was so excited! I made the reservation via a promotional email sent to me advertising special rates and a free play credit so I jumped on the opportunity.

The Good
1. Gorgeous Hotel. Lots of color and lovely atmosphere
2. Super clean casino area
3. Beautiful (way out of my price range though) shopping
4. Polite staff
5. Gorgeous rooms, very clean and quiet
6. Security checking for room keys before people are allowed upstairs (I like that safety measure).

This is where the Wynn loses me

The Bad

1. Even after I had reserved under a promotional rate with an email confirmation listing that rate, I was overcharged for the room and had to wait in another long check in line to straighten it out.
2. The hotel check in process was the slowest I have ever been through in Vegas. I think we stood in line for 40 minutes!
3. $150\/night ""incidentals"" hold on your credit card. That is a bit outrageous!
4. SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE! For such a lovely property, their ventilation system isn't the most efficient. I am praying for the day they get rid of smoking in casinos. All of my clothes were smoke filled every night. I have been to other casinos where it is nowhere near as bad as the Wynn.
5. Buffet was lovely but wildly overpriced especially for such a long wait.
6. Both me and my sister got food poisoning from their Zooza Deli. When I notified the hotel, they just gave us some bottled water and said sorry?!?
7. Spa is way too expensive. 
8. Toilet leaked


While I enjoyed the room and my time playing the slots, I think I will pass on another stay at The Wynn and just enjoy it as a casino visitor instead.",2,3,0

-the ceiling to floor, wall to wall window was spectacular (even if our view wasn't the greatest)
- the beds were uber comfy with down comforters which made my after drinking nap even more luxurious
-bathroom was large as well, and vanity table big enough for 4 girls getting ready for a night out on the town

UGH LEAVE ME ALONE!!  this alone made me feel relieved i was staying at the wynn, away from be accosted all day long.
rooms are beautiful, on the 58th floor looking down on the strip was actually tranquil and relaxing.  bathrooms are large and fully equipped for a great soak in the tub.  i loved laying on the bed and watching the storms pass over the mountains.
if it was not 100 billion degrees outside, i would have also been very happy to sit poolside at the wynn longer than i did.  the european pool is great even though my mojito was $14 and beer is $6.50 (yikes!).  bartenders are friendly and not at all pushy with the drinks.  the grill is expensive as well, but you at least do get what you pay for.  our burgers were enormous and tasty.  i especially liked my turkey burger.

Waited 45 minutes In line just to check in. They said Sunday was their busiest day, so wondering why they were not prepared? Others behind me waited over an hour just to get to the desk.

Going into the room the view and decor was great. But not pleased at all by the sandwich we found by the mini bar rotting and made the room smell. 

We went for dinner at the buffet which was wonderful. I love seafood and desserts which this place is great! 

Later signed up for a red card for the casino. Our card did not work. They told me to following instructions on the slot machine when using the card. I thought that was rude as I know it didnt work. Finally after an hour of going back and fourth lining up at the red card counter they went with me to realize that on their side of the computer it was active but not a working card.  They apologized for the inconvenience.

In the evening after a long day the tv,which worked earlier did not. There was a blue screen that would not turn off and no cable. Got someone to fix it the next day as it was an it was so late but was uncomfortable with the light. 

The next day we went to the pool was great and relaxing. Got back from the hotel to take a shower to realize that there was no shampoo\/conditioner or soap!! They cleaned our washroom and forgot to replace our toiletries. Had to get out of the shower to call housekeeping!!  Again they apologized.

As we only stayed here based on reviews on yelp and tripadvisior. So would like others to see my review based on our stay. So for a high end hotel I we got for all these inconveniences was ""sorry"" I would think that something would have been done for the lack of service\/customer service.",3,1,0

The shopping is great..lots of high end shops in one main hallway to basically make shopping easy. It also leads you from the wynn to encore with plenty of photo ops along the way.

Mizumi has a wonderful view of the waterfall while eating. So if you want a special night out. Try it there. The kobe beef is so good and served in a fun way with great dipping sauces. I heard only 3 places on the strip serve certified kobe beef. And this is of of them. 

The pool is great. Its quite large. Theres not much shade here. Mostly 5ibo trees and under the bridges if youre swimming. The pool temperture is heated to a very comfortable temperature.

It's Vegas where everything is a fantasy of overpriced glittery distractions. Weekend gettaway with hubby and we were doing it up big time!!!! 

I will rate everything individually then give an overall rating at the bottom.

The Room- 1.75 stars

Our king sized bedroom was not ready when we arrived to a packed lobby at the Wynn on a Saturday afternoon back in March. This is not a good thing in my book, but what can you do. They moved us to a room with two double beds. BIG MISTAKE!!

The room and bathroom were both well appointed and the view worthy of a million dollars. However, the beds sucked. They were uncomfortable and not big enough. I guess they really don't want you staying in your room at casinos.

When we first walked in the connecting doors to our rooms were open. We attempted and were not able to securely shut them. This definitely felt kinda weird and creepy at the same time.  I was forced to call the front desk to have maintenance come up to shut it for us. He said that the renovations had caused this issue all over the place. hmmmm Better get those contractors back out here then.

By far the worst thing about our room were the paper thin walls. We could hear entire conversations and loud partying all night long. What made matters go from bad to even worse was the room vibrating from the base and the continuous throbbing from the disco down below. I don't think we slept a wink either night.  

Listen we are all for revelers - revelling --it is Vegas Baby!! BUT not in my bed at 3:30-4 in the morning. I want to be able to sleep and when your paying big bucks  that means the hotel should have some sound proofing going on!!! 

The FAB Pool - 4.5 stars private loungers, gorgeous decor, great DJs, yummy drinks, & incredible vip service. Best thing about this Resort by FAR!!! Best pool I have been to in Vegas bar none! Sorry Mandalay but the lack of sketchy crowds here trumps ya!

The food & drinks inside the hotel 2.0 stars - Overpriced and not that great! We found far better food and drinks elsewhere around town. 
Hey listen, everyone knows while in Vegas, you are going to get bent over, but you should at least be able to enjoy the ride. 

Slot machines 3.0 -- I won quite a bit of money, but  my winnings were balanced out by my honey losing his shirt, pants, and everything else at black jack. Darn!!! So much for buying a Chanel purse while I was there.

Overall experience 2.8 stars I will round up to 3.0 for the sake of this review. Will we be back? Perhaps but I think we will try out the Encore next door.",7,1,2

The rooms were very spacious and nice, but the bed was very soft and I did not sleep well at all. The restaurants are all grossly overpriced. We went to their Japanese restaurant  MIZUMI and it was absolutely gorgeous, but it was the worst Japanese food I have ever had. The food was prepared poorly, and our bill was almost $250. There is literally only one coffee shop in the whole place, similar to a Starbucks. Other than going to a sit down restaurant, if you want a coffee in the morning you have to wait almost a half hour to get one. I started to get up earlier in the morning so I wouldn't have to wait so long for a good morning coffee. The worst part of our stay came just as were were getting ready to leave our room. I had checked out at the front desk rather that using the TV check-out in the room because I had questions on my bill. I told the front desk person that were were not physically out of the room yet, but would be by 10:30 am. (Check-out is required by 12:00 noon)  He said OK and would put us in for a auto check-out time for 10:30 am. Around 10:20 am as we were getting reading to leave the room, the housekeeping supervisor knocked on our door and said we needed to get out of the room now, because we had check out a hour and a half ago. We told her give us a couple more minutes and we would be out. She said that if we didn't get out now, she would report us. I immediately called the front desk to tell them what this person said to us, but the person I talked to was just a young girl and really didn't do anything but say don't worry about it.

All the staff are excellent!  They are super friendly and accommodating, not stuffy the way you might think staff would be in a place of this caliber.  

We arrived in Vegas and to The Wynn at 8am.  We prepared to leave our bags with the bell desk and head straight to the pool assuming there was no way there would be a room ready for us.  Surprise!  They had a beautiful room ready for us - fabulous!  We had a gorgeous suite with a view of the absolutely magnificent golf course.  Funny thing is every time we try to count how many peeps are swinging their clubs, the most we count is 8.  Steve Wynn has priced his course at $500\/head and you *must* be staying at the hotel to play there ... He obviously doesn't feel the need to fill the course ... Oh well, must be nice to have that bank ...

Speaking of the pool ..... Bellisimo!  We lounge poolside at their European Pool, enjoying the fun and lively crowd and the tunes bounding from the DJ stand.  And yes, European Pool does indicate topless tanning ... There is something quite freeing and liberating about the whole experience.  Granted, I don't know if I would have felt this way in my 20s?...  Guess its part of the rambunctious character that comes with rockin' your 30s.  ;)  A necessity in the 113 degree weather is a Citronade - vodka and lemonade slushie ... Delish!

Within The Wynn are the Esplanade shops ... I'll write-up the stores I shopped in each separately.  Overall, FABULOUS!  All the high-end designer boutiques under one gloriously, smoke-free roof:  Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Manolo Blahnik, etc ...

The story is that Steve Wynn fell over a stroller and ever since then he did not want them there. How can that be the stroller fault. He should open his eyes when he walks. So what happens when there's no strollers and he falls over a little toddler running around? 

I've been to Wynn a few times already with the stroller. If you go in from the Main entrance they don't pay attention. Apparently, people who stay in the hotel are allow to have their stroller. So go in from the front. I think when you go in from the main entrance, you have to register the stroller or they store it. I'm not sure, when I went in I just kept on walking. Nobody stopped me. I'm not sure about the rule this year (2010) because I never saw the sign prior to this and in 2009 I got kick out from one entrance, I just tried a different entrance.

With this rule (there's other rules also you will see it with my upload) this place is very unfriendly to family. I guess Steve is anti-kids. 

This year I just didn't go into Wynn at all, after all, I've seen the place already and there's nothing special for me to go back in again.

This is what's on the sign:

Hotel management reached out to me following my review and offered a refund of my first night room + tax as a service recovery gesture. I think this is commendable in light of circumstances and it's nice to know they pay attention to guest reviews even if the staff on site weren't quite so pro-active; thus, I've changed my rating from 2 to 3 stars. I hope that beyond satisfying one guest complaint they are taking steps to address the issues I encountered so others don't run into the same (that would earn them a 5 stars in my book!). 


** Original review posted 7\/17\/16 **
I wouldn't give this resort ""dismal"" marks but close to it. I was booked for a Fri\/Sat 2-night stay and I booked a ""King suite"" at Wynn but opted in for a standby upgrade for a King Panorama (+$34\/nt) or a King Tower Suite (+$80\/nt). The day before check-in I got an email saying that no upgrades were available but to check with the front desk on arrival. No problem.

On arrival at the Wynn and after a 30-minute wait in a very slow check-in line, the desk agent said my upgrade to a King Tower Suite was already processed and in the system. Yay for the upgrade but thumbs down for not notifying me before arrival as the Encore tower is a 3\/4 mile walk with my bags and has a private check-in area that I would have liked to use instead of a 30-minute wait at main check-in. They were still happy to charge me full price for the upgrade despite the diminished enjoyment of benefits due to their lack of communication. #fail

The room itself was awesome. Beautiful view of the strip, nicely appointed and an amazingly comfortable bed. The one thing I would change is there could be an amazing view out the windows from the bed but it's blocked by the TV. It would be nice if there was another way to arrange this so the view could be enjoyed from either the living area or the bed itself.

Housekeeping arrived at 9PM for turndown service. I told her I was leaving in 20 minutes and asked her to come back. She said ""yes, of course!"" but never did. #fail

My rate included buffet breakfast for two at the Wynn buffet. There's nothing in the literature (or my welcome letter) about a strictly enforced dress code that prohibits sleeveless shirts - it's 110 degrees in Vegas and for most guests who are planning a pool day, dressing up for something as low end as a buffet meal is not front of mind. Perhaps include a note in the welcome letter about this? So there was a 1.5-mile walk in vain since we couldn't go in and yet another benefit of my room rate that went unused due to poor communication on Wynn's part. #fail

At the tower suites pool it was rather busy since it was 110 degrees but they only had 3 attendants working 100+ guests. We were there for 90 minutes before we could get someone's attention to ask for a food menu. 30 minutes later still no menu so I asked again. We finally ordered and got our food & drinks 3 hours after we arrived at the pool. #fail

Last, at 9AM on my last day the hotel emergency alarms went off - so much for sleeping in! I don't fault the hotel for the alarm but the message was ""this is a pre-notification and we're investigating the source of the alarm."" This message and the siren repeated for about 10 minutes which is excessive and unnecessary. After it finally went off I tried to go back to sleep only to be startled again with another alarm and message saying ""the alarm was due to a minor issue and it has been resolved."" Which, again, repeated several times. For god's sake if it's non-emergency then let me sleep! #fail

On checkout (in the tower suites lounge this time) there was no order or organization. While I was first ""in line,"" if you can call it a line, the desk staff called up everyone OTHER than me who arrived after I did. The clerk asked how my stay was and I said I probably wouldn't stay again. She asked why, I mentioned a few of the above and she said ""I'm sorry, is there anything I can do?"" I said ""you tell me, you're in a better position to know what you can offer but at this point my stay is over"" at which point she printed my bill and apologized again. I guess that means there is nothing they do for service recovery, then again based on my experience I'm not surprised (note: removing the upgrade charge would have been a great way to turn a bad situation around). #fail

Overall, nice rooms and nice aesthetic to the property but if you expect good service go elsewhere.",2,3,0

I've stayed at some nice hotels before and Wynn is right up there with the rest!  The rooms are really nice and spacious!  The beds are awesome!  Very comfortable!  Big bathrooms!  Some words of advice though.

1) DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING in the mini-bar or snack bar inside the room unless you want to be mistakingly charged for those items you touch.  They have these sensors built into the fridge mini bar and also the snack bar where if you lift any item for longer than 1 minute they will automatically charge you!  When I say do not TOUCH, I mean do not TOUCH!  Those sensors work!  We had to call the front desk to tell them that we did not use any of the items in the bar.

2) If you find a used condom in your room like my friends did in their room, be sure to get your room comped for at least one night!  Yes, I said a USED CONDOM!!  YUCK!  BARF!  

They have a nice pool area too but kind of a challenge finding a spot to sit and relax because it can get very busy and packed there on a nice hot day.  I would definitely stay there again!",1,1,0

The staff was so useless and at times even rude. I have stayed in dozens of hotels in Vegas and never had such bad service. They must not treat their employees well is all I can say. 

We were actually booked months in advance at the Encore but when we showed up mysteriously our reservation had been booked under a double bed room at the Wynn. Why would a married couple book a double bed room? What are we Lucy and Ricky? I think they just got busy and gave our room away. Since the Encore was now completely full the only option we had was to stay at the Wynn. 

Everything was overpriced. We got a $16 cup of room service coffee, no free wi-fi Internet, hotel guests have to pay $35 to use the fitness room. We wanted to get some spa treatments and for some reason ""the computer"" wasn't letting them book the appointments at the same time, even though there were plenty of spots available. Instead of trying to resolve the problem for us the staff just said well you'll have to go at different times. Can anyone think outside of the box here??? Seriously at $90 for a pedicure you'd think they could figure out how to make it work. I finally asked for a manager and presto they solved the issue. Total lack of customer service. The spa looked like it was designed for 87 yr old ladies with blue hair. 

The plus side of our stay was the room. It was really nice. Large room overlooking the strip view and a giant bathroom with a large soaking tub. The pool was nice too but get down there early to save yourself a lounge chair. We saw the Circ du Soleil show, Le Reve, and that was really great.

Checked in at midnight! but I had called ahead and let them know it would be a late check int- best to do this to ensure your room is not given away on a SAT evening. Slight line backup at check in due to a large family group but the Wynn staff got us in quickly- very nice. Very warm greetings and information on the property from the front desk staff. Kudos!! . Room was very nice, clean, good size , and the bathroom was excellent with tub\/sep shower, dual sinks, sep watercloset. Not a fan of overpriced mini-bars but glad there was one in the room anyway. Its time that prices were reasonable for those items ! Geeze... anyway.  The entire property is well kept, clean, beautiful with displays , staff were great to interact with , restaurant servers, door men, elevator security staff,  dealers, pool staff , etc.  I did wish they would have the security move youngsters away from the entrance to the elevators though vs bottlenecking up. This ocurred a couple of times.  Pools were clean and sparkely waters. 1st day down I just used a lounge chair and had an issue with waitstaff not wanting to take order since I was not in ""their"" section??  Crazy.. thats not 5star service. This did not occur the next day as I had reserved day bed at the adult only pool and experienced excellent service.  SW steakhouse is a must if you go, excellent meal and staff , but it will cost you $$$$$$$. Especially if you buy a bottle of wine. I enjoyed the spa but they seem to promote ""room temperature waters"" vs having cold bottled water and snacks about. For the Wynn, I was expecting juices\/soda\/coffee\/tea\/fruit etc. and there was some of these but not really extensive. I thought the lounge area was lacking too.. just my take. Massage was typical, and actually was a little sub-par based on past experiences, but it really depends on your technician. Had a great time gambling but felt that beginners  who interfered with an ongoing craps game should have been instructed better to not reach into the game , place bets incorrectly-- I'm all for someone learning a new game but maybe a fully rolling table on a streak is not the place to jump in an test the waters - there were other tables available also .

Room and bathroom were very clean and nice, although not necessarily spectacular (maybe my expectations were high as this was our first trip to Vegas). 

Our first night (thanksgiving) we wandered down to the casino. I sat at the video poker machines and waited nearly 30 minutes to see a cocktail waitress and when I finally grabbed one, she said we weren't in her section. Disappointed and would expect a higher level of customer service. We eventually gave up and moved locations and managed to get a first round of cocktails, but the waitress there never returned. After waiting nearly 40 minutes, we decided to check out some table games. We found the craps tables and were very pleased with the friendliness of the dealers. They happily explained the rules and helped us get the feel of the game, and we had a great time. This became a recurring theme during our stay: excellent, friendly dealers, but just a distinct lack of cocktail service. 

We eventually checked out the B bar, and the bartenders were amazingly friendly, but we were shocked to learn that nowhere on the property will they comp drinks at the bar even if you're playing the video machines. Never have I heard of such a thing!! 

After wandering the strip and checking out several other casinos, we truly appreciated the impeccable cleanliness of the Wynn. Made everywhere else look dingy by comparison. 

Our last night (read: early morning), we caved and ordered the ridiculously expensive room service. The server was amazingly friendly and pointed out that gratuity was already included. While I was aware of that, I thanked him very much for pointing it out. Many hotels I've stayed at, the room service didn't mention that gratuity was already included and I've mistakenly tipped 20% on top of the gratuity. The food was excellent. 

One other gripe is that NOTHING in the drug store is priced. Come on! I expect it to be expensive, but I'd like to know how much a travel toothpaste is going to cost!!

The decor was simple and colored white\/light brown but there were splashes of color from various paintings hanging on the wall. The bed was super comfortable. 

We stayed for two nights and had a great time. We were comped two tickets to the show - Le Reve, The Dream. It was a great show. We were also comped a meal for two at the buffet. Upon checkout, I was informed that I received a single night stay comped with no strings attached for later in the year. Basically, the staff at The Wynn was very professional and super friendly with great attention to detail.

IMHO, the only shortcomings are the location at the north end of the strip. Makes for a good walk if you want to get anywhere else. Also, the guests at the hotel seemed to me to be older, on average. It was so quiet on our floor,which was awesome, but I literally never saw anybody in the hallway after 11pm.  I was mindful of the fact that my coming and goings in the wee hours of the night, might have been an annoyance to some. Oh well, I didn't go to Vegas to be in bed early. LOL.

I was at the roulette table with some friends and the dealer's supervisor was very adamant about giving me this red card (because I look young and this way I wouldn't have to take out my ID at the various tables) I said repeatedly well the red card would be with my ID so it wouldn't really matter because I would still be taking something out.

We do get enough free play credit to make this a  little weekday tradition. A few weeks ago we each received e-mail notices that the Wynn was going to start charging for parking on August 7th. But, at our level of play we would not be charged, the red card program would cover it.

On July 31st we stopped by the Red Card desk to confirm the parking charges would be covered. I expressed my complete dislike for the entire charge for parking thing. The person at the desk said they were forced into charging for parking because everybody else was doing it. Right out of the management lame excuse book, I GUESS. 

Now to yesterday, August 7th....what a mess. After about 3 hours at the Wynn we started home.  
Put my little parking ticket into the machine, big charge $12 for parking. Tried to use my Red Card as I had been told would work. Of course it wouldn't work, tried a credit card, again wouldn't work. The little window said ""exact change"" , so we dug out 12 one dollar bills and fed them in one at a time. I was not happy!

The Wynn had posted a guy to watch the machine and one of those purple suit guys was standing near the machine. So, I expressed my displeasure to them. What I got back was sort of a we know, but we don't care response. I strongly suggested that they call someone or go get someone, again nothing. Not getting anywhere, we took our little parking ticket an left. 

When we got to the departing gate, again one of those guys to watch the gate. I tried to put my ticket in the machine, he said ""oh the gate is up you can go.""  It seems the thing didn't work anyway, so what are they charging for?

The entire charge for parking thing drives me crazy! These mega casinos don't make enough money. They need to nickel and dime customers.  Or, maybe $12 for a few hours in a dirty parking garage isn't nickel and dime.

Yesterday afternoon I again expressed my displeasure in an e-mail to the Wynn customer service. Ignored I guess. No response.

By the way, as of yesterday, the Palazzo and Venetian not charging for parking. So, take your business there.",2,1,1

I ALWAYS stay at the Wynn or the Venetian. Wynn and Encore wins hands down just for their services, their location away from the hubbaloo of the strip, their exclusive feel, their luxury feel and the clean rooms\/hotel! I managed to get a suite for my birthday for half off! 

With that, the girls and I didn't even LEAVE the hotel - isn't that how its supposed to be? A resort - we used the spa, the gym, had pre-drinks at Blush only to go to XS then stumble back to the room (barefeet even, on the lush carpets) then back down again to play on their 25 cent slot machines. All the shopping? Well, all the window shopping I had to do in Vegas was their - Chanel, Dior, their boutiques with new Alexander Wang dresses, Oscar, etc.

Back to what I think: If you're baller, then ball hard or go home. If you can afford a 50% discount (or mooch it off your fazaa and uncles and grandma etc) then DO IT.

On my way up to my room, 3 drunk guys get in from a lower floor and were so aggressive that I ended up shoving one of the guys to get out to my floor.  This was traumatic for me and a big advice I would have for all the ladies is to be really careful about being alone in the elevator, especially when it's late into the night.  When i shared this traumatic experience with one of the clerks at check out, his only offer was ""I'm sorry"" and mentioned that I should have reported it to security.

Everything is absolutely beautiful!! When you first walk in, music is playing with a welcome note from the hotel displayed on the tv. There is also a little message welcoming you to the Wynn displayed on the phone screen. The beds are like clouds and the bathroom is my favorite - jacuzzi tub, huge walk in shower and vanity. Nothing like watching tv in the bathroom while relaxing in the tub. The decor is simply classy from casino to room and I can't help but feel at home every time I step into the Wynn.

The service is top notch.. like Four Seasons and Ritz status. Oh and their drinks!! It's the real thing. You want an overpriced drink in Vegas, might as well go to the Wynn for the real alcohol, and very generous with it as well!

The Wynn is a very nice, easy place to stay in Vegas.  The accommodations and service are top notch, and it's a beautiful, easy to navigate property.  

Although the Wynn is a thoroughly modern Vegas hotel, it retains a lot of old Vegas feel to it in terms of scale and service.  Genuinely great service used to be a given in Vegas almost anywhere you went, but it's become increasingly rare.  I miss the old Vegas a lot, and the Wynn reminds me of the old Vegas even if it doesn't really look like the old Vegas.  

Parking is a breeze unlike many Vegas properties.  The parking structure is easy to get in and out of and easy to park i, and the walk from the parking structure to the casino is basically nothing.  

If it's high end shopping, dinning, or nightlife you're after, Mr. Wynn's got you covered.  Tryst is one the best nightclubs in Vegas and probably my favorite.  

One small gripe:  Once in the casino, you have to traverse the entire casino floor to get to the check in desk and then all the way back again to get to the elevators to the rooms.  This kind of set up is endemic to the species, though, so it's hard to give Mr. Wynn too much grief about that.  Once you ARE checked in, though, the room elevators ARE close to where you enter the casino from the parking structure.  

On our way out with our bags, the folks checking room keys at the elevators thanked us for coming and bid us safe travels.  It was a nice touch and seemed genuine.  

I doubt anyone who stays at the Wynn would be disappointed.

Bonus:  Tacos El Gordo is a short walk up the boulevard away.  The spicy pork tacos there are spectacular and worth the short walk up the boulevard to an admittedly somewhat rough around the edges shopping center in the shadow of Encore to get them.  The vast majority of the denizens of the Wynn won't make that walk and will never know what they are missing.",0,0,0

From the minute we got there every employee was rude and didn't want to help in any way. Even trying to get to my room the elevator guy had to look through my ice chest and almost didn't let me bring it up. Then we finally get to the room and the ice machine was not working and there is a frig in the room but filled with the Wynn's over priced drinks and who wants that.

So to the main point of my trip and why I think everyone should boycott this hotel is because of the discrimination they showed one of my friends because of his tattoos. It was the most ignorant things I think I've ever witnessed. He was denied entry to a pool party that we all payed for because of the art work on his skin. He is not a gang member or anything like that and we were hotel guests just going to a pool party at the hotel that we payed for. The security gaurd that was kicking us out had just about as many tattoos as my friend did which was rediculous in its self. I asked him why he wasn't letting us in and he said ""We have an image to uphold"". He also said because some of the millionaires wouldn't like to see his tattoos. I find it really hard to believe that they would care so much about my friends tattoos that they would leave and not spend any of their money there. And we payed money as well so I guess our money wasn't good enough for them. So after we left by being embarrased in front of hundreds of people we go to get our money back and they took 2 hours to reimbuse us. 

So instead of us trying to provide a special weekend for our friend it turned into one difficulty after the next. I will never step foot in that hotel or casino ever again and you shouldn't either. They will treat you like second class citizens and will disriminate against you just as they did to us. Go stay anywhere else!!!!!!!!!",1,0,0

Many good things have been written about the Wynn and I don't want to repeat them here.  I would like to add our observation that the Wynn casino was clean (i.e., dirty ashtrays were quickly cleaned) and unlike at other casinos where vacated slot chairs were left in disarray, chairs in this casino were always pushed in so you know a particular machine is available.

The Wynn is absolutely gorgeous from the moment you arrive outside in the valet area.  It's almost overwhelming.  Walking in, you are not sure which direction to start walking, because there are just so many choices of which way to go.  Registration is to your right, along with Okada and Tryst.  There's a mall straight ahead.  YAY!  Shopping!!!  And then to your left begins the vast Casino area, along with places like Blush and Stratta.

The BF is a major poker player, so we came here specifically with that in mind.  We walk over to the Poker room and when we arrived, we had a minor wait.  A couple of people ahead, but nothing major.  Within the next few minutes we were being seated.  I really enjoyed this place because since I don't really know how to play poker, all I wanted to do was sit with my man and watch him win.  And they totally allowed me!  

The table we sat at had an interesting and eclectic mix of people.  The dealers switch out every 30 minutes (rules are rules), and the BFand I had them ALL laughing and joking, along with the rest of the table.  Except for this one dealer...  Wade...  Try as I might, I couldn't get him to crack a smile.  As the buzz kept buzzing, I gained more confidence and really started in on Wade...  Even blowing him kisses!  HAHAHA, NOTHING.  Not a smile or a smirk.  This dude was rigid.  He totally SUCKED.  Everyone else played along and just make our entire experience so extremely worth while.  

One of the other players was this wonderful lady from Germany that we ended up partying with her and her BF and friends for the rest of the night.  I love how easy it is to meet random people and have a good time!

Our motto of the weekend was W1N @ the Wynn!!!!!  And THAT we DID!  Came out $600 on top!!!

Location is good (just like the Venetian\/Palazzo) being a bit north on the strip.
There are fewer shops in the ""mall"" than CP or some of the other hotels but I don't spend much time shopping so it didn't bother me.
The lobby and gaming area is beautiful and made me like this place right off the bat.
The restaurants are all very good (especially Alex).
The night clubs were very impressive.  Tryst and X\/S.  Checked them both out and they were beautiful inside and busy on their respective nights.
The pool area was closed for the Wynn so they sent me over to the Encore pool.  I'm not sure how different they are but it looked like both have two pools, one for european bathing.  Wasn't the busiest time of year, and the only topless bathers were two women that I'm assuming were lesbians based on how they were rubbing lotion on one another.  As far as european bathing goes, the ratio of good-looking topless women to creepy, fat, fully-clothed guys was surprisingly high.  I'm glad the guys were fully clothed, but it just seemed so obvious that they were there to stare at some breasts when they aren't even in swimming shorts.  Maybe it becomes more exclusive in peak season (fingers crossed).  Also, I have nothing against lesbians.  I just mentioned it because it seemed funny that one second I'm joking about going to the topless area and the next minute I'm watching these women rubbing oil all over each other.
Anyway, on to the rooms: beautiful.  We had a view of the Wynn golf course ($500\/round, apparently).   The beds were extremely comfortable.  The bathroom was full of glass and marble and had a toilet in a room off the main bathroom.  A desk, flat-panel TV, some chairs...everything I could possibly have use of.  The overall room was the perfect amount of space for two people.  And I'm not sure if this is standard in all hotels now, but there is a channel on TV that allows you to see who is playing poker and what tables are going (not with a live video feed, but with a text list).  Kinda neat.
As far as value, this obviously depends on what you pay.  I stayed in a regular room for $CA150\/night booked through expedia.  I think that was around $120US....well worth the price.  I think I would pay up to $250US during a busier time of year and still say it had good value.

BAIT AND SWITCH

To Whom it may concern:
I am not an individual that goes out of my way to complain, I am actually usually too quick to pay a compliment. What happened to me this past Friday was beyond disrespectful to me to just let it go.
I received a correspondence from your hotel toward the middle of October with the promotion Trip21.  I utilized this promotion to get two nights, a show and a buffet for my wife and I to celebrate our anniversary.
I called a total of three times. The first time I called, I inquired about dates, I was told the promotion was good for any day, I chose Friday the 15th and Saturday the 16th with show tickets on Saturday. I said I had to call back to make the final reservation
The second call I called asked to speak with the same person, the individual that I spoke with stated that he could help me. I completed my reservation.
The third call I called because that same individual charged me for both nights instead of the one. I wanted to make sure everything was ok.
On the 15th my wife and I drove out as we intended, we arrived at the Wynn to be told that all the systems were down and we had to wait. We waited over an hour for the systems to come up.
When the systems came up, we were told that our reservations had been made for Saturday and Sunday, and they had only recorded two of the three calls. I asked the people up front to see what they could do and to speak with a supervisor. They at no point let me listen to the tape.
Up to this point I was not upset, I was just trying to see if someone could help me.  In walks a ""supervisor"" by the name of Raymond (around 6 o clock). I had just gotten off the road of a 6 hour drive and I admit I was in a sweatshirt and flip flops. Raymond gave me second to explain and said "" Maybe a cheaper more inexpensive hotel would suit you better"". That is where I lost it. I asked to speak with his supervisor.  Misha Came and spoke with me and had the tough task of calming me down. She did great even though she was not able to honor the agreement I had made with your hotel. 
At this point I was a bit calmer, but it was a matter of principle. Anyway, I was able to go to my normal casino, and my rooms were comped, and I played a great deal there and was not made to feel cheap!!
This will be copied to Yelp and I am still deciding whether I should go farther than that.  Please advise me of what you are going to do to deal with this employee.",23,6,4

The best part about it was that my girlfriend and I got to stay here for free for one night and we were given $100 playing credit with no strings attached (about 2 months prior, we signed up for a ""Red Card"", the Wynn's player rewards card, and we got the offer via email).

The casino itself is very grand and the lobby is very high class.  We were offered fresh lemonade while waiting to check-in.

The real delight came when we got to our room.  Every room at the Wynn either has a view of Las Vegas Blvd. or the Wynn golf course and pool.  The room was not set up like the typical hotel room.  The bed was against a wall facing the window and view.  This is probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.  All the drapes were operated by remote control so you could sit in bed and enjoy the view without having to get up.  There was a large living room area and the bathroom even had an LCD television.

There are several fine restaurants including the Wynn Buffet and a small ice cream and sandwich shop named Sugar & Ice.  The Wynn also features a man-made waterfall that is beautiful and serene.  There are even nightly light shows taking place on the water that tingle the senses.

At first, I thought it was very vain for Steve to name the hotel after himself instead of some region (Mandalay Bay, Sahara, etc.), city (Paris, New York, NY, etc.), or some fantasy theme (Treasure Island, Excalibur, Mirage, etc.), but after visiting, all complaints have been thrown out the door and I just enjoy the Wynn for what it is...a world class hotel.",2,0,2

The chairs she was sitting in were not marked in any way. All they had to eat at the pool was pre packaged sandwiches and when you are allergic to certain things it makes it pointless.

The hotel is GORGEOUS. The room was luxurious and spacious, with modern decor and with panoramic views from the floor to ceiling window the made up the far wall. It was immaculately clean. The bathroom was also ultra-luxurious, with a nice tub, shower, and double sinks flanking a vanity area in the middle (which included a little stool and magnifying mirror). There was even a TV in the bathroom, leading my sister and I to joke that we could spend an entire day in there. 
We stayed mid-week in October, so we were able to get a rate below $150. I've paid much more and gotten much less in a room. 

We didn't get to spend that much time in the pool area, but there were multiple pools surrounded by beautifully manicured gardens.

No need to die and expect going to Heaven, just stay in this beautiful unique hotel. I can't even call it hotel. It's like a Disneyland. There is no reason to leaven the hotel. Las Vegas is Wynn. I planned this trip a way in advance, in my dream after the first visit a year ago.. i promised myself that somehow i will bring to this wonderland my parents from Russia. And i did it. I am not a rich or a huge gambler but when you are in love (with your dream) there is always a way!!! I got a very good deal as a Wynn insider and planned every single hour. From the minute you walk in the hotel your heart stops (in a good way). It's like a DisneyLand for adults. It was not busy (we stayed during the week) and not crowded (which i like). The Receptionist was super friendly (i promised to mention her name but unfortunately i forgot, she was asian woman) and she upgraded our room (always a good way to start your birthday bash). Our rooms were amazing as the last time we stayed on the high floor with the beautiful view. This room feels like 'YEAH I'AM IN VEGAS BABY!' I stayed in other hotels in Vegas and no one hotel can beat Wynn in my opinion. The service was excellent. I called housekeeping few times and they were helpful and responsive (i asked to help me to put birthday banner). Each corner of hotel is a piece of art. It's a mixture of different styles and i love it. I love the colours. I love the smells. It's a perfection. I respect good food and i can tell you that restaurants in Wynn are GOOD. Yes it's all pricy and it will cost you few months of rent (lol) but we need to love ourselves huh?!  I really like the cafe next to the pool (their lobster sandwiches are to die for.. sea bass tacos are mouthwatering... ah and gaspacho with jumbo shrimps is very good light option too). For my birthday dinner we went to Mizumi and it was excellent place to celebrate birthday. What a view, what a location! Love the interior and food was ok too. It was picturesque and very emotional. Their cocktails are really good. The buffet @Wynn is good. I am not a big fan of buffets but do it once for bfast or lunch. Line was 30 minutes but don't go too late and there won't be line at all. As last time i saw The Reve i was very keen to watch a new show 'Showstoppers'. Yes, it's ridiculously expensive but go and find a similar quality show somewhere else. Good. I loved it and even tears came out few times.. again it was soo emotional and my parents relaly enjoy it. The biggest reason i adore Wynn is the pool. It's the best pool ever in terms of temperature of water (just perfect.. in other hotels a bit too cold), design, great staff and attentive beautiful pool girls, excellent cocktails (my favourite is coconut mojito). I went once to the gym and it was awesome. One of my favorite gyms. I am avery well traveled person and been in 37 countries (lived in 7 for a long time) as i am an international dj and i can tell you that WYNN in Las Vegas rocks!!! I am not a big gambler but i don't mind playing craps.. =) Casino in Wynn is very classy though it looks modern with the tough of 30s like everything in Wynn. I can walk around Wynn and it's the best excursion ever! There is also adjusted second part of a hotel called Encore which is also great but for me Wynn is more classy. The lakeside restaurant is beautiful as well and fish was cooked perfect. I would love to see more options for sweet teeth in Wynn (like gourmet bakery or some exclusive pastry cafe etc etc).. could be nice (maybe there is one but i didn't find it). I didn't mention clubs but there are amazing pool parties in Encore beach clubs and there is a good vive in XS as well. I am a golfer and i heard they have a golf course with awesome clubhouse but i can't afford it at this point as it's crazy expensive. Maybe one day.. =) Anyway it is a huge emotional review but i thought i need to spend my time and do it as the whole trip teared me up. It's beautiful, it's a dream, it's unforgettable. I would like to say huge thanks to all staff, management and personal thank you to Mr. Wynn for creating such a PARADISE ON EARTH!!! BRAVO!",1,0,1

We purchased our trip through united airlines as a package that included a room upgrade. Upon arrival last night we also decided to purchase an additional upgrade for an extra $65 per night on top of what we already paid. This upgrade was suppose to be from a strip panoramic view to a larger corner room with a larger view.  The room was pretty but not really impressive for the cost and when I woke up in the morning and saw our view of a cement parking lot and construction site on one side and a half golf view on the other I was less than pleased. 
I called the front desk and the girl was kind and said she would move us to a strip view room when one became available, which she did. We packed our things and moved to a room that was much smaller and had sat empty as the air was not on, it was 84 degrees in the room and stuffy. Had some one been in that room and it was just cleaned, the air would have been on. This room was not being used.  Funny that at first we were told there were no rooms and after placing me on hold this room was suddenly available. The room is 3 star at best and I'm paying $300 per night for it. 
When I got to the new room I called the girl to let her know that the keys worked also let her know my thought on the room. I let her know that I was not going to pay an extra upgrade fee for this smaller non strip panoramic view (strip on one side only) room and she could move me to my originally purchased room. The poor nice girl who was caught in the middle of this dilemma gave me the choice to stay or move at the same cost. 
Because I am tired of all the moving and just want to get on with my vacation I opted to not move again. 
I'm so disappointed in what is suppose to be such an upscale facility. I came to Vegas and chose the Wynn for Class, Glitz, and Glam. So far I've seen none of that. 
I will never book a combined vacation again, as you are stuck pretty much. You've already prepaid and can't just check out and go somewhere else. 
I paid a higher price for a nicer place and didn't get it. 
My advice would be to stay at the Bellagio or any other pretty hotel on the strip. They are just as nice for less money. 
I may be stuck at this hotel but I will not be spending anymore of my money here.
I will not go to the Wynn shows, gamble here, eat or shop here. Except to use the resort credit that came with my package.

Let me first say that I love Hotwire as well because we got our room for a STEAL... when we first checked in I was getting nervous because everyone at the counters seemed so stressed out, the hotel was sold out for the night and they had problems finding rooms for the guests... we were at the counter for maybe 10 minutes and she was apologizing the whole time because they were totally sold out and so was their sister hotel, Encore.  She told us the only room she could give me was an upgraded suite but it was on a smoking floor which was totally okay with us.  She apologized and had someone go spray our room with extra freshener and if we ever needed it sprayed we could just call housekeeping.  The room was so pretty and very spacious!   The bathroom was almost the size of the room with a gigantic tub and a big shower with a bench inside as well.  They spoil you with an abundance of toiletries including toothbrushes, toothpaste, razor, shaving cream, shoe polish, a shoe shine kit, sewing kit, lotions, body creams, sprays, hair products... and a lot more... there were more toiletries by the tub like bath salts and crystals and in the shower there were even more shower gels and even loofahs!   I guess we didn't even need to pack anything, haha.  There was also complimentary bottle waters in the room... usually they would charge you an arm and a leg just for a bottle of water.  There were also a lot of personal touches... your name on your room key, when you turn on the tv it greets you with your name... and things that make you feel spoiled and special.  The hotel is also wonderfully decorated!  The carpets are the prettiest designs Ive seen in a hotel and the chandeliers are so beautiful!

First problem we had on check in we had booked together but got there to be told we were each being put on a different floor. Ouch not the start we had hoped for. 

We started the next day off in the pool area, we rented one of the circle pads in the water. We had a blast and the staff and pool were great. This was the highlight of our stay. Got to play some blackjack outside and that was very cool. After pool decided to gamble inside before we went out clubbing that night. I did OK but the dealers to me were very lacking, not fun or helpful, the other 4 places we gambled later that night were much better. The pit just had no energy, blah. 

The next morning we had the breakfast buffet for $19.99, I felt the food and service were good. 

That day ate lunch in the Cafe having an excellent hot dog and latte, felt it was better value than the lunch buffet. 

At night our AC was not working or was fixed to not go too cold, we could not get it below 74 that night, ouch what a bummer. That morning my other friends in the other two rooms complained the same thing. It was my thinking they had them fixed at that temp because it did the same thing our last night too. 

On the last night one of our friends went home early and the other person from his room was going to join us for the night in our room, so 3 (big guys) of us sleeping there. We had two doubles in our room and called the front desk to bring up a pull out bed for us and we were promptly told no can do, only king sized bed rooms are allowed an extra bed, wtf. We were tired and didn't really want to get into it with the staff so we just hung up pissed when they refused to work with us.

It was very disappointing since I shelled out $9 for French onion soup that was so-so and $12 for a chicken quesadilla sadly lacking in flavor and chicken. Plus, what's up with the reddish tortilla?  This better be indicative of some sort of tomato flavor.  Nope.  The only good thing about it, I suppose is it's huge.  

My friends enjoyed their spaghetti bolagnese and fish and chips but everything was overpriced.  $4.50 for iced tea?  C'mon, now! The only thing worth it here is it's quiet and quick.

(note, every time I'm at the Wynn, I can't help but think of the owner ruining that painting and how much the hotel looks like the Bellagio.  How declasse).",1,0,0

If you get a room with separate beds, the bed size is like a twin and a half - definitely not a full size bed nor a queen.  Which is quite disappointing because the room is actually quite big.  I assume they do that to deter having tons of people in one room, but still...  Also, the bed itself was quite uncomfortable.  My bed felt slouched in the middle.. for the amount you're paying to stay at this hotel, I guess I had higher expectations.

But does it really deserve to be there?  In a word:  absolutely.

The casino is one of the best in Vegas, with a superior layout that allows folks coming from all directions to have a clear path to get to the other side and a decor that is simply unmatched.  The rooms are decadent from the standard rooms to the beautiful suites that are luxurious enough for any king \/ queen, while flawlessly combining style and amenities. Tryst (formally La Bete) is easily the most posh lounge \/ night club with a tinge of elegance and one heck of a good time.   There are almost too many restaurants to pick from as they are all very good but extremely expensive.  Finally, their website is top notch and whoever put that beautiful piece of multimedia together (love the flash, voice overs, sleek design), deserves a good bit of money.

Two things separate the Wynn from its competition: the space itself and the service. Both are truly exceptional. From the sweeping landscape to the meticulous detail to the gorgeous pool and the impressively large and well-furnished rooms, the Wynn is among the world's elite hotels. The service, from the front desk staff to the waiters, everyone is friendly and professional. In particular, the blackjack dealers (even at the $10 table!) were the most personable I've ever met (not that I gamble a lot but most seem to have that dead fish-eye look... you know the one).

The noodle bar, often an afterthought in hotels, was a real standout. While most of these venues are designed to get gamblers in and out and back to the table, the thoughtful dishes of dim sum, noodles and more were well prepared and delicious.... so much that I ate there twice despite my being on an expense account.

Unfortunately, there were two issues that hold the Wynn back from a five-star rating. The first issue is the sound. While I had an excellent view from my strip-facing panoramic room, I could also clearly hear both the club 22 floors below me and the continuously looping ad blaring from the Fashion Mall across the street... ""I tried to do handstands for you"" has been stuck in my head since I left!

The second is being nickle-and-dimed to death. For a hotel as expensive as the Wynn, I was disgusted to have to pay for use of the Internet ($15\/day) and the gym ($30\/day!) Both were obscene. Because I was on business, I only used Internet access twice and never got to the gym, opting to walk the strip instead. I found the lack of paid amenities to be tacky in light of the rest of the hotel's opulence.

Es ist ein Luxushotel, das im Jahre 2005 eröffnet wurde und nach dem Immobilienmogul Steve Wynn benannt wurde. Gleich daneben ist das im gleichen Stil gebaute Schwesternhotel Encore.

Bei seiner Eröffnung war es das teuerste Hotel am Strip und auf der Welt. Mir war vor zwei Jahren nicht klar, dass dies ebenfalls ein Casino-Hotel ist, da das Wynn mit keinen von der Straße zu bewundernden Attraktionen Besucher anlockt. Sehr sehenswert ist der ""Lake of Dreams"", auf den Bilder projiziert werden.

Das Hotel steht für absolute Superlative in allen Bereichen und dem Gast soll hier nur das Beste geboten werden. Man kann hier Zimmer von mit 58 m² bis zu Suiten mit 650 m² buchen. Man kann hier einen Ferrari oder Maserati aus dem hauseigenen Fuhrpark für einen Ausflug mieten. Man kann auch den Golfplatz mit 18 Löchern nutzen oder sich von den dort arbeitenden Spitzenköchen verwöhnen lassen.

Im Hotel befindet sich die imposante Kunstsammlung des Erbauers und man kann Theaterproduktionen, eine Artistik Show oder die  Wasserrevue Le Rêve besuchen. Den Abend kann man auch in diversen exklusiven Nachtclubs ausklingen lassen.

Bei unserem Rundgang durch das Hotel sind wir erst durch eine exklusive Einkaufspassage mit Geschäften von Chanel und Louis Vuitton gelaufen und sind dann an Bars, tollen Restaurants, Hochzeitskapellen und einem gigantisch großen Casino mit 1.800 Spielautomaten und 26 Pokertischen vorbeigekommen. Alles wirkt hier sehr edel und das Publikum hier im Hotel ist sehr gehoben.

I had a business trip to the Wynn, and like many people who visit here I have little proclivity to gamble. I'm not really a drinker, and while I enjoy fine dining I prefer smaller, off-the-beaten-trail places to big blingy restaurants. But hell, this is Vegas ... and if I'm going to go big, I might as well do it right.

The Wynn's expansiveness includes a Ferrari dealership, boutiques for brands you may never have heard of (mutter the words ""Patek Philippe"" around your wristwatch snob friends and watch the eyebrows raise), and some really fantastic restaurants. The place is also a convention factory, meaning that there's always guaranteed to be a steady stream of convention goers, eyeing the casino warily.

And the casino. A dizzying blue of lights, bells, roars and sighs. A bit like the proverbial boat; a hole in the water into which you constantly throw money. I noted that it's almost impossible to get anywhere in the Wynn without walking through the casino. This was definitely deliberate.

But in terms of an actual hotel experience, the Wynn is top-notch. Our end room had two spectacular windows looking out over the city. The motorized curtains and automatically dimming lights make you feel like a movie star when you walk in the room. And the little cans of nuts and chocolate remind you that you're in Vegas ... where you pay for EVERYTHING.

(I calculated that taking all of the snack nuts would cost about $120.)

Yes, you pay for everything. Internet is $12 per day. Bottled water was $8 per bottle. And I'm pretty sure there was a toilet-flushing tax added onto my bill too.

So if you're heading to Vegas and you want to stay at the Wynn, I wholeheartedly encourage it; it's an experience you won't soon forget. Just make sure you bring a lot of Pesos, even if you don't plan on gambling.",0,3,0

I must say when the Wynn first opened, their buffet was first-rate. Took my son there to eat and got charged 45 and 25, respectively. It was one of the worst buffets I ate. The new hotels do this quite often: start out great, then suck the customers in, lower food quality and options considerably. The rack of lamb thats carved at a station used to be my favorite. The chef cut the meat in front of me and it was ICE COLD I mean almost like it was meant to be cold. Terrible. The sushi is a JOKE they should call it ""for people who have no clue what sushi is"" section. I know I cant and dont expect yellowtail sahimi, but how much imitation crab meat laced crappy california rolls can you stomach? Crab legs another item which used to taste great now its a disaster. All I taste is sodium and water, mixed in with a ""fishy"" crab which probably has been hangin around the freezer too long. But people are so dumb and blind they keep coming back, paying 1\/2 a c-note just to eat. Every single ""hot"" entree was anything but, ranging from lukewarm to dead cold, just disgusting. Lots of quantity, minimal quality, just doesnt suit the Wynn. But again, once you make a good name, its hard to bring down and thats the case here clearly.
Pool is good, clearly one of the least noisy and spacious pools in Vegas, and of course, towels are on the seats at 9am so good luck after that finding any shade.
Casinos. You know a dealer on the blackjack table once told me here ""you dont look like youre having fun"" I told her ""lady, I am not here to have fun I am here to win money"" For me I take playing blackjack on the tables seriously and get in a ""war"" mode. I leave the standing on soft 17's and standing on 16 vs dealer 10 to the sorry saps that boosts the casinos profit. I am a casual card-counter, and the double deck tables at the wynn and encore are decent, with good penetration but, like most casinos now, they have changed the stand on S17 rule to H17, which drives me fcuking crazy. These bastards are doing everything they can to not give you a tiny, microscopic chance of winning anything. The limits are awful, minimums are $50 before 9am and after that its all $100. I strolled to the encore to find 3 empty tables---thats 18 seats, of double deck $100 21. I asked the boss kindly if he can lower limit to ONE table to $50, he said no, jerk-off. Had dinner another night at Stratta, which was packed so assumed food was to die for. It was very average food disguised as Italian cuisine. Highlight was watching Steve Wynn enter and sit across us with his single-mom bimbo new 38-yr old gold-digger. Also, the cafe is decent but hardly memorable.

Well, at least a wealthy person! Lol.

Rooms here can be pricey (worth every penny), but if you sign up online for the Wynn membership (it's free), they'll send you offers of up to 75% off.  

The food here is also amazing - whether you eat at the buffet or at one of their restaurants.

I haven't mentioned how beautiful this hotel is, but it's one of the most gorgeous in Vegas. They have a flower motif that will dazzle you.  In addition, they have fountains, waterfalls, and a lake - with water shows nightly.

Can't recommend the Wynn hotel enough. It's always my first choice when I come to Las Vegas.",5,0,2

It wasn't just the smart spacious layout of their rooms, I also felt like the staff was unbelievably courteous when compared to other facilities.  

I guess only diamonds last for ever because I am so grossly disappointed in how fast things have gotten changed around! From the valet attendant who was totally taking advantage of his position and extorting money from the guests, to the waitress who had her fingers in our drinks and gave us an attitude when we asked her to change them, to the security guard who was giving all kinds of trouble to the guests who got their cars before he did (first place I've seen providing valet service for employees but not for the paying guests!??!).

All in all, it's over people, it's FINISHED! The Wynn, which used to be the best hotel for their service and attention to details has become another suck hole like all the other facilities.

What a shame as I used to even talk about how good this place WAS! Good riddance, you should've monitored your staff a lot better.",10,12,1

A quick run down:

The buffet - it is what it is cracked up to be.  It was totally un-need and unwarranted but I probably ate $100 worth of crab legs alone.  A nice selection of food choices but I might stay away if I were vegetarian or vegan, it didnt look very friendly to those dining choices.

The hotel rooms - Nice rooms, not the fanciest but very well done.  No complaints.  Our view from the 53rd floor and my parents view from the 52nd floor was amazing, the best view I have ever had of the Strip.  

The service - Everyone was helpful, the dealers, bartenders, front desk staff, etc.  

The ""European"" Pool - This would be my first visit to a stateside top ""optional"" swimming pool.  Complete with outdoor Blackjack tables, craps tables, poker tables and a full service bar, what else could a guy want? ;)

The crazy - The woman playing $500 minimum per hand Blackjack for 15+ hours straight.  

The bad - I had made an attempt to take my parents to the Grand Canyon on one of the days of our visit.  I was provided with directions to the Grand Canyon from the Concierge Desk  which turned out to be incorrect (read: TERRIBLE) directions.  This resulted in a 8 hour boondoggle and never actually seeing the Grand Canyon.  To top it off the return directions on the sheet provided were even incorrect on how to get back to the property.  

I raised this to the manager of the Concierge Desk desk and explained how it wasted a day of our vacation, etc.  She was unable to help me immediately but deferred me to the manager of the entire property.  About an hour later I received a call from the manager of the hotel who apologized profusely, etc.  They ended up compensating us somewhat but in the end I do not think 100% due to the error.  

My expectation when visiting (and paying for) a property of this caliber, things like directions to a popular National Park will be 110% correct.  The manager of the Concierge Desk admitted that the directions were Map Quest directions that they had not checked out on their own, needless to say I was pissed.

Would I go back?  Sure, I liked the general vibe of the property and I would be willing to give it another try, regardless of the heinous error on the driving directions.",0,0,0

I was in Vegas a few weeks ago for a conference, and basically did not leave the premises.  Why would I?  The Wynn has positively everything you could need for a top-flight Vegas experience.

Let's start with the rooms themselves.  My colleague and I stayed in the Tower Suites, in a room that I can safely say is the nicest hotel room I've ever stayed in.  Huge (2000 square feet), beautifully decorated, floor-to-ceiling windows offering views of the Strip and the mountains, full wet bar, separate room with massage table (regrettably not used), and spectacular bathrooms.  Throw in a full kitchen, and I could have lived there.

The service was also first-rate.  We found ourselves constantly pampered by a bevy of attendants, delivering us free chocolate, attending to our every need, and making our experience completely stress-free.

Now, turning to the rest of the complex.  The Wynn casino (despite have no cheap craps tables!) is awesome - it manages to somehow be elegant and non-cheesy, and the dealers are the most personable I've found in town.  The Wynn has a selection of outstanding restaurants, covering a variety of different cuisines and price ranges (expensive, very expensive, and are you kidding me?).  The Tryst nightclub located in the resort is my favorite on the Strip - despite the eye-popping prices.  It's also nice to know that if I need to pick up a Ferrari, I don't need to leave the hotel to do so!

I have no intention of staying (and playing) anywhere else on my future visits to Vegas!",0,0,0

I had some family in town so we decided to do a little stay-cation sans mini-me(s).  After much debate, we all finally agreed on the Wynn; mostly because of the location (across the street from Fashion Show Mall and the Venetian\/Palazzo).  

First, the hotel:  It is gorgeous.  Gorgeous and classy.  The rooms were large enough to include a spacious sitting area that would comfortably seat 5 adults (we didn't all stay in one room, but we all hung out together to visit\/make plans\/etc.  This is pretty standard for the major hotel\/casinos on the strip, but still worth mentioning.  If you are a hotel guest, Wi-Fi is included in your resort fee for a couple of devices, but it's not the best signal.  

Restaurants\/Cafes: We wanted to grab a quick breakfast before spa day, so we stopped at the cafe on the Lobby level.  It was very busy, the line was out the door.  We ordered some baked goods (that were served cold), a smoothie, and an iced tea and then waited approximately 45 minutes to an hour for the drinks.  The barista was not filling orders as they came in, but rather whenever she felt like it and in whatever order she wanted.  As the orders kept piling up, she took a break to the back, cleaned the sink, counter, and dishes, and moved about with no purpose whatsoever.  It was disappointing.  I will say that on previous occasions, I dined at Allegro (after a show) and had a much different experience-- much better service and food.  Also, if you can't decide on a meal, the buffet is very nice (kinda noisy, but... it's a buffet) and has a very large selection and the food is high quality for a buffet. 

The POOL:  If you get to the hotel before check-in time, get yourself a pool pass and head to the pool.  If you can, reserve a CABANA!!!  It is $400 (summer rates) for the day.  It's a little open room with a mini-fridge (stocked with water, gatorade, and soft drinks--included in the price), TV, sofa, small table, chairs, and a patio with 4 loungers and a high-pressure misting system.  You also get a little fruit plate around lunch time that is also included in the cost.  There's an abbreviated menu for lunch and snacks though, and you can order drinks (for some of the stuff, gratuity is included--make sure to ask when they hand you the bills).  The attendants are AMAZING.  Our attendant (Kristin, I hope I spelled it right) even found us in the pool to ask if we needed\/wanted anything, called to check on the status of our room (saving me a trip to the lobby), and was super friendly and professional.  She really set the bar for hostesses.  The pool itself was clean, quiet (reasonably so), and family friendly.  If you do bring children though, police them yourself.

The Grown-ups' Pool (topless):  Located on the far end of the main pool, through the bar, this is an adults only area (21+).  You can also reserve a cabana here but the prices are different.  For the same price as the cabana at the main pool, we reserved SEATS (a large round lounger and 3 regular loungers).  You get water and gatorade, but it comes in an ice bucket and the service was much slower and less attentive than at the main pool.  The pool was dirty.  There were cups, straws, and large bits of food and drink garnishes (I stepped on a pineapple rind, french fries, and a pickle) floating around in it.  There were also several very drunk adults who NEVER LEFT the pool.  I don't know about you, but if I'm drinking all day long, at some point I usually need to go find a lavatory to relieve myself.  Um, yeah.  I will say that the lifeguards at this pool were very quick to respond to any incident.  The border around the pool is very slippery, the hubs fell getting into the pool and the lifeguard was there in about a half second to make sure he was alright.  Another lifeguard was quick to stop a developing game of chicken-fighting (some drunk girl climbed up on some drunk guy's shoulders, we were all waiting for her to fall off and knock her head on the edge of the pool).  

Honestly, I was going to give this an overall 4-star rating but Kristin (our Cabana hostess) really did a fantastic job, so the 5-stars is for her.   Thanks for making our pool day the highlight of our stay-cation!",3,1,2

The rooms are super comfortable, with wonderful Strip views, and overall the property is managable in scale so you don't feel like you are walking miles just to get to your room.  I like this end of the Strip also -- right across from NM and the mall, and not too far from Caesar's Forum.

The pool area is perfectly relaxing -- love the misters and the meandering pool. For Vegas, the crowd that stays here is fairly sophisticated. A LOT of Chinese at Christmas time.

Enjoyed cocktails in  the up and down parasol bars, however we only tried the deli and coffee shop (?) restaurant. The deli is actually quite good, perfect for grabbing lunch after checkout. The coffee shop restaurant (the one above the pool area) however, has atrocious service -- loooong waits, wrong dishes, etc.. While I'm sure the Big Gun restos at Wynn are wonderful, it's not too long a walk over to Palazzo and The Venetian where we always do a Batali place such as B+B.

As for shops: Chanel, Graff, Brioni, Hermes...great eye candy.

I'd have to add the Wynn to my list. And I'm sure the Encore would be there also.

This hotel was well thought out by Steve Wynn. I actually visited them as a vendor during the design phase, and remember the incredible attention to detail. Now, long after that opening, I've finally stayed there, and I can say that I see why my family told me that it was ""really nice."" From the electric-draw drapes to the spotlessly clean bathroom, to the TV screen near the sink area, I was impressed. They've also provided upgraded mattresses and bedding, which if you're interested in actually sleeping while in Vegas, is a big plus!  :-o

Since I don't gamble much, I appreciated the smaller, more tasteful and less commercial looking casino. And thankfully, it doesn't take 15 minutes just to get from the elevators to the front or side entrances. It's not a botique hotel, but also not another mammoth operation like the MGM or NY NY. Caesars is huge too, but given how they've maintained their high facilities and service level all these years, I've included them in my list of favorite hotels.

Again, if I had to stay on the strip, and I could secure reasonable rates as we did this past week... I'd strongly consider a re-stay. (Someone in the family gambles...not enough for a comp'd room, but attractive enough to catch my interest... and it worked.)",5,1,4

I asked the bartender at a bar inside of the Wynn about prices of wine and he called a store in the Wynn and handed me a napkin with the prices, years and names of every wine that they had to match my request. The service is like no other and well worth the investment since the prices for the Wynn are much higher than other hotels in the area. The bed was wonderful, but be careful trying to sit in it because if you are not tired you will fall asleep anyway!

It truly is an experience.  The french pressed coffee was rich and bold.  They will make you whatever you desire.  For a true indulgent go with the hot fudge sundae, a true classic but served in such a fun yummy way.

Staff:

Incredible friendly from the bell desk, concierge, room service, maid service, casino, etc.  Everyone is their to make your trip one that you will never forget.

Pool:

A great place to go and relax, they have a huge bar area which also has some gaming which is a lot of fun to do outside with a real beachy atmosphere.  Cocktail waitresses walk around and will even serve you in the pool.  You can also order food and if your really feeling like the ultimate experience, go with a cabana.  It is much cheaper during the week and starts at 150.00 for half day.  This gets you a nice room, lounge chairs, fruit, water and personal service.  They have a lot of room to roam, but best to get here early or ask one of the staff members to find you a lounge chair cause it does get crowded.

Shopping:

Imagine stores that appeal to everyone but afforded by the rich.  They have high end stores from Dior to Men, the only Rolex store to Cartier and Chanel.  Its a lot of fun to browse through but you need to bring the cash to afford anything.

Dining:

So many restaurants to choose from Daniel, Alex, Red 8, Terrace Point Cafe, Buffet, etc.  It has every type of food from Italian, Continental, Chinese, Japanese and American.  They even have a shoppe that makes delicious homemade chocolates and a coffee bar.

Entertainment:

Le Reve is their Cirque O Le style show which I highly recommend.  It was absolutely amazing, the production was perfect.  The music was intents and the performers were so very talented.  

Spamalot is also available which is a musical from Monty Pylon.  I haven't had the chance to see this but heard it is funny and very entertaining.

Club:

Tryst- This was gorgeous, but very hard to get into.  They have a decent sized dance floor, but the outdoor area is what really sells you.  Imagine two huge waterfalls with comfy couches and light show to relax and listen to a DJ who really knows how to spin a variety of music from hip hop, rock, 80's to reggae.  It was the most fun ever.  They had lots of beautiful people and the drinks were 15.00 and up.  The VIP section I heard was extremely expensive but it looked worth it, only if you can afford to drop 3,000.

SPA\/GYM:

I didn't get to use this amenities on my trip, but from what friends told me, it was incredible from the massage, facials, manicure\/pedicure to the sauna room.  The gym had a lot of equipment and you might even spot celebrities using it.  You do have to pay for the gym, but if you have a spa treatment you can use the gym on that day no extra charge.

Overall:


I was so spoiled staying at THE WYNN and it was truly hard to venture out of the hotel.  Once you stay here you will not be able to stay anywhere else in VEGAS.  Spend a little more and enjoy the WYNN experience, also note you have to ask for a great room with a view of the Strip on the highest floor you can get.  You won't be sorry.",2,0,2

Russell Westbrook gambling in the casino? Check. 

deadmau5 DJing at XS, the Wynn's swankiest nightclub? Check.

Gardens to disguise the casinos? Check. 

AMAZING room service menu, which I might be biased toward because it included amazing corned beef hash which is my favorite? Check. 

Full window curtain control via remote for those mood-changing moments? Check.

Comfy humongous bed that not only looks swank but also makes you never want to get out of bed? Check. 

Humongous tub and stand-up see-through shower in case you want to look at each other while bathing and showering at the same time? Check. 

Squeaky clean, so clean that you can eat off of the floors? Check. (not that I did that... ahem)

First off, I was given a room on the 36th floor, one of the best.  I mentioned that I am a light sleeper, and the gentleman at the front desk gave me a room facing the golf course.  He said, ""We can't do much about the partyers coming in at 2:00 a.m., but we can put you on the quieter side where it's less frequent.""  I had some of the best shuteye of my life in that room.

Second, they go above and beyond with the toiletries and amenities.  There are the usual suspects - lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner - along with shoe polish, a nail file, a face clothe, and Qtips for easy make-up removal.  The television offers several options (although they need to add the E! channel), along with 7 different types of music for all tastes.

Third, try the restaurants.  I had dinner with a friend I hadn't seen in 2 years at Bartoletta's, an Italian restaurant specializing in seafood from the Mediterranean.  We dined on the purple snapper, which is prepared tableside, and comes with roasted potatoes and steamed vegetables.

The only criticism I would mention is that guests are overcharged for use of the workout facility.  I was charged $15.00 for a workout, which is a cost that should either be absorbed by the hotel for its guests' use, or the fee should be added onto the room cost.  That is a basic amenity that can be found at even the most frequented hotel chains in America.

However, that small criticism was not enough to deduct even one star.  I was thoroughly pleased with my stay, and the courtesy of the staff.  Top notch.",0,0,0

It was my first visit to this hotel, typically preferring the Aria as of late and in many ways, I was impressed.  However enough went wrong that I am leaving quite disappointed.

I went to Las Vegas for business, basically 36 hours.  The rate at the Wynn was very reasonable and it was convenient to several of our appointments.  We arrived in the late morning and they didn't have any rooms ready.  You can't ding a hotel for that. . .that is just being petty.  But when you let them know that you will be flexible to get a room early, you agree to take two doubles instead of a king bed, are promised a text in an hour, don't get one for five hours, and then wind up with the room type that you did not request. . .well, you can ding them for that.

The hotel itself is quite nice. . .the hallways are very well done, rich colors and nice furnishings.  But having been to LV several times, I was surprised at how smoke filled the common areas were.  You had no choice but to walk thru the clouds to get to the elevators.  Ding number two.

The room. . .very nice.  Well furnished, well thought out.  Not the largest rooms on the strip but size is overrated (insert joke here), it is really about what you do with the space.  But, the air conditioning did not work as well as it should have so the room never really got cool enough to be comfortable.  Ding number three.

Then there is the minibar and the room service charges. . .$5 for a coke?  $8 for a piece of candy?  $25 for a pot of coffee???  Yeah, the Wynn is expensive. . .I get that.  But at what point is the juice simply not worth the squeeze?  Ding number four.

Ok, so four dings but they can be overlooked because truly, the hotel is nice, convenient, the room rate itself was good and the facilities really nice.  But here is what really dinged the Wynn.  Getting back to my hotel room at 11:30pm (remember, I was on business), I heard the noise coming from the pool \/ club on the second level.  I should mention that I was in room 5160.  I managed to fall asleep being tired enough but I woke up at 2AM because the music just seemed to be getting louder.  Finally at 3AM I called the front desk and this was the answer:

""Yeah, the nightclub on the pool level gets pretty loud on Sunday and Monday nights.  We have been tracking this over the last couple of months to see which rooms get the loudest.  Above the 50th floor (really I think it is the 40th floor given the weird numbering system) and right around your room is the worst.  I will mark it down and we can let the next guest know that this room can get pretty loud.  It should be done by 4AM.""  

Pause. . .

""We could move your room.  I see you have a wake up call at 5:15am. . ..but you could still get a couple of hours sleep.""

Pause. . .

""Or we could just refund you for the one night.""

Ok. . .I wasn't looking for the discount but really?  You have been doing a study?  And you didn't think to warn someone in Las Vegas on business that the room might be a tad bit loud until 4AM?   I do appreciate the gesture of giving me my money back, but damn!

So. . .given that they did try to make it right, I will go with three stars.  It really wasn't special enough to warrant four stars, especially given the prices.  And I need to take a nap now after writing this review!

The Wynn is just classy.  Even the restrooms are fabulous.  Whether you choose to drive to the resort or walk to this resort, you will not regret it.  Just do not go over your budget, if you choose to gamble.  I recommend the Wynn for a fine tourist destination in Vegas.",4,3,3

ROOMS: If I could afford it, I would live in a Salon Suite in the Wynn Towers for the rest of my life. My first time going to Vegas over 21+, I was spoiled silly being able to stay in the Salon Suite courtesy of one of my high-roller friends. I pretty much ruined it for myself because nothing can ever live up to that experience again. From the impeccable service, to the amazing floor to ceiling views, and plush carpet that feel like heaven after 4+ hours of standing in 4 inch heels, everything about the Wynn screams luxury fit for a princess. And at an average rate of $800\/night for this Suite, it better.

I've also stayed in the more affordable Deluxe Resort King at the Wynn and the Resort Suite King at the Encore, the attached sister hotel. Both are a downgrade from the size and amenities of a larger suite, but are still very comfortable and provide the same immaculate quality of service. 

THEME: The hotel itself is quite spacious and feels much airier than some of the other hotel casinos. The theme is classic with a modern twist, so both young and older patrons will feel comfortable, which may not be the case in some of the newer hotels such as the ultra-modern Cosmopolitan. 

CASINO: I'm not a big gambler so I can't say much about the quality of the tables here except that the minimums are higher than average for the strip.

FOOD: ""Affordable,"" the food options here are not. However, there are some flavorful choices that won't break the buck. I particular enjoy the Red 8 Asian Bistro for their Braised Pork Knuckle with Taiwanese Flat Noodle Soup. Of course, the award-wining Wynn Buffett is worth a stop if you want a quintessential Vegas Buffet experience. With the onset of newer buffets opening, I wouldn't say it's the best buffet in the city, but it's convenient if you're staying here and like crab legs. Unfortunately, staying here will not give you discounts to any of their restaurants. 

CLUBS: Wynn and Encore are home to 3 nightclubs: XS, Surrender, and Tryst, and 1 dayclub: Encore Beach. Staying at either hotel allows you to use a special entrance when entering XS and Encore Beach which can be lifesaving if the line is ridiculously long (always). If you are a guest, you can also request complimentary tickets when you check in and they may or may not have some available depending on the day of week, headliner, etc. 

Of the 3 nightclubs, XS is the largest, most popular, and my favorite. During the winter months, when they close the outside, it can get extremely stuffy so I would recommending getting a table to avoid getting your feet stomped on. But in the summer, there's tons of space and its a much nicer experience. The best part of XS is their Sunday Night Swim which is basically a big pool party at night. You are encouraged to wear your bathing suit (under your clubbing outfits) and splash around to the sweet, drunken melody of EDM. 

Surrender and Tryst are much smaller and underwhelming when compared to the behemoth that is XS. Both are nice options however, if you're with a group of guys wanting to pay less. Surrender gets better headliners and opens up to Encore Beach in the summer. 

Encore Beach Club (EBC) is an awesome dayclub. Yes, their drinks are overpriced and there are suspicious things floating in the water, especially later in the evening, but it's beautiful, I don't have to wear heels, and the DJs are pretty much touching distance. It's huge compared to some of the other day clubs so it's never too squished in the water.  

OVERALL: If you can afford it, this the place to stay in Vegas.",7,0,2

The swimming pool areas were really cool. So it happens that my family and I was walking to the pool area and the first spot we walked into was surprisingly the nude pool. I didn't realized it until I turned around and saw something out of left field. The bar\/gambling area separates the nude pool and regular pool. So if you're adventurous, go for it :-)

The reason why I didn't give it five stars is because you have to pay for using the gym. Come on, even with some some in vegas have to squeeze in personal gym time !

They work solely on tips. I went to the restaurant and enjoyed one of the best meals of my life for a little under two hours (see my SW Steakhouse review for the delectable details!). The valet was an extremely convenient option versus self parking and walking some distance. The restaurant is really close to the valet entrance.

After dinner, I hit the casino floor in hopes of recuperating some of the $300 I had just spent on my meal. I told myself I was going to gamble $100 only, which usually turns out to be a disastrous attempt at self control (one word: ATM).

Wynn boasts the latest in slots, video poker, roulette, and table games (blackjack, pai gow, etc). There is a wide selection of games, and friendly staff. Getting a player card is a breeze, and I've never had a machine malfunction on me. Overall a great place to play slots and video poker. Don't forget to indulge in some free drinks while you're playing; just remember to tip your cocktail server.

I put $100 into a roulette machine. I like a system of betting 2 of the 3 grouped number fields, i.e. 1st 12, 2nd 12, or 3rd 12. This way you have a 2\/3 chance of winning one unit on every spin. For example bet $20 on 1st 12 and $20 on 2nd 12. If you win, you win $20. If you lose, you lose $40. I've gone on a winning streak of $800 before at the Wynn using this system, betting in $20 increments. That means I won a total of 40 units. Be cognizant of the 0 and 00. These put you at slightly less than 2\/3 odds to win. Tonight's session didn't work out so well. After numerous bets, I was down to $60 and decided to cut my losses. I moved on to my favorite casino video poker machine - 100 play draw poker.

*Do not gamble. Gambling typically results in loss of money. (Author assumes no responsibility for anyone ignoring this advice.)

On previous visits I have noticed about four different 100 play draw poker machines at the Wynn. I saw one and immediately sat down. They're usually pretty popular so I was surprised I found an open one right away. I was only betting $5 per hand in order to try to stick to my $100 limit. So with my remaining $60 I began my 100 play draw poker adventure.

I was getting dealt crap and was down to $15. On the next, magical hand, I was dealt four 8's. So my $15 jumped up to $260. I played a few more hands and lost $10. I started with $100 in the roulette machine, and left the draw poker machine with $250. $150 profit. I was a happy camper and got the hell outta there. In essence, my $300 SW Steakhouse meal only cost me $150! That's a win in my book!

After having 3 kids, both my desire and resources to gamble have dwindled. I was super happy to replenish $150 and leave. I turned in my valet ticket, and my car resurfaced 5 minutes later. I tipped the driver and was on my way.

As of 12\/24\/14, only three restaurants in the U.S. offer certified, authentic Kobe beef. Wynn has two of the three (SW Steakhouse and Mizumi).

I've seen Le Reve at the Wynn and it's a beautiful, skillful show. It's almost as good as any cirque du soleil production.

For a man who is virtually blind, Steve Wynn has precise, creative vision when it comes to the hotel and gaming industry. His properties are some of the best in the world. I highly respect the man and trust any resort with his name on it.

I've stayed at the Wynn several times before and have always enjoyed myself. The rooms are clean and elegant. My parents have a long standing history with Wynn resorts. This relationship goes back to the Bellagio, Treasure Island, and the Mirage. We must've stayed at the Mirage at least ten or eleven times in the 90s. When Steve Wynn opened up his namesake hotel, my family came here and have enjoyed it ever since. Wynn Las Vegas is classy, professional, and top flight. I highly recommend this or Encore for a stay in Las Vegas.",13,3,5

The pool  was cool.  They had misters to cool thee from the heat.  The only thing I think that should change is everywhere they played music, it was all cover bands turned into disco music.  The elevators really had elevator music too!  Why not the original artist?  Maybe that is not as, I do not know... help me with this adjective..um, anyway.

We inadvertently left our iPad in the nightstand drawer when we checked out and, upon arriving at the airport a short time later, called lost and found who indicated housekeeping had not checked it in yet. Our friends still at the hotel also attempted to retrieve it, but were told they too had to wait for housekeeping. Awaiting a return call, I also left a msg when we arrived home that evening, knowing time was of the essence. I followed up the next morning, as no one returned my call, and was told that nothing has been turned in. I was directed to Guest Claims to file a claim, which I did, and also a police report, yet they confirmed no one had checked into our room yet. Even though a ""thorough"" investigation was to take place, I received a call the next day saying that they would be happy to provide an insurance letter because they simply could not ""accuse"" anyone of impropriety and nothing was found, however the fact is that it didn't disappear into thin air. Each time I have called, they either had my name or check out date incorrect, which leads us to believe that they never had any intention of restoring our item to us.
Honestly, I would have never expected this from the Wynn. While the facility was lovely, this behavior is unacceptable. I even left a message for Christopher Fox, the assistant manager 6 days ago to review the matter, but never received a call back. This lack of concern and frankly, dishonesty, is appalling. Judging from several other recent reviews, the theft is becoming an epidemic.
It's a shame that a supposed luxury resort would conduct itself this way, just awful. We went to great lengths to go on this trip with friends after a family tragedy and this only made it worse. Shame on you, Wynn.",5,0,0

When I checked in, I was greeted with some coffee. I was confused since there isn't really a formal line to check in or check out. You kind of just walk up to whatever is open. The clerk was very friendly and upgraded me to a resort view room. He gave me some passes to Blush, though I really wanted Tryst passes.

The room key that they give you doubles as your players card, so you can build up comps. Pretty cool except that the games here are very high limit. The dealers are friendly and the cocktail waitresses are very attractive.

Anyways, the room I had was great. Fully stocked bathroom with random crap. The TVs are cool, they have your name on it, same with the telephone.

Casino: 4.5
Rooms: 3

First I'll do the casino area. Like I said, it's beautiful and classy and personally, I just like the dealers here better. Maybe I just got lucky but most of the dealers I had were very friendly and helpful. Usually I never gamble but my brother got me into it and I learned how to play craps and now I'm addicted! Anyway, I know this really isn't according to casinos but I liked that the dealers would help me out, explain craps to me, give me pointers, etc. Note** If you ever play craps, it's definitely more fun to play at an energetic table. Serious players = no fun = really sad and boring game.

Now the review for the rooms. The rooms are nice but they aren't anything spectacular to me. There was a TV in the bathroom which was pretty sweet and two sinks (GREAT for big groups of girls since we like to hoard the bathroom mirrors) But honestly, I prefer suite rooms, especially if you're going to go with a big group.

When I found out our work group was staying here I was so happy. My room was amazing and the view was breathtaking. But what brought me the most joy was laying in bed and opening and closing the automatic shades and curtains. Honestly I could lay there all day and have a blast. I guess it's the little things that make me happy. In all of my world travels that is one feature I have never really seen in a hotel. 

Steve Wynn spares no expense and everything is top notch in any of his properties. He understands his customers are willing to pay for the good life. Steve provides that good life here. He plays videos on the in-room TV where he describes the hotel. After 4 days of non-stop talking in the dry weather my voice starts to sound like Steve Wynn. I crack up all my co-workers with doing hilarious versions of Steve's TV speeches. I love Vegas for laughs with co-workers. 

This hotel is amazing but expensive too. The room is great. It is so luxurious I want to stay here all of the time. The bathroom is huge too. I enjoy the amazing views of the mountains and it's such a great sight to see when I wake up. 

The hotel has some restaurants inside. There is one we always go too but that's because you can get a bag of hot donuts after dinner. Those things are so good. There's also a nightclub but I've never been to it. Work seems to always get in the way of business trips. Damn work. 

I do use the gym\/spa though. It is a little expensive at $20 a day but I need to get my workout in. I will work in breakfast there too with some fresh fruit and a coffee. So it kind of works out because it might actually cost me $20 to just order that food for breakfast. My mornings are not complete until I've gotten my six mile run in.  So as unhealthy as Vegas can be between the amount of food and late nights this gym puts me right back on my healthy track. Which is derailed by the end of every evening...ha!!!

So if you're looking for a great place to stay in Vegas then this is the place to stay. It will make you feel like a king. I wish I could spend more time hanging here then actually working off-site. They use to have a free shuttle through the golf course to the convention center. That was the best but it's now gone. It made my work day so easy. Now I have to take the scary convention bus in traffic or a taxi to get to the show. Steve if your listening bring the bus back!!!",23,20,26

Sophistication meets relaxation. With all the dayclub pool parties popping up at nearby hotels, sometimes you just want a nice pool to relax in (although there is a DJ in the European pool end). The layout of the pool ensures that you will get some shade in the water under the bridges. The water was the perfect temperature- lots of hotels get the water temps wrong and make it so cold that you don't even want to go in, but it was just perfect :)

Mind you, we've never stayed at the Wynn before, but the deal we got included a discounted rate for two nights, a $75 dining credit to Andreas (a fancy Asian themed restaurant in the hotel), and two tickets to Le Reve.  To say this was a good deal is an understatement.

This is a posh hotel, but we didn't feel out of place at all.  It's comfortable and all the staff we encountered was more than friendly and accommodating.  Check in was smooth and our room request was granted (looking for a quiet room with a view).  The decor in the casino and throughout the hotel is top notch.  It's not overly done, just inviting and beautiful.  The flowers and high end atmosphere is really well done.

Once we got to our room, we were blown away.  It is so nice. I loved the fresh, clean vibe.  I would pick the furniture\/decor for my own home, if only I could afford it.  The  White leather with pops of color on the walls is spot on.  The view, even from the 14th floor was great.  The best part... the drapes and lights close with push of a button.  You can operate your privacy sign\/service request as well as the air conditioning with a push of a button right by your bedside.  One thing to not however, is that though the hotel is very quiet, it is in the flight path for the airport.  Planes are flying overhead all the time as are helicopters... not a problem, but they are noticeable for sure - bring ear plugs if you are sensitive.

All of the restaurants a the hotel that we ate at were great (see other reviews).  The show was excellent, unique and interesting.  The pool is comfortable, upscale, and super nice - it was quite enjoyable laying out at the start of our day.  In fact, I'd love to experience one of their cabanas some day.  Honestly, we had a great time at the Wynn.  I'm not sure I can stay anywhere else in Vegas going forward... it was that good!",2,2,0

On the other side is The Mirage, where the volcano exploding every hour may awaken anyone who hasn't taken a sleeping aid.

For those that don't like long reviews, here's a summary:
this hotel, specifically their customer service is S***!!!

GOOD
- looks really nice; lobby smelled great
- Room looked pretty nice, tv in bathroom, nice tub, remote for curtains
- panoramic view

BAD (i hope u'r ready for this)
- nobody to help w\/ luggage.....grab your bags, drag 'em to the door, open the door, hold it open, get bags in....repeat for second set of doors
- no organization @ registration
- had reservation for 2 full sized beds in non smoking area.....got one king sized bed in a smoking optional floor (same thing happened to a few families w\/ kids)
- $15 a day to use internet
- $30 to use the gym (either daily or per use)
- Dummy working the hallway by the elevators greets me with a ""what's up bro?""......I'm not your bro you jagoff....I'm a hotel guest, now go get that oversized purple sportcoat tailored and learn proper communication w\/ hotel guests
- towels smelled like they've been sitting in someone's trunk for a few years
- desk area smelled like a low budget nursing home
- bathroom walls dirty
- toilet flush didn't work a few times
- shower door didn't close all the way
- Concierge was a worthless POS; did not really provide us w\/ any type of service. Said we were placed on the guestlist for club, but club said there is no guestlist when we got there. If our friend didn't have a table there, we'd be in line for at least an hour
- asked for shaving cream, they said 15 minutes; 40 minutes and 2 phone calls later, after I start yelling, worst shaving cream in the world is dropped off w\/in 5 min.
- Jerkoff old man working the craps table made a few racist comments (if there weren't so many cameras, I'm sure someone would've punched his combover off his bald head)
- Cocktail waitresses old and miserable....hate themselves, their jobs, and the rest of us
- They don't check ID when someone is charging meals to a room (at the restaurants), so someone ended up charging a meal to our room
- Express checkout - noticed the charge from restaurant....called to clear it up and were told that we had to go downstairs to check out (will update when the results of their ""investigation"" are in)
- stood in line for over an hour (there were only 4 people in front of us), idiot working the front didn't know what she was doing. 8 lines, not moving, nothing dividing the lines......whatever issue you have, pick a line and get in
- noticed a lot of people had been charged for things they didn't order
- overall customer service is S**T....seriously....!!!! you might as well take a dump on the front counter, give it a name badge, phone, and computer and let people come to it for assistance
- Of all the hotels, motels, gas stations, and street vendors I've been to.......this place has to have the worst customer service

ok, so it kinda ended up like a book.......seriously though, I recommend you sleep in your car before paying to stay here.....",22,15,10

Every time I tried to address issues I got a schpeil, so it was much like talking to a robot that didnt really have any answers but was giving the default excuse. Also...my tv wasnt working and the manager wasnt going to do anything about it. Their customer service was really lacking this time! Also, I would agree their dining collection needs a revamp. To top it all off...on my last night there they had the place so packed full of convention people that we had to wait it line for 20 minutes to get up to our room.

Impressed with my first stay at the Wynn a few years back, I decided to check out the buffet this past weekend. We waited in line for about 20 minutes, after the wait we were seated and began our dinning experience. Buffet food looked very dry and even tasted drier than it looked. When I asked a women where the bagels where located she shouted ""that direction"" and mumbled under her breath while walking away. I then had to wait for another employee to come over and toast my bagel (as it is not a shelf service toaster). 

Later, after breakfast on the casino floor my bf and I were playing blackjack. During the middle of our game a casino representative approached us on the floor asking if we would like to sign up for a players card. He was already a member, so I said no thank you. She continued to talk and try to sell us in on getting a rewards card. I was in the middle of a game with money on the table and did not appreciate her distraction.",1,0,0

I've stayed at the Wynn in the past and have had a good experience and this time around, it left me heartbroken and disappointed.

I booked a room well-in-advance, at least 1.5 months before, to stay based on a promotional offer I received in the mail.  I was able to get one complimentary night, and for ANY discount, I am grateful.  However, the service just didn't sit right with me from the beginning. 

When checking in around 4PM, I was told they no longer had any double-bed rooms available, although I had clearly booked reservations for double-bed room.  If I wanted a king bed, I would've asked for that in the beginning. 

Hiromi at the front desk apologized, but was not able to accommodate us any further.  What do I get for the inconvenience?  Anything?  No, but we will see if any room opens up tomorrow and call you tomorrow.

The next day, we receive no call.  So we're stuck with the king and a rollaway.  Had I been a petty person, I would've thrown an outrageous fit.  However, because I'm a good calm citizen, I accepted it as is, and just went along with it.  Though inside, I was frustrated.

It led me to think, did we get shorted the room we wanted, because we were on a promotional deal?  It also made me wonder if we were getting the short end of the stick because we're younger, not the elite-looking type of older people who come through those casino doors.

I also requested a late check-out on our last stay, because we had spent most of the night up enjoying Vegas, and would require a little extra time (simply an hour!) to get packed and organized before heading out.  When I called the front desk at 4AM, Thierry told me I would have to check back at 8AM and they would let me know if a late check out would be available.  So I asked, what is the difference between knowing now and 8am?  I was not given an answer.  Instead, when I finally mentioned how much of an inconvenience our stay had been from the start, she reluctantly gave in and said, OK we will give you an additional hour for late check-out.  I had to battle tooth+nail simply for an extended check-out.  I've stayed at many-a-hotel in Vegas before, and I've never had to ask more than once for a late-check out.

Other hotels I've stayed at have kindly offered upgrades for just-for-the-heck-of-it convenience, and here it seemed like we were just expected to stomach the inconvenience. 

The only great service I received was from their concierge who offered plenty of answers and suggestions without complaints and a pleasant attitude.  The front desk should be trained in a similar manner.

I don't expect to be treated like a king, but for the price you pay for a 5-star hotel, I would hope that a guest wouldn't get undermined into being treated like a pauper.",11,4,0

First the room... it was roomy, clean, comfy, huge bathroom with very nice tub, clean linens and towels, ceiling to floor glass window (gives you a great view). We had a very restful sleep. They make it personal as well by having your name on the TV screen that says ""Welcome plus guest name"" as well as on the phone monitor screen. 
2nd is the pool... huge (so it doesn't feel crowded even there's lots of people). Nice lay out and ample amount of place to stay or just hang out the pool area. 
3rd is the 2 free tix for the La Reve (a show which cost about $140.00 each) that came with our promo stay. Stage was awesome! Performance was great. We enjoyed it! 
4th is the buffet... not just a lot of variety but their food has quality...  We went for a Sunday brunch ($35.00 per person- but then again we got two free buffet as part of the promo) and the selections varies.  Love the desserts as well. Gotta be really hungry when you go to their buffet. 
Lastly, a lot of the basketball players who participated in the NBA Summer League are billed in the hotel the same time we were there. So my son got to see a lot of them and even took pictures with some of them (priceless). 
Overall, our stay was superb! The only set back... it raises the bar on my expectations the next time we look for another place to stay.

This was my second time staying here and man oh man, do they know how to treat their guests.  We stayed in a Resort Room which is considered the lowest tier followed by their Tower Suites and Villas.  Still, as they say in their ads, Michelangelo took 3 years to complete the Sistine Chapel ceiling, your room took 5!  

The room was approximately 500 sq.ft. but almost half of that was the amazing bathroom.  Something about taking a shower with marble floors and walls makes you feel extra squeaky clean.  The vanity includes twin sinks, extra thick towels and a lighted make-up mirror so you can see every hair follicle on your face.  

One other thing...their customer service is probably the best I've ever experienced in a hotel.  I.e.: when calling for room service, they say your name before every sentence.  And every sentence is a question followed by a thank you.  They really figured it out.

____________

PROS:

+ The Wynn really shines from an aesthetic point-of-view (see photos!). It's classy without feeling forced, elegant yet lively, and inviting in many different ways. With its lush red carpeting and abundance of natural lighting, the resort feels like a getaway from the craziness of the Las Vegas Strip. The level of detail and refinement is evident everywhere you look - from the personalized room keys to the check-in kiosks that are blocked off from non-hotel guests via velvet rope, etc. It looks & feels like a million bucks!

+ This sense of pampered luxury continues in the hotel room, which was impeccably detailed and thoughtfully designed. Like many others, I was very impressed by the bedside console that allows guests to control many of the room's functions (thermostat, windows\/drapes, privacy settings) at the touch of a button. It's a convenience that I found myself missing as soon as we arrived back home! 

+ The level of cleanliness in the room is fantastic - even immaculate. I was very impressed with the housekeeping staff's attention-to-detail, and the way in which the room hardly showed even a sign of its 11 years of age.

The bathroom was perhaps the most impressive element of our room; spacious, beautifully designed, and stocked with an amazing assortment of Molton Brown bath products.

____________

CONS:

- Towards the end of the check-in process, we requested for some extra toiletries (toothbrush, extra shampoo) to be brought up to our room. 

These items were never delivered over the course of our first night. In fact, we made sure to follow up on the status of these requests with the bellman who delivered our luggage up to our room; even then, we never received these items until calling down the following morning and requesting from housekeeping over-the-phone.

Of course, one minor complaint isn't enough to undermine an entire weekend  - but soon after, we found ourselves dealing with one issue after another with regards to the amenities in our room:

- The TV and phone interfaces in our room left plenty to be desired; both broke down on multiple occasions. I tried to troubleshoot the TV problems on my own by following the on-screen electronic prompts; at one point, the image on the TV said to press the ""OR"" button on the remote - of which there was no corresponding button! Things only proceeded from bad to worse with this TV, as the default ""Welcome"" screen became replaced with a generic reset page soon after.

- This same trend was echoed with the telephone system in our room. I called down to the front desk to make dinner reservations, only to have my call placed on hold and dropped about thirty seconds later. On another occasion, I tried phoning down to the front desk to make a request, only to have my call ring to the restroom phone in our room!  

Between the TV and the phones, we had engineers sent to our room on three separate occasions. Our phone line was given a hard reset, and the TV was initially reset (which did nothing) before being reprogrammed altogether. At times, it proved difficult to relax and unwind in our room when every gadget & amenity inside it seemed to be coming apart...

____________

So you're probably wondering - after all these problems, how did the Wynn still manage to pull off a four-star rating? 

+ Simply put, it was the staff's level of accountability and professionalism that stood out most to me. THAT was what truly distinguished the whole ""Wynn Experience"" in my book.

After it became clear to us that the technological issues we were experiencing were a repeated pattern and not just isolated incidents, I finally decided to voice my concerns with management. Because the issues that we encountered took place at different times over the course of our stay, I spoke to management on two different occasions. 

I spoke with Lindsay and Molly, both of whom identified themselves as Front Desk managers. Hats off to both of these staff members; they knew precisely how to identify the problems we were dealing with, and the compensation that they offered was both generous and thoughtful. More importantly, Lindsay and Molly went much further than simply adjusting the balance on our bill; rather, they went through the time to explain some of the issues at hand, noting that the hotel was encountering a property-wide cable upgrade, and service interruptions had been popping up as a result.

Their commitment to keeping us happy did not go unnoticed! Lindsay & Molly exemplified the meaning of what true hospitality is all about.

___________ 

While I certainly hope that we won't experience the same technical difficulties in the future, I've also got to admit - our stay at the Wynn was nonetheless one for the books. Fancy aesthetics take a backseat to exemplary service every time. Looking forward to a more complete stay soon!",7,4,6

We were looking to go a bit fancy for a bachelor party, and managed to snag this five-star by bidding on Priceline for $110 per night.

Though it's a bit north of the main action on the strip, we didn't find this to be too inconvenient, and the close proximity to the Fashion Mall was handy (for the cheap food court, booze at ABC stores, and clothing, etc.) Were it my first time in Vegas, I might opt for something more central.

Check-in was a bit of a hassle, with one agent telling us we'd have to wait a couple of hours (it was well past check-in time) for our rooms to be ready. We were suspicious, and approached another agent, which resulted in us securing our rooms right away. Not a good first impression. Check-out wasn't much better, with long waits, and that friggin' $20 per night resort fee being tacked on despite any prior notice.

Having said that, the resort fee (which we were led to believe was included), would have been more than worth it, as it nets you: (1) wi-fi access in your room, (2) gym access, and (3) pool access (eh, this may be included in the price of the room) 

The gym has everything you need, and plenty of treadmills. Free fruit was all I needed for a light breakfast, and I liked having personal-use headphones available.

The pool was gorgeous, and we were grateful for the 21-and-over section to escape from the little brats. Lounge chairs were plentiful and inviting. While cocktails were pricey at $14 (for one hell of a mojito), a very limited beer selection is a bit more reasonable option.

The casino itself (and like all Vegas hotels, you have to parade through a fair portion of the casino to reach the hotel elevators) is pretty nice and clean, with more respectable clientele than other hotels I've experienced.

Finally, the room itself was glorious - lots of space, comfortable beds, and a huge washroom. The great floor-to-ceiling windows and fancy drape technology were a big hit.

The worst part about being charged so much for every little thing is the service and amenities do not at all justify the huge price tag. It's like Mr. Wynn built this massive hotel and your going to pay a premium for just stepping into it . There are lots of gorgeous hotels in Vegas that have amazing service, don't waste your money at the Wynn. To give you a idea the resort fees for internet access are normally an extra $20 a day, at the Wynn its $20 per day per device for the low end internet access. Also a very basic continental breakfast with coffee one small cup of juice and a muffin will cost you $60, oh yeah and they brought tap water. The rooms are ok but dated, the tv in the bathroom doesn't have a clear picture and looks like it's from the 90's, drapes did not work nor did half the lights.  We have stayed at nicer hotels for $75 a night with much better service. The Wynn says they cater to high end clientele, most people are ""high end"" because they manage their money wisely, and the Wynn is not a wise value at all.  We will never ever stay here again. There are many better choices in Vegas to have a very enjoyable stay.",0,0,0

Our view of the strip was lovely.

The bed, linens, pillows -- all were extremely comfortable.

The bathroom shower smelled a little like mildew, and one of my towels had a strange, almost salty, smell that was awful. I tried asking one of the girls with the cart for another one. She didn't speak English, and she finally said she didn't have another towel and to call down for one. I decided I didn't need another towel.

After our stay, I'm now reading that the $25 resort fee gives you access to the gym and wireless internet. If that's true, that sucks, because we didn't know that during our stay. We would have used the gym, and when I tried connecting to the wifi from the room, I was asked to pay $15 for it. If it's included in the room, why ask me to pay? I couldn't use my iPad because of it. Very disappointing.

The lighting on the outside of the building causes a strong reflection of yourself on the glass, making photos and clear strip viewing at night difficult if not impossible.

The LV marathon was taking place during our stay, unbeknownst to us. When we called the front desk asking for suggestions on where to park our car, etc., they were lost and had to put us on hold to ask for help multiple times. In the end, they had no answer. I would have liked a better solution than ""I don't know.""

Although the hotel is overall lovely, it's also at the end of the strip, and it's difficult to reach other resorts and activities without a car or a cab.

This is an expensive hotel, and I would expect the linens and shower to smell nice (and not bad in any respect), more informed staff, and access to the gym and wifi (and if there is access, notification that such is available).",4,0,0

The Wynn is beautiful from the front desk to the view from the room. The service was great! My boyfriend and I booked for a panoramic view room with 2 double beds for us and his friends. However, when we checked in, the receptionist said our room only had a king sized bed and that it was their mistake and quickly made sure they send out an extra bed for us to the room. Another problem we ran into was our air conditioning. It was so hot in the room! I complained and the front desk quickly sent someone up to our room to fix it. The staffs were extremely helpful and friendly. Service was amazing. Did I forget to mention the bathroom? It  was BIG (even for a standard sized room)! Very nicely decorated with every bathroom amenities I could ever need!

I enjoyed having a good soak in the deep tub they had and the robes they provided were great.  We are looking forward to either staying there again on our next trip or their sister hotel the Encore.  

Casino - the slots were a lot tighter then they were on our prior trip but the table games were still fun with plenty of other players.  

Buffet - It's one of our favorites, with a great selection and atmosphere. 

Cafe - There's a little ""cafe"" near the guest elevators that's open 24 hrs with food and drinks you can order if you're looking for a quick meal or snack.  The food isn't very good considering the cost but I really did enjoy my frozen caramel drink with the extra shot of espresso.

Parking - FREE.  I love that they aren't trying to charge their guests for parking like so many of the other casinos on the strip.  We love knowing that the Wynn & Encore have refused to follow suit with the likes of M-Life casinos and others who have put greed above their guest by trying to squeeze out a few extra bucks.

Soft beds.
Huge room.
Everything was beautiful (I took photos of the wall to capture the textured coppery goodness :D, the fun yellow print of the armchair, the gorgeous bathroom --I'm a nut!).
The tv in the bathroom was tiny, and not well positioned for watching from the tub (hey, I have to find a negative somewhere!).  But man, that tub filled up crazy fast and was *so* fabulous for that reason :D
Gorgeous panoramic view (and it was, though overlooking Encore + other properties + then the beautiful mountains).

We stayed Wed through Fri, so  there were plenty of spots at the pool on Wednesday afternoon from 5p til 7p (pool closed at 7), and just starting to super fill up after we got there Fri morning about 11a.  The lap pool between the two round end pools was a serious work out for me :D, and not too many people clogging it up!  We just peeked around the corner at the European pool -- people were actually using it (and a businessman confessed to us in the elevator that his meetings were held in rooms overlooking that pool -- lucky him we said!), but no one was gawking or creepy (er, other than us, I guess :D)  Friendly pool-side service; we grabbed breakfast to go from the nearby cafe (Terrace Point or something) and that was easy.  Other than that, I liked how the chaises were arranged (not too cluttered), the gardens leading to the pool are beautiful (lots and lots of rose bushes and sculpted hedges leading you down to the pool), and there's nothing Vegas-cheesy at all in these pools.  Just straight up relaxation and chill.

Gambling isn't cheap poolside, but $15 tables seem pretty standard. Downstairs in the casino, everything's beautiful, and we loved the nickel 50-play video poker :D I sunk a bit into the video blackjack, but my friends scored pretty well :)

Because we were doing so well on budget, we noshed at the restaurants located in the Wynn -- reviews elsewhere, but overall, awesome food, too :)  Overall, it was *fabulous*.  I'm pretty darn cheap so I don't think I'll be re-creating this experience, but gosh darn, I'm glad I'm lucky :D",2,1,2

Finally ... around 1:45 am my order arrived.
As I stated earlier if you like a clean elegant casino and not wanting any kind of beverage service then this is a good place. If you are looking to drop your money on gambling and plan on beverage service...... well your gambling on whether a server will be there to take your order.
I was not staying at the Wynn, instead I was staying at the Palazzo for 3 nights but decided to do a little gambling at the Wynn since I haven't done so in the past.
Whoever is in charge of the Cocktail Service Department really needs to review the operation.

Let's begin with the rooms. The decor really isn't my style, I would say I'm much more Aria but it was very clean, real marble tables, and THE BEDS! Literally the most comfortable bed I've ever been on, I got an extended check out just so I could lay in the bed longer. It was like laying on a cloud, everything was so comfortable. I hated even getting up to go to the bathroom. 
The view from our room was great, you could see the strip and some of the villas on the ground level. They had amazing thick drapes you could control from the bed so if you wanted to block the sun it was easy. 
My fiancé ordered us a Dom champagne cart with chocolate strawberries, a server brought it up in a cart and served us. What an amazing bottle of champagne it was!
There's also so much to do at the Wynn. There's awesome shops (Alexander McQueen!), the dining options are phenomenal (fiancé proposed to me at Mizumi), you can see a show (La Reve). 
The property itself is beautiful with all the waterfalls, fresh floral landscapes, restaurants, ugh I could go on forever about this place. The staff is always so helpful and happy as well. Make sure you for at least one night of your life stay at the Wynn, it's 100% worth it.",2,0,1

They complained and encouraged us to walk to the other stations because of various reasons like 'too busy', 'long wait', 'backed up tunnel', 'your car is parked in garage closer to the other station', and 'your room is closer to the other garage'.  No.  Do your job stop telling us to carry our bags all around the resort.  I still gave hotel a 5\/5 because all the other service was good.  ESPECIALLY the restaurants are all GREAT.

I was upset because it was crowded and we didn't have a car, so what am I going to do with all the luggage?  
""Well, we'll call you as soon as we can.""
""No, you are going to give me my rooms like you promised.  I would completely understand this problem if I was trying to check in early, but it's after 4. You are telling me that housekeeping still hasn't done their jobs yet?""
""I'm sorry ma'am there's nothing we can do.""
After 30 minutes of arguing, ""okay ma'am, since I can see that you are very upset, I will move you up the waiting list for rooms.""

Waiting lists??? Are you kidding me? How many other people are suffering from your inability to uphold your promises after we paid $300+ per night?

It took another 15 minutes for the manager to say, ""Okay, I suppose I can give you a room.""  No apologize, nothing, for making my parents (who have knee problems) stand in the lobby getting shoved around by people (very small check in area) for them to get us our rooms.

Fair enough I guess, but a more service focused hotel would have sent one of the Phantoms at the VIP entrance.  We didn't need that but the offer to at least arrange for a cash car would have been nice.  

I also found service issues in some of the restaurants.  SW, for example, does not carry service that comes anywhere close to matching their food.  Okada offers ""Fiji"" water in plastic bottles when ordering bottled water.  The service there is also substandard.  Some of the lesser restaurants just completely lack a minimal level of service.

FRONT DESK - It was 8pm and my non-smoking ""room type"" that I had made a reservation for was not available. So, rather than upgrade me (like any other hotel chain in the world), the Wynn told me I could either have a smoking room (um NO), a downgraded non-smoking room, or PAY extra for an upgrade.  I'm serious. I asked if they could give me the non-smoking downgrade and then change my room the next day. Since I was there for a conference I called at lunch time (was in sessions from 8-12) and they said there was no record of a room change in the system and the earlist it could happen was the next day. So finally 2 nights after I checked in I got the room I had reserved months before. No adjustment was made to my bill for this inconvenience, despite my asking about that. 

SPA - Since I was there for a conference I went to the spa to get waxing done (didn't have time to go offsite and my bf was flying in).  Let's just say that the waxing was $170 ($10 more than the menu said) plus tip, and it was the WORST waxing job I have ever had, at 3x my usual cost. There were huge patches of hair missed. Terrible. 

GYM - it's $30 to use the gym. Nothing more needs to be said about that

We were told upon arriving that we had a golf course view. The view was more of that of a building below the hotel (not scenic), but the room itself was gorgeous. Beautifully decorated in whites and creams with a lovely king bed, a spacious bathroom with a separate toilet, a couch area and a table sitting area. The bed was very comfortable, and as is often the case after staying at a nicer hotel, we questioned our own bedding at home! The mini-bar was pricey, but at what hotel isn't it?

The Wynn was well-located in terms of proximity to other hotels, restaurants on the strip. The hotel itself is also nicely decorated and very well-kept. It has everything: a large casino, upscale shopping and lots of places to eat. My husband was particularly impressed by their swimming pool, and said it was the best he's ever done his laps in!

Hotels that I have visited:  Stratosphere, Mandalay Bay, The Venetian, Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, Treasure Island, Encore, and Wynn.  Out of those places, my favorite is the Wynn for their excellent FAST service, decor, restaurants, casino floor, and staff.  I was comped three nights there with a $150.00 resort credit, the best thing ever!  

Rooms:
I actually prefer Wynn's suites over Encore, to me it's just more simpler and serene.  Encore is more for groups, there's a living area, so your friends can stop by and hang out with you.  Att the Wynn, when I first walk into the foyer I feel like as if I am at home and I can jump into bed and look out the window at the beautiful strip.  If you get a chance to, you have to order room service for dinner and just take in everything and relax, then go party and gamble afterwards :-) I absolutely love their bathrooms!  The toilet is its own room which is a plus!  I love the shower head, it's like washing yourself underneath a waterfall :-).  The bedding and bed are so comfortable; you'd feel like you're sleeping on air.  

Restaurants:
The Buffet!  Is my second favorite from RIO's seafood buffet.  Wynn's buffet used to be my favorite, but since they had taken away their flan, I stopped going.

There is a chinese restaurant at Encore, it's called Wasusu? I loved it!  I love the decor from the big booths, to how it is open so when you're eating you can also keep your eyes open to what's happening on the casino floor.  I would come here for lunch again.

The Spa:
Their spa is heaven!  I absolutely loved The Wynn's spa and I will definitely be coming there again.  If you do go, please make sure to arrive there at least 2 hours in advance so that you can take advantage of their spa amenities and then have your service.  Right when the elevator opens, you'll notice the difference in ambiance and their reception area is so welcoming.  I like to lounge around there for a few minutes and just relax while waiting for a friend.  Make sure to drink their teas and have some fruits :-).  My only regret was that I did not use the amenities enough last time I went, I had booked my appointment right away and didn't have time to enjoy the rest.  Ooo ladies, this is European style, but you can also wear a bathing suit of course.  I prefer going Euro ;-).  

The Wynn Theatre:
I'm very picky with my theatres and where I see my shows or concerts.  I hate The Staples Center or the Honda Center in California because the layout is NOT for concerts, sound just floats everywhere and you can't hear anything! ugghhh pet peeve....  Wynn's Theatre is not like that, you have the stage and the audience fans out, like how a theatre is suppose to be.  Their sound system is amazing, I saw Le Reve here and I absolutely loved it.  Such a different experience and no matter where you sit, the performers are not tiny, where you'd like binoculars.  Granted, I have seen all the Circus Du Soleil show, my favorite is ""O"", absolutely amazing!  The reason is, I love to swim and their show is just wonderful in the water.  Any Circus Du Soleil show would be great to see, just depends on your budget.

Golf Course:
Please please please, go visit the golf course!  It is awesome!!!

Back in August of 2015 I stayed at the Wynn and my stay was not ""Wynn Standards"". I wrote about it in detail and it was not positive.  

Last weekend I re-visited the Wynn. Hotel Manager Steve asked me back for a retry. I am thankful to Steve for the consideration and efforts.

On this trip we had no problems as before. The staff was very nice and professional. Any small items of concern were taken care of immediately. 

The hotel designed by Roger Thomas, has a colorful France\/Italy feel in my opinion. Quite beautiful. The Tower Double Suite rooms are neutral in color, large showers, large bathtubs (for us guys at 6 feet and above) and without doubt the best hotel bed\/mattress I have ever slept on. No sore back issues the next morning.

The Wynn is a high end hotel. ($$$$) Needless to say, you receive what you pay for and hopefully what you receive is worth to you the dollars spent.  The various bars in the casino with video poker do not provide bar comps. On the casino floor, slots, tables, etc, bar comps are given. I don't consider casino gaming.  Gaming good or bad... it's a matter of luck. 

The Wynn prides itself on everything Wynn. I cannot speak for Encore but at least at the Wynn you are not going to find a 'Food Court' or 'Starbucks'. The Wynn has their own dining and their own coffee shops. 

The Wynn pool was quiet, nice and restful. The waitresses serving within the pool area were attentive.

Since its quite expensive, you better have  a good strategy. to get your money's worth. I would load up on SHRIMP, KING CRAB LEGS, PRIME RIB, EXOTIC FRUITS, and anything else that remotely looks like sea food. If you have room at the end of your smorgasbord..load up on desserts.

I was told that their system was down but that it would be up the next day. I went downstairs right before my flight to find out if the system was up and if our points from the previous night had posted. We were told that they did and that we qualified for all new member bonuses based on the pattern of our spending. I was offered four free meals. I asked about using them the next time we returned, which I said would be for the Mayweather\/Canelo fight. I was told that I had seven days to use them. I asked for an extension given the fact that the points system had been down the previous day. I even went up to the cashier at around 4am to see if it was up yet. We were told that no exceptions would be made.

We will never return to this hotel again and will make sure that my boyfriend tells his company to put up their employees at another hotel. Why is it MY fault that YOUR system was down?

Their snacks and minibar sits on a sensor so for those who have kids who like to explore everything (or for those who don't like to read), you'll need to be careful because you'll automatically get charged if the items are moved\/changed for more than 60 seconds.

The bed and oversized pillows are so fluffy and comfortable - I didn't want to move once I plopped onto the bed. If I hadn't made any plans beforehand, I'd probably wouldn't leave the bed! Also, the service was impeccable. Upon returning from our exploration of the strip, I found that housekeeping had arranged all my make up and placed them neatly on a towel. I ran into a very small incident in which I brought to the front desk's attention to see what my options are. They went above and beyond and notified their manager immediately. She called to apologize, offered to file a claim on my behalf, and offer me a replacement. I told them to disregard it as it was such a minute thing, but knowing that they take even the little things very seriously is reassuring.

The last time I was in Vegas I stayed at the Bellagio when it was the nicest hotel on the strip.  Now I will stay here.

The room was very nice.  Great panoramic view of the strip which is especially fun at night.  The bed was super comfy which is what they are known for.

The pool was nice.  Water temperature just right, the whole area was very clean and constantly being picked up by the staff.    The hostesses around the pool offered pretty quick drink service. Next time I would like to rent a cabana though - very pricey but nice to have the shade and misters. Plus a plasma TV!  Certainly if you go with friends or another couple, worth the price.

The bar areas are all very nice, clean, not too loud.  Someplace fun to hang out.  The sports book looked fantastic!  All of the gaming areas are clean.  Yes, it is pricey to gamble here but its a high-roller place.  So $5.00 blackjack is down street if you want it (currently across the street at The Frontier which is closing this weekend - no doubt for another luxury hotel and casino - Trump I believe.)  

The Penske-Wynn Ferrari showroom and dealership is also here.  They charge $10 to look at the cars - which I think is silly if you are a hotel guest. But beautiful cars for sure.  And does keep the many teenage boys out of there (saw them drooling through the windows) which is likely the reason...

The staff were always very friendly. From the registration desk to the taxi porters to the pool attendants.  I also appreciate that they have on-the-ball security.  They seem like they are paying attention and not just biding their time to get off their shift.  

2 complaints though: One is no coffee maker in the room or ability to get one (The Ritz on Maui ""rents"" them to you for your stay.)  How many people would like to wake up and have their coffee before going downstairs?  And the coffee bar downstairs is cute but would rather have one in my room.

Second is they charge a $25 use fee for the gym even if you are a guest.  That seems ridiculous.  Even a $25 fee for our whole stay would have been ok.  Seems like I am paying quite a bit to stay here per night so the gym shouldn't be an upsell.

It's always clean--even the casino area. The theme of the entire hotel is Picasso's ""Le Rêve"", so if you are into modern cubism you will love the decor.

The lines at the check-in\/out desk are ridiculously long. It helps that there is an outdoor patio area where you can sit, have a cocktail and enjoy the outdoor waterfall (there is always a light show at night, too!) while your man stands in line and checks in line for your group. That's what I did!

We stayed in a double-bed room, and it was pretty huge. We could have easily fit 2-4 extra cots and had more people stay with us. The beds were comfortable and linen was high quality, as expected. Flat screen, wall-mounted TV, as expected. One big wall as a window to let in the sun, as expected. The only thing I really didn't expect was having a flat-screen TV in the bathroom and in the toilet room. Lol

On the first level of of the hotel, you will find the standard, but cleaner-than-usual, casino and various restaurants. We tried both Alessandro Stratta's restaurants: Alex (5 AAA Diamonds, 5 Mobil Stars, 2 Michelin Stars) and Stratta. Both were exceptional, and dining experiences I will never forget!! Steve Wynn really knew what he was doing when he invited Stratta over to Las Vegas.

Two of the hottest clubs in Vegas are located at the Wynn and Encore, Tryst @ the Wynn and XS @ Encore.

The rooms at the Wynn are spacious, however not as well laid out as others in their league, e.g. the Palazzo, Venetian. Although larger than most standard rooms in Vegas, the living area of the Wynn's rooms are smaller in contrast to rooms at Venetian and Palazzo.  This is because most of its square footage goes to the bathroom.  Yes, Wynn's bathrooms are huge.  Double sinks, separate and enclosed toilet, large shower, and separate soaking tub.  For a five star, five diamond resort, the beds are just ok, not the greatest, considering hotels with less stars like the W,Sheraton, and Westin have much better beds and linens.

we went to the Wynn and i think it's the best hotel on the strip. (i liked it better than the Bellagio) the room was spacious and cool.. (they had a tv in the bathroom! so you could potentially watch tv while you. went pee or poo.. sorry) and the bed was comfy and the mini bar had a lot of fun, overpriced stuff in it...
i really enjoyed the buffet too. It's clean and there is a wide variety of different cuisines you can choose from.. (okay, that's all buffets -_-) and they're desserts were good too.
the pools...are really big and i think they were heated...l think two of the pools connected somewhere... it was weird...but different?
also, it was conveniently located right in front of a mall! my favorite. and i got some shopping done there. fun stuff.

I keep feeling that each new hotel that goes up just has to outdo the last one by a little bit. I guess Wynn succeeded. I liked the floral walkway from the entrance into the hotel's shopping area. Since we didn't stay there I can only review the areas I did visit -- the shopping area and the public areas of the hotel. I'm not sure why they put all their security guys in purple jackets. It just threw me off. I'd expect that at the Rio, but at Wynn? Purple is just not a very nice color for big security guys.

The other thing I didn' t like about Wynn was how the valet drop off and pick up are kind of far away from each other. Yes there is an airconditioned room for you to wait in but when there are 20+ people standing around, the room just doesn't get cold anymore. Even with the misters, it was hot.

We were offered a choice between two different types of rooms- one at the Wynn and one at the Encore. We picked the Wynn. Upon arrival we were given a room at the Encore as an ""upgrade"" which we didn't request or want. We had booked the Wynn. 
We were also given two free buffet passes as part of the promotion. The line was a 2 hour and 15 minute wait. You can't leave your name and come back. No, thanks. 50$ in free slot credit, you say? Nope. Only after you get 300 points- very misleading. 
Once we walked across the property to the Encore and entered our room. We found the previous occupants clothes still in the closet, and the room had not been cleaned. Disgusting and unacceptable. 
Of course we had valeted our car at the Wynn upon our original arrival and we were told it would be moved so at check out it would be at the Encore. This didn't happen, and we saw the Valet's seriously annoyed face she had to go to the other building to get our car. We looked like the jerks, but it was their mistake. Thanks, Wynn.

We purchased a small suite on priceline for roughly $250 per night. Upon arrival we were informed that the hotel was booked and our room was given to someone else -which, you may think, is cause for concern. But no!  Oh, no. We were bumped up not once but twice and eventually upgraded to the second largest suite in the hotel to make up for the oversight. 

As for the suite - I can only liken it to the moment in the ""Hangover"" when they first walk in - this thing had two bathrooms, a full living room, and an enormous bedroom and bathroom (with jacuzzi tub and separate shower).  Robes, slippers, two TV's, private pool, insane views, you get the idea. It DESERVED a tiger in the bathroom. I felt downright fancy!!

My only complaint - which doesn't really qualitfy as a complaint - is that the myriad restaurants\/bars\/stores in the hotel had pretty strict dress codes, and there were times when I found myself dripping with pool water, in shorts, unable to find a place that would accept my disgustingness.  But honestly, thats my fault - and good on them for having standards. Next time I shall cover myself head to toe in fanciful Dorthy Zbornak-inspired blue satin. 

Everyone who worked there was kind, professional, and helpful. The food was amazing; all of it. I fell in love.  And now I'm heartbroken that the experience has ended.

Mechanical moving shades, 42 inch HDTV on a swivel that has your name computerized on it, and a spectacular bathroom with separate shower and giant tub alongside a TV in the bathroom and a separate room for the toilet.

But here is the kicker.... The outdoor ALL NIGHT (till 4am) club pumps house music with bass emanating through our room that is on the 11th floor. This is not relaxing music. And yes, I love to party. I even enjoy some house music when I'm at the club, but when you have decided to retire at midnight to have a good awake morning in Vegas, DO NOT EXPECT IT AT THE WYNN! I thought it was some street party at 3am and realized it was the Wynn decoding to allow a few hundred people to party until 4am while anyone in bed at the hotel just suffered. Did I mention it was Thursday night, not Friday or Saturday.  Yes this party is 7 days a week. 
A 5 billion dollar resort that has forgotten it's guest might want to sleep, damn what a shame.  Steve Wynn got everything right at this resort except for the fact that sometimes people need sleep to keep the party going. Again it's a shame.

I do a lot of research of companies and what branding and how it's message is conveyed. Wynn thus far does it the best because the experience matches what they advertise. 

My stay with Wynn was flawless, fantastic, relaxing and delicious. Let's just say I barely left the resort because everything is there and within reach. I cannot wait when the expanded two level Esplanade is open! A water themed resort addition is in the works but most likely 2 years from now. 

I stayed at the Encore tower in one of their deluxe suites. Become a Wynn Insider to get the best available rates (generally I prefer to book direct, travel agencies like Expedia, Orbitz, Priceline, and Hotwire are a no go). 

Room: It was fantastic, bright with floor to ceiling window, custom furniture pieces, separate room and living space, tv that swivels between both spaces, beautiful large bathroom, and innovative touch screen control display (shades, lighting, do not disturb settings and other extra settings for services). 

Amenities: I rate a hotel highly on their body care offerings and I was pleased to see Molton Brown as the partner. London based Molton Brown to me is pure luxury and their products work in many ways and well worth the price paid. Wynn resorts offer Coco & Tonka Bean created by Molton Brown, which is an exclusive and cannot be bought in Molton Brown stores nor online. Whenever I go to Wynn, I must buy more of Coco & Tonka Bean from their gift shop. The scent is irresistible and it lavishes your hair and body. To me, it speaks well for Wynn and is a perfectly crafted match. 

Food To Crave For: THE BUFFET, don't mix the name up with that of Bellagio's (even if Wynn also built Bellagio before selling it to MGM), is to me the best buffet in Las Vegas. Just like any space inside of Wynn, THE BUFFET is whimsical and bright with pastel hues in a simple yet elegant setting. The food is to die for with each station crafting fresh dishes from all over the world. I come to Wynn's THE BUFFET even when I don't stay at the resort.

Tableau: If you want brunch, Tableau has the perfect fixings. Tucked away just past the elevators of Wynn's tower suites (a separate front desk is dedicated to guests staying in the tower suites), is a beautiful floral themed eatery. I usually get their surf and turf inspired eggs Benedict (steak medallion with blue crab and hash brown rounds), and it's so delicious! 

Jardinare: Classic food offerings against a pool side setting with a floral theme. The food was exceptional and great if you're for a quick meal (the prefix offerings are a great deal breaker). I will say that my dessert was overly sweet, but did not tamper my entire meal. I'm craving their crab cake - so delicious!

Wing Lei & Andrea's are on my list to try next. Even though I spent the majority of my time in the resort, I did venture off to have other fare along the Strip.

Shopping: The Esplanade, its similar to the wing of shops at the Bellagio (of course, same designer), but to me is brighter, and adds more color. It's actually relaxing to walk through even if you're not shopping. You immediately walk through The Esplanade as it's part of the route to get inside the resort to reach other areas.

Casino: I'm not much of a gambler, however the casino space is well designed, like a paradise for those who will spend hours staring into a slot machine or a table with cards. In comparison to Wynn's previous or (ex-sibling properties: Bellagio, Mirage, and Treasure Island), Wynn is brighter in interior and is not as dark and drab.

Pool: I have to visit the pools of any hotel I visit, when available of course. The pool was beautiful and relaxing. My only caveat is that the pool areas of the Encore and Wynn towers are not connected, and you would have to enter the Wynn pools through the casino corridor (if you are coming from Encore and vice versa). In comparison, you can walk to all of the Bellagio pools along the same deck without passing the casino. That is my only negative point, other than that I enjoyed the pool and being out on the pool deck. 

Service: Impeccable and professional. That is all I can say, no complaints there. 

It's really hard to stay at any other resort in Vegas after staying at the Wynn. The second resort that comes close would be The Venetian. 

A wonderful resort!",6,5,3

I never had one bad experience staying at the Wynn. The customer service from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave is always outstanding.

While there are so many buffet in Vegas, and I'm a Vegas goer for the past twenty years eating pretty much all the buffet on the Strip, stayed most hotels there, there have been much of an improvement on a food department except, most of the buffet is now ""upgraded"" with those cold shrimps and crabs that many will go for.. But for me, they are mostly flavorless... Yes I can taste them, but there are so much better way to make those jumbo shrimp and crabs to much better way but they were boiled in such a bad way that many flavored is drained in the boiled water and sadly, what a waste...   Wynn is not an exception of serving these food and charge more money for it.. I am still a fan of this buffet as well as Caesars Palace and Bellagio for their wide selection but I think they can do better if they charge more now!   The price keeps going up but the quality seems stationary...  Inflation hasn't gone up that much and neither the demand, thus they can do better job creating the customers (including repeating customers) happy!

Anyway, here is the original review:

Excellent rooms, excellent pool area, excellent buffet!

This huge hotel has so much to offer.  While some are rating for rooms or bars, I'd like to focus on the buffet which many people are wondering....  

Yes, it's pretty good.  I'd say, it is comparable to Bellagio.  Wynn has seafood, italian, asian, salad bar and cheese and salami bar, desert section...  so many to choose from.  It's about $25 for lunch and $34 for dinner.  We arrived around 2:45 and dinner started about 3:30 so we got to enjoy a little bit of dinner menu with lunch price.

Lunch was pretty good. Very juicy and flavorful roast beef, creamy tortellini, tasty anchovys, mashed potatoes are homemade and buttery (yeah, lots of calories too..), good selection of salad bar, and they served tom yum soup, which didn't seem like attracting many people, but I thought it was pretty authentic and delish!   Sushi section needs a lot of improvement.. they had some california rolls and eel roll but not very good.

When dinner started at 3:30p, they started bringing in some shrimp and crab legs... I thought shrimp was very big and pretty good for buffet (Bellagio had the same shrimp in size and taste) and crab legs were big too. I thought they were a bit too salty though, they want you to drink a lot of water to make you full...Many buffet does that trick... to make you full quickly with liquid..   But it had more flavor than just salt so it was a ++.  

Wynn buffet is a lot less crowded than Bellagio and many other buffet... In fact, we didn't have to wait for a line so that's a huge +++ for us.  The crowed seem more sophisticated and older, which was nice.  I've seen many rude people at different hotels, so I really like that atomosphere.   If I have only one choice of buffet to go in Vegas, this is my new favorite choice from now :)    If you are a sushi lover, there are other places (like makino or sushi on tropicana) you can go!

Oh and did I mention they have good grapefruit and orange juice?   It was a nice bonus to the great meal",2,0,0

First, the standard rooms are incredible. I suppose the theme is ""big"". The room itself is big as are the windows and bathroom. There is a couch and table and great televisions - in the bedroom and bathroom. 

The pool is awesome-sauce. Get up early to snag your chair and nap as needed. There is a topless pool, too if you're into that. A word to the wise: sunblock is uber expensive at the shops, so bringing your own is strongly advised. 

The buffet is incredible. It's pricey, but it does not disappoint. If it's in your budget, definitely go for it!

I've been to the outdoor parasol bar a few times and it's beautiful as well as is the other bars. Been to XS and some of the other night clubs and again all beautiful. This hotel is in tip top shape and is one of the best hotels on the strip! Maybe the best.,1,1,1

My first time in Vegas (yeah! I was a Vegas virgin until two weeks ago) and the Wynn did nothing short of blow my mind, expectations... even my underwear away! (kidding on the underwear).

ROOM
- On the 21st floor with a view of the Encore, the pool, their golf club and the Vegas mountains... and Barry Manilow eerily staring at me as I undressed
- Floor to ceiling and wall to wall windows... good for peep shows
- A push of a button to open and close the curtains... had too much fun with that and now I think I have carpal tunnel
- Pillows so soft that I fell asleep the minute my head hit them... you can buy them for like $69 at the Wynn Shop
- Bathroom was the winner with the shower stall and the tub... OK! TV in the shit-can was strange.. rich people got weird habits

FOOD & WINE a.k.a. BOOZE
- The Wynn Buffet was stellar for all three meals with food ranging from American to Indian to Asian (try the crab legs!) and their deserts (flan!) are to die + kill + molest + pillage +lie + steal for... at $40 a person per meal... watch out! You WILL overeat to compensate for the high cost
- The Strata was a good breakfast treat with a great pasta dish but so-so Bloody Mary's (was more like Bloody Blah with no spice)... at $70 for two with tip kinda pricey.. but its Vegas! 
- The cafe by the waterfall was a great place to veg out, sip iced tea, people watch behind sunglasses and contemplate how much more money would one loose
- We did room service one night and both ordered burgers... not bad!

GAMBLING
- Tried my hand at gambling and this desi does NOT have the gambling gene... thank Krishna!
- The usual slots, tables, and the fancy gambling fare

SURROUNDING THINGS
- The shopping area is really neat regardless of whether you buy or don't buy... just great to see some wonderfully tailored clothes and some that make you go ""HOE! HOE! HOE!""
- The show Le Rev is a MUST SEE! Water show with guys in tight swim suits and bodies that would give Hercules a run for his money
- The lobby is a treat in itself as its sort of an arboretum with scores of plants and flowers
- Walk the gambling section just to people watch... its fun!
- Their pools are the BEST! Salt water all the way so no chlorine, great service right by your pool bench and great way to get sun (I went from hot chocolate to machiatto in minutes!)

All in all, if you want a nice place to stay, clean, good customer service, upscale, well kept and hoity toity, try the Wynn. It is pricey for some rooms go for $399 per night and we were there for 2 nights, but again its worth all that you get and its Vegas.

Next time... I'm trying Encore!",7,9,8

Be sure to bring a bath bomb or something when you go! the tub was comfortable and clean.

The staff were so nice and accommodating. And traffic around the area definitely wasn't bad at all. Would definitely stay here again.

Also, the buffet was GREAT but the line was so long. It was like a 1.5 hour wait... so go off-hours. We ended up paying an extra $16\/person to get in the VIP line. Felt a bit scammed, but it was our fault for not knowing any better. Not enough to knock off a star for.

The bedding was super soft and Wynn went over the top and embroidered everything, from the pillowcases, to the complimentary slippers, brown for the boys and white for the girls!  The bathroom had dual sinks and the 'freebies' had a wonderful lemongrass citrus scent.  I have never stayed in a resort that provided a scale in the bathroom along with a tv!  I never knew what the benefits of having a tv while bathing or brushing my teeth, and yes, it is necessary!  I felt spoiled and bratty-I loved every minute of it!  The room service was spiffy and decadent, not to mention expensive!

Pool is awesome, they have a 'european' area and the lounge chairs are plush.  The landscaping is amazingly lush and green year round.  It is never crowded and seems to not attract many screaming children.  The shops are lovely, a nice mixture of designers and tasteful boutiques.  

Great friendly poker room with poker PRO, Daniel Negreanu giving personal lessons and play time, at a price.  UPDATE: Negreanu had a horrible 2005, he has since ceased his contract with Wynn.  

One thing I have to mention is that the Wynn staff are a bit on the cold side, I've never been to Britain, but I can only draw comparisons to the armed guards.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update 5\/12\/06:

If you are getting a package delivered to the Wynn, they are going to make you pay for processing the package $6 plus tax.

Wynn is building a second building next door, will be named Encore and the curvature will be going the opposite way of the current one.  

The pool has a severely limited menu: Turkey bagel, Ham and cheese sandwich, and an Italian wrap.  Order to go from the Terrace Pointe Cafe before you lay out.  

The in-room dining is really reasonable, and delicious!  I think we eat half of our meals in Vegas in our room, so the quality is not an option.

Update 8\/18\/06:

The pool and jacuzzi closes at 8pm.  It's nice to relax here before dinner and gambling, all the walkways are lit and the landscaping looks gorgeous at dusk.

He actually spilled a full glass of red wine on the table, and they kept serving him. I found out about an hour later that he lost over $20,000 at the table. He should have been cut off from drinking and gambling.

I hear a lot of people complain about it being at the end of the strip (this personally does not bother me since I find myself spending most of my time at XS Nightclub or other locations in the Wynn and Encore) but I think that allows them to take full advantage of the landscaping and property. You are visually stimulated by all the detail and work that has gone into creating such a lovely place such as the Wynn. 

The restaurants are top notch and the entire environment is clean and constantly well kept. The employees are friendly and helpful, tons of shows and shops to explore. Beautiful art work throughout the vicinity, Positive and well lit environment. I am 23 and feel safe to wonder this hotel by myself because I know there is a trustworthy employee in any direction. 

The Encore is more suitable for a younger crowd and the Wynn appeals more to an older age range, but as long as your dressed decently they are pretty welcoming to all.  

The Wynn rooms are spacious with a large bathroom and a full snack and fridge bar THAT IS WEIGHT CENSORED so please do not touch things unless you actually consider purchasing it. The beds are EXTREMELY comfortable, cleaning service is outstanding, and the electronic controls for the lights, curtains etc. was quite entertaining. :)

The bathroom in our double bed suite room was very nice, with a convient door shutting off the toilet area making it easy for people to get ready and use the restroom as needed.

In the end I think I had five-star expectations, but got a solid three-star overall experience.  I doubt I will stay at Wynn again.

For starters, we got a great off-season rate:  $139 for two nights and $219 for the Saturday night.  I think my disappointment would have been more pronounced had we paid the peak-season rates.

The room was very spacious and I would consider living in the well appointed bathroom.  The room was clean and the bed was comfy.

That said, here are the tidbits that I think soured my grapes:  We, and many others, had to check in twice.  We arrived early, around 1:30 p.m., stood on line and learned that there weren't any non-""smoking optional"" (how is this NOT a smoking room??!!) rooms ready, but they went ahead and checked us in and said they would phone when our room was ready.  Ok, fine, check-in isn't until 3:00, I get it.  So we had lunch at Red 8 and waited around for our phone call from registration.  We finally got the call at 3:15, but had to queue up again to pick up our room keys.  There's got to be an easier way.  And, like I said, it seems many others were in the same boat.

We suspect it was music reverberating from Tryst that kept my getting-over-a-cold wife up until 5:00 a.m. Saturday night\/Sunday morning.  I can't imagine she was the only one affected by the noise, as half the hotel faces Tryst's lair.  Her subsequent protestations to management were duly noted, but hardly redressed.  If your night club keeps your guests awake all night, well that ain't a good thing.

There were odd moments during the stay when I could clearly hear conversations and could identify television programming in the rooms adjacent to ours.  I was not at all expecting any paper-thin-wall moments, but there they were.

The maids kept arriving for turn down service earlier and earlier.  The last evening they showed up at 4:30.  This seemed odd.

What Wynn giveth, Wynn taketh away.  The great rate we got was greatly offset by the fact you cannot get out of any of the casual dining spots in the hotel for less than $20.  Should I pay $17 for two coffees and a croissant?  Well, the only other option is to leave and go across the street to Starbucks, so I guess I should fork over the cash.

I've always enjoyed the casino floor at Wynn.  It's huge.  The table minimums are too high for my wallet, but if that's what keeps the rabble away, then I don't protest.

On the plus side, we splurged for room service one morning and it was fantastic.  I had the breakfast wrap, which was enormous.  Same for the wife's portion of French toast.  Delivery took less than 30 minutes and the service was professional and friendly.

All in all, a good stay, but by no means one that left me eager to return.  I stayed at Bellagio on my last trip and have much better memories of that experience.",4,3,3

Although much of the hotel staff was courteous, overall, the hotel was not very accommodating to our needs.  The casino is not family friendly.  Upon entering the casino, (before even seeing any kind of welcoming signage) there was a big sign stating that strollers are not allowed in a casino.  Excuse me, but how do you expect my infant to be transported around the hotel then?  And how are strollers any different than the huge suitcases guests are rolling through the casino, or even wheelchairs for that matter?  We booked our stay as part of a package deal.  We were supposed to receive show tickets to Le Reve as well as breakfast\/dinner for two at the buffet.  However, we didn't receive any of this due to black out dates.  If there were black out dates, I believe this should have been communicated during the time of our booking, and another type of compensation should have been offered.  Nothing was offered in place of this, and when I asked them to waive our resort fee instead of us receiving the show tickets and buffet vouchers, they said, ""No.""  In my opinion, waiving a $30 resort fee is more than reasonable under this circumstance, but the answer was, ""No.""

I was part of a large VIP group traveling together who had contacted the Wynn in advance of our stay to secure a ""preferred"" room rate which was for two deeply discounted rooms for a weekend stay .  After several phone confirmations that our reservation was indeed of the ""preferred"" variety before our arrival, it took the first two days of our stay at the hotel to reach the appropriate staff members in order to confirm the proper rate for the third night.  This hassle along with my mixed feelings accompanying the various hotel staff we encountered during our stay (ranging from helpful and genuinely friendly to totally pompous and stand-offish) left me feeling that the Wynn certainly could have offered more from a customer-service standpoint given the caliber of its reputation. 

Secondly, I would say that the overall value of the hotel rooms we were given left something to be desired.  The rooms were nice and had some nice things in them, but I didn't feel like I was staying in a five-diamond hotel room.  We had a golf-course view which was not that exciting (it's mostly an ""Encore construction"" and ""Hilton with Barry Manilow banner"" view right now) and the room wasn't all that spacious.  I will say that the bathroom was disproportionately large, and that the beds were very comfortable.  But wireless internet was $14 per day in the rooms, and the snack\/minibar was rigged with pressure sensors to automatically charge your account should things be removed for too long.  Maybe Steve should have spent the money he used on those snack bar weights and scales to add a few square feet to the rooms instead, or offer the basic amenity of internet access to his guests. 

I was really expecting to be wowed at the Wynn but I think my expectations were much too high.",0,0,0

I guess we drew the attention of security as we were asked to leave due to State law of no one under 21 yo allowed in gaming area. What????  We were a little taken back as we were not standing by any machines or tables.

The first time we came here and introduced our daughter to ""R&R"", it was a toss up from Palm Springs (which we had done a few times already) or a NEW desert experience. I had wanted to keep her innocent mind and eyes from all this but, dad ensured me she would have a blast (in my mind, I still recalled many times mom and dad had to smuggle us kids in...).

On to the hotel:
Never once during the past stay did we ever feel as if our daughter (""does not drink, gamble or eat enough"") was not appreciated. All the staff treated us as if we were royalty. One exception was when we were standing BY the ATM machine and a staff member escorted us away from it due to my daughters age. My daughter said (at 8 mind you) ""what am I going to do? Take the ATM and go gamble with it?! I'm not even old enough better yet strong enough to do such a silly thing!"" So to staff, we understand some of the rules and how closely you are watched but really?

The buffet (as mentioned) is SPECTACULAR! The food is amazing as is the spread and the separate dessert room?! Absolutely worth the amount you pay but NOT worth breakfast, lunch and dinner worth.

The pool staff, my deepest appreciation to them. They treated my daughter like she was Queen of the Pool. Everything was ""yes miss, no miss, how or what can I get\/do for you miss"".

Wynn, received a call from me the very day we got home and I thanked them up and down for treating her like a person regardless of what she spent. This place knows, treat the kids well and mommy and dad are more than happy to come back.

And come back we did! This time for Christmas!!! This time we stayed for 5 days and to tell you that this was an even better experience even with all the traffic of world travelers, you would doubt but I'm being honest here.

At first, we booked our room at Encore (requested Strip view) but when we checked in, we were staring straight at the airport, a BIT of the golf course and the back of Wynn. Encore just lacked what the Wynn has, activity and view. We immediately called the front desk and they moved us to the Wynn with the best view we have ever had.

They sent us a ""Hotel Porter"" who carried all our belongings to the Wynn. We tipped him very well as he did everything for us. Got us a fridge and a ""roll away"" bed.

The view was beautiful from our 58th floor. We can see all the way down the Strip which is what our daughter loves most.

This stay was different, we went down every morning to the drugstore cafe to get apple juice, coffee and muffins. Therefore, quite a few dealers and security got to know us by face and greeted us every morning as our now 9 year old walks out sporting her Christmas Jammie's and carrying her teddy. Cutest part was when security bid a morning greeting to our daughter and her teddy.

Only once (again) were we approached by a large woman security asking my daughter to don her shoes when half of the patrons visiting from other hotels were barefoot in the lobby with a lame excise of ""there MAY be glass on the floors front he ornaments or loose tile..."". I guess she is looking out for a future client but seriously? Ok, whatever.

This time however, we passed on the extreme long lines for buffet but we did try the Terrace Cafe. Excellent food but slow service. Totally worth it if you don't have plans to tour the town.

This time, we stretched our wings in Vegas. We went to:

Bellagio - O
Neon Sign Museum
Mob Museum
Paris - cafe at Eiffel Tower
Lotus of Siam
Fogo de Chao
Ramen Sora
Circus Circus - 9 year old gambling at the arcade
Luxor- Titanic exhibition
Battlefield Las Vegas
Hard Rock Hotel

This was the one of the best vacations for all of us as we got to see much of Vegas...through different lenses.

We stayed at the 57th FL in the Deluxe Resort Room with a Panorama View of the Strip.  Well worth the upgrade.  The View + Spaciousness + Digitally Controlled Lighting and Curtains = Epic.  DO IT! 

The room and bathroom were plush'd to the nines.  Super duper inviting and splendid.  If that wasn't enough, their robes were by far the best I've ever put on! softness to a whole new level! I seriously slept in them one night.  The bath tub was the deepest with a waterfall like faucet that I've never seen\/experienced before.  

This trip got even more EPIC when we ran into NBA Players! ahhhh! It was just coincident that this week Team USA were scrimmaging in Vegas.  I had a pic taken with the #1 Draft Pick, Anthony Davis, saw Paul George playing Craps, passed by DeJaun Blair, John Wall, and a super tall fella that resembled Dominque Wilkins! If you know me like the back of your thumb, you knew this was heaven for me being that I eat, breath and dream basketball.

Their regular pool was pretty nice and chill.  The self-serve parking was easy to get in and out.  To be honest, there was very little to complain about the experience here.

No wonder Wynn is a 5-star hotel. :) Very happy that my husband and I were able to stay at least 1 night here this past Monday.

We did self-parking; plentiful and free.
You get into the elevator which takes you to the Casino level, and then you have to walk quite a ways to get to the ""Registration"" area. It's pretty much across the entire casino!

Check-in process was a breeze; we tried to get a room on a higher floor, but no luck. 
It's OK though, because our King size room was still pretty sweet.

-Fancy phones + electronics in the room; almost everything is digitized. 
-Bathroom kit was well packed. We had to request a dental kit as I didn't have toothpaste on me, and it was brought to our room w\/in 10 minutes. 

We paid the $28 resort fee; so our wi-fi internet connection was FREE. If you didn't pay the resort fee, then it's NOT free, so check what kind of room rate you have!

Bed was cush and nice - the furniture looked trendy. There was option to dim the lights at medium or low. COOL :)

I went to check out the pool; but unfortunately, it closed by the time I arrived. It's only open from 9am-5 pm during the winter. 

The gym was very nice too; there are free WATER bottles for you to drink (and bottles available at every treadmill). You get free admission with the ""resort fee"".

Decor was very nice in the casino and right outside the Registration area; Chinese New Year is coming up so there was a huge dragon hanging from the ceiling in the indoor garden area across from the Registration area. :)

I stayed here for a conference in July and I was over the moon at the service I received. Upon entering the hotel, I was greeted by an amazing display of fresh flowers, the colors so vibrant, the flowers just plain awesome.  The check in desk was a little hidden behind all the flowers, off to the right. Upon check in, I was greeted very warmly by the staff, who made sure to make me feel right at home. But walking through the flower garden is a must. 

The biggest downfall of the entire experience is walking through the middle of the casino to get to the guest elevators. Especially when it is late at night, and there are a lot of smokers around, and you are sensitive to smoke. But I didn't go there to gamble, I was there for business, but still did a fair amount of walking through the middle of the casino.

To get to the guest rooms you have to show your room key every time so just be prepared. There was nothing worse than having to stand behind someone who forgot their key and sitting there arguing with the guy to get past him. The elevators are divided, one side for the lower floors, the other for the higher ones. The room was amazing. Gorgeous, soft, and fluffy. The curtains and sheer panels all controlled by the touch of a button. The TV mounted on the wall out of the way. The floor to ceiling windows overlooking the strip. The bed, which was probably more comfortable than my own bed at home. The bathroom, was probably one of the largest and most spacious bathrooms I have ever seen. There was a large Jacuzzi tub separated from the shower. Two large sinks with a vanity to get ready. The toilet was in its own little room. There was also a little TV in the bathroom to watch while getting ready or while partaking in the tub! The mini bar had some of my favorites. I can't say enough about how wonderful the room was. 

There are many little shops inside the hotel, as well as some high end shopping. The pool areas are large, lots of chairs, and they even have little cabanas to rent for the day. I unfortunately didn't get to enjoy much of the pool but the look was awesome. The conference rooms were large and comfortable. No detail is spared, the entire hotel to the conference rooms were decorated amazing. 

There are multiple restaurants inside, including the buffet. The restaurant by the pool was perfect for lunch. The steakhouse was probably some of the best food I had the entire trip. The Asian restaurant was delicious. One of my favorite places was the up\/down bar, which was very pleasant, great drinks, and great service. And don't forget to stop by the Ferrari dealer.

I am judging not just by the room, but also by all the amenities that are available within the hotel such as the clubs\/restaurants\/decor\/great view... 

This was my very first stay at the Wynn and it definitely won't be the last. When I was checking in, I was asked if this was my first time because they print out a ""Red Card"" for your room key. The Red Card not only gets you into the room, but also serves as your players card whenever you are playing at the Casino. It can be used again when you check into another room in the future and even has your name on it. 

The room was exactly how it looked in the pictures. I booked a resort room which featured the king sized bed, two tvs, one in the room, and one in the bathroom which came pretty handy. 3 telephones, and my favorite one had to be the one next to the toilet. Too bad it is only meant for incoming calls. Also a clear stand up shower, and a huge bath tub.  I had the view of Tryst below and the strip which faced Treasure Island. The air conditioning system was superb. It literally took 2-3 minutes to get your room the desired temperature. Other things i noticed was the lighting in the room was perfectly place to bring the most out of the decor. There are several abstract paintings of flowers in the room which made the place look classy.

Room service did a great job of cleaning, and it seemed like I had a brand new room the second night I stayed here. There was only one small gripe I had was with my TV remote running out of batteries. There was no possible way to turn my TV off on the set itself. If you did, its possessed with demons that would automatically turn it back on. I made a call to front desk at 3 am after I came back clubbing. When I woke up  at 10, the TV was still on. I guess it didn't matter in the end since I was too intoxicated to notice that it was on the whole time. 

Another small gripe I had was the guest list at Tryst and XS were unavailable because of the holiday weekend. I feel that paying hotel guests should at least get some sort of priority if they would like to attend a club within the hotel. Come on Steve, don't you want us to spend more money at your resort? 

What made this place perfect for the summer were the pools. I got a chance to enjoy the Wynn pools that were privately accessible using the resort elevators. The pool area was huge and just slightly smaller then MGM's, but the adult pool is the best part. Adult meaning no kids allowed since there is gambling and topless tanning.

I have been to Wynn Las Vegas several times for shows and to eat at the buffet.  The casino is very nice and roomy.  I like the wide aisles which generally allow you to navigate around photo taking tourists who are in a cloud.

I stopped in to see the newer carousel and hot air ballon and was disappointed to find they were artificial flowers instead of real ones.  I was looking closely and a security person asked me if he could help.  When I mentioned the artificial flowers, he confirmed I was correct.

I do like to stop and see the two Jeff Koons sculptures Wynn has purchased.  But I wonder if paying for two guards for each (maybe two only depending on time of day) is worth the cost as opposed to having some fresh flowers in his floral displays.  I do like Koons.  I spent a good amount of time at LACMA in the Koons section so I am very familiar with his work.  It's just that I can't afford to buy one for my place.",8,8,5

The lemon body wash and lotion smelled so good we wanted to eat it. We ordered a snack from room service before we went out and it was delicious! We had an excellent time. The only negative thing was that I left my phone charger in the room when we checked out. I called their lost and found and they said they would look into it and get back to me.

We got a room in the tower suites overlooking the golf course and when dawn comes, the warm sun shines through the window and doors waking you up (maybe not so good when you're hung over). The bathrooms are huge with hot tubs and enough room to have a party in there. The decoration is sophisticated with warm colors (remember Mr. Big's apartment in SATC...all beige) with flowers everywhere.

The staff is friendly and courteous no matter how busy and how may people are pulling at them asking questions. The concierge ( her name escapes me) totally hooked it up with getting us on the list for the clubs and even a cabana for the pool. 

The spa is chic and serene. After all the partying you can find your sanity here with the help of the great massages and huge steam rooms and whirl pools.

If you're hungry one of the11 fancy restaurants will give you an experience you wont forget. Okada serves fresh savory sushi and the tartars are a must try. For a romantic dinner, italian at Bartolotta is perfect. With a table under the cabana and intimate lighting everywhere, all that was missing was a marriage proposal! 

My fav is the European pool. I'm the most self conscious person in the world so when someone mentioned going here, I was quick to decline.

We stayed in a tower suite and were on the 9th floor. The view of the strip was viewable and the window was from floor to ceiling so it was nice once we got the drapes opened. Everything is electronic and you could put on all the lights and open all drapes at the push of a button! Bathroom came with a huge tub and separate tiled shower, two huge sinks with a vanity stool ideal for applying make up. I loved how the toilet was separated by a door so you could get ready while someone taking care of their own business!

The mountains surrounding the city are beautiful, but I personally prefer different types of beauty than the blinged out, assault on every sense that Vegas has to offer. Occasionally, my company has forced me to stay at lesser establishments. Please also understand that I'm not the easiest to please. I'm high maintenance and very comfortable being accused of such. 

I've seen the Tower Suites, but I just stay in the plain old rooms and they are fantastic! Super clean. Marble everywhere. Large soaking tub. High end Molton Brown toiletries. Mountain and strip view or golf course view. There are buttons on the wall and next to your bed that control the lighting (3 choices), drapes (3 choices) which are a nice touch. Well stocked bar and snacks. Good champagne, wines, etc for your private imbibe. Appropriate glasses in room. Just awesome! TV's in bathroom and main room that I never turn on. You can order in room massages. 

I request a kettle to use with my own french press and am charged $10\/day. Worth it for me. I usually request a humidifier as well since Vegas is such a dry city in the mountains. 

The property itself is absolutely amazing. I just spent a week in the meeting rooms. I kept meaning to take pic's. Corporations take note- sales conferences should be at the Wynn. The meeting rooms are beautifully appointed. The hallways are beautiful. Delicious restaurants at every turn. Popular, too, so make a reservation. Steak, Japanese (Wazuzu equals happiness), Chinese (Wing Lei), Italian (Bertolotta!), Deli's, Coffee, late night (Allegro!). There are boutiques galore! Hermes, Chanel, anything you need for a night out at Tryst (beautiful club with fountain). 
I never leave the property for a week. There's a couple of outdoor spots to hit when you remember there's a world outside- La Cave or poolside. 

Spa is beautiful. Great services. Pricier than real world. Remember you are no longer in the real world...

The Wynn is swank, classy, and has everything you need for an upscale Vegas experience. It's connected to the Encore. The casino is also a step above everything else on the Strip. The people are even prettier here. In my opinion, it's the best that Vegas has to offer. I'm still not a huge fan of Vegas itself, but I feel pampered and special at the Wynn.

Those fees should be included in the original price when you're planning your trip. Their excuse is that other hotels in the area do it sometimes.

The Wynn is one of the few individual owned properties on the strip. Steve Wynn sold his other Las Vegas properties to the giant MGM, who owns half the Strip today.  

The hotel layout is different from any other Vegas Hotel and Casino. You will appreciate that they are not hitting you with the casino aspect of the hotel over the head. They did not create a casino jungle patrons have to pass before they can get to important locations within the hotel. The casino is located in the middle of the 1st floor and there are straight walkways that go right through it and all around it.

You can get from virtually any point to the other at the main floor in less than 5 minutes, including the lobby, restaurants, shops, show theaters, special meeting rooms, the night club Tryst, the Lake of Dreams and the Ferrari dealership and show room. 

The rooms are what you would expect from a first class establishment. Everything you need is there, from Internet access, a mini stereo system, a safe to store valuables, a mini fridge and a gorgeous view either across the strip or the huge (full size) golf course that is adjacent to the casino property and only available to Wynn patrons and their guests.

The bed sheets (the upper one of course) are changed after each stay, something that is not typical in this industry, including first class hotels. The bedding is made of special material. I forgot the name of it, but you will sleep in it like a baby. 

They have numerous top notch restaurants on the property, but for the general occasions I suggest the ""Terrace Cafe"", which overlooks the pool area. They serve full meals there. I have a special insider tip for you. If you look at the menu, ignore the headline ""dinner"", ""breakfast"" or ""lunch"". You can order what you like at any time as long as they have the ingredients available. Cook time will be a bit longer, but even with special orders did I always get my food quickly and faster than in many restaurants where I just ordered the daily special.

The shows at the Wynn are great too. You should not miss to see ""Le Reve"", which means ""The Dream"" and is French. The working name for the Wynn project was actually ""Le Reve"" and the show was one of the first things that were organized before the hotel was even build. Creator of the show is Franco Dragone and anybody who has some interest in Cirque Du Soleil shows will know this name. Dragone is the mastermind behind the vast majority of CDS shows, including the shows ""O"" and ""Mystere"", which are also running in Las Vegas. The show is much like a Cirque du Soleil show and this should not come to a surprise, considering who created it. The music is fantastic too. I bought the soundtrack right there after I saw the show the first time. I do not recommend the VIP pass, which includes Champagne and fruits; because you will be seated at the top most rows in the venue and that is not the best spot to sit for the show. The first three rows are also only for folks who do not mind to get wet (this is not an IF scenario, you will get wet there). About 5th row is probably the best location. Trust me on that one, I have seen the show already twice and done the VIP thing myself.

The other show is ""Spamalot"", which is a spin-off the famous Monty Python movie ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". If you know the movie, then you will recognize many things from the movie in that show, including the famous song ""Bright Side of Life"". If you don't like British humor, this show is probably not for you.

There is much more, but you can explore this stuff yourself. The atmosphere of the place invites to take a little stroll through the property. If you book a room off season, you can get a resort room for a price that is less than half of their regular rate of $300+ per night. It is well worth the money and a good place to spoil your better half and enjoy a weekend away from your children.

The rooms were large and comfortable,  the view was of the car park so was pretty crappy, you can't use the fridge to keep any drinks cool as they will charge you if you do (I guess they want to encourage their customers to use the bars). The resort fee is a ripoff we didn't even use the pool because it closes so early so $75 for 3 days of internet (an hour a day of actual use) is a joke.

The hotel seems to care more about it's encore and casino guests rather than the wynn guests. Service is not great and the buffet breakfast is of low quality (more about variety), not worth it, save your money and go to a cafe outside the hotel.

We wanted to use the bathtub on the last night but when we filled it we noticed gross things floating on top like body hair and fluff!

The privacy aspect of the Tower Suites is GREAT: private elevators, the Tower Suites Bar and Tableau restaurant, conveniently located right there together, away from the Casino (more or less) The Tower Suite Bar was excellent, the space is warm and comfortable and the service was friendly and attentive.

It's the best sleep I've had in a while. Flatscreen tv. Huge bathtub. Tv in the bathroom. Desk with fax and internet connection to do your work if you're here for business (but you gotta pay for that internet, around $12). And oh, DON'T touch those mini bar snacks!! Move them for more than 30 seconds and they'll charge you whether you eat them or not. A good place to stay if you plan on staying in the room for an extended period of time, but a little too costly if you're going to be out most of the time.

GAMBLING:

25 cent Wheel of Fortune is my new best friend. There's nothing like spinning the wheel and winning a couple hundred dollars. Make sure you can hear other people spinning and winning though, because one time I played when people weren't  and lost some money.

Roulette tables change their minimum at night. The cheapest table is $10 and it goes up to $15. It's not a big bump, but it's big enough to keep me from playing more than a couple of spins. I don't know if it's a Vegas norm or a Wynn norm. And personally, I think the table was hitting 00 a little too often.

1 cent slots--fun to play, easy to win, but overall I think you win more by playing something like Wheel of Fortune.

SKINNY on the WYNN PLAYER's CARD (RED CARD):

FREE PLAY
Upon signing up for the Red Card you get $10 free play. You do not have to be a guest to get the card. After earning (by spending\/winning) 25 points you get to spin their wheel and win a prize (money in slot play, free buffets, etc). However, do not assume that 1 point equals 1 dollar as I did, because 1 point is actually $3 spent\/won. Yikes! I was wondering why it was taking so long to accumulate points...

SKIP THE BUFFET LINE
Get the Red Card and you can skip the long regular buffet line and stand in a shorter Red Card line.

FREE BUFFETS
Upon signing up for the Red Card, you can earn points during your visit to win 2 free buffets. (I don't know how this works for people who are not guests of the hotel. I was there for 3 days so I had 3 days to earn my points.) To win the buffets, you do have to earn 150 points, which is a lot, but depending how big a gambler you are, you might earn it pretty quickly. And if you're an even bigger gambler and earn 500 points, you can get 2 more free buffets. Buffets can be used during a future visit. 

If you're with another person you can just use the same card to accumulate points faster. If you both live at the same address and can prove it (via driver's licence, etc.) you have the option of linking your cards so you can each sign up and each get the $10 free slot play, and as I understand it (double-check to be sure), your combined points can work towards the buffets.",2,0,0

The Wynn is, by far, my absolute favorite hotel, ever, period! I've only stayed here once, in Jun 2009 (& only once b\/c I've tried to stay @a different hotel each time I go to Vegas, which is 7x so far). But am definitely only staying here again next time I go to Vegas.

Rooms were immaculately clean & neat. Beds were amazingly comfy. Floor-to-ceiling windows were an added plus, especially when in a Strip-view room (Mine actually overlooked the roof of something as I was only on the 8th floor, but I did manage to see some of the Strip! haha). I loved having his & her sinks & a vanity table AND a TV in the ginormous bathroom (Although I must admit it was pretty funny trying to watch the Yankee game from my shower only to have it steam up eventually & I couldn't see anything, hehe).

In addition to the rooms, the service in this hotel is superb. Everyone was so nice & speedy, they totally more than earned every tip I gave them. Not one bit of snotty attitude that I've gotten at other (not as classy) hotels (*coughcough* Planet Hollywood *coughcough*).

The pool is great, but gets packed quickly. Had to circle a bit til my friends & I found ourselves some lounge chairs. Also loved the fact that they allow European sunbathing (aka topless sunbathing) in the back-end of the pool.

It's super classy, upscale without making you bankrupt after a 2-night stay (hopefully), and will stand the Vegas test of time. It's an absolutely gorgeous resort with everything you could possibly need. 

After checking in, you'll immediately start feeling like royalty. Security checks for your hotel key as you walk towards the elevator, because only superstars get to go up to the ginormous hotel room that awaits them. My husband and I recently celebrated our 30th birthdays together and paid for a 57th floor panoramic view upgrade. The view was to die for (literally you would die it's so high up). With a sunset view of the strip, you can get comfortable on those luxurious hotel chairs and sip your whiskey while starring down at the mighty LV Blvd below. 

While the view and room is huge with a royal sized bed, the bathroom is what must blow everyone's mind. The bathroom is the size of my old studio. No joke, it is a KINGDOM. It comes with a TV, a large shower, a huge tub, a vanity station, two sinks, and a private toilet room WITH a phone. To a woman, that bathroom screams ""get sexy and get your party on"" and in my case, I sure did. If you stay at the Wynn you will take pictures of the bathroom. 

The casinos, the decorations, the intricacy of every touch and detail screams perfection. Even The Cafe (the ""after-party I'm drunk and need food"" spot) has grandiose chandeliers and a ceiling full of black damask patterns. On my next trip, I'll definitely plan checking out a couple Wynn restaurants. This time around I mainly got food to go at the basic The Cafe and at The Terrace Cafe.. which says a lot about the drunken destruction the night before.

Highly recommend the Wynn to families and especially couples. It will never disappoint and you'll feel transformed into a superstar Vegas VIP for however long your stay might be.",12,1,4

I loved the litle touches - a hair dryer in the room, a vanity, a giant jacuzzi tub and shower,  automatic curtains and a killer flat-screen TV. I almost forgot there was an  incredible casino below. Wifi costs around $13 bucks a day and room service in 24 hours (there are a lot of choices too). For only $60 extra for an upgrade, you may want to consider changing your room out to a Tower Suite when you arrive in Vegas. The experience is really a glorious one.

It only has to make small routine changes in order to be held at higher esteem. The first thing that went wrong was the arrival. The check-in was eternal. We walked in through the front doors and turned right to a reception area with a sign reading ""registration."" We waited in line even though there was 2 other available employees. Once we got called up, the lady told us that check-in was down the hall. I mean whatta fuck kind of service is that. So that already pissed me off, and then the actual check-in also took a while but this employee was nice. The next problem is the casino dealers. I understand that being a casino dealer must suck. I would definitely consider it one of the shittier jobs in the service industry. They constantly have to deal with drunk gamblers and potentially rude high rollers that can do whatever the fuck they want. But the casino dealers were all particularly in a shitty mood. We went to the Cosmopolitan and their dealers at least pretended to be happy. This next problem isn't necessarily a problem but more of a comment. Upon arriving to the Cosmopolitan, I realized that their casino\/restaurant waitresses are all incredibly sexy -something that the Wynn did not measure up to. I'm not here to judge, but I will say that people are gonna be more inclined to hang around a casino with smoking hot waitresses that are really good at pretending to like you. The Wynn's taxi service is pretty on point. You don't even need to get an Uber. I mean, you still gotta get in a smelly taxi, which sucks, but thats a personal decision I guess. My last big concern with the Wynn was the slow service in general. I went to this little restaurant in the lobby called little Charlie's or something like that. Anyways we walked in and there was literally 5 empty tables and the lady told us it would be a 20 minute wait. And the place is like a diner, so nobody is making any reservations. It's a big hotel so I understand that service is going to be a little slow, but this was more than a little slow. I'm new to Vegas and to be honest, i'm not a big fan, but I think i'm safe in assuming that the Wynn is one of the better hotel options.",0,0,0

The Wynn, therefore, was a breath of fresh air.  The lobby was incredibly beautiful and smelled so fresh and clean, with lots of fresh flowers, which I saw throughout the resort.  

The room was beautiful, in shades of whites and cream.  Very similar in layout to the Palazzo, with the exception of the sunken living room in the Palazzo, which we did like.  But this room more than made up for that living room.  Huge windows overlooking the strip.  Room was well maintained and cleaned well every day.  Room SMELLED so good, did not detect a HINT of smoke.  Cool Picasso prints on the walls.  LOTS of glasses, including water glasses, wine glasses, smaller drink glasses, glasses in the bathroom.  Awesome sunken soaking tub.  Bed was very comfortable.

The light panels for the room (located near the door and near the bed) are awesome to easily turn off\/on the lights and also open\/close the curtains.  

I did order room service once while there, and it was overall very good.  I've never ordered steak from room service before, and not surprisingly it was a little cold, but cooked perfectly with very good flavor.  Fries were good.  French onion soup had too much cheese.

First the actual building is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen, a nice break from the standard Vegas hotel architecture. The inside is breathtaking. Plush carpets, fresh flowers, jeweled tiles, and REAL Picasso's make this place dripping with splendor. The casino is full of friendly dealers, plenty of tables, yet is not so big I get lost. The shopping (not as good as Ceasers) is also great. Hermes, Chanel, John Paul Gautier, Dior, Manolo Blahnik, you name it, they got it! They have an amazing selection of restaurants. We like the casual ""Sugar and Ice"" for their mango sorbet, turkey club sand which, and tuna salad. Daniel Boulud was amazing. Hands down best fine dining service I have ever had. The chicken consomme was killer. The buffet was truly amazing. The mint green walls adorned with fresh flower arrangements made us forget we just paid 35 dollars for a buffet, but oh boy, the food delivered!! The rooms were the best I have seen in Vegas. We just had a standard room but we still had a floor to ceiling view of the strip, flat screen TVs in the room and bathroom, his and her vanity's, a shower and separate tub, a HUGE comfy bed, and well stocked mini bar. Upon arrival our kind bellman showed us all the details of the room and even offered to help us make dinner reservations.
My Only Complaint:
We couldn't get into Tryst even being a good looking couple who were hotel guests. They didn't even have a line, it was literally a herd of people whom they started selecting ones to get in. That was ridiculous. Most hotels offer a hotel guest line or no cover for hotel guests. We went up to our room and called the front desk and complained, but, we didn't let that spoil out fun. 
So, if you are going to spend 3-400 bucks on a hotel room, don't cheat yourself luxury by going somewhere else. This is the place to be! Steve Wynn outdid himself!",2,0,2

Wynn and Encore are connected to each other and the rooms look exactly the same maybe except for some of the decorations in the hall ways.

We ended up with a panoramic view room overlooking the golf course and were thrilled with the view. The room was a bit smaller than some of the other rooms we stayed in LV, but the furnishings were new and everything was quite clean. The bed was awesome, super soft with soft sheets and an even better pillow.

The pool area huge with tons of chairs; but you will need to get there early if you want a good spot. The ""european"" pool was a cool idea; but my dream of the second coming of the Playboy mansion grotto ended pretty quickly as the pool was full of 22 year old douchebags and roving packs of chain smoking brits.

One of the guests next to me at the pool asked the waitress for water and was told that they stopped giving people ice water but there was a tub of water over by the pool gift shop (which meant a tub of $6 bottled water). This isn't a crack on Wynn; but a reflection of Vegas and the direction the town is going. The strip is really starting to get a nickle and dime feeling to it. Everything that can be monetized has. You want ice in your drink? extra 2.50...that bottle of bud is only 9.50....you actually want to sit down in a club after paying $30 to get in? that will be $300 plus a ""thank you"" to the host if you thought at any point you had a good time.

Be warned that in rooms on that side of the building you will be subjected to the bass thumping coming from early morning parties at the Encore pool.

The only downside of the stay was the quality of the food for the price. I don't mind paying top dollar for food but I expect top quality for it. The food at the Chinese restaurant was bland and overcooked. At the late night Italianish place my wife got the meatball app for $18 but was told there was no bread to go with it.

Here is the breakdown of the highs and lows:

Checkout (1 star):  As I waited in line for an eternity, I noticed why it was taking people so long to check out.  It was like taking a time machine back to prehistoric times as they were filling out carbon copies of TPS forms and other things for mini-bars and room charge disputes.  Receipts took forever to be printed out and apparently someone was scrawling them on a stone tablet.  

Here is the worst part, after waiting my turn in line, I finally got to the counter.  I asked the lady behind the desk if she would take a fedex pack (already prepaid) and just have it dropped off in a fed ex box.  She said this is not her job and I would have to walk across the entire casino to the business center to drop it off.  Mind you I was checking out so I had all my bags.  Seriously?  That is about as bad as it gets.  Apparently she forgot she is in a customer service industry *Sigh*.  Had I the time or the inclination I would have pointed out to her where she failed.  

Valet (5 star): On a positive note, I asked the valet if he could do this for me and he happily obliged so I gave him a nice tip.  

Pool (2 star):  Getting to the pool is a real hassle which requires multiple elevators and winding halls if you are going from your room to the pool.  Pool area is ok and I like the long stretch in the middle which allows you to get a little workout if you like.

Room (4 star):  Room is nice with a comfortable bed.  The TV takes forever to get to the regular channels.  The wifi worked ok but something about this hotel really screwed with my cell service.  

Overall:  the lady at the check out pissed me off so bad that I left disappointed.",3,2,0

After seeing excessively glowing reviews of this place, I am compelled to chime in.  Not that this isn't an overall fabulous hotel, but I just don't know if I'd rate it as high on the coolness scale as it seems to put itself, you know?  I wasn't actually paying for my room (vacay with the 'rents, yay!), and I can say with confidence that I don't think it would be worth my hard-earned cashola.  Yes, the room was gorgeous, with an obnoxiously large bathroom, and I could have melted away into those soft sheets... had construction not woken me up every morning.  

I guess it's just that if you're going totally top notch, you have a certain level of expectation, and there were several ways the Wynn felt short.  The staff was never particularly friendly, and we actually felt like some sort of riff-raff as we were physically stopped to show our keys on our way to the elevator.  The pool area completely filled up by midday, leaving us to wander around like lost little kids looking for seats to put our overly plush towels on.  We had heard how amazing the gym was, but there was an exorbitant daily charge if you wanted to use it (unless you signed up for an equally exorbitant spa service.)  And my mom's biggest peeve: we had to wait well over an hour for brunch (it was Mother's Day, apparently a holiday for brunching), and it felt like we were in line for a ride at Disneyland, not an expensive brunch in a fancy hotel.  You'd think it would have occurred to them to walk around with pastries or something to keep us from getting restless, but instead the staffers just barked at people not to cut in line and watched us stare at our watches.

The Wynn pool is very relaxing. In our cabana, we were taken care of by Joe who made sure to stop by frequently, which was appreciated. Joe was comfortable with the menu, which made our order much easier. 

Food: I ordered the Berry Smoothie with no dairy, using pineapple juice as a base instead of yogurt! Additionally, I had the Garden Pita. The Garden Pita was SO good that I've been making it at home ever since! (Almost a week now!) The Garden Pita is prepared with a variety of fresh veggies stuffed into a fluffy, warm pita along with red pepper hummus. Seriously. SO good! Our table shared a fresh Guacamole, Salsa, and Chips dish that was prepared very nicely. I usually love guacamole more, but the salsa was really really delicious! 

The pool itself was busy but still was quite relaxing. After a short while, we ventured into the European pool hoping to have more fun with the blackjack tables, bar, and topless pool.

I haven't been for a few years now and when my friend and I decided to book our stay we knew that we had to go with the Wynn. I had heard great things and was so excited at the thought of staying that I almost peed myself....which is why I'm left feeling a little disappointed with the end result. There were things that I loved about my stay here but to be honest, I was left a little disappointed on some levels. 

Things that impressed me: 

- The pool: it's huge, beautiful, new and has plenty of lounging spots. They offer pool side service but beware, if you're hoping for a speedy turn over you may want to adjust your expectations or risk severe frustration. 

- The room: Beautiful, modern with cool art, a huge flat screen tv and a small tv in the bathroom that you can watch while getting ready. The beds were out of this world comfy; there were times when I didn't want to get out of bed. The view (at least from the 37th floor) was awesome. 

-Gambling: I won about $200 on penny slots. Ha! 

-Clubs: Had such a blast at Tryst and XS; they are the hottest clubs in Vegas right now and you'd be a fool not to check them out. Thanks, Mac, for hooking us up! :) 

- The fantastic deal we found on Travelocity: $396 (each - 2 people) for 4 nights and airfare. That is just an unbelievable price. 

Things that did NOT impress me: 

- The jenky-ass room they first tried to put us in. It was on the 6th floor and overlooking the top of another building. We went up, took one look and said hell no and demanded another room. 

- There was just not enough places to eat inside the hotel. They had only ONE cheap option which was this little cafe that offered crap. The only other two options were the buffet for $30 a pop and the Terrace Grill which was sit down. 

- Along those lines, since the Wynn is so new, It didn't feel developed enough for me (e.g. no shopping, not enough food options, etc.) We had to go to Cesar's and The Venetian to really get some good diversity. 

- It's at the end of the strip so you're not central; I didn't mind this so much but it's definitely something to think about when you're considering a place to stay. Expect lots of walking or lots of $$ spent on cabs. 

- The last thing, which probably made me the most irritated out of everything, was that there was NO COFFEE MAKER in the room!!! What. The. F*CK. What kind of hotel room as nice as that one doesn't offer some free coffee. I physically had to call the front desk and ask if I was missing something. Devastatingly, they confirmed my suspicions and directed me to in-room dining. After all was said and done, we were billed $18 for 2 small cups of coffee. 

As you can see, my review is conflicted. I wouldn't deter somebody from coming here but I would make sure to point out all the negatives that I stated above. 

Now, time to get back to nursing my liver back to health.",13,8,5

it was my birthday weekend and i booked way in advance so we got a really great deal for a two-night stay.  they even let us check in way earlier than the normal check-in time.. around noon.  they even put your name on the hotel keys. how cool is that?

lobby is beautiful and definitely looks so much different in the daytime than at night, since we're usually only there at night to go clubbing.  the floor to ceiling windows are amazing and we had a beautiful view of the pools and the golf course. definitely feels like your in another world when you dont really see the strip.  housekeeping is great, really fast and attentive.  

we hardly left the hotel since EVERYTHING you need is there at the wynn or at encore.. and is all walking distance. such as restaurants, shopping, and of course.. XS, tryst, surrender, and blush are all just downstairs.. its awesome not having to take a cab anywhere =)

Everything from the check-in, asking directions, room service, cleaning service, hanging at the bar, the restaurant, luggage\/bell service, & room quality was A+, 5 star. 

I got a good deal for round trip air on jetblue and the apartment suite that I couldn't pass up for the recent magic\/project fashion trade show.

The room was beyond perfect. Felt like I was a brand new guest at the suite. The light switches were a bit weird, but I guess that goes with sleeping in a new surrounding. 

Room was perfectly quiet. Amazing view of the strip with the floor to ceiling windows. Great seeing the fireworks at treasure island at night around 6ish when I went back to shower and refresh before getting ready to go out. 

Room service was a tad expensive. I got back to the hotel late around .... actually I dont remember the time and was craving a cheese burger and strawberry milkshake. $42.50 ! Ouch but oh well it was def tasty. 

Everyone at the whole hotel was great. Had good drinks at the lounge at encore while waiting for the table at Strata restaurant. Decent meal. Had bitter salad and lasagna with some tasty pinot noir. Def was pricey but not too crazy. I would give overall restaurant rating a 7.5\/10 because the food only did so much for me. 

Stayed for 3 nights and didnt want to leave the morning I had to checkout. Waking up with the view of the snow capped mountains with the sun coming up was just awesome. 

Oh, the bathroom was amazing too. HUGE. His\/Her areas and a big walk in closet. All marble bathroom was just great. 

I hung out in the living room mostly when I was working on my mac and making calls. Having the extra TV in there was nice for background music and had the couch looking out onto the strip.

The place is fantastic.  Similar to the Aria, it's very updated, very upscale, and provides ALL the amenities.  The rooms are just over 600 square feet, and again, like the Aria, all electronic.  What I REALLY liked, as did the wife, was the fact that the far wall was all glass.  Our room looked out over a fantastic golf course.  Nice big screen in the room, and the wife appreciated the rather cool bathtub.

The buffet was well laid out, with something for everyone.  A small cafe further down actually has reasonably priced breakfasts, too (something you do NOT see in resort hotels in Vegas!).

So why the drop in rating?  Simple - our room was over Tryst, the hip night club.  Which meant that our ""quiet room"" thumped with bass from 10pm to 4am both nights we were here.  And THAT was high on the suck factor.

There is not too much that I could say that hasn't been said by the other 485 reviews, except to share my experience: 

Steve Wynn has the experience of building so much of modern day Vegas.  I just stayed at Bellagio last month and with the Wynn\/Encore, he has truly built the best hotel.  The difference between Bellagio and W\/E is that they are now ""corporate-owned"" whereas Steve gets to do whatever he wants or needs to do.

The rooms are opulent.  I should warn you that I think the front desk plays an upgrade game where they tell you that your room is not ready and then they try to upsell you to be a bigger room.  I witnessed this on either side of me when I was checking in.  They had a problem with my reservation and I was offered an ""upgrade"" for free.  Comparing rooms with my coworkers, I could not see any difference.  Hrmmm

The food is all over-the-top good.  There are NO inexpensive restaurants in the hotel.  Expect to eat like a king everywhere and pay a fortune for it.  I ate at Lakeside and can wholely recommend it, if only for the experience of seeing a  strange animatronic show.  Steve Wynn certainly has a sense of humor having a giant, black-lit frog sing ""It's a Wonderful World""

The convention services are phenominal.  Not a blip of trouble and everyone was super nice and responsive.  Catered lunches were almost as good as the restaurant food - definitely a departure from your normal troughs of food at trade shows. 

The clubs - XS and Surrender - oh if the walls could only talk.  I am beyond the ""clubbing"" age, but it was definitely a treat to see how\/where the rich, young, rich, beautiful, rich people party.

I am not sure who\/how the $20\/day resort fee works.  I thought I signed something agreeing to it when I checked in.  But then when I went to use the fitness center - they told me I didn't sign up for it.  And then they wanted $15 for each day of using the center.  

Yes, the blackjack tables START at $25 per hand - ON A TUESDAY NIGHT!  There were no shortage of people playing\/losing at the $100 table.  I guess it goes with the rest of the place.  

On the flip side, I only paid $159\/night with my convention rate, but Steve made up for the [cheap] room rate with everything else.   However, it was all worth it.",4,2,3

When booking the room I specifically asked for a strip facing room with two beds, and I told them it was for a special occasion.  The Wynn room agent said no problem for two beds with a strip view, but the floor would be determined at check in.  They said that since it was a special occasion they would take care of us.  (1st LIE)

Upon checking in around 1:15PM they said our room was not ready, but they would text me when it was.  I was again confirmed that I was getting a 2 bed, strip view room.  The front desk agent assured my that I was getting a high floor, 2 bed, strip view. (2nd LIE)

Around 3pm I got the text that my room was ready, when I retrieved my room keys I was told that I was getting a golf course view room.  I explained to the agent, what I requested, reserved, and paid for was a strip view room, and that I was told at booking and at check in that that is would I would be getting.  He told me that the Wynn didn't have any 2 bed strip view rooms!  Why wasn't I told that when I booked the room or at check in?  Since we had dinner reservations at 4pm, and show tickets at 7pm, I didn't have a lot of options.

When I got to our room, I found our view was anything but special.  We had a full view of a construction site, a partial view of a golf course, and right smack in the middle of our view was the Encore.

I called the manager and spoke with Ruben who said he was very empathetic but the only thing he could offer was a bottle of champagne.  Seriously?  Planning a special event for months, only to be lied to twice about the room we requested, and the ""sorry"" was a $10 bottle of champagne?... Really?  And that is what they call first class customer service?  Ruben informed me they could do nothing about the price of the room.  I declined the champagne and decided to salvage the evening and have fun, despite being lied to.

The next morning I was still upset about our room view and being lied to, so I spoke with Ruben again, and the most he would compensate us for being lied to was $50 off or $300 room rate.  That covers the resort fee.

I checked out using the phone.  I told them I didn't want to stand in line, and if I could get my room invoice without standing in the check out line.  The operator told me to go to the side desk and they would have it ready for me, no standing in line. (3rd LIE).  When I got there they told me I would have to stand in the 30 minute line, I wanted to avoid in the first place. 

I also lost a pair of sunglasses when I went to lost and found to determine if they were turned-in, the security officers were incredibly rude, which just added to my already disappointing experience at the Wynn.

On principal alone, a business should not promise one thing, charge the customer for that item, and then give them something completely different.  I believe they call that ""Bait and Switch"" and it's illegal.

If the Wynn did not have the type of room that we wanted, they should have just made that clear when I booked the room.

When I was trying to decide which hotel to stay at for our special occasion, and clicked on the ""About Us"" tab on the Wynn website, and found the following;
""Our commitment to making every visit a once-in-a-lifetime experience to our guests is what makes us who we are.""

Honestly, they fell very short on their commitment to us...

We're typically Venetian patrons, but its free so we figured what the hell, let's do it up.  We arrive and as we're checking in (2 guys, 2 girls), we pull off the the trusty old room upgrade gambit with a $40 tip.  The front desk guy gave us a wink and told us he'd take care of us with a romance package.  So we head up to our room feeling pretty good about it, and walk in to find a regular room puzzled by what he meant.  There was nothing out of the slight ordinary to suggest any romantic additions at all.  Not a single thing, not even robes.  Hell, even the Venetian leaves chocolates on your bed and a dim overhead light illuminating the bed with their regular turn down service -- none of that here.  Yes, Venetian has more romance offered on any given day than what I could make of this.

The room has 2 full sized beds.  Nope, not queen -- full beds.  Even Holiday Inn has queens.  Come on, Wynn, are you even trying?  It's okay, we'll request a roll-away and make due.  But I guess for the basic room we were in, they don't offer roll-aways because it violates fire code?  Room service was impressively bad except for the fries, which is pretty hard to screw up.  My friend couldn't finish a basic BLT sandwich even with her drunken appetite.

The girls that were with us thought we were just being super anal about everything because we couldn't stop making comparisons to the Venetian.  However, we ended up spending our last night in the Venetian and the Venetian converted them to fans with their rooms, food, and service within a couple of hours.  Then even they started echoing most of our Wynn criticisms.  Even though the rooms were free, it would have been more worth it to pay to stay at the Venetian.

They do have quite an awesome ice machine though, like seriously legit.",7,8,5

Rooms are immaculate and the suite bathrooms are to die for.
Service is extraordinary and very friendly.
The casino has the best ventilation system ever.  I sat there playing blackjack for about 4 hours and didn't have any problem with smoker's smoke.  I didn't even smell it on my clothes.  2 big thumbs up for me for that.  I'm not a smoker and I was dreading going to the casino for that reason alone.

The entrance is gorgeous.  Lined with marble and decor lit well.

The club Tryst is downstairs and is one of the better clubs in vegas.  What's cool is that the huge glass windows open up to the waterfall in the distance.  It's a gorgeous scene.

It's definitely not a cheap hotel.  You know you're in luxury as soon as you roll into the hotels drop off\/pickup area.  The hotel cost $2.7billion to build.  They have to make their money back somehow.

As a semi frequent traveller to LV, I've stayed at about half the hotels on the strip and the Wynn is by far the best (with Paris a distant second). I booked rooms at the Wynn for myself and my mother for her 60th birthday and it was one of the best ever. 
While the theme of some Vegas hotels is repoducing another city or theme, the Wynn's theme is quality and luxury. The view is the best in town and the rooms are laid out in a most attractive manner. For some reason I was very impressed with the bathroom which had a shower and a tub as well as a TV. The beds were the most comfortable I had slept in at a hotel and the automatic curtains made waking up an experience. 
The casino is elegant and the deli is unbelieavable. The fact that it is at the end of the Strip is really the only drawback. It's a solid 15 minute walk to get to the Bellagio which can get to be kind of a drag if you want to go someplace specific.

We had an excellent stay and would return. For the most part, we were treated with the utmost professionalism and made to feel special. The casino and resort are lovely, and our criticisms not deal-breaking.

ZOOZACRACKERS
They must be taking the NYC deli theme seriously between the service, prices and portions!

We visited twice. Food was inconsistent. The bread fell apart, and the meat was bone-dry. Mushroom-barley soup was delish! On the 2nd visit, the cashier seemed impatient, and we had to wait 15 minutes for our food to arrive. Overpriced for the small(ish) portions. 

SW STEAKHOUSE
It was a special night for my sister's 50th birthday. Delicious food, ambiance and our server Corey and sommelier Fabrice were pros. The hostess seemed bored and didn't look clients in the eye when talking. I hear that's normal for Vegas.

ROOM SERVICE
Room service was a pleasure: exceptional server (I wish I could remember her name), good food, an impressive set up and recall of every detail of our order. It was like a restaurant ""pop up"" right in our room. No one returned to clean up after the meal, even though we gave the server a specific time, so the dishes stayed there for a full day. Even still, I'd say this was the best room service that I've had in Vegas. If we hadn't been entertaining family, we would have ordered-in more, enjoyed the view and privacy and skipped bummers like Zoozacrackers.

SPA (at Encore)
My sister enjoyed her massage and facial, and I enjoyed a day pass. Well worth the money. The facility was clean and elegant; although the cool-water pools look worn and dated: more backyard-1980s than opulent 5-star resort. Management should consider upgrading them. The steam room was excellent -- best I've experienced. I only wish that you'd add a snow room like Caesars. Then, I'd likely consider it my favorite Vegas spa.

THE POOLS (Wynn)
The outside pool area is impeccable: beautiful landscaping, clean lounge area, good pool-side service. Didn't enjoy the young kids playing in the pool, splashing water in my face several times, but didn't feel like planting myself in the ""European"" topless area either. Wish the pool (on the Wynn side) stayed open later. That would have been fantastic.

THE BUFFET
I was excited to visit the Wynn buffet, but I was underwhelmed. Nothing we ate was particularly memorable, and I didn't feel compelled to return for seconds. We were scratching our heads on the absence of a full salad and fruit bar or designated breakfast station at 10:30 a.m.. Even though I'm a foodie, I like buffets to stick with the basics. Not that I'm expecting Hometown Buffet or Souplantation (!), but the point of a buffet is to be able to make my own plate, not go around picking tapas-sized items like I'm ordering off an upscale, eclectic restaurant menu. We also had a space-cadet server who always returned with the wrong drinks or forgot us altogether. He never made conversation. The hostesses at the front were overworked and cranky. Though we could tell that the Wynn really wanted its buffet to live up to its Wynn brand, it just didn't get there. We weren't impressed.

ROOM COMFORT
We had a very clean, well apportioned panoramic view of the golf course. Thank you! The iPod station was missing its cord. (HK fixed the later issue promptly.) Bed linens were delightful. The robes and towels were thick and plush but a little too scratchy for my taste. I'd rather have smaller, thinner towels if it means they're soft. An enormous Brillo pad doesn't do anyone any good.",4,1,0

Let me count the reasons ...

1. The decor is fantastic.  I love the beautiful garden\/atrium once you walk in.  Even the fake flower smell pumped in the air has some kind of relaxing appeal.

2. The service here has always been solid.  The folks at the reception desk are friendly and generally the staff is very helpful.

3. The rooms are minimalist and tastefully modern.  I was lucky enough on my most recent visit to get a room on one of the highest floors in the hotel and the view was phenomenal.  Even though I was facing west (instead of the main strip to the south), I was still overwhelmed by the great view of the surrounding landscape and had a good view of old strip to the north.  

4. The rooms were clean and the beds were super comfortable.  I had by best sleep ever in Vegas by far here (and I've stayed in the following - Bellagio, Venetian, Paris, Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Planet Hollywood, Caesars, and the old Sahara).

5. Even though the table games and slots are expensive I enjoyed playing here because the atmosphere isn't that smoky and the crowd isn't that loud\/rowdy. 

6. The Wynn Buffet is still my favorite in all of Vegas, along with Caesars and Wicked Spoon.  The crab legs here are still the best in Vegas IMO and even though they don't have a HUGE amount of variety compared to other places the quality of each individual item is solid.  I also love the dessert section here.

The only real drawback is that this place is about a 20 min walk from the Bellagio\/Caesars area and that the rooms can be pricey.  But it's worth it for what what you get and also the benefit of not getting as much annoying traffic here as you do in mid-strip.",5,4,3

The casino floor is filled with enough tables to assure you an open spot at your favorite game. The craps dealers are always exceedingly social and help promote an upbeat vibe amongst the players. The black jack dealers are knowledgeable and will respectfully advise inexperienced players on suggested strategies to maximize their chances against the house. The Wynn has the best sports book in all of Las Vegas. Each seat has a personal monitor that you can control, allowing you to switch between the games that you are dying to see.

Every restaurant in the Wynn is an experience. My favorite is Bartollota, which celebrates coastal Italian cuisine and features homemade pasta  and fresh seafood.

Perhaps my expectations were way too high with a well drink being greater than $15 and all however I was extremely disappointed when I asked for water for my friend and was denied by 'Missy' I don't understand how after watching someone get heat stroke in the pool earlier in the day that asking for a cup of water was a privilege granted to a certain few. Even getting Missy's name for this review was a task because I had to explain why I wanted her name before I got it. The west coast is weird and rude AF and clearly needs a better business plan and staffing. Good luck.,1,1,0

It's gorgeous, and although you aren't snorting coke off of silver trays and shitting in gold gilded toilets, you are shitting in the nicest bathrooms on the strip. Wynn, a once prolific art collector, had opened an art gallery here in 2006. I LOVED THIS ART GALLERY, and I loved it because it fully displayed Steve Wynn's self-cock suckery, his utter love and admiration for himself... from the monumentally sized diamond encrusted portrait that Warhol did of him that he appropriately displayed next to his Rembrandt and Renoir, to the curation that was done by him via tape recorded anecdotes of his experiences buying art (which only vaguely related to the art itself), the Wynn is really Steve's swan song, a final over-the-top dedication to his dying self. The Wynn gallery has sadly closed, but rather than moving the gallery, Wynn has scattered its ashes around the casino, so while you're getting completely hammered and handing your money over to the Wynn Empire, you can still participate in the unabashed cock suckery that once was the Steven Wynn Art Gallery.",3,13,6

This is a letter I sent them and got a ""I'm so sorry that happen to you and we will try to fix it"". I hope if you stay heretic get better service. 

 To whom ever it might concern,
I am emailing you in regards to the service I received for this reservation at the Wynn from 3\/28-3\/30. I reserve 3 rooms in total for a friends bachelor party and believed that the Wynn was the best place to celebrate. I want to recommend that your hotel is beautiful, the clubs (Xs, Surrender and Beach) were great clubs, gambling was fun and always found room to bet, the food at the Wynn cafe and Deli were reasonable price and delicious. Now to the bad. This is more to the hotel service and being let down by your workers. 

1) my friend and I arrive around 9am to try to  get a open room. I know check in is in the afternoon but most hotels let you get 1 of 3 rooms early if available. Registration said all rooms were busy so to wait for a text when they had a room. My friend wanted to check if registration forgot about us at 11am and to his amaze 1 of our rooms was available but they never text me and there was a line people who where getting their rooms already

2) More of an annoyance but could live with it. Our rooms where on the same floor but where far apart.

3) I asked for the all the rooms to have the fridge locked and the snacks taken away because of fear of my friends opening them after being at your night clubs. They were not removed so I called the front desk at 7pm on Saturday but they said they couldn't remove it because the employees who do that where gone. I was promised that I would get charged for the snacks by the manager on the phone. 

4) Around 730pm, I went to registration to pay part of the hotel bill with cash. After I had paid, I inquired to check that it was noted that wouldn't charge for the snacks. It was not done. I had to speak to another manager who shook my hand and gave me his business card and promised that I wouldn't get charge

5)I asked a few weeks after I checked out for my bill. To my surprise for 1 of the rooms, I charge for the snacks. I had to call the Wynn and waste my time correcting this error. I am happy to my money it was refunded to me

As you see from my list, it was 5 different occasions that the Wynn let me down. I again have wasted time writing this email and most likely from the track record of your service, I won't get an email response. I just wanted to let who ever cares about the Wynn to try to fix your service.  As for now, I guess we will stick to MGM, Venetian and Cesar's for our bachelor parties.",2,1,1

A hotel of this level can do much better. I emailed my complaints to guest services so below is an excerpt of my complaints.

-----------
My recent stay at the Wynn left me incredibly underwhelmed. There were several problems during our stay.

1. Although check in was at 3pm.  Our rooms were not available until after 5pm.

2. I asked for tape upon check in. I called at least 3 times from check in until the following morning before tape was brought to my room. I would have appreciated follow up from the hotel.

3. In the morning of 6\/2 the tv in 5846 did not work. I called for service and a new remote was brought to our room. It did not work. I called and asked that the tv should be serviced during the day. When I returned to the room after 6pm, the tv still did not work. Someone came to fix the tv after 6 pm but it took an entire day to service something so simple.

4. Housekeeping closed the doors connecting our 2  rooms on 6\/2 so my friend could not retrieve her items from the adjoining room. It took an hour before someone came to fix the problem.

5. I left my sweater in 5848. I find your $15 admin fee  for returned items to be outrageous.

6. Coffee makers are not in the rooms. That should be standard.

7. The refrigerators are stocked full of your merchandise. A $25 rental fee for a refrigerator is ridiculous. 

8. There were several times that no one answered the front desk phone, housekeeping phone or concierge phone.

Most of these items were minor inconveniences that luckily did not dampen our Las Vegas experience however I am confident that other hotels can do better.

I hope that you make some significant improvements to enhance your guests' experiences.

----------------
Just to be fair:

Some good notes

-They waived the admin fee to return an item a left in the room. :)

-The room was beautiful.

-The bathroom was huge.

-The hotel was clean and didn't reek of smoke.

So there you have it. There are too many options on the Strip to be so disappointed.",9,2,3

It can get expensive to stay here but I just love it and to me it is worth every penny. Each time I step in through the doors I feel more relaxed. I feel pampered and I feel like I'm home. Bravo. 

Hotel: I am asthmatic so I really appreciate it when a hotel and its rooms does not have the lingering scent of cigarette smoke. Maybe there are people who go around spraying the hotel with some relaxing scent. The decor of the rooms just adds to the relaxed atmosphere of the hotel room. Everything in the rooms are just a notch above the rest - even the toiletries. You can forget almost all of your toiletries and it will be available for you. The bed is one of the best I've ever slept on. I have had views of both the Strip and the golf course before. Both are gorgeous. 

Service: The employees really try to make you feel like you are somebody. If there is something wrong bring it up with them and they will try to work with you on it. I'm surprised that some people have had bad service because I have had anything but.

Salon: I got a manicure here one morning because I felt like it. They did a decent job and gave me green tea to drink. Again, just felt relaxed and pampered. I definitely will try more of their services the next time I visit. I am also very tempted by the spa....

Casino: This casino is one of the cleanest I've ever seen. I don't know how they do it but they do. I do not like going to a casino where I feel like I absolutely have to wash my hands after playing. The limits are kind of up there especially during peak times but I have noticed some $10 limits on the tables recently. Oh and do try the coffee. It is phenomenal!!!!

Nightclubs: Can't say much because clubbing isn't my thing. There are some interesting uhm...people though!

My friend and I got a fabulous deal through Hot Wire. We ""blind booked"" for a South Strip 5-star hotel and the Wynn accepted our offer for $125\/night! Originally we were going to stay 5 nights, but my manager told me to take more vacation days, so we blind booked again and also got the Wynn for $138 for the two additional nights.This is our third trip to Vegas and we usually travel around Halloween\/early November. Our first trip, we stayed at the Augustus Tower Suites at Caesars, and last year, we stayed in a GO room at the Flamingo. 

Please note: I work for a 5-star hotel, so as part of the hospitality industry, my observations may be seen as critical; however, as a consumer, my friend and I are pretty low maintenance. Things would have to be really bad for us to vocally complain to management.

Check-in
Compared to the Flamingo or Caesars, there were only a few people in line when we checked in at around 1pm. We were not even waiting for a minute when a front desk agent noticed we were waiting and offered assistance. They were able to accommodate us for one room throughout our entire stay, even though we had two reservations. We were given a red key card that also served as their player's card. We don't gamble much, but supposedly time on the slots will quickly rack up points for a comp meal at their buffet.

Fees
There is a $20\/day resort fee that includes usage of the fitness center and wireless internet. This does not include use of the spa facilities, which is $40\/day. Wireless internet without the resort fee is $13.99 per computer for 24 hours. While we did not like the resort fee, we decided it was a minor inconvenience for a better value, as we had both brought our laptops. 

Room
Our room, located on the 34th floor, was very spacious. It held two queen beds, a desk, and a flat screen TV. We had a great view of the golf course and the mountains, as well as the Encore. Another featured I liked was the wall panel that controlled the lights, curtains, room temperature and privacy\/service room options. There is also an iHome so you can charge your iPod. The safe was located in the closet. The bathroom was glorious, and on par with the suite we had at Caesars. The bathroom had two sinks with vanity, a private poo closet, a shower stall and a deep tub. There were no jets for the tub but it was fabulous. My friend is much larger than me and she found it comfortable. Water pressure was good. I also believe that Steve Wynn is not a fan of the low flow toilet, as our toilet was like the Dyson of the Ivory Throne: 100% suction all the time. There is also a TV in the bathroom, tuned to Steve's fave channel: Fox Business News. For the Asian gamblers, there is NHK, a Korean channel, and 4-5 Chinese channels so you don't have to miss your dramas. No Food Network, though!

Beds
The bed was very comfortable, although the pillows were too soft for our liking. The comforters are down-filled and I woke up often because I was too hot, even though our room temp never hovered above 70 degrees.

Amenities
Generous bathroom amenities included shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, face and body soap, shoe polish, buffer cloth, manicure kit and cotton balls\/swabs. I had forgotten my toothbrush and called Housekeeping. They were able to deliver a dental kit in under 30 minutes which included a toothbrush and toothpaste. 

Internet
Wireless was pretty speedy and there was no drop in connectivity. However, Wynn's site is pretty annoying and you will hear Steve's voice encouraging you to ""explore and find the surprises"" every 24 hours.

Housekeeping
We had our room serviced once during our stay and our housekeeper did a good job. A couple of days before, we had replenished our round shag bath rugs and some towels, but when she cleaned our room, the bath rugs were taken away, which I found odd. 

Gym
Very spacious gym with a huge variety of equipment. It does get crowded, so get there early if you want to use the stair climber or elliptical.

Noise
All is pretty quiet EXCEPT for when Tryst and XS are open. You WILL hear noise from 9pm-4am traveling up to your floor from outside your room's window. We were on the 34th floor. If you need quiet, I recommend you ask for a room higher up. Bring or ask Housekeeping for a pair of earplugs. I went to bed earlier than my friend, but she said the noise kinda dies down around 3am but you can still hear it until the clubs close.

Security
After 9pm or so, they station hotel staff near the resort elevators and you need to flash your room key to access them.

Check-out
Speedy checkout via the flat screen TV. They also have the Express Checkout mailboxes near the resort elevators.

Overall
Fantastic value! Not close to the hubbub of the Strip, but we immensely enjoyed our stay. We'll definitely use Hot Wire when we travel to Vegas again.",9,0,2

The buffet is expensive but well worth the price for what you are getting. It's definitely one of the best I've tried thus far.

I've only seen one show here, La Reve - The Dream and I highly recommend it.

As for the Wynn itself, it's a fun place to walk through. It's huge and there's tons of things to explore. They have high end boutique stores selling things I'll probably never be able to afford, but nice to look at nonetheless.

Pros: 

-The rooms are quite spacious 
-The rooms are clean 
-Have these cool electronic shades that close and open with a button next to your bed (I thought it was cool) 
-Rooms are modern looking 
-Hotel is relatively new 
-The bathroom is huge 
-The way to your hotel room is easy to navigate through the casino 
-The meeting services (convention services) are pretty right on and the staff is really nice in the banquet department 
-The do not disturb signs etc...are all electronic pretty cool 
-There are a lot of eateries to choose from in the hotel 
-The Fashion Show mall is right across the street if you want to get away from the casino\/hotel 
-A lot of nice high end shops in the hotel 
-The poolside area was pretty nice 

Cons: 

-I waited to check in and it took 45 minutes (not enough staff to check in) 
-The front desk staff is pretty unhelpful with everything-if you have a request don't expect it to be done quickly or at all 
-The air conditioning in the check in area was not working so in July I was dying of heat in the hotel 
-The air conditioning in the common areas in the hotels did not seem to be working everywhere was hot. 
-When I checked into my room the shades were wide open and the air conditioning was not on and according to the thermostat the temperature in the room was a sweltering 87 degrees...when it was 100 degrees outside 
-The air conditioning took 1.5 days to get down to 70 degrees but the hotel swears that nothing was wrong with my unit

My main complaint is about the disrespectful way they treated my friend who stayed there at the same time (altogether, we were 3 couples staying for 3-4 nights).I want to also mention that upon my arrival, my wife and I were offered a room upgrade for an extra $35 + tax, that was described by the front desk person as ""a much better view than a regular room"". We agreed and after visiting our friend's room, learned that it was exactly the same view as a room without an upgrade (in other words - a scam). We decided not to make a big deal out of it (approx. $160 down the drain) but I thought it should be mentioned as a bigger problem occurred afterwords. 
I was going to share my friend's statement that tells all the details but it's too long for a Yelp review. Here's the short version:
My friend and his wife arrived to the hotel straight from the airport and during check in, a front desk employee tried to scan my friend's passport 3 times. The 3rd attempt resulted in the tearing of the passport's 1st page (The one with the picture). My friend talked to multiple managers throughout his 3 day stay, had to drive in the middle of the night to Los Angeles to get a new passport (as he would not be able to board a plane with a torn one) and kept all receipts and hotel security reports. The attitude of all managers from different departments was full of anger, excuses and refusal to take responsibility for the tearing that was witnessed by his wife who's a retired Colonel from the army. All my friend asked for was a refund for the cost of the new passport (less than $500) and a refund for the room (about $800) as he hardly got to enjoy it. The answer that was given by Ruben Vivas (Senior hotel manager) was that the case is being investigated and will not be resolved until my friend leaves. After he left, the hotel informed him that he will get NOTHING. 

Since then, we have sent emails to different Wynn executives, Steve Wynn's web site and guest relations. As a result, Mr. Ruben Vivas, who by now we realized, is quite an arrogant and flawed individual (No idea how this guy made the position of ""Senior Hotel Manager""), called my friend overseas and offered him a $150.00 refund\/compensation. My friend said that this is a second insult as this amount has nothing to do with the passport expenses or the room cost. Ruben, who was clearly recording the conversation stuck to his guns and my friend refused this insulting offer.

I would like to conclude by saying that my friend and his wife are respectable people whom I have known for over 30 years. At no time did they raise a voice or tried to threaten or scam extra money or anything like that. 

The Wynn chose to completely ignore their mistake, not to take responsibility for their employee destroying an important international document and provide a nightmare sample of customer service by not righting the wrong they've done and throwing it back to the customer's face.

Ask yourself this question: Would a refund and apology even been an issue if my friend was a high roller?",0,0,0

Ohh the ATMs won't let you withdraw less than 100 bucks at a time. Didn't even really get any game play.  I'm fine with loosing the money but gosh at least make it fun. Let me be up a little and then let me be down a little. Then let me be up a little.  I'm used to how it works but this place seems really desperate for the dough.

Unlike the other hotels, because it's so fancy, there aren't any cheaper food options (for instance Caesars Palace has a food court with a variety of quick cheap bites). Even the little cafe they have is fairly expensive for what you get. $4 for a 20oz bottle of soda. $5 for a bottle of water. The food\/drinks at the pool were very expensive. $16 for a hotdog?!

I only went to Tryst, their night club and Bartolotta for lunch.  This hotel was beautifully decorated and had man-made waterfalls behind most, if not all, restaurants.  Tryst was amazing...there was a huge water fall behind the dance floor and cabanas wrapped around the pool.  If you had a bit too much to drink, it would appear that people were dancing underneath the falls.  Minimum charge to book a table is about $450, but they'll give you 2 bottles of Crown Royal.

Because of the initial visit, I thought this would be another tasteful and classy hotel, so this past weekend, my friends and I decided to book a room at their Tower Suites.  We were given 2 rooms, mine on the 30th floor and my friends' on the 50th floor even though we had asked for a connecting room.  Nevertheless, we didn't complain 'cuz it was 4am when we arrived and we just wanted to go to bed asap.  We went up to the 50th floor first to check out their rooms...for some reason thinking that the rooms on upper floors would be bigger and nicer.  Well, I was disappointed ~  the room was small and their 2 beds were only full-sized beds (it felt).  Their bathroom, however, was huge in comparison.  My room on the 30th floor was almost double the size of the other room.  Again, the bathroom is very nice except it didn't have a vent.  It had a toilet room within the bathroom but there was no vent either.  The bathroom had a shower with floor-to-ceiling glass and also a deep bathtub big enough for 2 people.  There was a small tv that was installed into the wall that faced the sink.  Towels weren't as soft as I would like them to be, but they were clean and nicely folded and organized.  They also provided 2 sets of toothbrush with Rembrandt toothpaste, a razor, shaving cream, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, cotton swabs, etc...even shoe polish and a bath brush.  There were also 2 bathrobes and 2 slippers in the closet.

Although the rooms seemed a bit plain and empty, the beds were very nicely made and it looked and felt very comfortable.  You could open and close the curtain and shade with a button next to the bed.  There's a plasma tv although the distance between the bed and tv is a bit far.  The windows went from floor to ceiling and left & right to each side of the wall, and the view was stunning.

I have walked through the Wynn many times and always admired how beautiful it is, so I was really looking forward to our week staying there and had high expectations. 

I do enjoy the aesthetics of the casino and shopping areas, although our resort room was entirely done in pinks so my husband felt like he was on vacation with Dame Edna. I would say the color scheme didn't take into consideration the comfort of most males, but I know my Grandma would love it! 

Our room was very clean and the maid service was very good. However, I can't say this was any better than any other LV hotel I have stayed at. So far every hotel room has been very clean and spacious. They all have flat screen TVs in the bedroom area and in the bathroom. They all have had great views, comfortable beds, lovely toiletries, and great bathrooms with double vanities and separated bathtub\/shower. Wynn was in no way superior. 

There are a few downfalls w\/ Wynn. 

During our week stay I went to the concierge desk twice to ask for assistance and both times the ladies acted like they just wanted me out of their face. Absolutely horrible customer service, and all I was doing was asking for recommendations. 

Wynn is very busy, there is always a crowd making it more of a chore to stroll around than a pleasure. Of course weekends in LV are always a madhouse, but even on a Tuesday afternoon the hotel was packed. Encore was a totally different story, so we would go over there for drinks and gambling - a much more comfortable atmosphere. 

If you are someone who is wanting to catch a few vagina flashes when the wasted girls fall down - hang out in the Wynn or Encore in the wee hours. Tryst and XS became the bane of my existence and seeing the types of girls hanging out around there makes me afraid to have children. While the behavior of club goers is not a reflection on the hotels, having the clubs in the locations they are within the hotels was a problem for hotel guests. We were on the 26th floor and could hear the music from Tryst until 5am. I will admit it didn't keep me up, but I would think if you are on floors 10 or less it would be an issue. My friend staying in Encore had the same problem with the XS music. It was all very Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan, which is just not my scene. 

And my experience at the salon was the WORST of my life, but I will save that story for the salon\/spa review. 

I probably would not stay at Wynn again, although I would definitely consider staying at Encore. Encore felt more intimate. Both hotels are stunning and most definitely should be seen while in LV. And they both have some great dining options. I was just a bit let down as my expectations were very high.",3,2,1

Mirrors, mirrors, mirrors- and mirrors within mirrors and things on mirrors. Why? Well, because you are beautiful. Oh wait, no you're not.

I like the room a lot! The standard room is very large. Ten foot ceilings make it feel larger still. The walls have textured wall paper with colors that vary from room to room. The ceiling is white; the furniture is light colored. One wall is completely taken up by floor to ceiling windows. The curtains (both sheer and solid) are electronically controlled by buttons near the bed.

There's a good amount of drawer space. The dresser itself is somewhere limited, as one side is devoted to a mini bar. However, there are two very large night stands with drawers.  There is a large closet, with a safe. The flat screen TV is mounted on the wall to the left of the bed. It swivels to provide a good view from the bed, or anywhere else in the room.

The A\/C is OK, but in hotter months if the curtains are opened and the sun is shining into the room it never gets cold - cool, but I like cold. I've noticed this money\/energy saving feature is becoming more common in hotels.

There's a desk, a round table, a sofa, and a large oval footstool (or something).  There are three phones, a FAX, and internet access. There's a fancy clock radio. If you have an iPod, a cable from the radio will plug into the iPod and play back your iPod's music.

The bed is wonderfully comfortable. It has more pillows than anyone needs, but the turndown service moves most of them off the bed and out of the way.

The bathroom is huge. It has a large shower, a very large tub, two sinks with a center area and chair, a small flat screen TV, and a scale. The toilet is in a separate room.

OK, on to the rest of the hotel.  For such a big place, its feels compact.  Walks are generally short, compared to other Las Vegas hotels.  Employees are friendly and enthusiastic.  Water features are visible from many spots: Okada, Daniel Boulud, SW Steakhouse, Sugar & Ice, Parasol Down, and probably other places as well.  None of the water features are terribly dramatic or awe inspiring (a la Bellagio), but they are restful and pleasing.  Stores are super expensive.  I'd never buy anything (except at the chocolate shop), but they're fun to look at.

I've fallen in love with the restaurants.  They're not perfect (for example, they need a good ptisserie like the one in Bellagio or Paris), but their overall level of quality is head and shoulders above any other hotel's offerings.  Also, with one exception, the restaurants are originals; the head chef spends his time at the restaurant.  

The pool is large, but not designed for playing; there are no water slides, lazy rivers, or the like.  The shape - long and thin - means that the pool area doesn't feel as crowded, as people are spread out.  In cooler weather, the water is heated to a comfortable temperature (unlike some other places, which advertise heated pools, but heat the water just enough to prevent it from turning solid).  There's an adults only\/topless pool as well.

Wynn is heavily into orchids.  They use different genera in different areas.  Hundreds of big blue hybrid Vanda blooms grace the elevator lobby.  Each restaurant seems to sport its own genus.  As an orchid nut, I enjoyed this nicety.

I had read that the elevators were hot.  I haven't noticed this, even though I like things chilly.  I had also read complaints about long waits for elevators.  I never experienced this either, although the elevators were sometimes pretty full.

Valet service looked like it could be a trouble spot, as it was pretty congested.  However, in practice it's turned out to be OK.  The line for taxis was a little worse.  Often there was almost no wait, but in the evening, I twice had to wait between 10 and 15 minutes.  This was at least in part due to the way the taxis had to wait in a single line, underground, until each was called in turn.

Your room key card is also your players card.  In some ways this is convenient; there's just one card for everything.  However, it's also worrisome.  I tend to forget my card in slot machines, and did this once in Wynn.  This means I also lost my room key.  The card doesn't have any room number on it, and doesn't have your last name, so it's not too serious, but it's still a pain.  When I went to the registration desk to report my loss, they guessed what had happened even before I spoke, as I was taking out my driver's license as identification.  I suspect this happens a lot.

Overall, my complaints are minor, my enjoyment level high.",0,0,1

Gambling:
Others have commented on the high minimum tables, and they're right -- the $25 minimums mostly turn into $50 by 9 or 10pm on a weekend, and are kind of like citronella for the hordes that swarm around cheap tables in otherwise nice hotels like the Venetian. On top of the thinner crowds, the dealers here are the best on the strip. I've gotten to know a few and highly recommend Joy at the $50 blackjack tables (usually on the noon-8 shift). She's a bundle of, well, joy, and energy and is always a delight to play with. She'll get the table talking and joking, and really makes it a nice experience regardless of whether you're winning or losing.

I've been playing more poker lately, and the poker room at the Wynn, while small, is comfortable and full of action. Not off the hook Commerce Casino action, but the $500 no limit frequently sees $1000 pots and there are always good players as well as rich tourists abounding. I'm an okay player, and I've discovered that the game for me is about whether I can gobble up the rich tourist dollars faster than the pros can take me down. I've had a couple of great nights as well as one god awful weekend here, but it's always been fun! 

Rooms:
The rooms are superb. I don't think the walls are any thinner than other high end hotels on the strip and have never overheard conversations, etc. I read a review talking about the noise from the club and am astonished -- I've stayed on low floors, high floors, and suites, and have NEVER noticed club noise or strip noise. It's a hotel, not a sanatorium, so there's some audible presence of others, but if that keeps you awake at night you've got issues. I've stayed during working trips also, and found the rooms to be really conducive to work: fast internet, speedy room service, and space to lay out books and papers while you work.

Food:
My favorite restaurant in Vegas is the Daniel Boulud brasserie at the Wynn. It's pricey, but the value you get makes it feel like a steal! Don't miss the charcuterie appetizer, and I highly recommend the steak dinner. The sommeliers are superb and have never tried to upsell me past my price-point -- in fact, I was once going to splurge and told him I was interested in a great wine and would spend $300-$400; he came back with a $250 recommendation! 

The other restaurants are all pretty stellar. Bartolotta is fantastic -- they fly in their fish from the Mediterranean daily and when you order a whole fish it's filleted for you tableside which is such fun to watch. Corsa is solid Italian food (they once made an off-menu pesto preparation for me, which is odd at high-traffic restaurants but spoke volumes about their customer service). The country club has what is possibly the best lobster preparation in the country (steamed and served with drawn tarragon butter that makes me drool to think about). Okada is a little oasis of sushi with fanciful preparations and the softest toro I've had since Hamano Sushi in San Francisco. SW has never once overcooked my steak and gets the exact temperature and color on a 3-inch thick filet which is not easy. My only hold out is Wing Lei. Maybe I've just never had the right thing, but most of the food there tastes like regular Chinese food, except much more expensive. 

Customer Service
I benefit from having a Casino Host (Pucci -- World's Best Host!) who arranges my stays. But the fact that I have a host at all once again speaks volumes about Customer Service at the Wynn, since I'm nowhere near a high roller. Sure, I'll play the $100 black jack tables, but as others have pointed out that's nothing at this place. On a weekend night, there are banks of tables that I can't even go near. Yet I've never once paid for a room and Pucci frequently finds a way to cover a good chunk of my (at time exorbitant) restaurant tabs.",3,0,0

But, since he spoils me rotten, I also have to return the favor every now and then. This time, I booked our stay at the Wynn. I made the reservation online. It was very easy and fast. 

The hotel is simply beautiful - both the interior and exterior. This is one of those hotels where the moment you walk in, you know you're in for a great experience. We also had a view of the golf course. The atmosphere of the room was so damn clean and comfortable, I didn't want to leave. And the bathroom? Yeah, if I were to design an ideal bathroom, I'd model it after the bathroom at the Wynn. =)

The minibar = way too easy access. I guess they know most guests would be easily tempted. I'm afraid to say that it didn't work on us. The bed? Comfy. For the price you pay here, I also think they should provide free wi-fi. The staff was helpful and friendly. Because this is such a popular hotel, expect a line for a taxi. 

In summary, this hotel screams luxury. While the hotel is pricier than most on the strip, it was worth every penny. Best hip, hotel in Vegas. There's just no comparison. Just look at the long lines to Tryst or the several hard-to-book restaurants, for proof.

Our room was sparse, no coffee maker, no mini fridge, not even extra blankets or pillows.  The view of the golf course and pool were great, however the nightlife noise went on way past 4am.  Vegas right, but really thin walls and thin glass make an evening sleep pretty much impossible.  I have included a picture of the pool before the party, and after, and the after party music was blaring.  So the food has to be good, right, wrong.  The restaurant was so dissppointing.  We had the lobster seafood, our dinner came cold, and the lobster had the toxic green excretions pouring out, and a foul odor.  It was not appetizing.  We brought it to the waiters attention, it was ignored, and then we were ignored.  Prices were high, food was inedible, drinks expensive for small pours of wine (I would stick with beer).

In three years and nine months(who's counting?) I will be departing the State of Nevada for good. And after I've sold my adobe and moved everything to my new home back East I'm going to spend a few nights at Wynn before heading to the airport for the last time. My sister and husband were just here and my parents like to room here when visiting(they usually split their stay between here and my place). The rooms are nice, the casino is not too big, and I've eaten at several of the restaurants here: Wing Lei, Allegro, SW Steakhouse, Red 8 and Terrace Pointe Cafe. Every once in a while I like going to The Country Club bar for drinks since the view of the water and golf course is so pleasant. Everything here is so nicely done. People say it looks a tad like Bellagio in certain respects and it does but that's no surprise since Steve Wynn developed both properties. I especially like how Wynn decorates at Christmas and walking through the atrium is always a comfort. Not many know this but there is a small area where people staying at the villas access the elevators. And in that area is a quiet, people-free system of fish ponds and shrubbery. No music or ringing of slot machines, no high priced hookers or visiting douche bags, just peace and solitude--my two favorite things in life. On my final night I'm going to stroll down the row of shops and buy myself a retirement present at the Rolex store. A Sea Dweller. Then I'm going to eat dinner at one of the upper crust eateries, have some ice-cream at Drugstore Cafe and an after dinner drink by the golf course. The following morning I will rise and have coffee, look at the time on my new watch and catch a cab to McCarran. Upon which I will board a flight heading East without so much as a good-bye because, my friends, the nightmare has finally ended....",3,2,2

Stayed here on a recent vacation to relax before the holiday craziness. The rooms are large with huge bathrooms and tubs. We had a room overlooking the strip and the view through the floor to ceiling windows that is unveiled by automatic drapes was my favorite part. 

We had a great time but our stay was plagued by two problems. The first was the smokiness of the casino level that was also apparent upstairs. While you could write me off as a prick who complains about smoke in a casino...I'll just say that I've been in lots of other casinos and the smoke is not nearly as apparent.

The real concern though was that at 3 am of our first night there somebody opened our door with a key card. The latch was on and stopped her from entering so she closed the door and tried again. Again she was stopped and by that time I was at the door to confront her. I was tense thinking I was going to have to fight off a middle of the night intruder but we were able to talk briefly.

It seems that she was also checked into our room by the front desk. She left quickly and I called the front desk immediately. They said they would send up new room keys right away and that a hotel manager would follow up with me. I got the new keys but no follow up. I called down again at about 3:30 am and got an apology but still no follow up from a manager. We stopped by the check in to speak to a manager the next morning but the lines were long and we decided to just move on. We had limited vacation time and didn't want to spend it waiting to talk to a manager who had not gotten back to us.

I have not worked in the hotel industry but would assume this was a serious gaffe. I have travelled extensively and have stayed in everything from Motel 6s to more posh accommodations and everything in between. I have never experienced a room intrusion and was seriously put off. Somebody entering the room of another who was already checked in is setting up both sides for potential disaster and I could imagine this going south pretty quickly.

The hotel is a luxury 5 star indeed. Staff was all super friendly and not pretentious.

Filled with high end boutiques like Dior, Chanel, Alexander McQueen, Rolex, Louis Vuitton, Even a Ferrari dealership!

Everything is bright and cheery, the attention to detail amazing, all the way to the stained glass butterfly mosaic tiles on the floor.

The girl who checked us in was nice & friendly. She gave us a room on the 39th floor since we were staying a week. We had to give a 200$ deposit on the credit card. This later was a 900$ deposit - we never quite understood why. Something to do with the Internet which made no sense.

Our room was a deluxe resort double. Floor to ceiling windows overlooked the spectacular golf course and pools.

The bathroom was huge ! 2 sinks 2 mirrors, a large vanity and shelves under each sink left lots of room for our toiletries & products. Huge soaker tub and separate shower with room to sit down in it.

The room itself was bigger then my entire apartment ! 2 super comfy beds with lots of pillows and sheets with a very large thread count.

Everything is on a control that sits on the bedside table. Buttons to open and close the heavy curtains that blocks out all light, as well as the shears.

It also controls the lighting, which has buttons for all off, all on, night lights, etc.

The air conditioning was also nice in that you could set it to the exact temperature you desired.

There was a large desk, with fax machine, and a few chairs.

The mini bar and snack bar was fully stocked, but came with a warning that 60 seconds of anything being removed would be charged to the room.

There was no coffee maker or fridge, but you can get one @25$ a day.
A resort fee of 25$ a day was also in effect. This coverage WiFi for all devices, local and toll free calls.

The bellman delivered our bags very quickly and even got us ice,
Housekeeping was immaculate, and would service the room whenever they were called.

Lots of towels, nice robes, and the toiletries provided were generous, however I didn't like the lemon grass scent.

We never ordered room service. The menu was vast, and looked really good, with lots of variety and options, but the prices were so high, unless you had an expense account be prepared to pay through the nose.

The rack rate listed for our room was $1500 a night. That's pretty crazy,

The casino was OK, played a bit of slots, won a few bucks. Was never offered a drink. The Encore casino was better by far.

They have a 24 hour cafe and drugstore. Both were pricey.

The pool was huge, and had lots of chairs, downside was it was only open until 6 week nights. Open until 7 on weekends. I was really hoping it would of been open until 11pm, but no such luck. The surrounding cabanas looked nice but pricey.

Be prepared to show your room key in order to get access to the elevator or the pool area. They are quite strict about this.

We slept so good, between the comfy beds, and the blackout drapes, we never woke up until 7 pm the day after we arrived!

The lock on the door however was defective, we were locked once when we tried to leave. They had to send up security to let us out. Thankfully, they were prompt. We were told that they had called a locksmith, and that the security guard would stand by until they arrived.

We left, but the lock was still glitchy. We had to slam it more then once in order for it to lock.

I had a small package sent to the hotel. It went to the business center. It was a $8 handling charge. While I waited, they let me use the Internet on a private computer, and gave me a bottle of water. They were super nice.

Another complaint was on our last night there, at 5am we were unable to sleep due to the people next door. They were super loud. We waited Until 530 am. Between the music and the loud voices, we had no choice other then to call the front desk. We were told they would send up security.

Over 20 Min's past, I called again, they said security was en route. The noise level subsided a bit for maybe 5 Min's, then it was right back. We were getting pissed at this point.
It was after 6am!

We had to get up at 10am to pack, check out, and fly home. I called ( this now was the third time! ) They asked if we wanted to change rooms! As if we would pack and change rooms at this hour, only to check out? If anything, the other people should be made to change rooms - or check out.

They asked if we wanted security back up? Duh! Yes of course.

At this point I was exhausted. I finally fell asleep. Lucky we got a late check out. we asked for a bellman to assist with our bags. 20 Min's later, he still had not arrived. We had a shuttle booked for 1-115pm so we called to cancel the bellman as at this point, it was almost 1 pm. We were able to check out via the phone with a receipt emailed to my GF.",2,1,1

As well the bathroom is ginormous, you could fit an entire family of orphans in here and have room to spare for Miss Hannigan. The shower is awesome - great pressure, never run out of hot water and the glass enclosure keeps the heat in.

I've stayed here a few times when visiting Vegas for conferences, and I'm not a gambler, so I can't comment on the casino itself - just the hotel and the pretty nice mall that I walked through 2-3 times\/day. You could do a lot worse on the strip, and pay a lot more for it.

I recommend getting a Tower suite or room at Wynn or Encore and entering through the more exclusive and personalized entrances and check-ins. The Salon Suites are very spacious, over 2,000 square feet. Tip: If you are booking this suite type and need to turn in before midnight, book it on the Wynn side instead of the Encore side as all the Salon suites at Encore face Surrender nightclub, which can get very energetic around 1-2am - (or join the fun and splurge on a cabana at Surrender!)

Built by the great Steve (Weinberg) Wynn himself, boasted to be the best and most luxurious hotel ever conceived in Vegas, the Wynn was a bit of a bust. 

I say this with a bit of great disappointment. After all, who would have ever expected this from the man who built the likes of the great Mirage, and the now forever famous mega-resort: The Bellagio? 

And, what is ""this"" I speak of? 

Well dears, it is being bamboozled and thrown around like minor class citizens.  Here is the story and the lowdown on what happened in this incident: 

Time: Two weeks before Valentine's Day\/President's Day Weekend
Place: Wynn Hotel, Las Vegas, NV

As any Yelper in an economic downturn would do, I hopped online to find the best bang for my buck in Vegas. I booked via Hotwire and found a great deal for a five star resort which turned out to be the Wynn - SWEET! -- or so I thought! Two weeks before one of the busiest weekends in Vegas, we received confirmation that the Wynn had been OVERBOOKED, and we were AUTOMATICALLY transferred from the Wynn to the TRUMP HOTEL. 

EW. 

Now, you ask, what's so wrong with the TRUMP HOTEL? Well, exactly that. We had been ""trumped"". Not only did the Trump Hotel NOT have a CASINO (I know, reallly!?), it was OFF STRIP and far as HELL if one were to walk to the strip. We begrudgingly accepted due to the fact it was only about two weeks before the trip and we didn't want to risk not having a place to stay. 

One week before the trip, we received word from the Wynn inviting us back. As it were, the ONLY reason we even got ""invited"" back was because a huge Wells Fargo party for that weekend had gotten CANCELLED. 

This leads me to believe one, and only one thing, which was the Wynn had sold its open rooms to Hotwire and got them filled.  They then received word from Wells Fargo for that huge executives party, and kicked out the Hotwire-ers, and then when the party got cancelled, asked us to go back. BAIT AND SWITCH, BAMBOOZLED. 

I will tell you loud and clear, I went to the Wynn, but not before I made them pay with comp'ed nights and lunches, but spent my entertainment dollars elsewhere.

Not only that, upon arrival, it took them 1.5 hours to check us in. ONE POINT FIVE HOURS. That is just ridiculous and stupid. In addition, the POOL was NOT OPEN, and if we wanted to use the pool we had to WALK to Encore. Steve Wynn: if you can't afford to staff your hotel, then do us all a favor and FOLD your operations while you can save yourself some face. 

To be fair, the views were great. The rooms were clean and spacious, and housekeeping was very nice.In general the grounds were kept well, but really not what i expected from a boasted FIVE STAR hotel. I kept thinking to myself I should have gone to the Bellagio. 

Overall, I think this hotel is OVERHYPED. Sure, its nice, and elegant, but it just is not all that great. The service was friendly, but I really don't like the way the hotel is run to seemingly treat normal people as space fillers. All in all, it was a good experience at the end, but what happened in the beginning will probably never let me stay at the Wynn again. 

Unfortunate.",10,4,3

Although I'm happy that I had the opportunity to stay at this highly rated hotel, I will never stay there ever again, nor recommend it to my friends, unless they'd like to golf at their $500\/day course.  

I would give the check-in service and spa treatments, amenities and employees 5 stars. The room view was excellent.  Other than that, I would not stay at this hotel again because the service was so substandard, in comparison to the Venetian and Bellagio.

We dined at three of the restaurants and service was substandard--took the waiters more than 10 minutes to even greet us and it took more than 1\/2 hour to get our meals, plus no apologies for the delays.  The buffet was excellent, but service was slow with refills on water and sodas.

Our room walls were quite thin, and we could hear the voices of the people next door. Also, in the bathroom, you could clearly hear the guest next door on the phone (kinda scary trying to figure out where the voice was coming from).  We could hear other hotel room doors open and close, so it was hard to tell whether someone was entering our room.   

The bathroom wasn't well stocked with paper products--we actually ran out of toilet tissue and kleenex the first day, and this has never happened at any hotel I've ever stayed at before--even 3 star hotels.  There was no ventilation fan in the bathroom either. Also, there was a green cleaning glove left behind on the bathroom counter (GROSS) our second day.

On our third day, I had a pillowcase that had dried blood marks on it (REALLY GROSS)  which really made me want to check out and check into the Venetian.

To top it off, we had family staying on the strip who had planned to have dinner with us.  They have three children, two asleep in strollers, utitilized valet, entered the hotel and were met by security, who denied them entry into the hotel because they were not registered hotel guests and were told that ONLY registered hotel guests were allowed strollers in the hotel.  Security didn't seem to care that the children were asleep, valet had just parked their car, and they were joining us for dinner.  They said that this was simply hotel policy. This I felt to be absolutely ludicrous, if not discriminatory.

So those of you with children in strollers who plan to shop, dine or peruse the Wynn and are NOT registered guests, security will ""greet"" you, then will not allow you entry.

We requested a rollaway, but the charge was $50 extra per day.  I've stayed at the Bellagio, Venetian, MGM and have never been charged extra for a rollaway.  I hadn't expected this, especially when I was already paying quite a bit for the room and the beds were only double beds, not queen.

Elevators were really slow, and I heard others commenting that most of the time, only half of the elevators were working.

I had really high expectations of this hotel because of all the hype and the 5 diamond status.  I was so very disappointed.  I can't wait to book at the Bellagio or Venetian again, where I've never been disappointed and would rate them over and above the Wynn any day.  

I'll be definitely writing to management about this experience.",2,0,0

When I went, I stayed at a fairway villa at the country club in the two story wings that extend out from the tower. These rooms are amazing. At approximately 3000 sq ft, plus an additional 2000 sq ft of deck space, these are truly the most magical rooms I have seen in Vegas. Usually they go for 10,000+, but sometimes you can get a good deal!

You're paying a pretty penny to stay here so you should expect nothing but the absolute best and priciest amenities. I apologize for sounding uppity, but it's really common sense. 

Yes, Wynn & Encore are at the end of the strip. However, I find this part of the strip to be clean, well kept and easy to walk around in without the ""porn guys"" snapping cards at you. The Fashion Show Mall is across the street with TI\/Mirage diagonal and The Palazzo and Venetian across the side street. Everything is within walking distance so you never feel like you're missing out on whatever goes on mid-strip (Hint: drunk people hanging out at Carnival Court or Fat Tuesdays).

My husband and I have stayed at either Wynn or Encore a total of 10 times in 4 years. Every trip has been an amazing experience. Many people say that a hotel is just for resting your head after a long day, and while that's true, the Wynn\/Encore properties make it an unforgettable experience.

The night I arrive, I get to Encore to check in and was told they were overbooked due to the Garth Brooks concert HOWEVER they were putting me in a tower suite in the Wynn instead. I had my little Beyonce moment ""talk about LEMME UPGRADE YOU"" This was perfect as my friends were all in the tower suites at the Wynn anyhow. Concierge guy at the Encore was so nice, he kept trying to find a suite on the same floor or at least same tower. He went on and on going over all the amenities, where to eat, private VIP pools, etc. 
Seriously, what great service. Housekeeping.... amazing. After 5 1\/2 hours at my pool (with my friends chatting it up with a famous soccer player) I practically crawled back into my room thinking ""IS THIS THE RIGHT ROOM!?"" Housekeeping had turned the flatscreen out from the wall, left it on a screensaver with classical music, turn down service with robes, slippers, mints, and they even went as far as organizing my chaotically strewn makeup in the bathroom! YES THEY ORGANIZED MY MAKEUP FOR ME. They even so lovingly placed all my makeup brushes into a glass for me. Who does that!? 

Wynn does it all. 

I can't stay anywhere else.

Garth Brooks - you can have a concert whenever Miss Susy C is in the house okay? I don't care.

P.S. Added bonuses for being in the tower suites: our own separate valet entrance\/exit. SO HANDY. No waiting in crazy lines full of drunk people for a cab. Plus, the area where you exit ..

I had to assure myself that my first Vegas experience would be one to remember...Especially since it was my Birthday weekend with the girls! This hotel had a major part in that. 
   The service was the best! The restaurants were delicious. The pool was unlike any other I've layed by. There were different sections. A calm and relaxing one and the other has a bar w\/ a mini casino surrounding it and a dome with a DJ! The rooms were also nice. I especially liked the flat screen in the bathroom and the buttons by the bed to open and close the blinds. The casino was good and the dealers made sure to keep things lively and rolling! (Unfortunately I lost but my friend had some luck!) It tended to be a bit chilly... but what casino isn't kept under 60? lol.
   Things inside can tend to be pricey. But, that's what you get for staying at the best hotel in Vegas. The age group tends to be a little older, probably because of the higher prices. Some young groups. Many international visitors. The boutique stores downstairs were only the best! Chanel, Dior, Manolo Blahnik, etc.(Not to mention the Ferrari\/Maserati dealership attached to the hotel) The only thing that truly made me frustrated was the line to get a taxi.

Dinner consisted of a prime table in front of the water fall at Daniel Boulud Brasserie.  Very accommodating staff -- very sweet and flirtatious.  It was cute.  Food was phenomenal, especially the chick pea fries!  As we ate into the hours of the night, we had primo seat for the water show with the giant buddha head and flower parachutes.

Because the mandatory Wynn ""Resort Fee"" of $20\/ nt which covers internet & fitness club access) is waived in the Tower Suites area of hotel, the net out of pocket was only $5\/nt so I happily agreed, especially as my King Tower Suite was available immediately when I was checking in at around noon. 

The other big advantages of the Tower Suites side of hotel is how quiet and secure it is in the VIP area including a private entrance for check in\/out and quick taxi service plus a dedicated restaurant called Tableau with excellent mid-priced food and warm, personal service for Tower guests.

The suite itself was spacious and well laid out with a sitting area, a swivel flat screen which could be easily viewed from bed or living room area. The bed and pillows were fantastic and the lemongrass bath amenities were generously sized and of a high quality. Wi-fi was fast and reliable. :) 

Oh- one last note: I forgot a small item in the room and called from the airport to ask if they could look for it and not only did the hotel staff react immediately and call me back within about 30 min to tell me that they had found it, they UPS overnighted it to my home address at no charge!

During that trip, my friends and I decided to go to XS, a club in the casino.  While waiting in line, some drunken idiot behind me started a fight with me.  After fists (and a headbutt) were thrown, security moved in promptly and hauled us to their offices.  According to the supervisor, after speaking with everyone involved, he'd made a decision permanently to ban both individuals in the fight from the Wynn and Encore.

This seemed strange, since I'm sure a review of the security tape would corroborate my story that I didn't even speak to the drunk guy before he started behaving like a moron.  Clearly he was just some loser who'd decided he was going to start some sh!t with the nearest person, who happened to be me.  However, I wasn't about to grovel since  there were plenty of casinos in Vegas happy to take my money.

I was escorted out by a few of the security guards who'd helped to clean up the mess, and one of them told me that he'd have done the same thing I did.  He also suggested I should call back and try to explain the situation to a different supervisor to be allowed back in.  While I appreciated the thought, I'd already concluded that since the Wynn had no interest in keeping me as a customer, I had no interest in going back there either.

We stayed at Wynn for the second time from 6\/25-6\/30 (Fri-Wed).  Had a room on the 31st floor overlooking the golf course on the backside of the hotel.  The only real annoying thing about this was that the club at Encore, XS, jammed their club techno music at full blast until around 4 AM.  It wasn't too loud or kept you up, just a minor annoyance.  I never heard Tryst during our stay in our strip side room.  I would also like to point out that our room cleaning was great this time, which made me recall that it wasn't that great last time.  Our room was promptly cleaned when we left every morning and was done quickly.  This was not the cast during our 2009 visit.  The hotel was much busier this time than it was during our March visit.  

We again had a great time and didn't got fancy with dining this stay.  The old Sugar and Ice is now a pizza place and is quite tasty and Encore's Society Cafe is very good.  

And for all of the stroller complaints on this site, I am glad that Wynn does not allow strollers.  Leave your kids at home.  This is Vegas.  There were kids everywhere in Vegas this trip.  Vegas is no place for kids.  Leave them at home - I did.  I don't want to deal with your kids and your strollers on my vacation.  So, Wynn is not a place for kids.

While the rooms were nice, at The Wynn, the service was horrible.

Reserved a seat at the sports book and it took over 90 minutes to get a drink. The cost is $50 ( per session) and we were lucky to get  the waitress to come by twice.

Same thing for the casino floor.

Gambled for 3 days ($3000) and at the tables or machines, you will be lucky to see a server.

At one point I asked for a water and the server asked me  where I was playing ... umm here, at your casino for the last 3 days.

Final insult was at SW steakhouse ( 5 star restaurant) where we witnessed a women (sitting alone) FLOSSING HER TEETH at the table!!

But wait, that was not dental floss.

SHE WAS USING HER HAIR TO FLOSS HER TEETH !!

Multiple customers complained but the management did nothing to remedy the situation.

We mentioned this to our waiter who replied "" she had a 5 course meal with drinks and is probably intoxicated""

So I guess our 3 course meal with a bottle of wine for $560 was insufficient for the staff to provide us with a dining experience that was not , frankly, nauseating.

I was invited for a 3 night stay at the Wynn & given $100 slot credit.  I'd refused these offers before but I had to take a trip in anyway so I decided to try it.  Here's what I found:

1) ROOMS
The beds & sofas are comfortable.  The rooms have shades\/blinds that have motorized controllers that open & close them automatically.  There is also a hideaway plasma in the bedroom as well as a small flat panel in the bathroom.  The room does seem a little small but I'm spoiled by the S&s properties.  Additionally, most rooms are relatively close to the elevators unlike most hotel & casinos.
...I had a couple issues though as a business traveler:  Very few electrical outlets near the desk.  Also Internet access - wired or wireless - at the Wynn sucked more than a 2-bit whore.  Wynn's engineering folks know it & say it's systemic.  The inkjet printer in the room is usable as a fax but there's no USB cable to hook it up to your PC in case you want to print directions\/show tickets.  @#$%.

2) COMP PROGRAM (a.k.a. ""Red Card"")
The Red Card is your comp card - it is also your room key if you're staying at the Wynn.  150 points on your Red Card gives you 2 free Buffet passes at Wynn.  This is the equivalent of playing about $450 through a slot machine, or 150 plays of 3x Maxbet $1 slots.  After that a free buffet is available after 500 points which is easy to attain. 
...One issue however is that invitation-linked promo credit is not usable as match play on tables.  It must to be cycled through slots or video poker which is lousy.

3) CASINO
--- SLOTS:  $1 slots\/Top Dollar & Pinball.  Boy, their machines are loose.  We played for 1hr+ on a single Benjamin each.  She came out ahead by $80, I myself was up $125.
 --- BLACKJACK:  The tables have RFID in them & the corners of the tables are often uncomfortably hot because of the RFID sensor's heat.  Rules wise, it's mostly $25, 6 deck, 3-2, early surrender, double down on any 2 cards, split up to 4 times.  The penetration is 70% which is meager but tipping can help.  They do have double deck w\/ minimums of $100 during the day, $200 during the evenings.
--- DEALERS:  The dealers here have a personality & they seem to actually avoid the ""robotic stare"" that so many other casinos have.  Note to dealers:  I toke dealers I like that enhance my gambling experience not those that sneer.  Yes, I'm talking to you MGM Grand.

4) RESTAURANTS
All of Wynn's restaurants are excellent & separated from the chaos of the casino.  We've been Country Club, Okada, Alex, Terrace Pointe, & of course the Buffet.  We had a really nice candle lit meal at Country Club with a view of the golf course & the view was so pleasant that my wife said, you really could forget that you were in the middle of Sin City.  

5) ADULTS ONLY
The hotel is entirely 21 & over.  Kids must be escorted.  Yay.

6) SUNSET POOL
During the weekdays, Sunset Pool at Wynn is an Adults-only, European Bathing area segregated from the rest of the chaos of Wynn's pools.  If you want a ""no kids"" zone, where you can sip cocktails in the pool, then this is a peaceful, enjoyably mature place to bake & mingle.  It's like a cocktail party where couples can get back to concentrating on each other - all without the chaos of other pools like the Venetian or the sheer boredom of the Palazzo pools.
...this is definitely my favorite pool to be at as a married man & one the primary 6 reasons I will return.

ISSUES:  ""REGISTRATION""
This is the worst aspect about Wynn - their general registration is crowded & disorganized.  Registration at the main entrance is fueled by tips.  Getting to the registration desk quickly may require a $10 tip.  Getting a high rise room near the elevators may require a $20 tip.

CONCLUSION
Great hotel.  There're some room for improvement but it's definitely top shelf.

5-stars.

""ADD AS AN ENEMY""
After seeing a couple of really colossally thoughtless reviews of Vegas hotels, I started to wish there was a feature in Yelp that allowed you to not just ""Add as a Friend"" but also, ""Add as an ENEMY"".  It would hide all comments & reviews by that person tacitly saying, ""You sir\/madam represent the opposite of my tastes on Yelp.  I drink your milkshake.""

Here's a list of people that I'd add auto-tag as ""Enemies"":
- People that give 'Treasure Island' 5-stars
- People that gave 'Wynn' 1-star
- The 2 dudes that gave 'Hot & Juicy Crawfish' less than 4 stars.  
...seriously, what are you people thinking?",14,11,9

The last time I was in Vegas was several years ago when they were BUILDING the Wynn, so it I suppose it's only fitting that my first visit after a 4+ year hiatus be at the hotel that wasn't even open when I was here last.  It's almost as if they had built the hotel for me and my first visit was long overdue.  But that's just wishful thinking.

The Wynn being one of Vegas' more recent hotels, there are a few aspects of the hotel that follow an architectural pattern with some of the other newer hotels.  Take the parking garage for example.  Instead of parking garages where you go round and round as you ascend multiple levels of parking, the ramp to climb each level is on the exterior of the structure so the interior resembles more that of a supermarket parking lot.  Why I'm spending so much time talking about the parking structure I have no idea.

Walking into the casino.... Oh look, slot machines!  Poker tables!  Scantily clad cocktail waitresses!  All these (and more) you will find in just about any casino, old or new, in Las Vegas.  *sigh* What a life....

My friend was able to score an upgrade up to the 52nd floor.  Yes, you heard me... FIFTY TWO.  All 3 of our rooms had great views.  The room I was in specifically had a view of the strip, and while the other 2 rooms were on the other side of the hotel, their room were overlooking a golf course.  The rooms were standard: bed, sofa and ottoman, wall-mounted flat screen TV, desk with a video phone and fax machine, and books and booklets detailing the room and resort amenities.  The bathroom had separate shower and bathtub, dual sinks with a vanity in between, a small wall TV, and a segregated toilet with a phone.  Hey, it solves the problem of answering the phone call while you're seated on the throne.  I'm just saying.

I don't have to tell you that the hotel overall is just gorgeous.  The theme of the brown and gold exterior of the hotel seamlessly transports itself to the color scheme inside.  The layout of the casino and surrounding areas is not complicated to navigate and makes everything seem easily accessible.  All of the dealers I dealt with were nice, patient and courteous, except for maybe the late late hours when they're not as talkative and would probably prefer being in bed instead of handing out winnings at the craps tables.  Yes, I found my new poison of choice at the casino: craps.  I never understood the game up until this trip when a couple of my friends explained a few basics and I experienced some beginner's luck.  One session I had started with $30 and within an hour, I had quadrupled my money.

We did have a chance to experience any of the fine restaurants here at the Wynn, which include Mario Batali's Bartolotta or Daniel Boulud Brasserie.  We did however eat at their buffet for brunch for one of our meals (review to come).

Would I stay here again?  Well, not unless I scored some sort of deal or promo (which my friend did) or we were in a larger group, like we were, bringing down the room cost for everybody.",16,13,15

Anyone who opts to stay there is gonna end up dropping some serious loot if they choose to dine at any of the restaurants. I did eat at their buffet and unforetunately was a little disappointed. I was honestly expecting more, and the crab legs, which are a must for me, were actually lacking flavor and weren't as big as I expected. I'm not cheap by any means, but their buffet is among the most expensive in town at 42 bucks and simply not worth it. Even the desserts were nothing to write home about.

I've stayed at several hotels in Vegas, but Wynn is definitely one of the best.  Along with my experiences at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay and Bellagio, this one was upscale and amazing.  The décor is very unique - it's modern with a whimsical twist.  There's a lot of color and you can see interesting pieces (chandeliers, chairs, artwork) all over the hotel.  Even though there is a whimsical theme in the hotel, the décor does change for the different sections you may be in.  The rooms were really big - a lot bigger than what I was expecting.  The bathrooms were enormous as well with his\/her sinks, a private toilet, a shower and tub.  

The best part of my experience was the pool area.  There are two sections: main and adult.  The main pool area was filled with different people, including families, but everyone was well-behaved and kids were not screaming...it was great to be in a main pool area that wasn't completely hectic.  The adult area was great - you can drink in and by the pool...everyone looked great - lots of 9s and 10s.  Even though the adult pool was filled with people, everyone was still friendly and courteous.  The drinks were a bit disappointing since they were all watered down, but considering how great everything else was, I barely remember it.

Wynn is an excellent choice if you're looking for the upscale experience in Las Vegas.  Rooms are a bit pricier than other hotels, but you get what you pay for.  When most of the other hotels can attract some really trashy and rude people, this one offers something special to its guests and those guests stay here - it's well worth it.  Its location towards the end of the strip is also great if you're not really into the hectic and messy Las Vegas Blvd.  Wynn really does make for a great experience in Las Vegas.",3,2,2

Might seem like a strange thing to say given the rating I've given the Wynn, but ""I hate the carpet"" is always the first thing that pops into my mind when I think of the Wynn.  Sometimes I wonder if the carpet is the output of some terribly complicated algorithm developed by computational neuroscientists to keep gamblers from getting too relaxed.  Keep you awake, keep you gambling.

Obviously, I kid, but the carpet is the closest thing to a complaint I could come up with for the Wynn.  I've stayed there as well as just visited to gamble or see a show and the experience is always about the best I find in Vegas.  I highly recommend the panorama view rooms for a view that will always get your heart pumping and ready for a night on the town.

There are little touches everywhere, views that make you wonder aloud if they laid out the entire floor plan just to accommodate what you're seeing, little ergonomic touches that make the stay just a little bit more comfortable, and visual touches that let you know a lot of thought, sweat, and concern went into putting the place together.

Some of the things I like about this hotel in particular: the subtle yet modern decor, the lack of children and the lack of drunk college students.  The hotel has a small shopping mall that's connected with the Encore, and you'll find some of the big names there such as Hermes, Chanel and LV.  In terms of restaurants, most of the places in the hotel are on the more expensive side, and they have one or two different restaurants that have Michelin stars.  Even in the casual eateries such as the pizza place and the deli, expect to spend at least $40 for 2.   I will say that the Wynn's buffet is great and worth it.  Last year we had dinner at Daniel Boulud Brasserie (now closed) , and it was pretty good but not life-changing.  

We've also had the opportunity to stay at many of the hotel's different rooms - the standard, Tower Suites and the ridiculously fancy Parlor Suite.  All of the room types are tastefully appointed with ultra-comfy beds.  

Also, as a Red Card member, I've gotten tons of promotions and deals because we choose to play at the Wynn.  The promos they offer are excellent and have included drastically discounted room rates, free slot play, free La Reve tickets and even comped stays in their swankier suites.  

Overall, I'm a fan of the Wynn and it's where I choose to stay when I'm in Vegas!",2,0,0

I love their rooms even more. Our suite had floor to ceiling windows with a view. More importantly, we had a switch that allowed us to operate our heavy curtains keeping out all natural light until we were ready  Our beds were so........ plush and comfy. We had an i pod docking station allowing us to rock out while we were getting ready. We watched t.v. on our flat screen in the mornings while we were in bed trying to regain our senses. Our desk was nice and big located right by the window. Sitting in the chair we enjoyed our view, amazing both night and day. We set up our bar on top of their dresser and what a bar that was (homemade flavored vodkas, bloody marys, almond champagne for mimosas, tequila, and etc). We also had a good sized closet with a full length mirror. 
Their bathroom is huge compared to other hotels. They have a separate toilet room which was convenient. Their shower is spacious and their showerhead is large shooting out perfect water pressure. Their toiletries smelled like lemongrass, very refreshing. Their bathroom had a large vanity with big mirrors and a chair. 
Their room service was expensive but convenient and delicious. We ordered twice and the food was consistently good. Their tomato bisque was super hot and creamy. We ordered a couple of dishes for dinner so we could eat while we were getting ready. When we got back we ordered  chicken lo mein and spaghetti with meatballs. We were in heaven. We stuffed our faces with both dishes and vowed only to order room service at the Wynn instead of going to that awful late night cafe.",0,0,1

I cannot stress enough that this is one of the best casinos that Vegas has to offer due to its high quality service, breath taking architecture, and its ability to make you feel like a billionaire. 
As I approached the front desk, I was warmly greeted and treated like first-class royalty. It must have been my lucky day, because they upgraded my ""mediocre"" room to a tower suite of no charge! This means that I was sectioned off to an exclusive part of the tower, because I had admittance to a private pool.
The key to my room had my name printed on it, which made me feel special. As you enter into the suite, you are just appalled at how beautiful it is! The bathroom had a tv in it, they had robes\/slippers, flat screen HD tv, the curtain opened and closed electronically. It didn't look like a hotel room, yet a condo or place where you could live. I had a view facing the pool and it was breathtakingly beautiful. The pool was reminiscent to the one at Hearst Castle...it was that amazing!

Two of the things I love about the Wynn: the pool\/resort area (those pools are beautiful); and the mojitos with a sugar cane stick!

From the start I was surprised that the hotel doesn't have a 24 hour restaurant. The dinky little café where you have to order your food cafeteria style, in a line is neither classy nor chic. At least the Encore has a very nice restaurant called Jardin, but no one seems to know about it. Regardless, my main problem was with my room. There seems to be no sound insulations between rooms!!!! I'm close to 50 and I don't have super hearing but I could clearly hear my neighbors watching TV, having fun or even vomiting at 3:30am next door.  Not just faintly but like I was right next to them. Also the room doors don't have a damper so when your neighbors come or leave and just let the door close by it's mechanical spring it shuts with a bang. This is a casino hotel, people very often come home after 2am so sleep is far from being undisturbed. This is even worse when you try to have an afternoon nap and the room next door needs some extra care by maintenance. The first thing they do is turn out the safety latch so the door can not be shot and each time they use the door it just bounces on that latch 2 or 3 time so vehemently it shakes the walls and even your desk. On one of these occasions that went on over an hour I got so annoyed I talked to the guys who were working on the room next door, then called housekeeping and finally went over and put my own pillow into the door because my requests fell on deaf ears. Unfortunately my inconveniences didn't stop there. Housekeeping standards are far below to any Steve Wynn property. First, whoever comes to make up your room rings the bell twice in rapid succession which is already way too loud so it can give you a heart attach but they don't even give you time to reach the door and just come into your room. Once a lady just walked in without nocking and when I freaked out she said I had the sign out indicating that I requested housekeeping so she didn't expect me to be in the room. When I complained about it to housekeeping, next day she told me that I jeopardized her job. Yes, she confronted me. Obviously she wasn't trained on hospitality. I wouldn't fire her, she could be a nice person she just needed training but I would definitely let the person go who didn't train her! Anyhow, the worst was the lack of demand towards cleanness. In Bellagio I remember talking to a housekeeper who told me how they were expected to go on their knees to inspect the tiles and use a toothbrush to clean the grout if necessary. Apparently it's no longer in fashion in this hotel. I accidentally stepped on the body lotion at one night going to the toilet without the lights on. It exploded spurting it's content under the sink. I only saw this next morning when most of it already dried. I had the room for over two weeks and in the second week taking a bath I noticed spots on the floor under the sink. I was horrid to realize that it was still the dried lotion from over a week ago. Smudged but still there. I didn't call housekeeping -sorry, it's not my job to be vigilant - but checked every day and it was there till the day I checked out. There was only one thing that was as expected and that was rooms service. Those people nock and don't use the bell. (BTW bell is an immensely nice word for this hotel's labor inducing device) Every serviceman and woman in that department was kind, professional and eager to please.

The comps were a nice surprise for my bday! The view is amazing (we got the strip view) and the floor to ceiling\/wall to wall windows really take advantage of that. Bed, bath, amenities all luxurious. But one piece of advice, take advantage of the view. We slept with the windows open at night (early morning to be exact) to really take everything in. 

The service, housekeeping turnover, and atmosphere were A+. Definitely stay here if you can (I know I wouldn't be able to without those comps)! And charge everything to the room in order to, you guessed it, earn more comps! And and AND use your key card (if you have a red card account with them, its the same) when gambling (slots, BJ, poker) to earn points and potential comps :) Cheers to all you LV lovers!",3,3,2

I have stayed here 3 separate times-- twice in the standard resort tower room, and once in the exclusive Tower Suites. If I could, I would stay here every single day of my life....okay, maybe not every day, but you get the point. The Wynn does absolutely EVERYTHING right. I also enjoy the Encore (you can see that review here: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/encore-las-vegas-las-vegas#hrid:CsuvbYFaiobwF0_gWgvd-g ). 

The rooms are exceedingly spacious and even more comfortable. I truly get the feeling of ""home"" when I set foot in these rooms. Plush beds, large bathroom, a great view no matter where you are-- it's tough to beat this hotel room. And, there is something that is often taken for granted: peace and quiet. The clientele at the Wynn seems to typically be higher class and respectful, compared to a lot of the hotels on the southern end of the Strip. I never hear any screaming, bratty children (AKA my biggest pet peeve in Vegas when parents bring their babies and\/or toddlers...so unnerving and disgustingly irritating. Okay, now I'm starting to sound a bit pretentious. I'll back off). The walls are extremely soundproof so that your neighbor and their...ahem, activities, are usually masked over. 


Getting past the room, every little ornate detail inside the main part of the hotel is so wonderfully executed. Beautiful plants and flowers throughout, a perfect mixture of lighting, and perhaps my favorite: some of the most genuinely happy employees and service men and women I have ever had the pleasure of encountering. They will go out of their way make sure that everything is going well for their guests. Speaking of service, the Wynn knocks it out of the park. That's all I have to say. They set the bar for service within gaming properties on the Strip. 

Moving on... I am a HUGE fan of this casino. There are fantastic dealers and pit bosses along with a wide array of machines to suit any gambler's fancy. 
TIP: Table minimums seem to be routinely lower over at Encore, but you can usually spot a table to fit your needs. 
Also... please notice their ventilation. I know this sounds silly...but next time you go, just notice how smoke-free and fresh their casino is; I haven't once left with my clothes reeking of an 80-year old chain smoker like I do when I leave other casinos. No other gaming property in Las Vegas has perfected this...just the Wynn & Encore. 

The restaurants here are also not to be missed, particularly SW Steakhouse & Stratta (but especially SW. Read that review here: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/sw-steakhouse-las-vegas#hrid:__5du_tEBLosXsf72dzaUw ).

Oh, and their show...Le Reve. I have seen probably 70% of the shows on the Strip in Vegas, and Le Reve is still my favorite. I'm gonna even venture to use the word earth-shattering...it's THAT good. I haven't written a review for it yet, but it's just so amazing. Don't miss out on this. 

Finally, their spa. Yes, it is nice. But it is very basic. TIP, TIP, TIP!! Head over to the Encore for their spa. It is the best all-around spa in Vegas (I also have a review for that, too). 

Ultimately, the Wynn is worth the pretty penny that you may pay to stay here. However, for those that gamble a decent amount with their player's card, they do occasionally mail out deals for $129ish or so a night, weekdays, complete with $200 resort credit. Regardless of this, splurge a bit if you get the chance. You won't regret it. 
You'll truly feel like you're WYNNING.",5,2,4

The pool is large and spacious.  No floating river, but I don't think that's what they were going for. Tons of cabanas that run you about $300-$400 per day, if you want to pay up front.  You can always talk to a casino host and see what deal they can get you.

If you are staying at the Wynn and are celebrating an event (e.g. anniversary), you may want to consider having a custom cake created by the Cake Room at the Wynn. 

Last August, my husband and I celebrated our first year anniversary at the Wynn and I wanted to have a top-tier 6"" cake created for our anniversary dinner. The total price was $69 ($50 for the cake and an additional $19 for the gum paste orchids). It didn't take long to order (I put the order two weeks prior to our arrival) and the catering supervisor taking my order was very accommodating and helpful.

I had no clue what the cake would look like. It was a custom design that I had envisioned in my dreams. When it arrived at our dinner table, it was completely amazing. Even my husband was in awe (see photos).

The room was great, bedding comfortable, and the bathroom was awesome-- come on, there's a TV above the sink, how could I not love that?!  I liked the aesthetic of the hotel in general.  Aside from the lobby and the casino area, the theme is pretty modern and chic-- perhaps not as 'glamorous' as the other hotels on the strip but in my mind, the Wynn is just classier.  I visited the spa which, although overpriced, was excellent.    

My one complaint about the Wynn has to do with the pool.  By about 1 PM every day, nearly 75% of the pool is in shade.  Like, no sun at all for the rest of the day.  It was totally frustrating to have to move 15 times just to find some sun (and most of the chairs were full by the time we wanted to move anyway).

OK, I have only been to Vegas one other time & the buffet situation was pretty sad for vegans. This one, however, was thebomb.com!!! My options were...
Mac & cheese
Ravioli
Sushi
Chow mein
Spicy green bean & tofu
Street tacos with tofu & veg
Spanish rice 
Ramen in miso broth with tofu & veg
Tomato soup
Some speciality salads (Italian-ish quinoa, beet salad, etc)
Various veggies that were already prepared vegan or could be cooked to order (fresher anyway!)
A few fancy dips & pitas\/chips
Apple pie
Mint choc chip ice cream
Mango & tapioca coconut pudding
Candied apple 

Have one of the chefs do a ""vegan walk"" with you to point everything out & tell you about the vegan sub possibilities. Everyone was super friendly & helpful

We went on a Monday night in the summer & the wait was about 20-30 minutes.

Spontaneous decision to spend the weekend in LV had me phoning the Wynn casino marketing to see if I could get a room comped for the weekend. Luckily, I was able to book a complimentary room based on play from last visit (two nights would have been $800+). We checked in right around midnight on Friday, there was no line so it was pretty easy process. One note, I realize it was very late but front desk clerk was not friendly and actually our reception was borderline icy and not what I am accustomed to at Wynn properties. We were given room 56-62. I would not recommend it and here's why:
1. Dated decor. Mr Wynn, it's time to fire your designer. This room looks like my grandmothers high end condo. Cream colored, tufted leather sofa, cream plaid carpeting. They've tried to modernize with art and some furniture but it doesn't work. 
2. Noisy. Really noisy! Club music until 4am and starts back up at 10am at the club at the pool. While I don't come to Vegas for R&R, i do hope to get SOME sleep. This is, by far, the worst thing about Wynn. 
3. There are no usable outlets near the bed. Major inconvenience if your phone needs charge and just plain unacceptable for a hotel of this caliber. 
4. Elevators to suites are small and hot (yes, I'm knit-picking). 
5. No room service menu in our suite. 
6. Not related to the room, but the Wynn is seriously lacking a 24\/7 casual restaurant (think Grand Lux). At 1:30am our options were Allegro, a mid level Italian eatery or counter service at The Cafe. We chose Allegro and ended up eating undercooked pasta and paid $6 for bread basket...at an Italian restaurant. Really???? I'm not even going to go into how bad the service was. 

A positive note...nice bathroom toiletries and the bed was very comfortable.

A lot of slight of hand sells you on doing things that, anywhere other than Las Vegas, you might balk at.  The Wynn is the Lance Burton of hotels. Slick, smooth, and opulent, from the multi-million dollar waterfalls to the championship golf course right behind the hotel, to the spacious rooms with flat screen tvs, it would appear that no expense has been spared to make your visit a memorable one. 

The reality is a little less obvious than the smoke and mirrors that dazle you here, and I can see why Wynn hasn't dominated the Bellagio, THEHotel or Four Seasons, which, if you're reading this, you may also be considering.

I should add that I don't gamble, so how good or bad the casino is will have to be left to those with that bent. I also don't smoke, and I'm a lightweight drinker, which just puts me in a category of non-addictive personality that Vegas just hates.

If you don't have deep pockets, forget about the casino tables or the slots... The food and services here are all obscenely expensive. Double just about every bill that you're used to getting most other places. Admittedly, some of the restaurants feature the best chefs in the world, so the $145\/per person to eat at Alex may be worth it, but the steakhouse is not all that great and you can find a better meal at other major eateries for about 1\/3 to 1\/2 less.

The golf course is beautiful, but at $500.00 a round, it's pretty empty. I hear that high rollers get to use it for free.

For a hotel that spent millions on one fountain display, and has spent millions more on the entry ways, carpets, etc. the ventilation system is its achilles heel. I'm on a smoke free floor but the air is carried up from the casino floor and the hallways reek of smoke. Point to Bellagio which manages that much better. Smoking is ""allowed"" in the casino but in practical fact it's allowed everywhere but the restaurants because no one is going to stop you.  If you're not used to smoky environments, you will feel it quickly.  If I wanted that, I would go to the Venetian and die from the pollution, and we're not talking the canals.

The view from our side of the hotel, where they have King\/Queen combos (read families), faces the golf course, which is cool, and the construction of the new tower here at the Wynn which is not... Did they mention that I might be awakened at 5:30am by the construction when we booked? Noooo... 

Okay, so that won't happen to most of you because you're booking after 2008's early part of the year. Or will it? The Frontier next door went down and a multi-billion (Yes B billion) development is going up there. READ MORE NOISE.  To be fair, Bellagio is sitting next to a massive construction project at the moment too, but most of their rooms are not exposed to it.

It is a nice hotel, with fabulous fixtures. I think I would stay at Bellagio or THEHotel next time.  Even though I can easily afford it, I take offense to $7.00 bags of potato chips and feeling nickled-and-dimed on everything.

Then again, this place works on PT Barnum theory, so I'm sure that the next sucker that comes along will pay it with a big smile and point to the nice trees in the entry and the lovely marble and the designer shopping and enjoy the slight of hand.

With all of the new hotels springing up that are one-uping each other, Wynn should focus on things that induce more customer loyalty and less shopping the latest and greatest.",0,0,0

This had been a goal of mine to stay here ever since walking threw the Wynn several years ago. When I made my plans for a this Vegas trip i could get a room for 109.00 and two passes to the buffet daily.  

Given this price I expected it to be dead.  

Upon arrival I had trouble parking.  The entire structure had been full.  I had to drive around several floors to wait for someone to leave.  I rented a car thur Hertz which has a station at Wynn along with 2nd floor parking which was full of what appeared to be non rental cars.  I pretty sure Hertz does not rent 8 to 10 year old Kia's with no front bumpers or 7 year old mini vans with the temp tire on it.  

When I checked in there had been little wait.  However this had been the first time I find out that my included buffets are now not covered except one day of my stay.  My stay has blackout dates.   I used the Wynn web site to make my reservation and never saw this.  I'm told that I will get a Fifty dollar dining credit instead on the blackout dates.  

With my paper work I'm given a letter from the Wynn management with my room key that tells me that I get buffet passes daily?

We tell are selfs that we had not just come for the buffets so deal with it.  

When we get to are room it had a strip view and on the Wynn 60 floor.  Not sure if that a true 60 floors.  The room was big, clean, and what you would expect.  It was a beautiful.  The view had been fantastic.  It had been everything I had expected from Steve Wynn hotel.  

The rest of the hotel is so beautiful and I had been so impressed with the detail.  

The one day I could go to the buffet had been 12-22-15.  It had been so busy there had been a 2 hour wait to just get in.  I tried several times and the lines never had gotten slower.  

We ate at other restaurants inside the Wynn.  They were much more than 50 dollars.  Some closed early at night that were less expensive.  I felt like I had gotten the cheaper room rate because they knew they were going to get me into their high end restaurants.  This cost a lot more now.  With this and then closed pools or water fountains for maintenance it had not been the high end experience I had saved for.  

When leaving I had something happen though that I have never had..... I checked out to no great fanfare or how was your stay or hope you come back, nor did I need that, but then as I get to the doors I had been stopped by a member of the maintenance staff.  He but down all of his equipment and told us that he was so happy we stayed at his hotel and hoped we would come back.  It was not consistent with he is required to do this but it seemed he was really proud of his hotel and wanted us to feel special.  

I'm torn with this review.  I have read so many that are really positive or negative for some really silly things.  Somethings just had not sat well with me and thought it would be different than other places like MGM or Cesar's.",0,0,0

This is\/was the go-to hotel for our bi-yearly visit to Vegas. However, our last trip was unsatisfactory. First of all, we could hear everything from our room. For example, whenever someone left their hotel room, my family and I could hear the slamming of the guest's door and their voices all while we were trying to sleep. Additionally, our room did not accept any charges. For instance, we were very excited for their buffet. When we got to the register, the lady explained that we couldn't get in because our room didn't accept the charges for unknown reasons. We waited there for at least fifteen minutes before the problem was resolved. This issue also came up when trying to connect to the Wi-Fi. I'd turn on the Wi-Fi on my phone, click on the Wynn internet,  and proceed to log in my information. Nothing happened. I tried again, and once more, nothing happened. I tried a third time, and the screen said ""This location does not accept charges"". I then called the front desk, whom are very respectful, and begin trying to connect us to the internet. After two more tries, we were able to connect. This issue occurred the next night. Although these issues aren't massive, they do add up and become annoying. I'm giving the Wynn three stars because we've had pretty good experiences in the past, and their guest services (front desk, maids) are extremely helpful.

Overall, I would say this room is my favorite to play cards in. The room is pretty spacious and open and doesn't feel cramped (like the Bellagio). It's easy to railbird as the entire front of the room is open. Although it's exposed, the poker room is far enough removed from the casino that the annoying sounds (e.g. slot machines) are non-existent. The chairs are nice and the tables are top-notch as well (they do lack drink holders, however).

The room spreads a good range of limits, starting with $4\/$8 limit and $1\/$3 no limit for Hold'em and going quickly up from there. They also spread Omaha, but the limits are a bit higher.

The clientele is a little more upscale than most of the casinos. Which, most of the time, means that the players are a little better behaved; the exception seems to occur during late night sessions when the booze has been flowing. But, often, the people make the game and I can easily say that some of my best poker playing memories in Vegas have been courtesy of this room and its players. On the lower limits, the level of play is pretty amateurish, provided you don't have a ton of locals at your table. Playing correctly will often yield some nice payouts. Additionally, you can expect to see a lot of the poker celebrities in the room.

The dealers there are all top notch. There are very few misdeals (the only exception I've experienced to date was when one of the floor hands filled in to deal early in the morning, but I'm not sure if that counts because I don't think he normally dealt). The dealers are also very friendly and will joke with the players when appropriate. Overall, the room is well run and the staff is very accommodating (I got comp'd and front of the line passes for our group to the buffet twice during this last trip to Vegas).

The waitresses are some of the most attractive on the strip and serve up top shelf alcohols. I highly recommend the strawberry Julius (also available in pineapple and orange), which is made fresh (not from a mix). I'm not a coffee drinker, but I thought it was pretty cool that instead of sugar, they supply you with a stirrer covered in rock candy when ordering coffee.

This is my favorite hotel to stay and play in Vegas...and if you keep an eye on the rates, you might even score a night's stay at a decent price! Everything here is top of the line. From the scent in the air and the beauty of the design, to the cleanliness of the grounds and the friendliness of the staff, everything is an A+ experience. After all, any resort that perfects the floral world to the point of creating a mechanical carousal made entirely out of flowers deserves five stars in my book.

The restaurants:

Vegas is like Disneyland for adults and staying here is like staying at the Disneyland Hotel. The restaurants are culinary masterpieces with award winning chefs. There are almost too many restaurants to choose from, but I've enjoyed dining at SW Steakhouse, Lakeside, The Buffet, the grill in the sports book, the cafe and room service. I used to love getting a coffee and pastry at the chocolate cafe overlooking the waterfall, but during my last stay I was saddened to see that it had been replaced with a retail shop. Not only is the food excellent at the Wynn, but the ambiance is top notch as well. 

The shopping: 

Wallets be warned, shopping here could break the bank! However, it's pretty to enjoy while window shopping! They have many high end retailers in the Wynn, including Louis Vuitton, a Rolex store, Monolo Blahnik, Oscar De La Renta and the list goes on and on. The shops are gorgeous and the merchandise inside is even more gorgeous. And yes, they even have a Ferrari store inside the Wynn so if you hit the jackpot, you could drive away in your brand new Ferrari. Here's to dreaming big.

The Casino: 

The table minimums never seem to go lower than $15 but then again, it's the Wynn. However, they do have rows and rows of gambling for all types of gamblers. You can even play the card game War!  The sports book is huge and filled with comfortable seating and plenty of tvs.

The Hotel 

I just love the hotel. Where do I begin. First of all, the security here is great. You can't enter the elevator area without presenting your key and they will only provide a guest room with two keys, so you won't be finding people cramming into one room here. The rooms are spacious, airy and delightful. The windows go from floor to ceiling and the blinds are mechanical so you can open and close as you wish without leaving your bed. They even have a tv in the bathroom!

The amenities will spoil you rotten. The pools look like they should be Roman baths and the cabanas are like outdoor resort rooms complete with couches, tvs and refrigerators. The Wynn pools combine with the Encore pools, so it creates this ongoing view of never-ending pools. They have an outdoor bar with video casino games so you can enjoy the best of both worlds. 

Parking is free which is good enough for me!

They staff is very nice and helpful and i guess they did their best to help mitigate our problem. We saw Le Reve which is amazing and at their seafood restaurant, Lakeside, Superb! Then came the gambling: I played for over 10 hours and they only had me down for 4 1\/2 hours. Very frustrating when you are trying to get rated and regularly play. They tried to make it right after speaking to a casino manager, but only gave me nominal credit to go away for play i have been fully comped in the past.

I loved the garden. Check-in was a breeze, now show me my room!!!

That being said, every once in a while it's nice to pretend, and staying at the Wynn will certainly make you feel like you're hot stuff. 

Even their basic rooms are incredible, and since it's a new hotel, you can expect everything to be in tip top shape. I did not experience a single problem during our stay: housekeeping, front desk, concierge, bellman.... all spot on. 

I am definitely an atypical guest for the Wynn  - as most of their patrons probably aren't terrified by $25 tables like myself. So I tend to just high tail it out of here when it comes to gaming. Only reason I dock it a star is the location: It's so stinking far north that if you don't want to play here and you are too cheap for cabs you are going to have quite a hike to get to just about anywhere.

I had planned our itinerary so that we could visit the Wynn Casino since it looks great on Trip Advisor, the Wynn website, and all the reviews everywhere are great.    

Well it was as good as they say.    The place looks and feels ritzy.  The chairs at each slot machine are super comfortable and some even incorporate the games theme into the chair.   The air is clean and fresh - something a lot of casinos lack.   So just the overall feel of the place is high end.  I rate this as the #1 casino we visited with the Cosmopolitan second.    

I don't drink alcohol but like non-alcoholic beer and had been ordering it in Vegas.   As a non-drinker I used to roll my eyes at casino reviews where the primary emphasis was on drink service.   Now I understand that point of view.  Many of the places we visited, including the Encore, had terrible service, but the Wynn's waitresses were on the ball, very polite and helpful.  I was also impressed that instead of getting a plain O'Douls, the Wynn carries Buckler, Heineken's brand of NA.  So higher end verses average.  

The Red Card was okay, it's the Wynn's reward card.   Once you obtain 100 session points you can spin for a free prize. I got 10$ in slot play but hey it beats nothing.   Levi and Michael were both very helpful at the Red Card desk taking the time to explain everything to my wife and me.

I used a lock to secure my main baggage but didn't use any for my small cabin baggage and when we got back home, I noticed a little too late that a few small items that I had purchased in Las Vegas had disappeared and we were sure we didn't move them from the suitcase.

We stayed this past weekend with a bunch of friends in the Wynn Tower Suites and everything was perfect.

The suite was the most awesome suite one can imagine, with a beautiful interior, lots of wonderful details and a view of the Trump Tower, Treasure Island and the Mirage. At night, you get a full view of Las Vegas with the lights on, which is wonderful. It also had a rain shower, a private jacuzzi, a second bathroom and a very cozy bed. Also important: iHome to play music and charge my iPhone.
We ordered breakfast on the room both mornings and it arrived within 30 minutes and was both times delicious. The suite had its own dining area, so it was very convenient.
The service all over the hotel and especially the croupiers were all great.  They were genuinely friendly, all seemed to enjoy their job and were great fun, they knew when to be courteous, they knew when to be humorous.
The interior design with all the details in this place is incredible. I lost all my money but who cares if it's in a place like this.

Others turn to wise old great-grandmas or even psychics. Being an atheist\/cynic with a crappy grandma, I turn to my friends, and depending on what I'm seeking advice for, I have certain people lined up in mind as go-tos. So when it came time to figure out what hotels\/attractions I should visit for my first Las Vegas trip since I was 15 (I'm 24 now),  I turned to my good friend Jessica, who had moved from LA to Vegas sometime in the last couple years.

Now I'm a relatively transparent person; my likes and dislikes are pretty well known since I tend to talk a lot. Knowing my proclivity for class, style, and the company of people who speak in grammatically correct sentences, Jess suggested that I would probably enjoy the Wynn as my favorite Strip-area hotel, citing it's reputation for ""elegance, cleanliness, and less smoke."" Clean and low-smoke?! She really *does* know me!

Luckily, Jess was also tactful enough not to suggest I book a room there for my weekend trip, because although I have a taste for Van Cleef and Arpels, I operate on a Jewelry Exchange budget. So maybe all I could afford was the Westin via Priceline, but I'd be damned if I let that keep me from dressing up, driving down the street with my boyfriend, and sneaking in to the Wynn's pool as if we owned the place. (Hey, the Westin's pool is literally the size of a deck of cards. Cut a sheisty girl a break, kay?)

So after pulling off our 'let's sneak into the Wynn's pool and cabana!"" heist not once but TWICE (I blend in w\/families with kids and room keys well; like a babysitter or aunt), we looked around at the gleaming water, perfect ratio of shade to sun, fully-stocked cabana bar and nearby poolside cafe, and decided that our Saved By the Bell scheming was DEFINITELY worth it.

If you have the means to actually stay at the Wynn, I'd highly recommend it. The amenities speak for themselves; I can only infer that the rooms must be just as nice and well-appointed. And if you don't? Make like Krissy M. and pretend to be rich for a day. Maybe you can't spend the night, but you can get into the swanky pool! Just get (tastefully) dolled up and try and blend in with a group as they get off the pool elevator. It helps if you're wearing designer shades and you pretend to be having an important conversation on a cell phone.

Many thanks to my friend\/wise grandma\/personal deity Jessica, who helpfully steered me away from my crackerjack pool and 3 star hotel and in a more classy, Krissy-friendly direction. ;-)",0,1,1

The employees do the little extra things that make you feel special and the place breathes class instead of oozing kitsch. If you're going to spend $30 extra to stay at a hotel in Vegas, the Wynn must be one of the first you check.  

 - The rooms will run you 2 bills and up which is just fine because the amenities and 600+ square feet are worth it when you are wanting a ""better"" vacation. 
 - Le Reve is a 4-star cirque-style show in the water. We sat in the third row, but the circular theater looked like every seat had a great view.
 - I'm not a golfer, but the course looks beautiful. If you can't have a room with a view of the strip, getting one of this course is nice.
 - Lakeside is a nice restaurant to enjoy the Lake of Dreams
 - The Buffet is especially nice for dinner on weekends or holidays.
 - Save money on taxis because the 3 nightclubs (XS, Tryst, and Surrender) at the Wynn & Encore are bumpin!
 - the Esplanades at Wynn has high-end shopping too rich for my wallet, but still a guy can dream, right?
 - The Wynn pool is heated and a true Vegas party pool
 - The Casino is classy. They still will take your money, but in $25-$100 chunks instead of $10-$20 bites.
 - Housekeeping is wonderful. Need something? Ask. Seriously. Be prepared to tip.
 - Even the valet was great as he recommended we just walk instead of ride to the Venetian and then gave us bottle waters for the 5-minute stroll.
 - The worst part of the Wynn is the ever present voice of Steve Wynn telling you how awesome he thinks the hotel is. At some point, he needs to let the property, service, style, and experience speak for itself, but until then we are stuck trying to find a way to change the channel or hit mute.

My hair and skin, scorched by the Vegas heat survived thanks to their never ending stock of coconut scented Molton Brown products. 

We barely had to leave the hotel for a good bite to eat because nearly all of the restaurants we tried were downright delicious (with special shout outs to Red 8, Andrea's and Allegro).

Rooms - The goddamn rooms in this place are absolutely stellar.   They easily compete with the Bellagio as far as the room and bed is concerned and I gotta tell ya... the bathroom probably takes #1 spot in my book.   TV in the bathroom *while* you're taking a bath?   check.   A bathtub so big you can have an orgy in?  check.   Shower with water pressure so fucking fierce it'll bitchslap your hangover into tomorrow?  check.   Seriously... that bathroom's got it all.   You can even pick up the phone while you're praying to the porcelain God.   How Vegas is that?

Pool - When I come to Vegas, it's a good idea to keep me away from the Casino (see below) so my wife and I thought we should plump down $400 and get a cabana at the pool for the day.   It's hella pricey, but I gotta say that was one sweet experience!   The hostess came by every 15 minutes to check whether or not we needed anything.  I felt like royalty!   The cabana's got a stocked fridge with complimentary beverages and a decent size flat screen TV if you wanna crank some tunes while catching some Rays.   Seriously, we just hung out my the Wynn Pool Jay-Z style, and that was hella sweet!   Still, I thought I'd go try my hand at the Blackjack table that sits poolside and got quickly reminded that I'm not a celebrity... One thousand dollars minimum on that table?   Hmmm.... yeah no.  Thanks but no thanks.

Casino -  Eat shit and die.  Fuck all the dealers.  They always steal my money when I play Blackjack.  Fuck you casinos, fuck you!

Dining - We ate at Boulud, Switch, and Sugar & Ice.   All three restaurants, while very much distinct in style, had some very good food.  Service varied with location but the dining at the Wynn is certainly good.  Even the food that we ordered poolside while at the Cabana was good.   It wasn't the best culinary experience ever, but it certainly proved as a capable way to mop up the many Vodka Red Bulls loitering in my stomach.

Vibe - I dig the vibe at the Wynn.   It's snobbish enough to filter out the ghetto bitches and twentysomething hipsters.   Yet it's not so snobbish as to feel like you're at a retirement home with a bunch of people waiting to die.

Its a nice walk in the morning, which is what we did to get or daily walk in before it got into the 100's out of the way..  The pool does not get too packed..

We took our son to the Wynn for his 21st birthday last weekend and I can assure you it was an experience we will not forget. 

1. Reservations through the marketing dept....perfect
2. Concierge's attention to detail and perspective before we even checcked in....outstanding
3. Arrival and check in (greeted promptly at the limo and very efficient and quick c\/i (john was amazing, we requested through marketing, a high floor and rooms close together(we all know how these requests usually go)....top floor(60th) and rooms right next to each other..perfect start.
4. Rooms were clean, extremely well appointed and an unbelievable view of the strip...even better start
5. Lunch at La Cave...excellent food (charcuterie plate and the pizza with the quail egg is the way to go here), great wine list...even better service
6. Casino time...this casino is gorgeous, well laid out, not smokey, and just has an overall cool, trendy vibe. Great music, great cocktail servers, great dealers, and most of all friendly, professional, classy, pit bosses. (Jimmy at the craps pit is the reason I wont play craps anywhere else. This gentlemen is an asset to the casino if he can deal with me and make me happy and laugh at 5 a.m.)...Thx Jimmy!!
7. Parasol Up is the classiest casino lounge in Vegas....trust me, we've been to most..Chandalier Bar is the only close 2nd.
8. Saturday brunch at The Country Club (not the jazz brunch, just standard menu Saturday 12ish). Some of the best food in Vegas, classy atmosphere,(dont settle for a table by the hostess stand, sit in the back room or at the bar for a magnificent view of the well manicured golf course and the waterfall). Perfect start to a day at the Wynn!
9. XS, young..old..in between...just do it..really! Not snotty and pretentious like most high end clubs in town. From the doormen to security to the bartenders and servers..first class all the way..(we even got to party next to Gronk and his brother...which is great when your son is a huge football fan and your at the club celebrating his 21st bday)..What a blast!! Jo at the concierge was fantastic our entire trip, and suggested we get our club passes from the concierge desk, which we did, and as a guest of the hotel we skipped the line and went straight in..passes were very reasonable...do this for sure! XS *****
10. SW steakhouse....WOW! Over the weekend we had dinner at ""Cut"" and ""Bouchon""...Cut gives them a run for the money but SW is the real deal. We are from Austin and hard to impress when it comes to steak, but SW has the service, food, and ambience that you want before a big night out in Vegas. Perfect spot to get the party started and have a wonderful meal..SW*****

Excelent Stay at the Wynn! It is the Ritz Carlton\/Four Seasons of Las Vegas but better. The cool vibe, chic atmosphere, polished service are all reasons we will only stay at the Wynn. Thank you for a truly memorable experience..my son is ready to come back for his 22nd!!

The in-house restaurants all have creative vegan options -- the opposite of the kind of perfunctory vegan dishes often found at high-end restaurants.

Your every need is anticipated and accommodated, without any obsequiousness. The staff is simply attentive and on-point.

When you stay inside the hotel your treated like you were staying at a five star resort, which, is why this is a five star resort.

After my first trip there a couple of years ago, I absolutely loved it!  Of course, that was my pre-signature days.  We were also there to enjoy the holiday season and 200 bucks for this room was nice and i liked it a lot.  BUT after experiencing MGM's Signature a few times in the last few months, I can't help but not want to return to the Wynn again.

Yes, everything is luxurious... but the service that comes with it is sub par!  I also hate dealing with attitude when I'm spending so much money gambling at your casino only to realize that your comp system sucks as you're catered to only high rollers... and 4000 points a day @ $3 a point doesn't mean crap to my host.  I would have much rather pay for my own room at the Signature and get comped at the wonderful restaurants there.  Never mind the free room here.

We arrived to an overcrowded lobby past midnight - everyone and their gramma was trying to get into the club and was either obnoxious or drunk.  Checking in was relatively painless tho' I wish he would have asked if I preferred a lower or higher floor, closer\/farther away from the elevator.  No it usually wouldn't matter but it got to be a pain in the mornings sharing tight elevator trips with 48 other people trying to get to the spa level or check out ... taking too long to get to the casino floor.  Yes, the Signature has gotten me spoiled.

The pool is too small for that many people... the drinks much too expensive tho' the mango daquiri is excellent - even at that price :)  Service is slow but only because the place is huge and there are too few of them.

The casino is clean and well ventilated, the air seems fresh and there were never issues finding a suitable blackjack table.  There are several good dining options on-site, as well as some very swanky nightclubs that were quite popular. If you plan to visit one of the clubs, I suggest speaking to a guest host about your admission options (lines can be very long). The golf courses are immaculate.  The rooms are modern and bright with great views through windows that span the entire width of the exterior wall.

The Cons:

NOISE. I couldn't sleep at the Wynn. This place is all about appearances. It LOOKS nice when you walk in, but it's poorly insulated. Our room shook every time our neighbors closed their door and it sounded like they were slamming it. Compared to our stays at the Aria, Bellagio, MGM - you can hear a pin drop. The other major noise issue was the wind. Silly, I know, but the wind outside was so loud I could NOT sleep. The Wynn told us it was their ""windy season"" and the desk lady commented she's a heavy sleeper so it doesn't bother her. I am a light sleeper, but my husband is an incredibly heavy sleeper and the wind and door slamming woke him up too. I've stayed at top floors in many Vegas hotels - I've never been kept awake by the wind whistling. I think the Wynn is just poorly insulated! 

GAMBLING SUCKS. Again, I'm used to MGM with a seemingly endless amount of tables to choose from. The casino is rather small and the table minimums are high. During the day, you will be hard-pressed to find more than one table under a $25 minimum. It's even difficult to find many tables to choose from in the $25 range. The table minimum is no problem for my husband, but I don't like to bet that high. The MGM allows me to bet lower and he can bet as high as he wants. We were there with a big group for a birthday this time, and this was a huge problem since most people were not wanting to bet that high during the day. MGM and Aria are much more accommodating to a group.

LOCATION. Again, I prefer the excellent location at MGM and Aria. When we want to venture out of the hotel, we've found it to be easy to walk to a ton of nearby casinos. The Wynn was not convenient for us. It's walking distance to Treasure Island? blech.

The Wynn is all about appearances and it falls so far short of the mark I can't imagine ever returning. Most importantly, I didn't sleep for 3 days because of the noise issues with this hotel. Don't believe that just because you're spending a small fortune to stay here you're going to get luxury. You're not.",4,2,1

One problem that people post very often about Wynn is that, lower floors are able to hear the noise from the nightclubs at night. Based on my experiences, I've stayed there a couple times, in lower floors and I did not hear a thing. (Yes, i was facing the golf course and yes, I think it was Skrillex who was playing in XS that night). 
Other problem people complain a lot about the hotel, is that they charge an expensive, ""secret"" resort fee for the uses of pools, spa, etc. 
Once again, based on my experiences, I can tell you that the resort fee is expensive, but it is no secret. From the moment you arrive to the registration area, staff will ask you if you agree to pay the resort fee. Let's not forget this is a luxury hotel, and even though I think the resort fee is expensive, it is very well worth it. 
Those are the problems people post very often, other complains include: long lines, security, etc. All I can think of, is that maybe those people had bad luck and experienced a not very enjoyable stay, because overall, the hotel is prepared to give the ultimate vegas experience.

It has been about 10 years since I went to Vegas.  I used to go every year when I was married.  It was a thing for us.  He even proposed to me there at the Stratosphere and we always stayed at the Mirage.  We even went there after our wedding to honor Vegas with our nuptials. That was our spot.  BUT a year after our daughter was born, it came to light that there was someone else in our marriage.  He left. Married her.  And because he is unoriginal and a creature of habit, they now frequent the Mirage.  Tacky.  Classless. 

So...it was kind of a big deal for me to reclaim Vegas.  I had to do it for me.  It would have been convenient to stay the Mandalay because that is where DD was playing, but I wanted to do it bigger and better.  I chose the WYNN.  And boy, oh boy...did I choose well.  

The hotel is top of the line.  The décor, the details, the flowers, the shops...all top of the line.  They decorate that atrium in the front with live flowers for the merry go round and the hot air balloon.  Amazing.  Gorgeous.  Everyone that works there is professional and nice and happy (happy that you are there to spend your money-lol).  Their rooms are very nice:  floor to ceiling windows, electronic curtains and lights, a tub to fit a small family...and I happened to take 2 bubble baths just I've never been in a tub that size.  The bed...mmmmm...very comfy and luxurious with their sheets and mattress and pillows.  Oh. My. Oh. Yes. 

My only complaint was that I went to bed at 0300 on a Friday night and I could hear the bass from Encore's outdoor pool\/night club spot.  Seriously.  We were on the 25 floor or something like that, so we weren't too close to it.  I couldn't fall asleep.  So when we go back there...cuz we will, we'll have to request a higher floor or to face the strip instead of the golf course.

They gave me up to three nights stay each time. Last time I went in July, They gave me 3 nights stay and $150 free gambling money! Now thats VIP style for someone who doesn't gamble that much. 
I love their ambiance. It's elegance makes you feel like you are in Europe, or perhaps just one of the best in Vegas. When I'm there it's either gambling or on the strip so never took advantages of the pool, spa or the fine dinnings. 
The rooms are contemporary style with electronic curtains, flatscreen wall tv with music and mood swings background, huge bathroom with the toilet in its own little room, a standing shower and a bath tub, ooohh.. not to forget their beddings... sateen eqyptian cotton sheets and pillows. makes you feel so warm and cozy and guarantee a great night rest. You can also buy their hotel amenities and beddings at one of their shop cals NVLV.  

Their Toiletries is called bambu. They sell it at the gift shops.. pretty expensive. so Take advantage of the useages. ;)

I'm only giving it a 4 star because I like more of the elegance style, like Venetian more then the contemporary. At the price you are paying you would think its a bigger room like the Venetian rooms, with a living room and a pull out couch.

Every detail in this hotel has been experimented with, thought about, and perfected through years of experience and knowledge from the Wynn team that built Mirage, Treasure Island, Bellagio and now Wynn and Encore Las Vegas.  

The aspect that separates Wynn from the rest of the 5 Star resorts in the area (Venetian\/Palazzo, Aria and Mandarin Oriental) is the level of personal service and attention you receive from every Wynn employee.  From the housekeeping staff to the Blackjack dealers, their job is to make your stay as comfortable as possible and to address any need you might have.  

Another aspect of this hotel that is touched upon in several reviews is the atmosphere throughout the hotel.  The level of detail is over the top with the freshest of flowers throughout the resort, the spotless carpet in the Esplanade and Casino floor, the polished marble in the public bathrooms and the ornate and very expensive furniture found throughout the hotel.  Roger Thomas (head of Wynn Design) has spared no expense in decorating this hotel with pieces that are so unique yet so unassuming that there is something always to be discovered.  A table or chandelier at Wynn isn't just a typical piece that you'd find at Pottery Barn, most of these pieces have either been designed in house, commissioned or purchased at auction for your enjoyment from many places throughout the World.

The Resort rooms (not the Tower Suites) are phenomenal!  Floor to ceiling windows, electronic light and window shade control and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on are just a few highlights of the standard Resort King.  While the amenities go even further in a Tower Suites room, the standard Resort King holds it's own quite well. 

The Wynn (and Encore) represents the Best in Las Vegas, period.  Staying here is an experience like no other and I can assure you that you will not be disappointed.",1,0,0

Stayed at the Wynn from June 30, 2013 through July 9, 2013. The entire hotel staff were the most courteous people ever. Always treated us like we were special. This is the second time we've stayed at the Wynn, but this time was the best ever. The room was spectacular, the amenities such as the gym were the greatest, the pool was superb and the service at all the locations was superior to any other we've experienced. If you want to enjoy Las Vegas and be pampered the Wynn is the place to go. However, on a separate note there is one down side and this is the Casino.

The Casino comps are virtually non-existent for the average player and do not promote good business client development. The ""Casino Host"" was not customer service oriented and did not make any effort in promoting future patronization. As I stated before, the Wynn is the best hotel ever and I'd stay there again just to enjoy the ambiance, amenities, and the fine restaurants. 

Room Tip: Try to stay on the 28th through the 60th floors facing the strip. Excellent views!!!!

Last time I came to Vegas I had stayed in a different hotel, but spent most of my time gambling & partying at the Wynn & so I decided to book it for my next trip. This trip I decided my stay would be more relaxing; I'd go to a few shows and drink at hotel bars instead of clubbing. 

Well when I tried to go to bed at 2 AM I could hear the music from the club clearly in my room. This happened both nights and I was on the 22nd floor. Other friends who were staying on the 25th and 34th floors were able to hear the music in their room each night too. I mentioned this when I checked out & the front desk attendant said to request a room with a lower number next time. Upon check in I had requested a room on a higher floor, but they were unable to accommodate my request. Also, the beds and the pillows were extremely uncomfortable...I was surprised because this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel, but the beds\/pillows were WAY more comfortable when I stayed at the Palazzo. In addition to this the bed was supposed to be a king sized, but I swear it was a king...I have a king at home and that definitely was not a king.

Despite all of this, I do think the hotel is absolutely gorgeous. I love the hot air balloon and carousel art creations they have inside...they're absolutely stunning. There is a lot of great options for food in the hotel. My favorite is the Wynn Buffet! It's a bit pricey, but totally worth it! You can add on unlimited mimosas for $19 to the buffet meal price. To save some money we drank a ton at brunch and were drunk by the time we were going to go to the pool and didn't have to order $15 dollar drinks. 

Make sure to check out the pools. We had a wonderful time relaxing all three days at the pool. You'll have to get up early if you want a spot next to the water. We showed up at 11 one day and it was already crowded without any spots. We had to sit in the back by the towels until someone people left thankfully. We did notice several high class escorts trying to pick up drunk men at the pool too.

Like another reviewer said, the room deserves 3 stars and the hotel itself and amenities deserve 4 stars. I was surprised to see a ton of families staying here. I'd probably recommend a different hotel for families with children. Maybe the Bellagio or Caesar's Palace?",2,4,3

We had previously stayed at the Wynn before to celebrate our anniversary with my wife. We were so impressed that we were treated like Royalty that this time we chose the best Hotel in Vegas even though I'm not a rated gambler at the Wynn. I chose to give my wife the time of her life. Everything was flawless, we were impressed by the chocolates and the well wishes card. I told my wife, Mr. Wynn doesn't play game he's a piece of Vegas history and he delivers the best service ever, makes other's looks like amateurs. We enjoyed the Cajun chicken wings, and I have so far never tasted any chicken wings any better than those in my entire life. Everything was flawless with the hotel. Security was more than happy to guide us in the right direction to where we wanted to go. I was so impressed that I would surprise my wife and take her again for her birthday which was a few weeks away. The flatware was outstanding and flawless. I am unsure about the towels, some look a bit on the creamy side and some look nice and new. Maybe it's time to update the towels.

This time I decided to amaze my wife with another stay at the Wynn, I stayed and relaxed and enjoyed our room most of the time and walked the street for some fresh air and random live entertaintment.  Our stay was as extravagant as our first stay. The flatware from the first visit was once again perfect and the yellowy towels were less than my first time. As well, the hot water ran out or was not working for a good thirty minutes or so, just when I was about to shave. We were so enchanted by the view of the golf course and I could feel safe because I could see my Hummer from my window. We were so in love with the Wynn that we decided to stay and extend another night. We were made aware that I had to be by the downstairs desk by three p.m. to have new cards reassigned and to process my card again. The line was so long that even other attendants were serving us water. I was so frustrated that I considered just leaving. My wife even called me from my room worried if everything was okay, and I told her that it was really busy and that I was next in line.
I was tired of standing and I just wanted to go to my room and relax. I finally was greeted by my check in host ""Edwin"" and he greeted me and I was in the middle of explaining to Edwin that I was extending my day for one more day, when I begin to see Edwin lose attention away from me and roll his eyes to his left (completely ignoring me and let me talking to myself). The gentleman who was in front of line just ran up from beside me and invaded my personal space without excusing himself like if I was non existant to both him and Edwin. It took me two seconds that Edwin totally disregarded me and had left me talking to me self, that humiliated me and I felt like walking away. Edwin took a good five minutes ignoring me and addressing whatever this gentleman's questions were. I had to wait five minutes for his additional questions.
I was shocked by the level of rudeness of both Edwin and the guest, (Edwin could had asked this guest to please wait a minute while he assisted me as he was doing but he decided to ignore me).
Edwin's reintroduction was ""so where were we Mr. M*******?"" I asked him, what was this guest's issue he almost trampled me and disregarded that I was speaking with Edwin and he come and just barges right in-between my conversation in such a rude manner. To my astonishment! Edwin's reply made my blood pressure go up (I have a genetic heart defect) I asked Edwin what was that all about, and his response was, ""well he had multiple reservations, he had three rooms, and he's a business owner"". That really unsettled me because I could feel my heart palpitate. Edwin considered this gentleman more important than me because he was a business owner with three reservations. WOW! I'm a business owner with one reservation and an investor. I did not address the issue I proceeded with Edwin and left back to my room feeling disrespected. I later called and spoke with a front desk manager named Yuri regarding this matter, she sounded really busy and assured me that everyone is equal at this resort and that there was no excuses for Edwin's behavior. Yuri advised me that she would have a talk with Edwin. That was the end of it. 
After that experience I am not sure if the Wynn is the right place for me. 
I have been to Vegas twice since that incident at the Bellagio where the towels have the hotel logo and are all white. I game there and average a hundred dollars a bet in roulette and I put in more than four hours a day. I can turn five hundred dollars into twelve hundred in less than two hours. My host can verify that. I am disappointed with the Wynn and was looking forward to another magical stay. Oh and thank you for telling me other guest's personal business Edwin.",1,2,0

The rooms are HUGE and the windows are floor-to-ceiling. We had a view of the Wynn golf course and the Northern end of the Strip (if you looked closely, you could see Circus Circus down the road). 

The casino is not that big but the atmosphere is nice. The restaurants are all great. We got a package deal through Expedia (I stalked it a bit to get a low price, hehe) and ended up paying like $119\/n and $200-250 for airfare (from Detroit) which was a great deal.

My only complaints about it was that the pool was closed for renovations (they told us we could use Encore's pool, but of course we did not ... it was Feb. anyways so wasn't that warm) and we had a $100 dining credit EACH that we thought we could use at Okada, but it turned out we couldn't. That's still the most expensive meal I've had in my life, to this day, but also was very good, fortunately.

I went walking over & had to yell out to the valet guy because he was driving away. I told him that the name he yelled out wasn't mine & proceeded to tell him what my last name was. He didn't even say sorry his response was ""that's the name on the ticket."" OK so the guy I dropped off my car with not only has bad English but apparently bad hearing too. I even had to say my name more then once which isn't a hard one. If you don't understand someone's last night or don't have a clue to spell it then you should ask Mr Valet guy. Due to his mistake it could of resulted in a longer wait if I wasn't paying attention & valet could of re-parked my car & they would of had one mad customer. Get it together Wynn employees!! 
The conference room was nice (Chambertin), with a nice & comfortable set up with great food. The lasagna was delicious & their tomato, mozzarella salad was to die for!!! 
The registration line & food line was confusing though, I felt like those two were not very organized. I found myself standing in the food line thinking it was the registration line until I got up to the registration table. Not sure if this was Wynn's set up or the people running the conference. Plus the food was in the middle of the hallway too....not the best place to set food up. It would of been nice if there were some signs posted thru out the casino indicating where to go for the conference considering there was more then one going on tonight.",6,5,2

Even with this fantastic view and elegantly decorated room, I had one of the most horrific experience in Vegas tonight. I was mocked and ridiculed by the slot machine floor manager. I won't be coming back to Wynn thanks to this omniscient guy, who I can't remember the name of. Now here's my story of being ridiculed by the hotel staff.

My first night at Wynn, I sat at a table to play Blackjack. The dealer requested me to provide an ID for the age verification, which was a bit odd, but I took it as a compliment. (27 - turning 28) I gave her my expired license (I'm currently not eligible to reinstate it until next month), and the table manager of the night requested me to provide another id. This also was perfectly reasonable, so I did tell her that I'll bring my passport and be back. No harm here. I know the law. I brought the passport, and upon presenting it, I was asked if I would like to create a ""red card"", which is Wynn's playing membership card. She stated that I could use that as a form of my identification. She specifically told me i won't have to carry the passport around, because my passport will be in there system. Knowing that I would be playing tomorrow, and even more in upcoming years, it sounded perfectly reasonable to get one - at least up to this point, so I consented to the terms (verbally), and was given the ""red card."" I played shortly and went back to my room. The Red card benefit -replacing id- ended up being partially misleading. Real story unfolds.

Now the 2nd night was when the vegas experience went dreadful. I know I am over-exaggerting here, and becoming a bit verbose, but bare with me. Tonight, my wife joined me to play Casino, so we decided to play slot. I took my red card and cash to play. While I was playing, the waitress came by and asked us if we want to order drinks. I ordered one (first drink of the night), and she requested our couple to present our ids. Because of the information that I was given last night I gave her the ""red card,"" and my expired license.  She told me that she cannot run validation via red card. I told her about the last night story, and she said she will check with someone else (a slot machine manager).

Now this cocky manager came, and the story gets interesting. He told me the same information given by the waitress that they cannot Id me with my red card. I told him the same story that I told the waitress. He didn't listen and kept on repeating the same thing, which was bit upsetting. In addition, he said identifying via red card is absolutely not possible. I asked then why I was given the misleading information, and why I ended up providing my passport to be registered to their system. He then jokingly said, ""well because the red card provides wonderful benefits."" My initial responses were acquring justifications around why I was given the wrong information. He then reassuring said ""no one on Wynn's floor would have given that information."" Then I reasserted him that my passport is registered, and I don't have any incentives to lie. I stay at Wynn, so it's just a matter of time to grab my passport. I actaully had to state these facts MULTIPLE times, because he would turn deaf on me. In between he ridiculed me by exampling some elementary facts about identity. After my persistent effort to convince him to check their system, he unwillingly agreed to check again. Later he showed up and apologized that their staff could've delivered a partially misleading information. 

Now he admitted that red card can be used as a form of validation as the table or slot managers have access to run identification via red card; however, it still cannot be used as a form of ID to order drinks as waitresses don't have access to the system. So first part about his apology was clear, but that wasn't my main source of anger. It was his cocky attitude. I told him that the most upsetting part of this experience was not about the first apology, and I was loosing my patience more and more as he never apologized for his attitude and stubbornness to listen. When I tried to explain this, he kept on repeating the apology of his first part. After his parrot like pattern, he told me the drink is on them for causing inconvenience. I may not be a high baller, but I definitely make enough money to not accept the drink apology. I can pay tons for my own. I just chose not to because I'm not a drinker. All I wanted was his apology for his damn arrogant attitude. I tried to control my anger and decided not to pursue this further for the sake of my wife. Self centered egotist won't even change. It was simply better to ignore him without wasting my time. Unfortunately, I'm wasting time now as I am writing this long review with my mobile handset.",4,4,0

After a horrid drive from LA (it took over 6 hours to get to Vegas), it was pure heaven checking into our room. They even let us choose which color scheme we preferred (I believe there are three...we chose cinammon or something that looked like dark copper). Our room had floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the strip. The room was definitely big, it had a big flat screen with speakers hooked up in the bathroom so you could hear in there as well, and one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in. Definitely one of the nicest hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. 

The rest of the hotel\/casino is equally gorgeous. The colors, textures, and smells are so lush - I honestly don't know what they put in the air, but it smells unbelievable. (It must be some newfangled scented oxygen...the other casinos should take a hint for their oxygenated environments). The fresh flowers in the lobby hanging from trees are exquisite. The pool is great - it's much bigger than most of the other hotel pools (as I realized upon subsequent Vegas trips), I won $$ at the poolside blackjack tables, and the ""european bathing section"" basically consists of a ton of guys and like 2 topless girls, so it ranks not-as-skeezy on the general Vegas skeeziness scale.

Wynn is a slightly higher end Casino\/Resort and is actually little away from the strip. The monorail does not stop here so it is a bit hard to travel from strip to here.

** Stay ** 
Absolutely brilliant. The bed, room, minibar etc. was extremely good. The staff that served food in the room at 3 am was extremely polite and good to me. 

They had a TV in bathroom. I really love that. 

** Food ** 
Food is expensive. Restaurants close pretty fast and room service is the only option and food for one person will cost around $45 including gratuity. 

** Gaming ** 
Slot machines were fewer but poker tables were good and I overall cam out positive. 

** Pricing ** 
Biggest problem was pricing. They have a hidden fee of $37 for internet and other stuff and despite that internet is not really free if you connect multiple devices. That is very deceptive.

Minibar is damn expensive and they charge you automatically if you lift the product for more than 30 seconds. A pack of condoms will cost you $35 and a small bottle of vodka $25.",0,0,0

So Wynn, why are you so south of the strip?  I'm spoiled and enjoy staying at the Elara where I am prime walking distance from Earl of Sandwich, Fat Tuesdays, and the Cosmo.

Why are your policies so strict--can't rearrange the snacks and mini bar, you'll charge me if things are out of place for more than 60 seconds?  Who are you?  And then why does it take you an hour and a half to send a mini bar staff to examine our mini bar when we inquired about the $200 charges we got hit with because we supposedly took items out of the mini bar for consumption...when we didn't?  Oh wait, you didn't even send somebody to sort it out and instead, why did it take like five phone calls to the front desk to get it sorted out before you decided to drop the charges that shouldn't have even been there in the first place?

And why is it that for a luxury hotel, I can hear Surrender and XS's blaring music from my hotel room?  Do the people who stay here not have to sleep?  I understand it's Vegas and folks are up until the crack of dawn, but when I want some peace and quiet, I can't even have that?

I'll give it to you for everything else because the hotel is gorgeous, the rooms are spacious, the pool is amazing, and it is nice to be able to walk downstairs and XS is footsteps away.

First off the sportsbook, not too big but WOW just plain beautiful with comfortable chairs and large monitors at each booth that you can control to watch whatever sport you want..There are chairs grouped together as well for viewing games (this trip lots of baseball fans). To the rear is a large bar that opens up into the sportsbook.

As a horseracing fan I have to say the Wynn offers the best future odds for big races as well as daily sheet with some great handicapping info on the reverse side. When placing bets dont forget to ask for drink tickets..

The casino in itself is just amazing with a new flower covered trellis every few months, the place is clean, does not stink like cigarette. There is every video and table game you could want. Tables were not ridiculously high limits either.

And a trip to the Wynn would not be complete without a stop at La Cave wine bar..

However, I understand we're in the desert, so it's probably appropriate.

The separate bathtub is big enough for  two-person bath, but my only complaint is that they should give you a little botte of bubble bath to enjoy it with :)  I would gladly swap one of the many soaps for some bath suds!  The bath amenities are impressive, though.  They are the only place I have ever seen to offer up little bottles of hairspray *and* Q-tips (pet peeve of mine is when hotels don't have Q tips).  They also have nice shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash, and toothbrushes.

The bathroom is set up like a vanity with his-and-hers sinks and a seat in the middle to do makeup.  It has a side-room with the toilet so one can have privacy while someone else is getting ready in the bathroom.  The bathroom is very spacious and was my favorite part of the hotel room.

The bedroom area had a small couch, a coffee table, a desk, and a kitchenette-dining-table.  It was crowded with furniture, definitely, but maneuverable.  

The actual hotel\/casino area was quite a sight.  I personally loved the casino at the Wynn best, and the restaurants were solid.

The lobby area was decorated for christmas and thus had hanging balls and christmas trees everywhere.  Very beautiful.

The concierge staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and we found their recommendations quite helpful.

Something I didn't discover until the last day there - there is a shopping mall across the street (2 minute walk) if you want to do non-boutique shopping (like the high-priced things you find in the hotel boutiques).  If you are looking for a going-out outfit and think that there are no cheaper-places to shop at, you're wrong.  Walk outside, cross the street, and go to the large complex that has restaurants and many floors of ""normal mall"" shopping.  They also have a starbucks and a food court if you want to grab coffee\/breakfast at non-Wynn-hotel-restaurant prices.",2,1,3

Everything from early checkin in to better views. We declined them all.   We were able to get early check-in for free anyhow.

The room was very nice and clean.  Only complaint is the lack of fridge and coffee maker.  A mini fridge is available for $35 a day, but it seemed steep for our needs.  The mini bar is all sensored and ours went haywire and charged us for 5 items we didn't touch.  We were able to get the charges refunded, but be sure to check your statement.  

We also found the windows to be pretty dirty, which made us glad we did not upgrade our floor.

The pool is awesome, plenty of lounge chairs and shade is plentiful after 2:00.  We rented a cabana one day and would recommend it.  Includes snacks, sodas and a fruit plate.  The cabana itself is well appointed with TV, fan and misters.

I have been to Vegas a number of times and I do not have a very high opinion of this place overall considering my experiences here - especially with the people that frequent this place. I generally consider Vegas to be an overpriced, artificial, cesspool. All of that said... You might ask why I found myself and my partner staying at this hotel. My partner and I were on a cross-country return trip home after the holidays and Vegas just happened to be on the way and he had never been there so we decided why not. I booked a room via priceline and it happened to be here (I did not get an extraordinary deal, perhaps only saving about 10 bucks based on their website rates). After braving the traffic and holding off the road rage (two combat veterans driving) for our 30 min travel time from freeway exit we made it to the self park and found a spot right away. We checked into the hotel and used the ""20 dollar trick"" for a room upgrade. The gentleman behind the counter was very helpful and most a bilging. We ended up with a room over at the Encore on the 29th floor overlooking part of the strip. The room was very nice but not the nicest I have stayed in. I would rate the overall room quality and attention to detail at about 4.5 stars. There was also some issues with the technology in the room but we were able to work around it. As mentioned in other reviews be warned that there are several night clubs on the properties and you will potentially here bass and noise coming from them till 4AM as I did. I was able to get to sleep however, it was certainly annoying. I am certain if I asked to be moved I would have been. Just inquire about this when you check in. Overall the staff was very friendly, helpful, and professional. I am not a big fan of all these extra fees associated with staying somewhere like this but I can certainly understand that this is a business associated with nickel and dimeing your customers.

First, we had a reservation at the Wynn, they stuck us at the Encore when someone in our party with a broken foot had to then walk back and forth to the Wynn for meetings all day. Our room was next to loud hooligans and they took 5 phone calls and 24 hours to even mention moving out room. Let alone, they did nothing to quiet down the neighbor room, they just let them party like this place is the Quad or the Imperial Palace. 

On top of that, we reserved a premium cabana at the Wynn 4 months ago for this trip. Upon checking, they said Steve Wynn took your cabana, but here is a small one at full price. No comps, no cares, no acknowledgement that 4 months of planning had been washed down the tubes because Steve Wynn said so. This despite us spending thousands of dollar at this place year after year.

On check out, they tried to charge is a rate higher than we signed for.

Steve Wynn, I hope you hear this. Your hotel\/resort used to be a place of wonder and delight. But now, your attention to detail and care for you patrons has fallen the wayside. You no longer care for those visiting your establishment and it shows through your staff how they address customer concerns. 

Every time I'm on hold on our phone system, I hear you talk of making sure the customer has an experience like no other. Well it happened in his trip.  

Steve, if you are ok with this, do nothing and I'm am sure you will see revenues and occupancy rates drop. I won't stay here if I don't have to. I will never recommend your hotel.

Service is excellent and the rooms are incredibly spacious. If I had to knock them for something, I think the beds (in two bed rooms) are full size when they could be queens. We had a great view of the golf course which has unrealistically green grass! We also got a room on a non-smoking floor (without even asking) which was a big plus. Apparently the gym (included in the resort fee) is also amazing, but of course I conveniently ""forgot"" my gym clothes.

I visited in July this year.  It was a fantastic deal that they have in the summer time and I finally had a chance to use it.  First, I requested early check-in, now I understand that sometimes things don't quite work out.  I was limping because of an injury at cross fit.  I asked the manager directing check-in traffic, if they had a ice pack at the shop.  He didn't think so but I could walk to CVS and get one.  It was pretty clear I wasn't going to be walking anywhere.  Then they had a room ready.   Strangely when I got off the elevator there was a room with an ice machine.  All I needed was a towel or the plastic bag supplied in the ice bucket and there I had an ice pack.  I didn't have to walk to CVS.   I had requested non-smoking.  It was a smoking floor and room.  It stank when I got off the elevator.  I'm an ex-smoker who's husband died of lung cancer and they're putting me in a smoking room.  When I complained they couldn't move me until the next day, they did offer to spray perfume in the room.

I, frankly, was upset and hoped that they would do something.  They did - they discounted the ""resort fee"".  About $70 and he told me to contact him when I next came to Las Vegas.  I have emailed a Mr. Danny Min.  But he has yet to respond.  A bit disappointing.

I like it for several reasons:  1) their buffet (enough said).  PARKING:  if you drive, it is an EASY walk from your car to the hotel.  I hate Cesar's and Bellagio where it is literally a maze through parking and the casino to get to your room. LOCATION: you can easily walk to Palazzo\/Venetian and Fashion mall via the esplanade.  

ETC: The rooms are spacious and clean.  The elevators are fast. Their shampoo and lotions smell divine (a clean vanilla\/coconut). Front desk staff are quick and helpful (concierge has helped me with everything from tickets, dinner reservations, extra towels...)

I also like how the people in here aren't all hot messes at night. Sure you will still see escorts and the like on the floor at 2 am, but I don't have to constantly deal with the obnoxious, drunken groups in other hotels.  That was cool when I was 21, but I actually like to relax and will definitely be asleep at night and not throwing hotel pre\/post\/whatever parties in my room.

Note that wifi is included in your resort fee and it was steady and fast the whole time.  They have a great gym that you can also use and a spa which I have never been in.  They have 3 pools. For some reason they were filling the pools up with water for the majority of one day. That was kind of inconvenient, but then I was thinking maybe there was gross stuff in the pool, so that's cool they decided to clean it up!

The minute you walk in you notice a lot of detail that was put into the decor of the place.  Flowers surround the inside near the registration desk, and the casino floor has a floral red look to the carpet design.  The inside of the casino does not smell like smoke (surprisingly).  I have no idea what they are doing to avoid the smokey smell most casinos have but that is a big plus.  

Now on the to the few low points of my stay: When I arrived, I promptly checked in.  However, the front desk indicated to me my room suite would be in the Encore hotel (part of the Wynn) and directed me and my party to follow the signs to where it would lead.  About 10 minutes of walking lead me to a floor where my room was supposed to be.  The problem with that is my room was no where on the floor.  A passing hotel associate assisted us for a second, and then told us to check in downstairs where another check in desk was located at the Encore.  After this run around, we were told our room was not in Encore but inside the Wynn hotel itself.  Back to another 10 minute walk...by the time we arrived into our suite we were pretty annoyed at all of what happened.  I also noticed there was only one bed for a party of 3.  I am pretty sure I checked the option for 2 beds...another mistake.  I called the front desk and they told me they could switch me rooms free of charge the next day at the soonest.  Okay I thought...so far a few points deducted.
However, they were willing to make amends.

That next day we were changed out to another room.  Much better view of the strip outside the window, and that second bed was there.  The rooms itself were very spacious and clean.  Flat LCD screen tvs in the room, and a mini tv in the bathroom in case you want to keep yourself occupied to a show while prepping up for the day.  The showers were pretty spacious and the room also came with a bath tub.  High water pressure in the shower and sinks were nice, and the strong flush on the toilet was also a plus.  The beds were nice and comfy to lay on with very soft pillows to sink your head on.  Easy to rest and fall asleep.  The curtains and sheers of the room, along with the lights are powered by buttons located next to the bed and the side wall near the entrance of the room...I thought that was neat you didn't have to physically do more then button pushing to get everything turned on in the room.  They also have a digital push button screen on the inside to set your room status on the outside door to ""privacy please, or service room,"" which I thought was another cool thing.  

A couple more cons on some things I noticed.  Considering the Wynn has a big time club in XS and Blush, you would think that hotel guests would get a free pass in or at least a discounted price to get in. Not the case.  I called the nightclub itself to Blush and I was told general admission for Blush is $40 even for hotel guests.  That is pretty lame considering its not cheap to stay at the Wynn to begin with...

The lady told me I was supposed to be there the night before, so I would be charged for that night. I told her she was mistaken, that my reservations were changed prior to my arrival. She gave me a bitchy look and told me she would have to call someone. She got the approval she needed, but made me sign for the night I wasn't there, then she had to deduct it. I expressed my concern to sign for something. I questioned, what if I ended up getting charged for what I just signed. She gave me that bitchy look again, and got her manager to come explain it to me, and showed me where that date was zeroed out. She could have shown that to me herself, but she chose to be a female dog.
We got to our room on the 26th floor. Great view of the strip and Treasure Island boats, but there was just a King bed. I made reservations for two queens. So I called the front desk, and explained that we wanted two beds. They easily changed us to a room on the 25th floor by changing our keys electronically, so we went down a level to our new room with two beds, but unfortunately, just a view of the golf course, still a nice view.
The room was nice. House keeping staff was very nice. The elevators were fast. The lobby area and common areas were beautiful. The over the top dollar shopping area was ridiculous.

For a while, I was going to every hotel as soon as it opened. Most of them were on the south end of the strip so when the Wynn opened I was worried about the location and its vicinity to everything I knew. About 15 seconds in my room cured me of that right quick.

While I usually don't care much about a room I'm hardly going to be in, I love everything about the Wynn rooms. From the personalized messages on the flatscreen TV to the floor-to-ceiling remote controlled drapes to the giant jacuzzi tub to the telephone in the commode. But my favorite feature of the Wynn is by far the bed. I love the Wynn beds so much I ended up buying one for myself at home. I almost feel jilted by no longer getting that initial ""aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh"" moment when I lie on a Wynn bed at the hotel, but it's only because I get that moment every single day now!

I've been to the buffet (called The Buffet) several times, but usually only out of sheer convenience. I actually prefer the Dishes buffet across the street at Treasure Island. One of the less expensive sit-down options is Sugar and Ice which I've been to and enjoyed. I had one meal at Okada but that was much more for the novelty of it all and generally out of my price range.

I enjoy walking the shopping concourse ogling all the expensive shoes and clothes I could never afford even if I did have someplace to wear them. I've found myself in the Wynn LVNV store more often than I would like, purchasing all sorts of fancy new accessories to go with my fancy new bed.

The Wynn really hit a high in terms of service and attentiveness, and I travel a lot and have stayed at the Ritz Carlton many times. The Wynn blows every other hotel away.

The hotel itself is beautiful, tons of expensive fresh flower displays, ridiculous designer fashion stores, amazing restaurants, the best pool on the strip. Really the Wynn has it all. I got a great rate here on expedia.com including a $75 resort credit that actually went a long way.

I recommend you eat lunch outdoors at the Country Club, and try Sinatra at the Encore. The encore and wynn are connected by a convenient hallway.

The most amazing thing about the rooms is their standard rooms are HUUUUGE. The bed is so comfortable, the views outstanding. The curtains block out ALL light..and we are talking vegas. The room becomes pitch black if you wish it to. The room has NO outside noise at all. Dead quiet if you want it to, or the air conditioning has a fan that can add white noise.

The room has a large flat screen TV.

The bathroom has a TV in it, a separate deep tub, a spacious shower with convenient shelf..and two sinks. The toilet area is enormous with a phone inside it. The entryway was a huge full length mirror..the closet space is gigantic.
The only downside is there is no coffee in the room, the fridge can not be used for personal items.

The casino itself is the classiest on the strip. The Wynn and Encore have some great nightclubs, lounges and bars. The buffet is really delicious, I had the breakfast Buffet.

And one of my favorite things was the pool..so relaxing, you can get a beer brought straight to your chair. The water is a perfect temperature. Such amazing ambiance.

So my friends and I went for Memorial Day weekend and staying at the Wynn was one of the best choices that we made for the whole trip. It didn't feel overly crowded like the rest of the hotels of the Strip. I felt like returning to our hotel was like coming to a sanctuary from the craziness that is Vegas on Memorial Day weekend. 

One of the best things about the Wynn is the location. I prefer staying on this side of the Strip already but then Wynn is directly across from a mall with a food court, close enough to Lavo brunch, and easy access to clubs like XS. Like I mentioned before, it also feels like less crowded than other parts\/hotels on the Strip which really allows to have a fun Vegas experience and a relaxing one at the same time.

While the room is nice, it is small. If you get a double, the beds are fulls. That is slightly disappointing... especially for Vegas. I just wanna starfish out on a queen bed when I'm away for the weekend. It's smaller than places like the Palazzo... which makes it lose 0.5 stars. The automated remote control lights and curtains were probably the coolest part of the room.

The other 0.5 stars comes from the service. While my room had great service, the other half of our group did not. We were two groups arriving at different times. We were told we could get rooms on the same floor and when we didn't, the front desk was pretty rude to the other group about it. They also were not as accommodating to our friends as they were to us (like with towels and any questions we had for the concierge). On the other hand, the front desk was extremely nice to us and made sure  that everything that we needed was taken care of. It was odd to see both sides of the spectrum but I thought it was worth mentioning when I saw how upset it made our friends.

I would come back to the Wynn. Maybe I'll check out the Encore next. I genuinely like what they have to offer.

It has always been a dream of mine to stay here, and I was finally able to make it work with the help of Laura in the reservations department. She was absolutely an angel before, during and after my stay. 
The first time I called, I explained to her how I was a student and I wasn't sure if I would be able to book but if she could give me the best rate. She gave me a jaw-dropping rate. I called back a few times after I booked to inquire about shows and places to eat dinner etc. Each time, she spent many minutes walking me through prices and options.
When I checked in, I was in awe at how incredible the hotel was. At check in, Martin offered an upgrade! Laura had pre-determined a wonderful room for me, and I was greeted with a personal ""Happy Anniversary"" card and chocolates from Laura! Before her shift was over, she called us to see if we were happy with everything and to wish us a happy anniversary. 
Thanks to Laura, we also got to see Le Reve and eat at Lakeside.
Chef Paul was ao humble and far exceeded our expectations with the menu he had put together just for our anniversary. 

We did leave the hotel a handful of times to go look at other famous Las Vegas Hotels, and each time we found ourselves missing our hotel at the Wynn and running back!

Arrived at 11am, and we were given access to our room straight away. They offered us an upgrade for a panoramic top floor room for $25 a night (which we later got reimbursed via the red club host)
The room was a little bit smaller than I expected based on other hotels I've stayed in, but the view made up for it - it was amazing. I loved the fact you could open and close the curtains from the bed too.
The bed was so comfy, could have slept all weekend. I never noticed any sound on the Friday night, but on the Saturday night there was a lot of bass sound coming from what  I believe was the night club, even though we were on the 58th floor, but I eventually fell asleep so it wasn't a problem.
The bathroom was very clean, I think they may need to get some new towels though, some were super white and some were going a bit grey. The toiletries were really ncie too.
The snacks and drinks in the room were super pricey - I so wanted the swedish fish but couldnt justify paying $8, instead I went to walgreens and got a big bag for $3
All the staff we encountered during our stay were extremely helpful and very friendly.
We signed up for the red card and spent a lot of time (and money) in the casino, hence the free room upgrades and we also got free buffets too. The drink servers in the casino were also super nice and circulated a lot, so you never went thirsty.

Location wise you are a bit further down the strip from a lot of the action, but it is nice to take a walk up\/down the strip. Yes we walked the 3.3 miles to the Vegas sign one day!!
On check out there was a small error with our bill, but when I brought it to their attention it was rectified immediately.

The room we were in at the Wynn didn't have as big of a wow factor right when we walked in.

The garden display in the lobby is nice, flowers are all real incase you were wondering.

I wanted to just sit back and relax but had to think about being charged for everything.

The pool was gorgeous though. I didnt get to go to EBC but that will definitely be on my list for next time.

For an additional $35 bucks I scored a kick ass Suite with a King bed soft as the day is long filled with real down pillows and comforter. It also included an amazing view of the strip and view of the waterfalls out front. 



Is it just me or has the traffic slowed down in Vegas? THe slots and blackjack tables were awfully tight and after dropping $100 I gave up. The room service was excellent and please do remember to leave them daily tips for their service which restores your room beautifully.  Aka: Don't be cheap. 

I booked this room a month ago on www.bookings.com and it came with a daily resort credit of $25. Best price and availability compared to booking directly with the hotel.  Just sayin...

Parking: Free self-parking or $18 per day and is prompt.  ZERO in-room coffee pots. That part drove me nuts but maybe it's a safety hazard? I don't know...

Stayed in a deluxe king suite and paid $1020 for two nights. Rates were higher due to the David Guetta's in house concert.  It was well worth it and is to date the most I've ever paid for a room. Money well spent. Ice machine and elevator located just 3 doors down the hall. 

Tip: Room service adds a non-negotiable 8% gratuity tip to your bill.  Poor form as I was going to tip. Yet the pasta primavera was delicious and served with fresh bread and whipped butter for $22. Love this quality hotel!",7,2,5

The room is stunning with floor to ceiling windows and decorative mirrors. The shades are drawn by buttons in the middle console next to the beds.

The room is amazing.

Downstairs there are several late dining facilities and stores that open till midnight and serve drinks like mimosas and sparkling wine while you peruse the products. I get giddy just thinking about how nice it was. 

The staff and promoters here were also very helpful. Being guests there we had instant access to the club, which opens up onto their outdoor waterfall. While the music was subpar which I find with many Vegas clubs the view was fabulous and the drinks were good.

While waiting for the papers on my new house to close, I found myself homeless and in need of lodging for over two weeks.  During that period, I burned through every low-end hotel in Vegas, trying to save a buck.  After suffering thru the indignities of the Artisan, Terrible's, the Gold Coast and even the Oasis (out in Mesquite), I ended up here at the Wynn for a couple nights of luxurious reprieve.  It was fabulous!  Magnificent view (floor-to-ceiling windows in every room), fabulously comfy bed, gorgeously appointed bathroom with full vanity area (us ladies like to have SPACE and LIGHT for our cosmetic ablutions), beautiful pool and grounds, great restaurants.  Every tiny little detail is in place, down to the most miniscule.  Definitely a classy place, and enjoyable even for a die-hard anti-snob like me.
My only beefs: 
1. the restaurants are ALWAYS booked full until around 10pm, unless you happen to impersonate a high roller, in which case they mysteriously find a table for you (I may have resorted to petty subterfuge, I admit).
2. I accidentally left my Sonicare toothbrush in the room after checking out, and it was never returned, even though I called Hotel Security repeatedly over the next few days.  What kind of housekeeper wants somone's old toothbrush?!?!  Gross!!!
3. There are an inordiante amount of stuck up nouveau-riche poseurs here... which depending on one's mood can be fascinating, amusing...or irritating.  Caveat Emptor!
But all that being said, I've lived in Vegas and loitered on the Strip for 10 years now, and this is without question the nicest hotel.  The attention to detail is breathtaking.  All the plants are real (unlike the Palazzo, with its cheeseball atrium full of plastic shit), everything is immaculate, and service is nothing short of amazing.

Labor Day 2011

The family and I stayed at the Wynn this year for our Labor Day outing.  Was really looking forward to the Wynn since I've recently stayed at Aria and the Four Seasons Vegas...  With those stays fresh in my mind, I was looking forward to comparing them to the Wynn.

Check-in was efficient and friendly.  The girl behind the counter managed to put our parties on the same floor.  A.

I didn't gamble since we had the kids but the Casino looked plush and didn't smell of smoke.  A-.  You do not have to get lost through the Casino before reaching the room elevators like some other establishments.  A.

We only ate at The Cafe and it was just average.  C+ Jean Fillip's in Aria is way better in comparison.

The pool area was outstanding.  Large and plenty of seating.  The kids loved spending a day there.  Drink services were prompt and friendly.  A+

The hotel is ultra high end but I did have a few grips.

When the Wynn was the Desert Inn, and the Rat Pack was playing the Sands.  No high-rises.  People dressed for dinner and looked sharp for the casinos; the lounge acts were cool, no lines, no all-you-can eat buffets, no huge, fat people or oxygen breathers on their chair scooters.  No bling!  Just elegance.

The Wynn epitomizes today's Vegas.  What you see on The Strip is what you used to see downtown.  ANYBODY can get in, and they do.  The public areas are tacky and loud, ditto for the rooms, though they are well-appointed and spacious.  This is franchise luxury. (The Sinatra Restaurant at the adjoining Encore has Chicken Saltimbocca -- chicken???  Old Blue Eyes is spinning in his grave.)

My suite was equipped with a king sized bed that was very comfortable. I'm not a fan of down pillows, but there were plenty to spare. The overall size of the suite had to be around 600 square feet, making it as large as some garden apartments. It was divided into three areas: The entrance and hall way with a closet which included a massive bathroom. The bathroom had a separate stall with a door for the toilet, a standup shower, a deep tub and dual sinks with a very large mirror.

Moving into the living area was a large bureau that held a fridge, snacks and information books as well as lamps. In front of the bed, built into the divider wall was a generous chest of drawers. 

The third 'area' was the office\/lounge which was equipped with a desk and phone, writing pads, a large LCD TV and a chaise lounge with foot rest. The floor-to-ceiling glass window gave a nice view of the city and desert and mountains beyond. There were electrically actuated sheer curtains and blinds operated by a bedside control. It was a very comfortable place to hang out.

I ordered room service on three occasions and breakfast was delivered within the time frame promised by a very courteous employee. It was quite expensive. Be prepared to pay between $40-50 for breakfast whether you dine in or go to one of the dedicated restaurants. 

The hotel has a number of restaurants which all served very good food, including Jardin which served a mix of Americana and a Japanese noodle restaurant which never disappointed.

Also, it appears that properties located in the middle and south of the strip  (e.g. Bellagio, Caesar's) were more family-friendly, both inside and outside, than the northerly Wynn.

== Location ==
Wynn is on the northern end of the strip. I haven't visited Vegas enough to be an authority on the matter, but the areas further south seemed quite a bit nicer, more family-friendly in a tourist-y kind of way, and less seedy. It's also far enough north to require a long walk or drive to get anywhere else other than the Palazzo or Venetian. My wife and I are in our 30s and able-bodied, but would've preferred to be closer to the heart of the strip even so.

== The Room ==
We stayed in a ""Deluxe Resort King"" room that had a nice view of the Strip (specifically, Palazzo, Trump, Mirage, and Treasure Island). The room's finishes and fixtures were very nice and elegant. The bathroom was particularly lovely, complete with double sinks, spacious shower stall, and large bathtub. There were a few surprising omissions that I've come to expect from hotels of this rating\/price range:

1) No mini-fridge. How are you supposed to keep the exorbitantly-priced minibar beverages cold?
2) No in-room facilities for brewing coffee\/tea. 
3) Very few power outlets. There were a few by the desk, but its nice to have one or two by the nightstand(s) so guests can keep their mobile devices within reach of the bed while charging.

One other observation I made was that the wall art in our room, which has a semi-gloss surface, had some sort of spatter all over it. A minor grievance, but unsightly and a little gross all the same.

== The Casino ==
I'm not much of a gambler. In fact, I only spent about three minutes gambling during my two-night stay, and it wasn't at Wynn. Still, I walked around and through the casino section of Wynn enough to get a bit of a feel for it, and I will say that the gambling floor looked well appointed and maintained. It's smoky in there, but that's pretty much universal among casinos where smoking is allowed, so I don't count that against Wynn more so than I would anywhere else.

== Restaurants ==
My wife and I eat a vegan diet, which was a big factor in our decision to stay at Wynn. Steve Wynn, the hotel's founder, CEO, and chairman, eats a vegan diet, and makes it a point to have vegan offerings in all of the resort's restaurants. For us, it was nice and convenient knowing that we'd always have dining options nearby. During our stay, we ate at Wazuzu, Jardin, and Costa Di Mare. The food was great across the board. The service at Wazuzu and Jardin was adequate, though we sometimes found ourselves waiting longer than expected. The service at Costa Di Mare was excellent. All of our dining experiences were priced in accordance with what you might expect from a 5-star Las Vegas resort (i.e. expensive).

I'd like to give honorable mention to the buffet staff. We inquired about the vegan options, and they sent out one of the chefs (Malcolm) who gave us a full tour of the buffet line to explain which prepared items were already vegan-friendly and pointed out several items for which we could request a vegan preparation. 

== Other ==
We booked our stay through hotels.com from a listing that was labelled, ""Deluxe Resort King."" Much to our dismay, it was explained to us upon arrival that the ""King"" part of that booking is recorded as a preference and is not guaranteed. And, big shocker, there were no rooms with King beds available in the room tier that we'd booked. This meant that we'd have to take a room with two double beds, or pay more to secure a room in a sightly higher tier with a King bed. This was not at all apparent from the verbiage of the booking and seemed like a dishonest, bait-and-switch-type tactic. I tried to plead my case with the registration clerk, going so far as to reference my booking receipt, pointing out the fact that it said, in plain English, the words ""King Bed."" Unfortunately, they didn't relent. This grievance is the main reason I'm giving Wynn three stars - I don't feel that I can reward an establishment that engages in these kind of practices any higher of a rating, even if it does almost everything else pretty well.

Even without my last grievance, I don't think I'd stay at Wynn again. It's a nice place, but the location isn't all that great, and it didn't do enough to stand apart from its numerous competitors.",3,0,0

The rooms--impeccable and gorgeous, and they really have thought of everything that a guest might need.  I was just a bit disappointed when there was a mixup about whether breakfast was included with our tower king room.  On their website it clearly states that breakfast for two at Tableau was included, and specifically from Nov-Dec that breakfast would be served at Terrace Point Cafe instead. So my husband and I went to Terrace Point cafe for breakfast and ordered off the special menu they gave us when we told them our breakfast was included in the room rate. When we reviewed the hotel bill, we saw that the hotel still charged us for breakfast. I called the front desk to explain the situation; they told me that the website was wrong and breakfast was not included with our room. They put me on hold and then agreed to take off the breakfast charge, saying that the website was still wrong but they had to ""honor it""..... made it sound like I owed them something!

Even though they took off the charge, I was still a bit miffed about how it was handled. I checked the website again today and it still says the same thing--breakfast included with tower king rooms!  It wasn't that big of a deal but we wouldn't have even gone to the cafe for breakfast if the website didn't say that it was included, especially when there are so many other breakfast options in Vegas.

- High quality rooms, rarely discounted, totally not worth the bloated price
- Spotless bathrooms
- Vegan Friendly?  (Not sure)
- NOT Child Friendly....

Why this last point, you might ask.  Sit down, lemme tell you a story:


Sometime in 2010, Steve Wynn became an enlightened vegan, making sure that every restaurant in his casinos would accommodate vegans with one or more superb dishes (garden salads and grilled veggies don't count), making the Wynn a guaranteed destination on our family's twice-a-year Vegas pilgrimage.  We especially craved their ""Pizza Place"" restaurant until, that is, our last visit:  Having shoved our stroller down the scorching strip  ""Sir!  You can't come in with that!"" snapped one of their suited security sentinels.

Sea of heads shifting towards us.   

I felt the sharp feeling of injustice in my gut, like when a hard fought civil right law whose 'truth's we find to be self-evident' is being breached right there in front of you.  Swallowing my pride, I responded to the stroller Nazi saying that ""Bro... we're just going to go to the Pizza Place right smack-dab right next to the entrance [of the mini-mall]""  

Looking at our dehydrated faces, he said ""Well, only if  you JUST go to the restaurant"", eyeing our every move. 

Looking back, I felt cheap in having to convince him.  My moral backbone should have jerked me and my family away from that establishment, filed a case in constitutional court, and won untrammeled rights for strolling parents to go as they please...but our taste buds had the fever for the flavor and had accumulated some indelible, insatiable pizza expectations.  In any case, we entered the mall and dive bombed into the restaurant, noticing a change in the decor, thinking nothing of it, walking to the counter, and ordering my GO DAMN pizza from the same cashier that always recognized us and made us feel comfortable.

""OMG, SORRY, everything is changed"" she said once she recognized us.  My whole family entered a state of shock when we realized that our beloved vegan vegas pizza variety had vanished.  I later found-out, through the grape vine via a local restaurateur, that Steve Wynn recently had a change of heart and wasn't Vegan anymore.  I also learned through TripAdvisor that, the real reason they don't want strollers is because they are eye sores for the elite, the policy coming straight from Mr. Wynn himself.  I read stories of other humiliating stroller denials, one where a wife was held captive outside without a phone, unable to meet her husband who was attending a medical conference in the casino, almost missing their flight before finally getting an exception.  Shame on them!  

I guess shouldn't be too harsh.  I mean, I used to one of those uncompassionate assholes that once thought that the only restaurant parents should take their toddlers to is Chuck E Cheese, getting irritated on a flight if a child started crying, flashing a passive aggressive scowl in the parent's direction on the way off the plane.  But then I had kids and the roles reversed, and now, instead of irritation, I feel compassion for my fellow parents, and their lack of mobility.  They should be able to go anywhere the general public is allowed.  I get it why they can't be on the casino floor, but a mini mall? 

Three stars because this spotless structure does many things right on an aesthetic front, taking you into that warped Vegas-ian massive luxury overdose reality; the casino is posh, shiny, vibrantly colorful, floral and antiseptic in a world that includes so much asymmetry, smudges and shades of grey.   Attention is paid to every detail - if you drop some trash, watch how it takes about 4 minutes before it is picked up.  And I heard from another Yelper that there are still vegan options at the other Wynn restaurants, though I can't confirm this since I never made that far (and I don't think that chap was a vegan himself.)  But subtract two stars because I can't forget that, ultimately, the beauty of the burnished marble Corinthian columns all of a sudden becomes ugly when it coexists with such an ugly policy. You see, you don't gain class by banning parents with strollers - you lose it.",3,2,1

The buffet here is good (watch out for the bottomless mimosas in the morning...dangerous!), and I enjoyed Tryst as well...probably my favorite club in Vegas thus far.

From plush flowers.... EVERYWHERE..... to some of the best restaurants (especially Asian..... of all sorts...

I know I just made that up.... but seriously.... soooo ultra-cool... soooo UC!!)

One of the things I especially love about this is the hotel floor design. The place never seems to reach the level of chaotic frenzy on crazy check-in\/out times. Yes there are times when it fills up like any other place, but it always seems to move, and nobody really complains like they do at Paris, MGM, or Bellagio, where the check-in line crashes with the main entrance so it always feels like a zoo... but with more smelly people.

While the hotel has a couple of great clubs (XS and Tryst), it doesn't have the feel of 24\/7 frenziness that, say, Cosmopolitan has (don't get me wrong, I love the Cosmo too..... but that place is a boner factory).

Et cette barre, le Wynn ne la fait même pas trembler :
- c'est un casino : peut-être faut-il le rappeler, tous les hôtels de Vegas ne comportent pas de casino, il n'y a donc pas de fatalité à devoir traverser un hall enfumé, bruyant et clignotant pour accéder à sa chambre !
- conséquence aussi, le bling-bling est partout dans les parties communes, avec les magasins de luxe (sans clients, d'ailleurs : sont-ils là seulement pour ajouter du prestige à l'endroit ?) et la déco over the top
- les chambres sont dans les inévitables tons crème, beige... beurk
- le WiFi est payant, 15 dollars par jour, bonjour l'arnaque
- c'est absolument immense, à tel point qu'on vous remet un plan au check-in, et malgré ça vous vous perdrez !

Pour compenser, on a les avantages de la taille, notamment de nombreux bars et restaurants, et des économies d'échelle et des revenus du jeu qui font que la nuitée n'est pas très chère au vu du standing de l'hôtel. L'ensemble est relativement récent (2005) donc ça ne fait pas décrépi. D'ailleurs, esthétiquement, le bâtiment vu de l'extérieur, avec son faux jumeau le Encore juste à côté, est peut-être le plus beau de tout Vegas.

Le service est super pro, que ce soit en chambre, à la réception, dans les bars... ce à quoi on s'attend.

J'ai eu une chambre ""accessible"", c'est-à-dire adaptée aux handicapés, car il ne restait plus que ça lorsque je suis arrivé. Ça n'est pas un inconvénient, au contraire, puisque les lieux étaient je pense plus grands que la moyenne. On peut saluer les efforts faits pour le confort des handicapés, avec un système de treuil et de rail au plafond pour transporter les personnes entre lit, toilettes, douche et baignoire.

Pour résumer, un hôtel parfaitement adapté à la clientèle américaine venant s'encanailler dans la capitale du vice, mais, pour le même prix, il y a plus agréable et (beaucoup) plus classe.",0,0,0

We had a basic room with two queen beds on the 19th floor.  Luckily when we arrived at 11 a.m. we had a room available so we could check in early.  Thankfully, I had not paid additional for guaranteed early check in.  The room was gorgeous, with a spectacular view.  Lights, draperies, are all automated with push-button service, which was pretty cool.  I like that the lights had settings for high, medium, and low.  The room was spacious, and extremely clean and fresh.  The sheers of the draperies seemed as if they had been freshly cleaned.  There was a deep soaking tub, and a glass-enclosed shower, with large plush bath towels.  The toilet area had a door for privacy.  The entire room sort of exuded elegance in look and feel.  The queen beds was plush with thick duvets, and very, very comfortable. 

There was mini bar with snacks, but with a note that if any item was removed for longer than 30 seconds the amount would be charged to the room.  We didn't TOUCH any of those!  

Note:  No coffee maker.  You have to go down to the coffee shop in the hotel if you want coffee in the morning, or pay a ridiculous amount to have coffee brought up via room service.  

We didn't gamble, but the casino seemed nice, non-smokey, not all that crowded.  

The grounds and facilities are lovely, the decorations gorgeous, and there was eye-candy everywhere.  There is a waterfall and lagoon that we stumbled upon accidentally, and discovered a viewing terrace above where they have tables for eating, which ended up being better anyway.  We had champagne and watched the colored lights of the lagoon and waterfall at night, with a special light show every, I think, half hour.  

The buffet was good, but too expensive, with a long wait.

I was instructed to contact them again for another visit. Not sure if and when that will happen especially after the catalyst of issues I endured during this visit. Funny as when I was there, I had asked if I could stay longer as I wanted to experience all the hotel had to offer and I was told no, if I wanted to stay I would have to give up my reservation and stay in the Encore section of the resort and I would have to pay those rates vs just charging me for an additional night in the room I already had a reservation for. I felt that also to be rude and making no sense. However, should I do so, I will post another review based on that visit.

I made reservation online and paid with company credit card a month in advance, I then called a week prior and asked about check in and payment etc, I told them I would not be traveling with the card and was told not to worry everything would be fine. On the day before arrival I called again, same thing. 

On the day of, I called and informed them I was stuck in traffic due to a fire and that the roadway was blocked so my check-in would be later than expected. They told me no problem. Let's fast forward to the time I finally arrived. I proceed to the check in area and they are directing people which lines to go into. It takes 45 minutes to get to the desk, but I'm finally called up and the person who assists me seems nice, he then asks for my ID and then the credit card used to pay for the room. I tell him that is its a company card and I called the day prior and a week ago and was told this wasn't going to be a problem. He then says they need the card or they need to call my company and get an authorization as well as contact the banking establishment for the card. 

I ask if there is anyway to simply use my personal card for the incidentals rather than waiting unnecessarily seeing I had been traveling for nearly 8 hours and was exhausted. I was told no, that I could not use my personal card. I ask how long it will take and I'm told 10 minutes. I call my employer and get them on the phone and explain what has happened, they ask what information the Wynn needs and where they can email the forms and they will send them right back. I'm asked to step aside and have a seat and they will come get me. 

After the 10 minutes goes by, I ask if they have received the information and am told they haven't started yet, they are busy. My employer calls and asks if everything is okay as they have not sent anything yet. I'm advised to just place everything on my personal card and I will get reimbursed. Another 45 minutes goes by and they say they are checking, another 15 minutes goes by and finally they say they have everything that the need, but due to the time my original room was no longer available. I'm then asked to wait in another line so they can check me in. 

When I tell the second agent that the first person an hour ago said he checked me in to secure my room and was simply waiting for authorization; he apologized and stated that he never checked me in according to the screen. So we start the process all over again. So by the time they check me into my room a second time we are now two hours into sitting around simply trying to get a prepaid room. 

The entire check in process was ridiculous and they did not have sufficient staffing at the desks. The fact that no one was really forthcoming with an apology or being understanding of the situation worsened by the minute as I continued to be ignored. Not the type of experience one would expect from the Wynn or any Luxury Hotel for that matter. In fact the most friendliest person was the gentleman at the tower elevators as he was kind enough to get me proper directions to my room. 

Now the room, was absolutely stunning with plenty of space. Lovely bathroom and probably one of the best sleep I've had in a hotel bed; it was like sleeping on a cloud. The automatic curtains had some technical difficulties opening and closing without human intervention, but aside from that the room was flawless. Be prepared to be pampered, as Wynn uses Molton Brown products, just brilliant as I use these products at home. There was a tv in the bathroom though mine did not work. Either the temperatures are regulated in the room or mine simply had a glitch or Wynn only has a 2 degree variance you can adjust as I could not get the room warmer than 74 degrees even though I kept pushing the thermostat for a higher setting to get the room warmer. The room was excellently cleaned which is a big deal for me. The hotel charges a heft resort fee daily, one would think with the absorbent fees that the curtains and heat would work flawlessly, but I digress.

Before going in I stop for a second to say hi to the doorman, Ryan, I met him the other day when I went to the sane club 2 nights previous, he was also a nice guy but that's where the niceness stops. So I'm at my table now, I spend 600 dollars on a bottle of vodka and my friend I are having a good time..DJ spider is up on stage doing his thing, working the crowd and mixing an amazing run of tracks!! My friend and I invite this couple up ( Andrew and Jessica) to help us drink all this vodka, we start talking cars and nightlife in Vegas just normal stuff and then we realize...there's no more vodka!!! Let's buy a bottle of Rum, so I drop another 600 dollars on that. The bottle comes and we start drinking and dancing some more. I'm now successfully drunk and getting tired..but the nice thing is that I have a table..my own little area so I sit down and fall asleep, now usually sleeping in a club is a no no, but I have a table and my own area, I should be able to close my eyes for a second, I mean by this time it's only 1:30 in the morning and the club stays open till 5. I still have a good three hours to party. So, I'm awoken by 2 security guards that tell me I have to leave, I say, ""no, I paid a lot of money to sit here and plus I just but this basically full bottle of Rum"". They picked me up forcefully and started pushing me out, I'm resisting a bit but what they did next was way out of line! They handcuffed me, took me to some long hallway where there was no one, pushed me on the ground and against the wall and basically manhandled me, I said, ""you guys want to beat me up while I'm handcuffed? Take them off and let's do this! Let's make this a fair fight, so first I'm gonna beat you up (I point at one of the 3 security guards there..the one that was the most forceful and aggressive with me) then you, and you over there..I guess you'll end up in the ICU!"" now on retrospect I know I shouldn't of said that but I was drunk and just got beat up by three guys in an unfair fight. The first guy I pointed at said, ""how about I put you on the VIP list at Drais and I'll meet you there when I get off""...""Sounds good to me!!"" he took out his phone and put me on there and said..""see you there"" they then took me to some door, to off the handcuffs and pushed me out on to the sidewalk. So to sum up things, they basically kicked me out of the club but decided to beat me up first. Thanks tryst! In the morning I woke up with bumps all over my head from where it hit the wall and ground, a black eye, a big bruise on my face, and handcuff bruises because they were on so tight. Basically I wouldn't recommend this place",1,3,0

Previously I felt like they genuinely cared that I was being treated well and I never felt like the $ was coming before me (even though of course I realize it does). But now it felt like they were trying to squeeze every little cent out of me and the experience I had wasn't as nice. They're even charging $13 to valet (when it was free before, except of course the tip). I hardly seen any waitresses coming around to see if I wanted a drink while I was gambling on the slots, they seemed to only focus on the gaming tables. And I'm not sure if it was just me, or the day I was there, there seemed to be less staff in general. I was hard pressed to find someone to ask a question, unlike previously.

I will do a separate review on the buffet that may be the only somewhat negative point. We stayed on fifty some floor, almost the very top. Honestly, it's in my opinion one of the best hotels on the strip if not the best. Though I do enjoy touring other hotels because they each have a theme and I enjoy that. What sets this hotel apart from it's little sister Encore, is the room set up. Other than that, really the 2 hotels are quite similar. But I will tell you that the room set up does matter. You have 2 main options in the Encore. You can either have a double bed not facing the window view or you can have a king bed facing the window with these large pillars that partially block the outside view. They separate the living room and bedroom. Even though Encore is a slightly bigger room at 750 Sq ft versus 700 at Wynn, it feels smaller because of the layout when you either have a 2nd bed you don't need or have that dang pillar. At Wynn you get the king bed facing the strip, without a pillar, perfect! Also at Encore on the 30 some floor there was some locked machine room that made noise all night long, that's the reason for switching to the lovely Wynn. Another reason Encore left a bad taste in our mouth. I do like that both Wynn & Encore offer such huge windows, the Trumps aren't small by any means, but there is definitely something at Trumps that blocks them a bit, I think the pillar is thicker and bottom is covered by the couch.",4,3,2

For example, upon entering you press a button to open drapes...it sounds silly but it's so cool!  Then the beautiful view of the strip laid before us.

The pool, although clean and serene, was nothing spectacular and I was a little annoyed how long it took to get waited on for a drink (I ended up just going to the bar myself), but at the same time the ""calm"" pool was adequately separated from the more ""party"" pool at the other end which I appreciated.

Gym facilities were also very spacious with plenty of machines, water, and fruit.

I also really loved ""The Buffet"", one of my new favorites of Vegas.  Tons of delicious seafood and asian pieces.  My favorite was the pancake bar!  Definitely make sure you try some with the strawberry sauce and fresh cream.

For those who want a more calming experience with less crazy people and willing to spend more, stay here.  I personally would stay at a place with a little more to do and less pricey like the Venetian or Caesars Palace, but I can't complain.",2,0,1

First off, the staff is VERY friendly. Especially the guy who brought my girlfriend and I breakfast every morning. He asked how my stay was while he set the little table in the room. This guy had experience. From his movements to his small talk, he knew ""service."" 

Second, the fine dining is great. Alex is a terrific CLASSY and EXPENSIVE restaurant. Yet, the Wynn has one all-night diner but its menu becomes severely limited late at night. It sucked. So, their fine dining is great, but their drunk munchies blow. 

Third, the cocktail waitresses are hot! 'Nuff said. If you're playin' slots, they'll come by and serve it up. They came by a few times, but not a TON.

Fourth, we saw La Reve - a phenomenal show - at the Wynn. I highly recommend it.

Now the Wynn's rewards program is not one you want to join unless you're a high roller.  I don't mean a couple of thousand in your pocket.  When I saw the review of the guy that said he dropped six bills (a.k.a. $600), that's nothing.  Remember the guy in the phone commercial calling his wife?  ""Yeah, I lost about $5800.  But that's like $5 here."" Exactly.  $600 is like $0.60.  So if you're thinking that you're going to get a pack of cigarettes or free buffet, dream on bucko.

Now the gambling.  The gambling here is great.  Why you ask?  Well, granted, the table minimums start at $25.  Those are like the $5 minimums at places like the Gold Coast or other local joints.  I like it for several reasons:

1.  Rookies don't come here.  Not too much trash talking at a table.

2.  It just doesn't get as crowded.  Want to roll craps on a $50 minimum table?  It REALLY gets your blood up.  I haven't had that sort of rush since I jumped out of an airplane.

3.  The Pai Gow table isn't loaded with scruffy Asians looking to extended their dollars for as long as possible.  These folks actually play the game.

4.  Baccarat isn't just a $10 game here - add a couple of zeros and you have your typical bets.

Oh, and yes, the buffet is great - even my brother, a consummate local, likes this one above all others.  The Chinese restaurant there isn't bad either.",2,0,3

First, let me say that if you are vegan and going to be in Las Vegas, do yourself a favor and stay at the Wynn. Every restaurant inside of Wynn has a vegan menu. Their room service menu las lots of amazing vegan options such as a Wynn happy meal (great for adults and kids!). I get this vegan cheeseburger meal every time I stay there. Comes with a chocolate shake. Nuff said...

Now, if you can afford to splurge a bit, stay at the Tower Suites! As far as suites on the strip go, I think the Tower Suites are quite affordable for what you get. The rooms are MASSIVE. I believe they are 1800-2000 sq ft. Two bathrooms, a giant living room, a massage room, a dining area, etc. You also get a totally separate entry into the hotel from the Tower Suites. It's never busy at this entrance and it goes straight to the elevators. You can avoid the casino completely. 

The restaurants at Wynn are fantastic. My favorite, by far, is the Japanese restaurant called Mizumi. OMG. Their sushi is AMAZING. Service is impeccable. Pricey but worth it. 

The only thing that is absolutely terrible about staying at Wynn are the TV's! Dear lord, please update your system! It is god awful! Otherwise, Steve Wynn put a lot of attention into the details. It's absolutely beautiful there. Other than the Cosmopolitan, I won't stay anywhere else.",1,0,0

A hotel associate was on the floor and helped us out. He tells us the front desk made a mistake and our room was at the Wynn not Encore. So we walk back to Wynn and get to our room. Wynn booked us in a single queen room. We call the desk and they say they can get us a two queen room the next day. 

The room was nice and spacious. Nice flat screen television in the room and another television in the bathroom. Shower was huge. Water warmed up quickly and water pressure was perfect.

4.5 stars!

           Beside the Bellagio, The Four Season, Wynn is our second favorite place to stay. Got a great deal for my parents anniversary, I couldn't pass up the STEAL offer, but come here for the Thanksgiving week with with parents & my broski family.

           A few minor here and there but overall, the food here is amazing (don't go for the buffet), the service was on point, club Tryst & Encore are great, as if you know someone or have a table RSVP.

          Even for the regular suite of 600 SFT, spacious, clean, strip view, and lots of amenity! The pool & jacuzzi are open even though it was 40 degree outside.

         Expect $20 resort charge on top of your rate, even though we didn't use the service: work out, local phone calls, & Internet (extremely slow)!

         1 more thing, not enough Pai-Gow & Blackjack tables in the late evening, & they don't have non-smoking tables as Bellagio!  & the 195 seats race & sport book, nice, but can't compare to the fever feeling at the Bellagio! I'm just saying!",6,4,4

My friend was baller enough to spend enough money at the Wynn Casino that he was offered FREE rooms at the Encore. Well a 9 car accident clogged up the freeway on our way up to Vegas where it took a whopping six hours to get to Vegas! We arrived at the Encore to find that none of the free rooms were available and we were being put in the Wynn. No biggie! We proceeded to put our luggage on the cart but our luggage was lost for a good hour. We had packed all sorts of drinks in our luggage and we started the couple hours of our Vegas trip boozeless. It sucked big time! We were even escorted from the Encore to the Wynn. 

Anyways after getting our mess sorted out, we were put in the Wynn. We had a great view of the golf course and the night lights of Las Vegas! The room was spacey, even though it was kind of boring. We had an end room so we could make as much noise as we wanted without disturbing people.  The phone has the name of the person who booked the room. The Wynn has pretty much everything from shopping to places to eat. Their customer service is top notch as it should be since you're paying a lot of money to stay here. 

The casino is nice and there are a lot of machines with different types of denominations to play in. You can go cheap and place the penny slots (my friend won 35 bucks off a max bet of $1.20) to the more expensive slots. My other friend blew 100 bucks in a matter of 10 minutes at the blackjack tables. I won on Wheel of Fortune with the grand total of $55! I never win! Get their red card so you can accumulate points for rooms, etc. Use your red card when you're in the Wynn and the Encore.",1,1,1

So, I wanted to make my 100th review special. And nothing is more special and ass-kicking than the Wynn Las Vegas.

CHECK IN: We came in on a Wednesday night, and check in was a breeze. We were upgraded to the Tower Suites. The lady was very nice and answered all of our questions. I imagine check in to be more crowded on the weekend, but they do a good job of managing the line.

THE ROOM: The Tower rooms are so awesome, and the staff treats you like royalty. The tower has a private elavator, front desk, and concierege. Oh yeah, don't forget the line pass for the buffet. Upon entering the room, we saw a grand, spacious entry way, and floor to ceiling windows. 

The rooms were large and clean. The bathrooms had 2 sinks, shower, and bathtub. And no need to bring ANY tolietries....they've got everything: all the regular stuff plus toothbrush and paste, shaving cream, razor, shoe polish, cotton balls and swabs, mouthwash, and more. I loved that the shower products and lotion were fairly large bottles compared to most hotels...so bring 'em home in the suitcase!

The beds are very comfortable, and comes with nightly turndown service. They put out slippers and chocolates out for you. Don't forget the HD 42 in. flat screen that you can rotate. I'm a total germaphobe, and this is the only hotel rooms that I'll touch the phone or walk barefoot around...and that's saying A LOT! haha

POOL: The tower suites have their own pool that is above the main pool. I love the pool here because there aren't many kids at all. You can rent a cabana for around 300-400 a day. 

My favorite pool was the ""European Pool"", only for 21+. Women can go topless, but most don't. We only saw a few...and they shouldn't have been topless in the first place. There are day beds and lilly pads available to rent. We opted for a day bed ($150-200) which comes with a round bed that reclines, an umbrella, and all the bottled water you can drink. Diego, the pool boy is so awesome and helpful. The lillypads look cool in theory, but don't look too comfortable.

How do you rent a cabana\/daybed? Try to call as early as possible. They take you name 30 days in advance. Call the pool at 9:00 on the day you want the reservation, and they will tell you if you got it or not. The Wynn has to reserve a lot of them for the players, so you may not get one. But if you do, it is SOOOO worth it.

CASINO: The minums can get pretty high at $50 blackjack and $25 craps. But during the day you can easily find $15 minum BJ and $10 craps. The dealers at the Wynn are the nicest in town. Tip 'em well....don't be a cheap ass.

FOOD: Mr. Wynn knows how to do restaurants. Anything is good, even the buffet.

CLUBS: Tryst is the main one, and Blush is smaller, but still cool. The concierege will put you on the guest list if you ask. Altough pricey (starting at $450), I highly recommend bottle service because the club gets crowded. 



So there ya go. Best service you can get, hands down. A billion times better than the Bellagio (boooo!).",18,11,14

They then send their staff to double check on my insistence who confirmed the same. Not one word of apology from them. Not to mention  it delayed my departure by 25 min

Haha.  This place is definitely a fabulous 5-star hotel, but if you want to stay here and not break the bank, then I suggest going online and bidding for your price.  Even for a AAA Five-Diamond award winner, Mobil Five-Star and Michelin Five-Star hotel, I don't think their ""basic"" rooms are worth the average $250\/night.  Why break the bank for a room that you barely spend time in and then have nothing to spend the rest of the weekend?  

The ""basic"" room at the Wynn is pretty nice, (but not worth $250\/night).  There are coral colored walls with huge flower prints framed in the rooms.  They provide little slippers to wear and lush, Egyptian cotton robes for you in the closet.  The bathroom has a spa\/tub, shower with sitting area, vanity table and chair and a heated lighted makeup mirror.  There's a hair dryer provided, Q-tips, makeup cotton pads, lotion and shampoo\/conditioner.  The soaps are pretty nice, as they're lemongrass scented.  Heyyyy...I think the bath water is chlorinated because no water turns that pretty shade of light blue in the tub.  And you smell kind of chlorine-like and dry when you emerge from the tub.  Hmm.

The bed is not too soft but not too firm.  All of the pillows are down\/or down-like.  The 40-45 inch flat screen TV is mounted on the wall, but can rotate a full 90 degrees so you can watch TV in bed.  There's a small seating area with a velour yellow love seat in the room, and another desk with a fax, phone and ?wi-fi set up.  It's definitely a spacious room.  All the rooms at Wynn have floor to ceiling windows and this is a definite plus!  Make sure to ask for a non-smoking room, and a room higher than Floor 20 for a good view.  I would ask for a golf-course view, since the views facing the Strip\/Fashion Show mall seem more noisy with the huge Ipod commercials blaring through your windows.  

And the rest of the hotel............it's such a beautiful place.  Lots of bright red carpets with butterflies on the ground.  Tons of mosaics on the walls and all the restaurants have thick, textured drapery.  You can tell Wynn has gone one step beyond his Bellagio creation to create a classy establishment.  The shopping area is of course, high end, but the sales associates don't give you any attitude even if you're just in there browsing.  Overall, 4 stars for the Wynn!",1,1,1

The computer system went down as they were issuing keys and we had to wait for three hours. Tried to get a drink - they could only take cash not my card and took my drink out of my hand. Waited around for an hour... Finally went to dinner outside of the hotel to be served. The Wynn finally called at 10:30 pm- as we were being served now we have to hurry through dinner to get back there. Just frustrating! How is this Wynn service. This is an update. The Wynn contacted our party to rectify the problems at check in. They compensated us apologize and satisfied our inconvenience. Have to change the 1 star to four because they actually care and the rest of the stay was very nice.,0,0,0

I love you. You are luxury all the way! You did not disappoint me in any way and this is so very rare...so very, very rare. 

You are beautiful, breathtaking even. Your pool is so stunning is makes my eyes water. My room was gorgeous and I didn't find it to be small at all (as some people have commented). Though I did have a panoramic so maybe the standard rooms are smaller. The bathroom is stunning, STUNNING, the view...amazing, the beds...a dream.

Wynn, I never even left you during my entire stay in Vegas. There was no need to. You have clubs, the finest restaurants, the best spa (the best freaking pedicure I've ever had and I'm a nazi about them too!), the most beautiful casino...etc, etc.!

Ooooh. 

I'm sure every person who's been to Las Vegas wants to compare the Wynn to SOMETHING. But you just can't.  It's a very sumputously rich looking hotel and you'll instantly feel that when you walk into the lobby, that's filled with natural light and beautiful floral arrangements. Although, if you're looking for a themed Vegas hotel, this isn't it.

Some like to stay here for access to their golf course or the shopping esplanade that carry names like Manolo Blahnik, Dior, etc.  and if you think those shops are just chunk change, there's a Ferrari dealership as well. No, really there is!

I stayed here because it's the most luxurious hotel this end of the strip and got to stay for free thanks to KOIT! ;-)  The rooms are large, starting at 650 sq feet with floor to ceiling views of the strip or the golf course.  The rooms are done in a cream palette furnished with deeply comfortable beds in 320 thread count linens, velvety leather sofas and ottomans. The bathroom is bigger than my apartment's kitchen with a deep soaking tub to take a bubble bath in. Their own toiletry line BAMBU, is very lemony and clean smelling. 

The nightclubs are all fantastic: XS, Tryst, Surrender.  Just make sure to dress the part, this is VEGAS!

Also, what's the deal with the TVs? You have to share ONETV between the couch and the bed, ok you can turn it, but really???

When I was there, I got to compare with the Palazzo. I got a much bigger room at the Palazzo, a separate living room, a gigantic couch, 2 TVs that I didn't have to handle and turn.

Very nice rooms, and we got a decent view of the strip but couldn't see the Bellagio fountains or Mirage volcano or anything like that. Not the most upgraded and luxurious room I've ever stayed in, but nice. It wasn't super big but enough room. I would have expected more high end amenities.  I think the bed was a california king as opposed to a typical eastern king, so I wasn't very pleased with that. Housekeeping was good but again not as fast or attentive as I've had at other hotels.  Although it was our five year anniversary, we didn't receive any kind of special treatment or perk, which would have been nice but certainly not expected. Basically even though you pay a lot to stay here, employees don't make you feel special or any different than any other tourist that comes into the hotel. I just expected more from a Wynn hotel!

The worst part of this hotel is by far the food options. There are very little easy and fast options for food, and you end up waiting in very long lines, all the time. Forget about getting into any of the other restaurants without a reservation, even just for breakfast. I felt like a lot of restaurants were only open for dinner, which again narrowed down the options. I DO love their buffet though, but again, you wait in lines for it at all times of day.

First off, it is a very beautiful and classy place with an awesome buffet.  However I think all this disguises the underlying problems this hotel has: convenience and a quiet night's stay.

I go to Vegas often and have stayed at many different hotels on the strip including Encore.  Checking-in never took longer than 5 minutes at the other hotels except at the Wynn which took 40 minutes.  Yeah, ok it was busy but Vegas always is when there's a convention in town which is basically every day.

The first night what I thought was the TI pirate show turned out to be the window panes hitting each other because of the wind.  Keep in mind it was not that windy.  It was more so just breezy.  I was wondering why I was hearing such loud noise every couple minutes.  You would think for such a ritsy, expensive hotel this wouldn't happen, but it's definitely the case at the Wynn and from what I remember the Encore as well.  Not a big deal if you are out all night partying.  But when you gotta get up early the next morning because you are on a business trip it's not a good thing.

When it came time for me to leave and check-out they don't even have the convenience of checking out on the TV.  Anyways, I needed a statement copy so I went to registration to check-out.  Another 20 minutes wasted.  While I was waiting in line I overheard one of the workers tell a guest who was checking out that he was 13 minutes past check-out time.  Common now!  How dare he even say that to a guest and on top of that it was because the F@#$king line moved so damn slow!

When it was finally my turn to check-out they messed up on my bill.  Turns out they never took down my credit card information, which I provided them when I checked in and charged everything to the saved company corporate card on file.  I told them all charges needed to be on my own credit card due to my company's policy.  She didn't understand or know what to do so she had to grab a coworker to help her out who also didn't understand the situation.  This is understandable because how can a confused person properly tell another what the situation was without confusing her?

After some time they finally fixed the problem and I was out of there.  Never to return again.  I don't know if the convenience of quick checking-in and out is due to there computer system or just incompetence.  I don't care for finding out.  All I know is I completely discourage people from staying at this hotel.",1,0,0

I got a Saturday rate of $143 on Hotwire (on Memorial Day weekend to boot) and decided I couldn't pass up the opportunity. They gave me a room on a high floor with an amazing view of the Strip and Treasure Island. The room itself wasn't huge by Vegas standards, but the bathroom was, and it had a TV that I could watch while I showered. 

Of course, being a hotel that screams ""money"" in every possible way isn't something that a broke 21-year old college student can really take advantage of. I quickly realized that, even though I'd scored an amazing rate on my room, I couldn't actually afford to eat, drink, or gamble inside the Wynn itself. I had to go back out onto the Strip to find the more affordable offerings.

Am I glad I stayed here to try it? Yes. Would I stay here again if I had more disposable income? Yes. Until then... I'll opt elsewhere if I'm ever back in town.",2,2,1

If you have ever been to Vegas and toured around many of the hotels (specially on the strip) you are hit right in the face every time you step foot in the Wynn just how elevated and above all others they really are. 

We decided to head to Vegas a day early and try a night at the Wynn (already booked at the Bellagio). Booked a Tower King room, Non-Smoking. Upon arrival greeted by the valet, bellman and off to a great start. The valet at the Wynn is much more intimate than most resort\/hotels in Vegas. Sets the mood for the hotel experience at the  Wynn and I really like the difference. 

Then we hit the Registration Desk. Maybe it was the dud we ended up with, but considering the reputation and considerable expense just to say there we were expecting much better service. Maybe the clerk was not blessed with any discernible  personality, or maybe he was having a bad day? Either way check in was lacking in a big way. That can be overlooked, until you get to your room and open the door and are hit in the face with the powerful lingering smell of cigarette smoke. Yep, you guessed it. Even though I booked a Non-Smoking room......we ended up in a smoking room on an all smoking floor! The room itself was nice (if not totally in order), but I was on the phone immediately to request the Non-Smoking room I had reserved. Though the front desk operator was polite, I was informed that while I had requested a Non-Smoking room when making my reservation, that was not a guarantee. You would think this was a little tidbit the registration clerk would have mentioned? They put me on hold and when they came back on the line, I was informed that the only option available right away was a room with 2 full beds. That was unacceptable, and I really found it hard to believe that on a Wed. in Vegas the  Wynn had no other options available specially since they tried to pawn off an upgrade at check in because they had the room availability. I was placed back on hold and again informed that at that time the double bed option was the only option. I asked her several times what the wait time would be for a king bed option (as she implied that these rooms were coming avail.), and could not get a straight answer. Place on hold for a third time, and finally pay dirt! They did, in fact have a Tower room w\/King bed ready to go. We were informed that our current key cards would work, just needed to head to the new floor\/room and should be good to go. So, down the elevator bank and up another bank we went. As you can probably guess the key cards did not work so down to the registration desk we went. Thankfully there was separate registration desk in the Tower so not a long treck to have new keys issued. 

The second room was not completely ready to go, the furniture was also mismatched and dirty. My husband and I both got the impression that this was a kind of throw away room, somewhere you place the overflow. At the Wynn, you would have expected much, much more. Disappointed for sure. 

Our experience did improve from there however. We had a fabulous meal at Botero thanks to the recommendation from our bellman Bob. Room service the next morning was among some of the best we have ever had, and the food was wonderful. The Wynn manages to handle those details that most other hotel\/resorts in Vegas lag way behind. This is noticed throughout the whole facility. Service at the registration desk upon check out was night and day from the day before. 

Will we be back? Maybe, if the price was right.",1,0,0

======================================================

The overall stay and service after the initial check-in was superb!  The tower suite's have their own separate concierge and are way nicer than the concierge at the main registration area [as noted above].  From draperies to the marble and mosaic floors to the waterfalls and natural light to the restaurants and clubs; The Wynn is the nicest hotel in Vegas.  

The room was very nice, very spacious, and the view was amazing.  Plasma screen TV's in the living room and the bathroom.  Jet spa bathtub, electric curtains, and a breathtaking view; the view was directly over the Wynn's golf course and pool.  Sooo good! [view: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/t-o_Sraneime4DDhWrQRBA?select=E5xhLmhqQDq9DOt9TvumVA ]

The service was exceptionally perfect (with exception to initial registration).  Every time we needed something the staff happily obliged.  ""Would you like some water?""   ""Would you like me to call you and your guests a private driver?""  My name was quickly memorized among the staff I think from the stern finger pointing I gave out earlier.  Sooo good!   

One big problem with the tower suites are the lack of Ice machines.  I guess it's faux pas to have a green glowing ""ICE\/Vending"" sign throughout the Wynn's opulent halls.  Don't worry though; we Vegas Hillbilly'd the joint with our many requests to room service for huge ""Chaucers"" of ice to chill our 30-pack of Bud Light, Jaeger, Sparks, and a magnum of Cook's sparkling wine.  Sooo good!

Obviously the pools are the places to be at when it's 110+ degrees outside.  And yes, that magnum of Cook's with OJ was our giggle juice of choice.  Luckily we were able to enjoy one of the highly posh and classy cabanas at Encore's European Pool (adult 21 and over pool) thanks to my friend's hookup.  The cabanas are fully stocked with food and drinks, TV's, air conditioning, couches, a safe, and an around the clock hostess.  I am now and forever a high-brow pool patron.  Damn!  But, sooo good!  

While I'm not a big club aficionado, I must admit the clubs at the Wynn are my favorite anywhere. I've never been to XS but I can at least vouch for Tryst and their classy indoor\/outdoor beautiful flow.  True story, while I was checking into the hotel, my friends who were waiting for me next to the XS line overheard a girl crying on the phone to her mom about how the XS staff kicked her out and took her ID for hitting a bouncer.  She continued to scream and cry on the phone and said to her mom ""and I'm not even drunk yet"".  Sooo good!

We weren't offered any compensation of any kind for the inconvenience...that was also disappointing considering the price of the rooms and having to pack up to move halfway through our stay.

The staff was extremely attentive, the room felt luxurious enough to warrant the price (we were in the Tower, an upgrade we made at checkin for a very sweet deal). I loved the bathrobes and flirted with the idea of buying one until I saw the tag in the hotel store (200 dollars, alas).

The more secluded pool you get when you upgrade was very nice and not crowded, with prompt service by the extremely helpful eyecandy, I mean staff.

Our room deal included tickets to Le Reve, which was incredible. If you have a chance to see it I highly recommend you do. Much better than O in my opinion, but in a similar vein, combining dance and gymnastics and diving, with artistry in the visual effects that is mind blowing.

We also ate at their breakfast buffet, at 10:45 which it turns out is a good time to go- you can eat both the breakfast and lunch menus as they transition over. The bottomless margaritas were a good deal, since we definitely got into the spirit of the ""bottomless"" part.  I was very impressed at the variety of dishes, and how good they were considering it was a buffet. I'm trying to remember what we had, but the names of specific dishes seem to have been drowned in the sea of OJ and bubbly.

My second trip to Las Vegas with my wife.  First trip was back in February 2004 at The Bellagio in a standard room.  That was a 5 star experience due mostly to the staff, quality of the property and amenities.  That was 10 years ago but it is all I have to compare to this trip, which I will do.

We stayed at a Parlor Suite on the 38th floor with a strip view.  Hands down, this was the finest room I've ever stayed in a hotel or resort.  Including places such as The Ritz Carlton in Battery Park, The Plaza in NYC, The Beverly Hills Hotel and the fore mentioned Bellagio.  The Wynn property is by far, the most beautiful I've ever seen.  All top notch appointments and the quality and detail of virtually everything Wynn, is second to none!

We dined at:  Zoozacrackers Deli, The Buffet (lunch and dinner) and SW Steakhouse.  The deli was good and on the high side of reasonable in price but after all, it's The Wynn we're talking about here so quality ambience comes at a premium.  

The Buffet for lunch was very good and worth the money while the quality of the food was decent considering it was a buffet.  Dinner however, was disappointing.  Fairly poor service, inattentive wait staff and some of the offerings weren't all that hot.  Avoid the crab legs but the carved prime rib was pretty tasty and savory.

SW Steakhouse was altogether different.  Pricey but ""exceptional"".  Attentive, professional and courteous staff that appreciated our desire to keep a handle on the budget for the meal yet still treated us as well as the high rollers all around us.  I cannot say enough good things about this group of people whom served us quite possibly the finest Rib Eye ever.  The aged steak was brazed to perfection and was so tender, you could cut it with a butter knife.  My tastebuds were literally in fantasyland!  The bill came to $240 for two, including wine, a side dish, dessert and tip.  Money well spent.

Where The Wynn falls short is on two issues.

First, for staying in a expensive suite, I did not feel ""pampered"".  Certainly not as we did at The Bellagio ten years ago.  While things may have changed everywhere in regards to staff issues, our service here overall was ""good"" but not ""great"".  

The second issue which is on the same concept, was the valet.  We arrived in the afternoon in a rental car which was a Chevy Impala.  The valet did not attend to us the way I would expect as the valet for the Tower Suites, is located separate from the general entrance.  By the 6th night, I would think that the attendants would recognize a suite guest and act accordingly.  Not that such service should differ for anyone but a paying guest in a top category room, should be treated much better than we were.  My wife had to open her own door and twice, I had to approach the staff for service.  We got better service at the casino valet at the MGM which is unacceptable considering the cost of our stay.  

This may sound trivial and maybe it is.  However, premium hotels should have premium standards.  When ""common"" people like myself, choose to splurge a bit for a quality experience, I should have an expectation that this experience, should be just as good as it is for high rollers.

I still highly recommend The Wynn and in most regards, it is a premier resort.

NOTE:  we don't gamble, so I can't evaluate the very plush casino.  Other than to say that the cigarette smoke is a bit annoying but it isn't nearly as bad as it is in some lower caliber casinos.  It looks very nice though.",0,2,0

- No coffee makers in room - - I like my morning coffee. 
- Unfortunately I forgot my swimsuit - it cost me $140 to buy the cheapest they had

- They have a DAILY $25 'Resort Fee' for you to use the Health Club, room telephone, in-room fax machine... When I said that I had no plans to use any of those, I was told it was mandatory. And then there's a $3.00 tax on top of that. 
- Even your iPhone or iPad or whatever costs $13.99 a DAY - which they SO generously deduct from your $25 resort Fee. Seriously??!!! In this day and age they charge $13.99??? 
- Employees are not overly friendly - except for the housekeeping staff - when you ran into them in the hallways they were very friendly. Not so elsewhere in the hotel. It's like you're doing them a favor by staying there. 
- We wanted to have a family celebration dinner in the Stratta... Initially, there was no way that they would move our tables together... and we'd have to all have the same food... Seriously?? You can't accommodate 14 people??? In their defense a manager by the name of Christian did make it all work so we had a lovely evening... but it was work to get to that point. 
- The hotel nightclubs are on the upper floors - if you're anywhere near them BEWARE!  A couple of our cousins called down in the middle of the night to complain about the loud music - - the hotel sent security up to their rooms and provided complimentary earplugs - like the kind you buy at Home Depot.

Not only are we already paying inflated prices for food in Vegas, there's also an additional, exponential surcharge on a meal based on the celebrity factor.

We stayed in the Tower Suites of the hotel that overlooked the golf course.  A spectacular view from the wall of windows makes it easy for you just sit there with a glass of wine or a cup of tea to take it all in.  The room itself was large and comfortable with 2 bathrooms for us to prepare ourselves for a long day of hobnobbing with vendors.  The beds were fantastic.  Loved the fact that they give you the option of using either hard or soft pillows.  They offer both.

The hotel staff were all accommodating and pleasant.  Never needed a thing and if I did, it was a phone call away.  We got the concierge to change our dinner reservations for a later time at the last minute without any explanations needed.

The only negative was that the luxury boutique options were not as extensive as Ceasars.  Chloe, Manolo, Chanel, and a couple of others but we still cabbed to Ceasars to get our shopping on.  There is a mall across the street but I'm not a mall shopper.  I'm too snobby for that.  Kidding.  I'm not snobby, I just know what I like.

Maybe a lil snobby.",7,10,3

My sister complained to the man, who was supposed to be directing people to the available check-in staff.  My sister commented on how good Bellagio's check-in process was.  The man's response was, ""we are much busier than the Bellagio"" which was really confusing to me because the Wynn is definitely dead compared to the Bellagio.

The TV in our room was faulty - remote control did not work properly, the TV would turn on and off by itself.  My sister called it in to get it fixed. After 20 mins of waiting, no one came, so I decided to pull the cable from the TV to turn it off.   

When we returned to our room after a day of shopping, we found two cleaning rags on the chair, which were probably left by the chambermaids. 

At check-out, my sister was being charged $8 from the mini bar which we did not use at all.  I mistakenly moved one of the little tin containers, but after I realized that they had sensors at the bottom, I immediately returned it to its place.  Maximum of 15 seconds.

I left my glasses in my room and when I called to find out if they found them, I had a terrible experience with the lost and found department.

Wynn ruined my wedding day and I hope others won't made the same mistake I did, which was choosing to stay at Wynn for a special occasion.

I made two back-to-back reservations for our wedding at Wynn and was assured during check- in that it was all taken care of, that I would be staying in the same room for 4 nights and wouldn't need to check out and check in again. I have had back-to-back reservations at other hotels before and never had a problem, so I never thought a 5-star hotel like Wynn would have trouble handling that. 

Early morning on my wedding day, housekeeping barged in despite that we have privacy setting on. After I went downstairs to pick up my fiance's tux and my veil, I found that my key card was not working. I went downstairs to the front desk and talked to the staff about the dysfunctional key. The guy told me to stand in line. I told him my wedding is in a few hours and my room key didn't work, he told me to stand in line. After waiting for a while, I asked to talk to the manager. A guy named Curtis said he was the manager and when I told him that I needed to access my room to get ready for my wedding, he told me to stand in line. After waiting in line for 20 minutes with my veil on my left hand and a set of heavy tux on my right and no end in sight, I broke into tears since I was supposed to be in my room getting ready for my wedding hair and makeup if not for Wynn's dysfunctional key and impersonal service. After I don't know how long, I called the wedding salon manager and she came to the rescue and I finally got a working room key. I was told that my key didn't work since we were automatically checked out of the room, but why? At 10am? I was never offered an explanation.

Just when I thought everything was settled, when I was putting on makeup in my room, another guy wanted to come into the room to check the mini bar . It was not a pleasant experience spending the morning of your wedding day telling people why they shouldn't come into your room.

Thanks to Wynn, I was late to my own wedding and not in a good mood. I have to say that the Wynn wedding salon did a great job and provided excellent service, unlike the rest of Wynn that I have experienced.

He was doing business so I didn't bother to interrupt his conversation and thank him for his great contributions to Las Vegas. To be honest, not sure if he even noticed me (his eyes!).

 I have to say that Mr. Wynn's hotels and casinos are second to none. His resorts demand respect and class. You just wouldn't feel right walking around in a t-shirt and shorts. Button ups are the preferred attire for gentlemen.

I love the subtle DJ mixes and mash-ups heard playing over head in the casino area. It makes gambling that much more enjoyable. Being a high end casino one would think the minimum bets are set to executive status, but in contrast it is easy to find card and crap tables set to $10 minimums. The dealers are mostly fun and entertaining, they TALK to you and even give fist bumps!

Night life of long lines and expensive drinks is to be expected at a Vegas club. To get into Tryst you have to reserve bottle service to have any chance in getting in fellas. I for one find it wasteful and wouldn't stoop to it. Nothing in life is worth waiting in line for, so I skip that too.

I found a deal on Priceline where I could get a $100\/night room in a 5-star hotel, but they didn't tell me until I made the purchase. I was hoping for the Venetian, but thankfully I ""won"" the Wynn. We were able to upgrade to a top-floor room for $25 because the high rollers in Vegas were not in town for whatever reason.

Steve Wynn knows what he's doing. He is, simply put, the man. He is the man behind  making the Golden Nugget the best hotel in Downtown LV, as well as the mastermind behind The Mirage, Treasure Island, and even the swanky Bellagio. After MGM bought his old company, Steve Wynn started his own resort company. And this time, he wanted to outdo what might be the most luxurious hotel in Vegas, the Bellagio.

Unlike most other Strip resorts, you have to walk off The Strip to see what the Wynn and Encore are about. Once you enter the Wynn, you'll walk into a gorgeous floral display, which itself is not far from the koi pond and waterfalls.

I can't comment on the shows here, but the casino has some of the most helpful staff and the fairest odds on The Strip, while the buffet - don't even get me started on how heavenly it is. The pool is also gorgeous, but it's not very deep. It's where you can encounter a lot of the high rollers in Vegas. We had an experience where the girls I went with was comparing breasts with a girl from L.A. with fake tits.

The room - I cannot say enough nice things about the rooms here. Every room is high-tech and modern, much like the Aria, but more personalized. And every room has a gorgeous view, as well.

Rooms are very nice, with kind of a Spartan look that is clean and welcoming as opposed to the decorative excesses of some other properties. Beds are great. Views from the high floors on the Strip side are magnificent. The pool area is top-notch - much more sedate and far less crowded than Mandalay Bay.

""Le Reve"" is nearly as good as ""O"" (it was just as good before they - on Steve Wynn's orders - decided to make it less dark). ""Spamalot"" is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen - sadly, it is closing on 7\/13. 

The Buffet is now a Sunday morning ritual for me. Sugar and Ice offers nice, cool outdoor seating by the waterfall. Every restaurant is top notch, though some boast prices that are not necessarily in line with what you get. 

The Esplanade contains stores full of ""if you have to ask, you can't afford it"" items - but it's still nice to walk through on the way over to Fashion Show Mall.

Parasol Up and Parasol Down are nice, upscale lounges.  Tryst attempts to be a classier take on the loud nightclub, but I didn't really enjoy it because that whole scene isn't for me.

Boyfriend received 3 comped nights and some free play despite being a loyal MGM\/Mirage player for years, so we decided to give the Wynn a try.

The hallways of all things were beautifully decorated in a tasteful blend of browns and creams. The rooms were another story... white marble, white tufted leather couches, white bar, then RED and PINK and YELLOW. It was like a Boca Raton retiree won the lotto. 

Despite the recent renovation our toilet paper dispenser was broken and daily room cleaning took ages (we had to call every day to make sure they came). I will give them props though for bringing up hypoallergenic sheets after I broke out in a rash due to their chemically processed linens.

Everything from the spa\/fitness center to the buffet had steeply raised their prices from published rates, and nothing seemed to compare to the MGM properties (specifically Mandalay) that were generally less expensive with better service.

The Wynn's parking garage is considered one of the better ones in Vegas, and for good reason.  Frequent drivers to Las Vegas will appreciate this.  Access is easy and direct from the Strip.  Once you are in the garage, the distance from car to elevator to registration to room is the easiest and shortest I've experienced in Vegas yet.  

The inside of the Casino and Hotel is as beautiful as you'd expect.  Clean, well-maintained.  Security staff are visible and you see a lot more of them than in other hotels, lending a professional and safe feel to the property.  Criticism here would be that they have a no stroller policy that I'd wish they'd enforce more strictly.  

The check-in process was pretty easy, although this was the poorest aspect of this hotel by far.  This goes to even before physical check-in.  I booked my rooms a month before our trip.  In between then, I would have appreciated some kind of ""preparing for your stay"" type e-mail maybe 3-4 days prior, confirming my reservation, and explaining some of the details of the hotel.  Specifically, something that was not explained to me is that the room key can be used to pay for basically everything on hotel grounds, and to keep track of your casino play for comps.  Explaining this during the hectic check-in process might take too much time so I understand why it wasn't, but a pre-arrival email may have been helpful.  The hotel receptionist was cordial, but also tried to up-sell me on a room which I thought was kind of low-rent for a hotel like this.  This isn't McDonald's, I don't want to supersize my meal.  Come to think of it, if you have time for a sales pitch, maybe explain the hotel amenities (like the aforementioned room key) better instead.  But I was give free bottled water which was nice.

The room was nice, very clean and well-kept.  But very thin walls (typical of any hotel), and the hotel's age (I believe it's 10 years now?) is starting to show a bit in some of the fixtures.  One of my bath towels had a bit of a stain on it, but otherwise nothing to complain about in regards to cleanliness.  I requested no housekeeping during my stay, but did ask for extra towels and other toiletries which were brought promptly.  Housekeeping even called to make sure these things were taken care of.  Great service.  Comfortable bed, good sized room (I stayed in a standard King), tasteful throughout.  

Check-out was easy and done through the TV.  Best Vegas hotel I've stayed in by far.",0,0,0

STUNNING looks but lacking in service and security....check in took over an hour - we stood in 1 line and suddenly that line just closed leaving us and a few others ahead of us to go to the BACK of the line somewhere else. No explanation, nothing.  Just ridiculous.   The next day was our first visit to the pool.   Very nice,  but lots of unattended wild kids.   Yes it's a free country but these kids were just nuts, running all over the place, splashing right where we were sitting. Sorry, but if I had to hear screamimg kids yell ""MARCO...POLO"" one more time I was going to lose it!  We eventually had enough and just left the pool.   On our way out I mentioned this to security (they have signs posted that children must be accompanied at all times).  The guy just shrugged and said they'd ""check into it"" but he never left his seat.   Not to be bitchy but when I'm on vacay I don't want someone elses kids in my face constantly.   So we get back to our room and the security lock bar was turned to keep the door propped open so we were a little freaked but went inside and nothing appeared to be taken.  I honeslty think after reading reviews on this site at a few places about theft issues of peoples rooms bring broken into that the housekeeping did this to allow somene else to come in and rob our room but we came back from the pool too soon (guess I SHOULD thank those unruly kids for that one).... we immediately called down to security who came up to our room and because nothing was taken that we could see, was indifferent and acted as it it was no big deal.  He said he thinks housekeeping must have accidentally did that (seriously????) Why would security even do that, cmon'....   I called down to the front desk and explained what happened and asked to speak to the manager and was put on ""perma-hold"" so eventually hung up,  I did eventually make contact with a manager (Tim I think) who was pretty indifferent about it as well.

We had a standard resort king, non-strip view. We had the corner room with a view of Encore, Surrender, XS, and the golf course. Even though we didn't have a strip view, it was still beautiful. Since we had the corner room, we had 2 wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling windows...it was pretty awesome. When both windows were wide open, I felt like I was floating in air on a bed haha. I think that was the best part of the room. Oh ya, and they provide 2 luggage racks (another plus in my book). 

The bathroom was also very nice and spacious. I like how they provide q-tips and cotton balls too. I just wish they had a separate vanity where I can do my hair and makeup so I can spread everything out. 
I like my space when I get dolled up :)

My favorite place to stay is still Palazzo, but I'm definitely a fan of Wynn.",1,0,1

The staff is friendly, the hotel is clean throughout, the pool is heated, and there's 20 restaurants in the building. It's really, really hard to find anything wrong with this place. I'm very happy we picked the Wynn for my first visit to Vegas. It left a fantastic impression. We'll gladly stay here again.

Check-in was a breeze. The staff makes the experience very personal; our room cards and the flat screen in the room had our names on it! Nice touch!

We decided we'd learn a few games and figured out that the earlier you go to the casino, the less intimidating it is. We learned how to play a few games early on so we'd know what we're doing when we hit the floor at night. Employees were helpful and we felt like they went out of their way to answer any questions for us. Vegas is truly a service industry, and they know how to work it.

The room was fantastic. Floor to ceiling windows, clean bathroom, and an outstanding housekeeping staff made us feel like we were walking into a brand new room every time we came back.

Dear Wynn, 

You suck. 

I'm not gonna lie, I wanted to stay here since it opened (always loved the design of this casino) but the Trump had always been more inviting plus it's a little ways off the strip. I cannot believe I spent ANY money at the Wynn instead of Trump.

 It's done; never again will the Wynn get a penny of my business.....

Your staff:  ignorant, stupid (sorry to be so harsh but really, the people I dealt with? Girl, please!) Unhelpful, disrespectful, you get the point.

Check-in at 4pm when I request an 11am check-in (which I understand you refused to accommodate)? Yeah, um........NO.  4pm though, Really? EVERYONE can agree this* is just ridiculous.
 
Requested a medical fridge? Yeah, uhhh..... NO again. Thanks for trying to add that to the bill at check-out. Seriously, how pathetic.

Charge for getting another room card? Again, I must stress.....NO!

This was by far the weirdest most illogical, unprofessional, inappropriate hotel reservation\/stay I've ever encountered. I usually stay in Vegas a min of twice a year. I have suggested to everyone I know to take their money and class elsewhere. It's wasted on a dump like the Wynn.

Also, don't do what I foolishly did; don't think for one second these rooms are anything above Circus Circus Standard. The luxury stops at the casino floor and it Stays there.

ZERO STARS FOR WYNN - TAKE YOUR CLASS TO TRUMP!",10,4,3

Check-in was painless. Staff providing cold water bottles as you wait in line. There is a gorgeous waterfall adjacent to front desk. Breathtaking. 
The rooms are lovely, something that is expected from a high end hotel. The only con is signal strength for Iphone is weak. 
The pool area had a spring break kinda of feel. It was Memorial Day weekend, so alot of young beautiful peeps were living up, yours truly included. 
The European pool area alot of flesh mostly breasts with dental floss as bikini bottoms. The cabana next to us was occupied by a bridal party who had no qualm in displaying their Dr. Rey 90210 masterpieces. 
Waitresses were pretty good in making their rounds; sure when 20% tip is involved they will make sure alcohol is flowing at a swift pace. 
The spa is magnificent. Massage was great. 
Buffet was great. For $40 dinner, it was worth every penny. 
We avoided nightclubs, too many hoochie mamas with short skirts & high heels. 
Some looked like escorts; but for sure 75% to 80% of girls roaming @ the Palms are escorts.

We got a really good deal (well at least to me) to stay at the Wynn recently. This included a deluxe king room at the Wynn (with potential to upgrade to a suite at the Encore), 2 tickets to La Reve and buffet for 2. So we booked it.

Self parking was pretty easy to find (though it was 10 am) and there was no line for check in.  It felt like the theme was very much inspired by Alice In Wonderland.  Very whimsical. 
Our room wasn't ready when we arrived but they texted when it was, about 45 minutes later. That gave us time to get the red card and to get our La Reve tickets for that evening.  

Our room was on the 20th floor and had an AMAZING view. We could see Palazzo and Mirage pretty clearly, as well as the frog for the late night show. The room was clean, except for a couple hairs in the tub, and looked fresh.  The robes were very comfortable and the room was spacious.

The hotel\/casino is HUGE with a ton of people staying there (Summer League was in effect).  So we were dodging people constantly which wasn't fun.  The shops were nice and interesting, though most were out of my budget unless I was lucky at the slots\/blackjack. We didn't leave the property the first day due to the oppressive heat but definitely saw the pool was a hot commodity (as was Encore Beach Club).

Overall, this is a gorgeous property with a wonderful pool and amenities. If you are a nonsmoker you will realize that this is the only property on the strip where the smell of smoke is not overpowering. Unlike the Venetian\/Palazzo, the Wynn does not ""mask"" the smoke with a nasty deodorizing chemicals. We stayed in a resort room (1835), which was spacious and had a nice view of the strip. After visiting several casinos in the strip (the Bellagio included), this is definitely the prettiest and most sophisticated property in Vegas. 

However, the check-in line was long (even at midnight) and we encountered pretty rude staff. Basically, we had reserved a nonsmoking room, and upon check-in the front desk clerk tells us (with an attitude) that nonsmoking rooms were not available since they are assigned on first-come, first-serve basis and are considered an ""upgrade."" I explained to her that this was ridiculous, that I even confirmed my request over the phone earlier. I also told her that her attitude was not appreciated. Her reply was that we were ""rude"" but was going to upgrade us nonetheless.""  So apparently, we were ""upgraded"" to the same nonsmoking room I had purchase originally. What a joke. 

While the Wynn is a wonderful property, you will notice that the staff treat guests as if they are beneath them. Time and time again I overheard staff declining guests requests. I even got attitude from a security guard when I asked him for directions! We have stayed at pretty good hotels in the past (i.e. Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons) and we know what good customer service is all about. You can forget about getting friendly, accommodating staff at the Wynn.    

Finally, the restaurants are all good but overpriced and not memorable. I would recommend going to Caesars Forum Shops for some excellent restaurants (Joe's and Sushi Roku were unbelievable)   . Also, I can say that Wynn has the best mojitos ever.

Given the fact that the Wynn is the prettiest property on the strip and not as crowded as other hotels (Bellagio) I will give it a 4 regardless of the poor customer service.",3,1,1

Beautiful property but it didn't feel as luxurious as some of my other 5 star hotel stays. They have a very lovely pool for their guests that is clean and well maintained. However, I found it rather hard to get help in service such as trying to book a dinner reservation within the property or day club info.

Also, my next door neighbor flipped out and began yelling, pounding, and throwing food and dishes down the hallway. I had to call security because I was too afraid to leave the room. I was told them would stop by to let me know when it was safe to leave but no one ever followed up with me. I ended up showing the front desk photos of how they trashed the floor, even breaking the floor decor and overturning the trash then emptying its contents around the elevators. I'm pretty shocked that the resort did not offer to move me to a different room\/floor or offer any compensation since I was a paying customer during one of the most expensive weekends in Las Vegas.

Every aspect of my visit allows the little girl in me to feel like a princess, eat like a queen, and party like a rockstar. I also love gambling (chill- I'm a penny slots girl) and I get to ride the rollercoaster that is winning and losing, while laughing the entire time. 
Wynn is, by far, the most beautiful, well kept property on site. The shrubbery is manicured daily, the air is purified, the drapery is always bright and colorful, never covered in dust, and that bright carpeting somehow appears to be dirt-resistant, I never see wear in the rooms. It's like time stands still.

You don't encounter rude staff, ever. I don't believe I've even crossed paths with a member of the Wynn staff who wasn't genuinely happy to be working there. 
The rooms are ahhhhhmazing. You are in control of everything with the push of a button. Extra perks are included, razors, robes, slippers, scales (who weighs themselves on vacation? of yeah, I do) a loofa, the best smelling lotion and body wash.. so much more always refilled every night.
The bathroom alone is larger than my last studio apartment, complete with a fast fill soaking both, glass shower, double sink and separate toilet.

We were offered rooms with king beds but since this was my good friend's bachelorette party weekend, we needed the double beds. We finally were able to check-in at 6:30pm. The desk explained that the rooms were not available because they allow guests to pay for a 1\/2 day and stay until 6:00pm. We were not offered any comps or upgrades for our inconvenience. The room itself was nice but not worth their $300-$400\/night charge. We also experienced attitude from the bell desk where we were forced to check our bags until our room was ready. Also, the hotel decor itself was very reminiscent of Bellagio, just a bit newer. Nothing special.

We did eat at Corsa Cucina and that was fine - pricey but decent service and food. Tryst was a great experience that I would recommend to any faithful club-goer.

The Red Restaurant is super good. I enjoyed the eggplant with pork belly (they don't identify it as pork belly in the menu which I think is just wrong though) and cat's eye noodles.

Nothing comes close to staying at the Wynn or it's sister property The Encore.

From the moment you drive up to the valet you get the feeling you are in a very exclusive place.  Privacy is of key importance and this Hotel while visible from the strip is tucked away among a great forest of trees and water falls.  The Wynn caters to it's hotel guests and treats them like the VIPs they are.  It's rather humorous that everyone refers to you as Mr. ""your last name"" whenever you are asking for service.  If you are not a guest do NOT expect the same treatment.

This is not your typical ""Vegas style"" hotel in the sense that there is absolutely nothing average about or in it...Including food prices.  It is hard pressed to find a meal under $15 (sandwich or hamburger) let alone feed a family of 4 under $100 (if you're paying for it).  This is a 5 star AAA 5 diamond resort so the rooms are spectacular after the redesign, restaurants are also 5 star and the executive chef is always present, and the shops are equivalent to shopping on Rodeo Drive.  If you have the means, this is the place...If you're on a budget there is the ""Mall"" across the street with a food court.

A little known secret is to have brunch at the Country Club past the Buffet.  The prices are reasonable ($30 per) for food and beverage but it over looks the Golf course and there is Patio dinning as well.  

Also contrary to popular belief, I have 2 children that travel with me (ages 3 and 7) and if you are a guest in the hotel they treat you and the children like GOLD.  If you have a stroller they will tag it with a Wynn strap and you are free to roam anywhere.  If you are not a guest they do NOT allow anyone under 18 or strollers anywhere on the property.  I've been here so many times many of the bell hops and restaurant servers know my children by name.

We had a regular room with a view of the golf course and pool. The layout (not suite) reminds me of the Ritz Carlton in North San Diego, but the Ritz feels more upscale and quiet. Yes, the walls are thin here. There was a couple next door with a child that made terrible noise on our first night - slamming doors and crying. Bring ear plugs.

My partner and I flew in yesterday, both of us were ill upon arriving, and spent our first day\/night in bed ordering chicken noodle soup and watching TV. Room service delivered our soup on time, but it was actually pretty bad. The ""noodles"" were macaroni (ick) and the chicken was so overcooked that it was spongy. The broth tasted like Swanson's vegetable broth without salt. Ugh. It was just so wrong. The best thing was the bread basket that accompanied the soup. 

This morning we ordered breakfast and specifically asked for an omelet for my partner without bell peppers. They steered us to the organic veggie omelet. Everything arrived on time but my partner's omelet was FULL of bell peppers. We swapped. Sadly my omelet was cold (which he ate maybe 1\/2 of). It's a bit crazy to pay $60 for breakfast in our room and then to have it all be off.

The pool is great but don't forget your sunscreen\/oil as the cabana shop will hose you for at least $18 for a bottle of the stuff. The waitresses are hit and miss poolside. Sometimes you can't get one all day long...and other times they're plugging drinks like there's no tomorrow. The pool in the rear is Euro style so you can go topless but few of the women do.

There's cafes that don't break the bank and a nightclub, Tryst, that I am also a fan of in this property. Check out the beautiful waterfall and go golfing if you can! They have the biggest course here.

The first time my friend's parents (frequent Vegas visitors\/gamblers) used their points and got us a room for about half price, and this last weekend my friend was staying for a conference for work- and they picked up the tab.  If I could afford to stay here at full price though, I would; it's totally worth it.

The rooms are absolutely beautiful, with coral colored walls, quirky floral artwork, and sleek flat screen tv's.  One whole wall in both rooms I stayed in was just a big window looking out onto the sparkling pool, which lent a bright and airy feel. The bed is so comfortable it's hard to get out of it.  Probably my favorite part though is the bathroom...there is a glass standup shower with a deep white tub next to it; 2 mirrors with their own sinks, vanities, and chairs so you can get ready in comfort;  a small flat screen tv built into the wall so you can catch your favorite shows while you're getting ready; and a separate room for the toilet, complete with a phone.  It's the kind of bathroom every girl dreams of having in her house one day.

My other favorite part of the Wynn is the pool.  They have two of them; the main pool, and then the ""European"" pool.  What makes it European?  You have to be 21 to enter, it's acceptable to go topless, and the best part- NO KIDS allowed!  A dj spins a mixture of dance, hip hop, and pop, but it's not obnoxiously loud.  They also have a little stand where you can buy sandwiches, burgers, etc.  

Because it is such a swanky hotel, most of the people staying there are classy and well-dressed, (not stumbling around drunk with big plastic cups), which just adds to the high-end experience.  It's also the only hotel\/casino in Vegas I can think of that isn't absolutely freezing inside.

Check in was fast and easy, and the room (55th floor, two double beds with a panorama view facing north and east) was spacious and luxurious. 

I gotta say the only I didn't like was the exorbitant prices EVERYwhere. Like the $8 water bottles in the room (who doesn't give their customers a free bottle of water in Vegas heat!), the higher minimums on the tables (I don't work in corporate America anymore!), and the nerve to charge $35 for their ""Chinese"" breakfast - essentially a bowl of jook (congee), some dried pork, shu mai, tea, and one other small dish which together in Chinatown should cost maybe $7 tops.

But my being a cheapass aside, the food here was phenomenal and the entertainment well worth it. The Wynn buffet for lunch was delicious and contained so many different flavors (wok fried chinese veggies, pulled pork bbq cole slaw, prime rib, smoked salmon, and an entire section of dessert options were just a SAMPLE of what we ate). The cabana area with the pool was very comfortable (and who knew European style topless sunbathing was so in style?), and XS was really fun to party at (though when we went it became a dudefest later in the evening). That aside, the music there was solid and the visuals of the pool were nothing short of stunning.

XS may be the best description for a club, and I think it applies to the hotel in general. Food was sumptious, club was extravagant, and service was top notch.

My thought was that Wynn is somewhere between paying-for-style and paying-just-for-consumption.

The room that I had was decent in space with nice floor to ceiling windows from wall to wall.  The bathrooms are nicely kept clean with a fine bath and TV inside.  Beds are nice and comfortable.

But ticks me off is that they provide you with nothing... not even water.  There is a tray of goodies with Wynn's logo on the stuff, which looks nice.  It's not too expensive, but definitely marked up.  It's such a waste of space though if you don't use that service.  And in addition, they have a fridge, but stocked full of what they are trying to sell you.  That's great and not necessarily negative.  But what I find most annoying is that they left no space for guests to use (because they use a weight-sensitive detection to charge guests).  Like I said... it's an attitude of consumption for the sake of consumption or style... which isn't really my style.

For about the same price, I'd rather do a lake-view room at the Bellagio",0,0,1

The ventilation is superb, the modern decor is elegant and captivating, and you're bound to wake up with a story worth telling after partying at the Wynn (or Encore). 

Home of one of my favorite pools on the strip. They have a European-style pool sectioned off from the minors. So yes, you may catch a glimpse of more skin than usual...but hey, it's Vegas. There's no surprises here. As crowded as this pool can get, there's always plenty of lounge chairs up for grabs. There's even a few tables outside overlooking the water, so if sunbathing isn't in your interest, feel free to gamble away. The Wynn Buffet is also not something you want to miss out on. They serve a wide variety of ethnic cuisines and some of the best Alaskan crab legs in town. 

The ample sized rooms are beautifully decorated, and unfortunately, can cost and arm and a leg. Believe me, it's worth staying here. My only gripe is how dimly lit the living room can be. Not a girl's best friend if she's trying to put on her makeup in the hallway. There's always some kind of deal for players card members that include discounted rooms and resort credits. The front desk always tells me I can't use the credit to pay for a part of the room, but it still gets taken out during check out anyway.

Nice hotel, great buffet, staff was friendly, all as expected.   The resort fee of $ 25 per day covers the usual (WiFi, gym, pool, etc).  
My one complaint:  We went to the pool on a somewhat cool day (mid 60s) to get a little sun.  The main pool is closed for the season (no big deal), but they have the smaller Sunset pool open.  It's a big rectangle shaped pool with 8 large round lounges in the pool, and chaises on all 4 sides of the pool.  Here's the problem: all the lounges in the pool, and all the chairs in the front row are ""Reserved"".  I asked the pool attendant who these chairs are reserved for...his answer...""People who pay for them"".  I told him that my daily resort fee covered pool use. Not so much.
Apparently, if you actually want a chair in the sun, you have to pay extra.  Of the 100+ people at the pool, nobody had paid for a ""Reserved"" seat.  No extra revenue for Wynn.  What they did accomplish was pissing off every single pool-using customer that was forced to take a chair in the shade.  This is not ""5 Star Resort"" level customer service.

For example: as they are doing a main aerial show in the center stage you will have the jokesters on one side looking on in over the top grandeur at the show and the minor main character who reminds me of a shmaman or medicine man will be looking on in pride as his creation comes to fruition, and his minions are moving around doing what minions do best.

Got 2 rooms for 3 nights and paid $108\/night through hotwire, so pretty good deal. Our flight landed around 7pm and by the time we finished dinner and checked-in, it was 9pm. The hotel concierge said they might not have 2 rooms on the same floor, but we really wanted a connecting room. They offered us a room with a panoramic view on 57th floor for $25\/night, but the rooms are still 2 doors away, so we didnt go for it. We ended up on the 19th floor, about 20 rooms apart from each other. When we got into our room, the curtains were wide open with a spectacular view of the strip. We were in the double bed room... the room wasn't too big, but roomy enough. The bathroom was very nice. I especially love the built-in night light. :)

The first night was horrible, it was so noisy in the middle of the night (around 4am) that sounded like someones doing some construction work 2 floors down. I peeked from the curtain and saw a police van on with some cops and some other men around the van, not sure if they're handcuffed. I didn't get back to sleep.... lots of tossing and turning. :(

The next morning, we decided to try our luck to see if the hotel would be willing to transfer us to a connecting room. When we got to the hotel registration, the lady told us that their computer has a note saying that we've requested for a connecting room and they'll give that to us when it becomes available by 4pm. Nice! We were pleasantly surprised cuz when I checked-in the previous night, the concierge didn't mention that they'll do this for us.

We got back to the hotel around 3pm and packed up for the ""relocation."" But when we got to the registration, they told us no connecting rooms are available yet, but should have it ready by 7pm. But my mom knows for a fact that the two rooms next to theirs checked out this morning at 8am. So she talked to the manager and sure enough, those rooms are ready. So after going back and forth, we finally settled into our new connecting rooms. One rooms was with one king sized bed and the other was with 2 double beds. The room with one king sized bed was roomier, of course. The rest of the set-up was the same. 

Too bad the weather was abnormal and was on the cold size so they didn't get to swim in one of their spacious pools, but they're just as happy taking a bubble bath in the spacious bath tub!

We've stayed in Venetian and Bellagio the last two times we visited Vegas. I still love Bellagio's lobby the most... we always visit Bellagio each time we come to Vegas just because of the different exhibits showcasing different seasons throughout the year. The rooms in Bellagio was a bit too small though. Room-wise, Venetian hands down has the nicest room and bathroom... actually, they're all suite. It's truly luxurious!

We stayed in the Tower Suites with a fantastic view of the plush golf course and pools below.  The rooms are well kept, open floor plan.  However, the doors latch very loud and you can't 'hush' them by turning the handle.  So, you'll usually hear someone nearby easy enough.  However, I really enjoy coffee in the room and there isn't any.  So if that's important to you, look elsewhere.

The lemon drops in the tower suite registration bar are the best thus far, with a fine sugar rim and perfect blend of spirits and sweeteners.  I'd give them 5 stars on those.

Since we got in from the east coast, we are up at 4:00AM.  I headed to the gym, only to find it opens at 6:00AM?!?  That's late.  Ok...  So what about breakfast.  That doesn't open until 8:00AM.

 Overall, the service was very good - not in 5 star Four Seasons league I am afraid (although I hear the in Tower Suites wing,check in and service levels are higher than regular stay) - but very, very good solid 4.5 star place; although check-in process took way too long. We liked the spa and gym too and my husband thought the gaming was good if expensive (very few tables if any under $25 a hand). He did the all day poker tournament in the poker room and really liked that too.  We sampled a couple of the restaurants and nothing really jumped out but nor did we have a bad meal either. (The NY Style deli takeout place is surprisingly excellent though as well as the poolside Terrace Cafe).  We enjoyed Le Reve more than we thought we would too - lovely theater.

The pool is just awesome however and if you are going to enjoy relaxing while excellent cocktails are brought to you and you can lounge around in peace - you have to the right two hotels. The rooms are reasonably spacious and ours had a comfy love seat and ottoman too - they have these panoramic windows with remote controlled drapes which are fun to open up in the morning when you wake up (or rather noon in our case) and the bathrooms are outstanding.  The beds however are REALLY not good - both my husband and I woke up with a serious backache every morning, which is very disappointing for a hotel of this caliber - and such an easy thing to fix.  I would probably go back, but that issue alone would make me think twice. 

P.S.  Also don't miss the evening, light and water shows in the little terrace bar off the front desk reception area, that are projected into the fountain in the Lake of Dreams area every 1\/2 hour and they are different every time. So cool! (and no well publicized it seems.)",0,0,0

Buffet was a little disappointing since they didn't bring out any shellfish during the lunch hour.  I thought they would have had some crab legs or shrimp, or something like that.  

The show was great!  Every seat in the circular theater provided a nice view of this acrobatic water show.

As you start walking towards the casino next to the check-in area you can see a huge outdoor waterfall fountain framed with gorgeous trees, it is so serene. Unfortunately we never got to go outside to see it without a glass window dividing us, during the times we wanted it was closed.

All of the employees were extremely friendly and seemed to go out of their way to make sure you have an enjoyable stay. I spent days wandering throughout Wynn and the adjoining Encore enjoying the design, artwork and decor. Both are beautifully done hotels. 

An interesting tid bit we learned during our stay:

Every flower in the hotel is real - no artificial flowers are used with the exception of the large floral balls hanging from the trees in the main lobby.  When the hotel first opened these were made of real flowers, but they weighed approx 400 pounds each; they were considered a hazard.  Too, they dripped nectar and pollen.   

There were a few minor reasons I didn't give the hotel 5 stars: 

-The thermostat\/airconditioning in the room doesn't seem to keep the room all that cold - even set on the lowest level. 

-The walls are thin (as everyone else has previously mentioned). 

-The pool closes at 7PM, which I think is a little early. I agree it shouldn't be open super late, but 7PM?!? 

-Too, the elevators getting to and from the rooms and pool are slightly annoying. You have to switch elevators and walk through the edge of the casino in order to get to the pool elevator - poor design. (Or you can ride and stop every other minute and weave your way through the Spa\/Gym level. There again just annoying. 

-In order to use the gym you either A) have to have a spa appointment or B) have to pay a daily fee. I feel that when you stay at a resort of this caliber you should have access to every amenity that you'd receive at a standard hotel.

I was not disappointed when I arrived. The decor is really wonderful to look at. Almost reminded me of the decor at Bellagio so I felt it was worth walking all the way here.

The only reason we went there was to sign up for their player club card and get  the $10 free slot play. The slot play was fun-I spend like 3 hours or so playing the penny poker and left with $10 in my pocket. So I was happy :)

I like that the casino and public areas are more quiet and relaxed than other hotels on the strip. This is probably due to the Wynn not allowing strollers inside the hotel and due to the fact that they don't offer touristy attractions like other hotels on the strip.  Also, the casino floor is less smoky and crowded.  

If you want an upscale hotel, but yet want to be where the action and noise is, then you're better off at the Palazzo or Venetian.  When we walked from the Wynn and through the Palazzo to get to the Venetian for dinner at Tao, it was obvious the atmosphere changed from relaxed at the Wynn to the usual Vegas hotel noise at the other two.  

CHECK-IN:
Upon check-in, you might want to wedge a $20 between your credit card and I.D. and politely ask if there are any complimentary upgrades.   I arrived at the hotel around 1pm and since I booked two rooms, I offered a $50 instead of a $20.  The front-desk clerk saw the $50, smiled, said ""thank you"" and ""let me see what I can do for you"".  I'm sure he's encountered the ""complimentary upgrade tip"" before.  


Since I booked our resort rooms on Hotwire.com and got a rate of $135\/night, I was more concerned about our request for double bed rooms being honored more than getting complimentary upgrades.  Hotwire only guarantees double occupancy...meaning, you could get stuck with one bed.  

Anyhow, the clerk gave me two options:
1)  Two connecting rooms on the 19th floor, each with double beds and views of their massive golf-course.  Or,

2) Two rooms on the 51st floor, three doors away from each other, each with double beds and views of the strip.  

For both options, only one room was ready; the other would be ready by 3pm.  Since we preferred to have connecting rooms, we opted for choice # 1.  The clerk took down my cell # so that someone could call me when the second room was ready (which they did later on).

ROOMS:
The Wynn website reflected a rate of $289\/night for their resort rooms and although I was going to book at that rate, I ended up booking through Hotwire.com for $135\/night per a friend's recommendation.  Had I paid full price for the resort rooms ($289\/night), I would have been disappointed since for that price, the quality of the room and furnishings are not on par with rooms at the Venetian.  However, since I got the rooms for $135\/night, I was satisfied.  

I found the rooms to be spacious, with floor to ceiling windows, remote-controlled shades, and big bathrooms.  The décor was sort of blah, considering this is a five-star hotel.  I still prefer the rooms at the Venetian, which are furnished more beautifully and appears more elegant and spacious (probably due to their sunken living rooms).  For those wondering, the Wynn rooms with double beds can sleep up to four comfortably.  

Wynn provides some nice toiletries in the bathroom (i.e., citrus\/lemongrass smelling lotions, shampoos, and conditioners).  There rooms had an iron, ironing board, safe, refrigerator, and a mini-bar.  As mentioned in other reviews, the mini-bar uses touch-sensor, so if you lift an item out of the basket for more than 30 seconds, consider it yours, no matter that you put it back later.    

The TVs located in the main room and bathroom had various music channels to choose from.  It was nice to listen to loud dance\/hip hop music to get us in the mood while getting ready for clubbing.  

ELEVATOR SECURITY:
Although security located near the elevator areas is supposed to check and make sure you have a Red Card (to show you're a hotel guest), not once during our stay were we asked to present our cards.  However, I did notice the guy asking some other people for their cards while we were just waved on through.  Wonder if it had anything to do with how one looks\/dresses?  

WYNN STAFF:
With the exception of one of the front-desk clerks, all staff we encountered was courteous and professional.  The dour front-desk clerk was a British guy in his thirties.  I had to make a second trip to the front-desk to get our room keys for the second room and unfortunately the clerk I checked-in with earlier was no longer there.  The British dude must have expected a tip when I requested our room cards, but I told him we had already checked in earlier.  

OVERALL, we enjoyed our stay at the Wynn and would stay here again on future visits.  Basically, the Wynn has everything you would need (nice rooms, great dining, show, shopping, Tryst nightclub) without stepping foot outside the hotel.  However, all things considered, the Venetian is still my favorite hotel in Vegas.",1,0,0

However to start off with, the boom boom boom sounds from Tryst weren't happening this time despite us being on a lower floor which is good.  

Let's start off with the hotel rooms and this is really where my review is based purely on because the stores, casino floor and everything else are very good.  We got two rooms but unfortunately they were on separate floors even though we asked for it to be on the same floor.  I do understand the hotel was fully booked but not sure how hard it would have been so we could have been on the same floor.  One of our rooms had a foul smell in there as if a pet did a little bit of business.  They came up to spray something but it didn't do much good.  The towels in the bathroom had its thread coming apart which is something I expect at home but not at the Wynn.  There was also a stain on the toilet that could not be cleaned.  I did email Wynn about these issues and they email back and apologized.  I hope it'll be better next time because it's a good hotel and it's one that I want to stay at over and over again.",1,1,1

People who check you in are not friendly, AT ALL. Rooms are average, at best. Most all of the good chairs at the pools are ""reserved only"" meaning you have to pay to sit in them. For most all of their pools, sun is blocked by the Palazzo Tower by about 3:30 pm. Food you order at the pools is all pre-packaged.  Taste like airport food.

I got lost so many times in this hotel and each time I asked for directions, a staff member generously smiled and showed me the way. Yes this place is huge! Make sure you get a hotel map at the front desk. 

Even the concierge service was on point.

I didn't mind calling the business center myself. They informed me my package was ready. Went to pick it up. Only one person in front of me but seemed like there was some issue so ended waiting a good 15 minutes. I would call ahead as they have time to look for your package and set it aside.

There is so much more to the Wynn than his and her sinks, a 42"" flat screen TV, and a kid's free pool. I believe the concept of the hotel is a French whimsical dream; where Steve Wynn used Art Nouveau-style inspirations in the carpet, mosaic floors, silk walls, and even on the ceiling! This hotel is about believing in dreams. When a hotel is well designed you just feel better. Another concept was bringing the outdoors in. That might explain the enlarged purple, red, and yellow flower balls suspended from the trees in the lobby. I love details. I noticed the tiny decals of branches on the ceiling!! If you look up above the trees where the ceiling meets the glass of the atrium, edges are curved and smooth. The pull backs that hold the drapery together are small flower motifs!! 

This hotel features 270,000 guest rooms! I was lucky enough to stay in a double guest suite. As you entered the suite, classical music filled the room on a 42"" flat screen TV with a transitional tulip screen saver. It was so beautiful I took video. Haha. Walls were covered in a peach passion wall covering. The beds were plush and comfy; bed skirts consisted of orange, blue, and yellow stripes. Colorful artwork resembled Andy Warhol's flower painting. The goodies above the mini bar had sensors on them. They charged you for every second you picked up the food. The rules were you can look but you can't touch!

The bathroom consisted of his and her sinks with a separate toilet room that had its own wall sconce and phone. Our bathroom had a wall mounted TV so we could watch the news while we were getting ready! I did not like the glass shower. While I was getting ready I could see my friend showering. There's a thing called privacy, apparently this concept didn't exist in Wynn's ""dreams"". 

Our view was spectacular. We got to see pretty green hills of the Wynn's golf course. So glad we didn't get the construction view. Haha. 

Had dinner at a dimmed, 12 year old sports bar, it didn't quite feel grown up yet. Anyways, ordered a 6"" turkey sandwich for $12 which was the cheapest thing on the menu, yikes! 

The service was great, the bellmen brought our bags to our room but the handsome fellow said it was required to tip. The elevator men were nice but too pushy they wanted to make sure I had my red card  [room key] with me at all times, well sometimes it's a thing called forgetfulness and I didn't always have on me, whoops. Plus my friends would stay in the room, while I wondered around...

In the scopes of services, the design team needed to design 18 restaurants, 80,000 square feet of retail space, 111,000 square feet of casino space with 137 table games, 1,960 slot machines, and 200,000 square feet of convention and meeting space. It took up to five years to build this $2.7 billion luxury hotel. Steve Wynn used a program called Buzzsaw by Autodesk where he and 250 users created 140,000 sheets of drawings to design the space.

The Wynn hotel is way too nice of a hotel for me and my family. However, we lucked out because my husband was on a business trip for the ConExpo and his boss booked the rooms. Thank god we got reimbursed. 

However, even if we could afford to stay here normally, I'm not sure this is the place I'd choose. It was perfectly luxurious in every way, from the rooms to the lobby to the huge waterfall outside. But it was just sort of unnecessary. Not that I really wanted to stay at Circus Circus or anything. But there are nice hotels I've stayed in (the Mirage being one, or MGM) where it's nice without being overstated or gaudy. 

I realize Vegas is, by definition, over-the-top, but it wasn't needed here. We have a very young daughter and I probably would have been more comfortable at a place without an excess of nightclubs, lounges, and people giving me ""that look"" every time we walked around the casino to get outside. Not to mention the secondhand smoke. Someone else had mentioned they couldn't even tell, but I could, and it was really bad.

Now that I've got my pettiness out of the way, let me discuss the pros:

-FOOD. Amazing. There's a pizza place that tries to replicate NY pizza (and partially succeeds, in my opinion), a deli that wowed me, and a great little cafe to get snacks, breakfast, coffee, and so on. We didn't eat at any of the nicer places here, but I would have liked to had we not had a little one in tow.

-BUFFET: Didn't try it. For $35 per person, I'd rather get pizza and beer.

-SHOPPING. Not only are there designer shops in the lobby's esplanade, but there's also a huge mall right across the street with just about anything you could want. We spent three days just walking around and I only bought one thing (with the exception of food). But there's just so much to see that it's great to window shop, especially when you don't just want to walk up and down the strip and you don't have a car.

-ROOMS: This gets a plus and a minus. The room was ridonkulous. Great view of the strip, great bedding, controls for lights and window shades\/sheers from your bedside, a couch, a desk, a table and chairs, a big flat-screen mounted to the wall, THOSE ROBES (you know the ones), and a bathroom superior to all others anywhere I've stayed. Warm lighting, jacuzzi tub, shower with glass doors, a great line of products (body wash, lotion, shampoo, etc.), tv\/remote in the bathroom, lighted vanity mirror, and more towels than you could ever know what to do with.

On the bad side? On one night, there was this whirring sound that turned into a full-on shrill whistle that kept waking us up. After searching all over the place we finally concluded that it was coming from the door, which wasn't fully ""sealed"" when shut. If I pressed it closed more, the sound stopped, but when I let go, it would make that shrill noise every five minutes or so. I went in the hallway to see if any other doors were open slightly -- I thought maybe it was creating some sort of ""wind tunnel"" effect. Nope. I called downstairs and the guy's suggestion? ""Put a towel under the door."" Gee, thanks. I mean, it worked, but that's neither good customer service nor is it classy in the least. Nor should I have to do that for the noise to stop! I didn't insist someone come up, because it was late and we were all sleeping. But it was EXTREMELY annoying.

Also, you have to pay for wifi in the rooms. FML. $14 a day PER computer? No way. At least it's free in the cafe and in the pizza place.

-POOLS: there were five of them, all in the same outdoor area. No indoor pool is a minus in my book, because it was only in the 60s. Oh well.

-CASINO: I don't gamble, but it looked ok. Nothing special. On my last night there, I took a dollar from my wallet and gave it a go. I won seven bucks, then lost it all. Big surprise.

-STAFF: Other than the less than helpful guy at the front desk the night I called, the staff were courteous, professional, and helpful.

Would I stay there again? Probably not. Would I recommend it? Probably, depending on your personality and what you desired from your stay. It really is an ""adult"" hotel. But don't let the fancy decor fool you ... there were plenty of people walking around in scrubby clothes here too.",1,3,2

First of all, if you get the golf course view you will hear the club music all night. Then at 3 am when the music stops, you'll hear the youngsters come back to their rooms to finish the party because the walls are so thin. The beds are also a little older and uncomfortable-- their was a dent that rolled us into the center. There was something sticky on all the pamphlets on the desk and throughout the hallway floor, so housekeeping standards aren't too high. The pamphlets were actually already written on, so I guess they just don't switch them out.

There are shops and eating and drinking places like the Parasol up and down which is like a bar and has food as well the down you are outdoors there is a big screen and water around and flowing down from it and every 30 mins they play a show on the screen and in the water it was pretty cool.

Mr. Wynn has been described as someone with an eye for every detail; as far as I can see, this appears to be true.  This hotel is beautiful, spacious and clean, with sumptuous amenities and lively character and decor.  It's an *almost* eccentric mix of flowers, curlicues and both feminine and masculine colors -- a bit odd, like Warhol meets Dr. Seuss, but it works.

For the business traveler, there is high-speed Internet connection for $12 \/ day and a (unbelievably costly to use) fax machine in each room.  As far as room prices go, I probably wouldn't put this on the weekend ""value"" list, but I would stay here in a heartbeat for midweek rates.",2,0,1

As a native Californian (raised in Los Angeles), my family has been bringing me to Vegas since I was a little sprout, and I've consequently stayed at my fair share of hotels on The Strip. But since the Wynn\/Encore opened its doors, my family won't stay anywhere else when we're in Sin City.

I'm not a gambler and don't party as much as I used to, post-college. Still, some of my fondest memories of that time are of being freshly 21 and dancing with friends to Calvin Harris' set at Wynn's nightclub (by comparison, I don't think I've step foot in a Los Angeles club that I actually liked). They also have the Beach Club during the day that hosts some awesome events. I can't attest to the gambling aspect personally, but my grandma absolutely loves to gamble, and this hotel is by far her favorite place to indulge in it, and the Wynn accommodates her hobby handsomely. My dad loves their casino as well.

I usually come to Vegas with my mom (who, like me, isn't into gambling) to accompany my grandma, and we love the Wynn (and Vegas in general) for its other decadences: the dining and the shopping and the entertainment and the interior design. Simply put, this hotel is stunning. Steve Wynn has excellent taste after years of being a Vegas hotel titan, and he definitely reserved the best of his creative vision for his namesake hotel (and the Encore, of course). There are always gorgeous art pieces (the most recent time I was here, there was an actual merry-go-round and hot air balloon constructed completely out of flowers, in different parts of the casino). I always look around at the stunning decor with googly eyes, even though I've seen it at least half a dozen times. It's truly a sight to see. The rooms are beautiful too, and so comfortable - they have sweeping views of The Strip\/Wynn golf course, and are just immaculate. The shopping (at the Wynn Esplanade) is great too - they have all of the major designers (my personal favorite is the Chloe store), as well as some truly beautiful interior design shops. It's always nice to window shop or, alternately, pick out the perfect splurge. But my favorite part of the Wynn is the dining. Their food is excellent - Wazuzu, Botero, Tableau, The Buffet, wherever - and always such a great experience. They have a variety of cuisines as well - you can find just about anything you want. Also, Wynn's Cirque show - Le Reve - is amazingly beautiful. You have to see it at least once.

I highly, highly recommend this hotel. It's by and far the best in Vegas!",10,6,8

The room was smaller than some of the other hotels and I didn't like the telephone remote controlled lights that either all went on.. or all went off.. you were either blinded by the light or sitting in the dark unless you changed the settings on all the switches and walked over to the light switch by the door to turn off the lights above the drapes and hallway, kind of defeated the purpose of having remote controlled lights. The heater was also controlled by the telephone remote but no matter how warm I set it.. that darn room was cold!  Another instance where you had to walk over to the master switch and change the settings... (sigh) The bathrooms were nice and spacious and the room was clean but the bed sheets were messy.. maybe you aren't suppose to notice they weren't tucked in nice and neat but I'm weird like that especially in a $$$$ hotel.  The mini fridge was fully stocked, over priced and came with a warning.. don't touch for more than 60 seconds or charges will  automatically be charged to your room..but it is Vegas.  They did have a leather sofa but the kind I really hate.. you know you sit on it and if you move it sounds like you ... well you know.. it was noisy! The hotel itself was nice, I guess, if you like flowers this is the place for you. With all the flowers you would think this place would smell like flowers and it doesn't.. strange.  The halls did smell like flowers though which made me wonder if they pumped that smell in through the vents. The elevators were stuffy i guess they don't have air conditioning in them.  I was just glad it wasn't hot when we visited. Maybe if the doors where left open on the ground floor when they weren't being used that would help with the stuffiness.  The gym was nice but they could use more elliptical machines. I was surprised at all the fingerprints on the doors and framed advertising photos... again my weirdness is showing.  Maybe they don't care what people that park their own cars think of cleanliness.. I swear the whole time we stayed in Vegas those were the same prints. I'm not the gambler, my husband is, so I can't comment on the casino. Would I stay here again? I guess I would  now that I have the lights and heater figured out and if they offered me some type of deal.

They had just imploded the Desert Inn months before to make way for Steve Wynn's Le Reve, the original name of the Wynn. The only thing left of the old hotel was the lobby which housed the Marketing and Sales Department. I was working for a travel magazine at that time and was privy to preview some of the plans for this ultra-luxe hotel. 

Considering the fact that we were in the remnants of the Deserts Inn's hotel lobby, in true Steve Wynn style, this temporary office space was redressed to impressed. Fully outfitted with the $2 Million Ferrari Mr. Wynn had just purchased. Interesting fact, Mr. Wynn is almost legally blind and does not have a driver's license. Kind of a shame that one would spend so much on a sports car, never to drive it to it's full potential.

The hotel is not just a hotel... It is a moment to experience.

The Tower suites are HUUUGE the curved windows are from floor to ceiling, giving fabulous views of the Las vegas strip.
The room exceeded expectations, the bathroom is bigger than my living room. 5 star joy. 
But the air-con only had two settings: hot or boiling...! 
The hotel is typical vegas- gambling, 
Bars, Nightclubs, top restaurants, 
on the first night, we collectively lost a .. load of money on Blackjack and gawd knows what else..... But amazingly, in return the casino gave us $1300 discount off the bill at check out, AND free food bill for the ENTIRE stay... If u dont ask you dont get! 
Andreas restaurant is unbelievable, Asian-fusion perfection. I went twice it was that perfect. Theres loads of stunning chamagne and cocktail bars all outstanding.
However..Tryst nightclub at Wynn is utter UTTER cr...dont even go there....its full of pensioners, dooshys and obese women in lycra who obviously dont get out much. Had to queue for ages, blahzay staff, not impressed. Next time Id
Go to XS at Encore instead. 
The weather was perfect, booked a private Cabana and went swimming most days, pool is crystal clean, no complaints there.

Then I tried to explain to him that my husband has a meeting tomorrow morning in LA, but we may not drive four hours back under my husband's physical condition. So we may extend one more night of our stay in Wynn. He said it is fine to stay one more night,  but hotel is not responsible for the charge. I told him we are already facing a loss since my husband had to cancel the meeting which is really important. I did not blame the hotel for the allergy, but I need a proper solution to the problem that we have during our stay. And I quote what he said to me ""we have over 5000 guests everyday, we cannot give complimentary stay due to guests' PERSONAL ISSUES, I hope you understand my hands are tight. If you have more question you should contact guest claim department since they are PROFESSIONAL"" I was really disappoint to his reply but since my husband was still waiting for me in the room, I decided to pay for the extra night and let my husband rest well(he was very tired and dizzy after the shot). Then I told Shawn I need the hypoallergenic sheets in my new room, he said he will contact house keeping department immediately to change them. When we got into the new room, my husband lay down because he was so dizzy and uncomfortable, we assumed that the sheets have already been changed. After 20 minutes I received a call said they will have someone to change the sheets and towels, I said okay and told my husband to get off the bed immediately since we did not know those sheets were not hypoallergenic. Unfortunately he started to have more reaction on his skin where touched the sheets and pillows(face and upper arm since he was wearing t shirt and pants)  We sat on the sofa waited for more than one hour for the hypoallergenic sheets to come, then I asked Holly to contact security again since my husband felt worse over time The paramedics came again and suggested my husband to take some antiallergic pills which are sold in the shop downstairs. The housekeeping lady changed the sheets and towels AFTER 2 hours we moved to a new room. After the paramedics left, I called Holly to ask Shawn come to my room so he can see my husband's condition. Shawn called me back said he couldn't come to our room at the time since he has a MEETING afterwards. I told him we were very disappointed for their response since we have to wait so long to get our sheets changed in our new room. He told me that because I said my husband was resting so they do not want to disturb us, and the hypoallergenic sheets required time to prepare.  In fact, the housekeeping department already had my permission to change those sheets, they just never came. I told Shawn I was tired of all the excuses and lacking of attention, and I needed guest claims department to contact me ASAP. When the lady from guests claims contacted me ( I believe her last name was Matthew, could be wrong) she kept question me what do I want him to do over and over again, I told her everything had already happened and they did not gave me any options since the beginning. She said she is sorry that they disappointed us, but she could not gave us a free night of stay and they could not control allergy reactions. Then she questioned me why did my husband laid down when he knew the sheets were not changed. WHO THE HELL WOULD DO THAT! The attitude she gave me made me feel so cheap that we could trade my husband's health for one free night of stay. Then she kept telling me that because I said my husband needs to rest, so they would not disturb us to change the sheets, and the hypoallergenic sheets need time to prepare. But the truth is we reported the allergic reaction around 11 am. The sheets were actually changed around 3:30 pm. MORE THAN 4 HOURS TO PREPARE THE DAMN SHEETS?C the update for the rest of story",9,0,0

The economic crisis does not seem to have affected the Wynn in the least. The service is the same level as a year ago and there are very few signs that this is not a new hotel anymore. However, there are signs, which probably means that in my regular visit to Vegas a year from now I will not be staying here. Maybe the Encore. There's nothing like the perfection and the new-ness of  a brand new hotel.

The only negative point which I noticed was the fact that the rule about strollers was not enforced. I saw strollers with annoying crying babies on more than three occasions. Given that parents with crying babies can go pretty much everywhere, I resent the fact that they managed to also break their way into Wynn. Shame.",1,1,0

Booked a room with king bed, we arrived at around 9am on Thursday, and the check in line was already quite long.  We had to line up for a good 15min before we reach the counter.   Since we're there so early, we didn't expect the rooms to be ready but to our surprise, they actually have rooms ready for us already so that was great.  We even get to choose the strip view or golf course view.  They also offered us to upgrade to the tower suites for an extra $150 per night but we declined, not like we're going to spend much time at the room.

The rooms are clean, roomy and beautiful.  The bed is super comfy.  The charge $25 a day resort fee on top of room charge which includes wireless internet in your room.  The internet however gets disconnected right away as soon as you step outside of your room.  No wifi in the common area of the property, which is minus for me since I'm on roaming on my cell phone so every bit of wifi counts.  On top of the normal amenities they also provide plush slippers, bathrobes and cosmetic cotton pads.

I do not gamble but the boys do and they seem to prefer going to the casino at the Palazzo.  I'm not sure why though.

The pool at Wynn is packed at all times and an open lounger is hard to come by.  Also, 80% of the loungers are directly under the sun with no shade, which can give you a heat stroke if you chill there for longer than an hour without cooling down a the pool.  I like the adult area the most, it's smaller but with no kids it's just that much more peaceful.  Beware of topless women though, the adult area is clothing optional for women.  Drinks at the pool area is same as the clubs, about $15 per drink.

The Wynn buffet is super popular so be prepared to line up for an hour for it if you don't go at ridiculous time like 5pm for dinner.  We didn't even bother going.

One of the main reasons why we stayed at the Wynn is the clubs, we hit up Tryst and XS and they are both great.  Hotel guests unfortunately do not get complimentary entry into the club, but you can get advanced tickets from the concierge before 9pm everyday.  The ticket gives you line by-pass into the club before 11pm.  Our group has more guys than girls and we all know that's a problem in vegas, but with the tickets we just walked right into both clubs, no problem. Tickets for Tryst is $35 for guys and $20 for girls, and for XS it's $50 guys $25 girls.

As a guest at Wynn we also have access to the Encore pool, but then when we wanted to go to the Encore Beach Club, we were told that we'd have to get tickets ahead of time as well so we passed.  That was disappointing though given how other comparable hotels provide complimentary entries into the pool party for guests.

Other than that, the hotel is great.  I also love the location of it, even though it's not in the middle of the strip.  I like how it's away from all the tackiness of Vegas and I can do without sitting through traffic on the strip. The Fashion Show Mall that's right across from the hotel is also my favorite shopping destination on the strip.  All in all, Wynn is a classy luxury hotel with character.  I love it and would go back for sure next time.",1,0,1

When I checked into the hotel the computer system was down and continued to stay down for quite amount of hours. I tried to get there early to set up the room since I was throwing a bachelorette party but couldn't get in and around 7:15pm I had to go talk to them again since we had dinner reservations at 7:45pm at another hotel and had to get ready still. The only reason they gave me one room key to only one of our rooms is cause I started crying. To top it off they call us at 1am to tell us our other room is ready but yet don't comp us for that night. They had the girls get ready in their spa and then check their luggage back in at the desk. 

Overall the only thing they did for us was give us food credit and comp the resort fee. I honestly believe they could have and should have done more for us since we only got one room at a time and the second room that was ready at 1am wasn't the right one, it only had one bed and the shower didn't work well so we had to have the girls in that room switch rooms again on Sat to one with two beds. 

There was a lot of inconveniences at this hotel that I wouldn't have expected and will not stay there again because of this. There are plenty of other nice hotels that aren't as expensive and will treat you a lot better.",0,0,0

Granted the rooms are annointed well, with full glass to ceiling mirrors, plush red and beige carpet, flat screen TVs and firm  and comfortable beds. The recess lights in the room and marble-floored bathrooms define luxury and comfort. But at the end of the day, there is nothing at the Wynn that is fresh or new. All the above hotels have been there and done that. 

The buffet at the Wynn is mediocre at best but that is a different review. Room service is expensive as can be expected, and the Cafe downstairs in the Casino, while making a mean breakfast bagel, is also expensive.

It's a long walk from the garage to registration. I pass the guest elevator on the way. So after carrying all the luggage to check in, I have to back track to the elevator. Does that make sense? Who designed this place?
After getting to the lobby, I expect big smiles and friendly staff; unfortunately, no. I waited in line for about 30 minutes just to check in. This man name John had this pissy look on his face. He didn't want to explain anything to us and just hands over a piece of paper for us to read about our stay. We asked for a higher floor and he said its not available unless we pay $25 a night for an upgrade that includes panoramic view of Vegas, which we later found out that a higher floor room was available free of additional charge. He just didn't want to give it to us.
I finally got the room keys and headed to the hotel room, but found out that the bed sheets were dirty and had blood stains. Unbelievable to be experiencing these kind of things at a 5-star hotel.
Anyways, after the blood stain incident, we got another room. The hotel was not apologetic or anything. We moved to a higher floor, not the upgraded room but just another room slightly higher than the one we were in.

For God's sake, put a damned Kuerig in my room and take away the trauma other guests will experience by seeing me in all my 7:00 am, cave-dweller glory.

Another thing: How can you justify making me pay $25 per device to get a decent wi-fi signal when the worst hotel in town will charge me less for the room and give me the wi-fi for free? Of course the Wynn is an otherwise fabulous hotel, but the nickel and diming (or here, the Jackson and Grant-ing) is almost enough to make me consider playing bedbug roulette at a place like the Luxor.",6,3,0

Of all the higher end hotel casinos on the strip, Encore\/Wynn has the highest slot payouts. I am offered rooms and other comps at nearly all of the Vegas hotels including the MGM resorts (Bellagio\/Aria\/MGM, etc.), the Harrah resorts (Caesars\/Paris\/Planet Hollywood, etc.), Venetian\/Palazzo, and countless others. None of them rival the frequency of larger payouts than at Wynn\/Encore. 
Here is a telling statistic. I have hit individual slot wins of $1,000 or more at Wynn\/Encore 6 times in the past 3 years. It has never happened at any other property on the strip. In fact, I have never had a slot pull that resulted in a winning of even $500 at a Mlife casino. The Encore\/Wynn also attract a more educated and well-mannered crowd that creates a more comfortable casino floor atmosphere. Either the affluent, but diverse, patrons smoke less or the casino has the most technologically advanced air circulation system in the world. Once you enter the hotel, this will become immediately obvious as your first sensory experience. The courtesy and professionalism of the entire staff is also second to none - including the front desk, the bellmen, the cocktail waitresses, and the housekeeping staff. 
The rooms\/suites at the Encore are also the most elegant, the cleanest, and have the most comfortable beds anywhere in Vegas. The hotel also hosts some of the hottest clubs as evident by some of the hottest, albeit scandalously dressed, ladies on the night scene. I do not recall ever seeing an abundance of over-aged or over-weight herds that frequent some of the other nightclubs in Vegas.
Lastly, no other casino could boast a world-class golf course located literally on the resort property. The spa is also phenomenal for the ladies while you are playing a round of golf or laboring at the casino tables. You may not want to leave her at the pool though unless she prefers to be incessantly propositioned by desperate men (or even uninhibited women for that matter). 
Why am I sharing these observations with everyone on Yelp and risking the possibility that everyone will flock to Wynn\/Encore and it will be over-crowded? Because I am tired of reading reviews that complain about the resort fee, internet charges, or other nominal costs. Staying at a Motel 6 that is conveniently located next to a McDonald's or Starbucks with free Wi-Fi would be a better option then? The resort fee is never charged when it is part of your room comp and if you cannot afford wireless hot-spot service on your smartphone, perhaps wireless internet is above your means anyway? Most of all, I am disgusted with the low standards at the other resorts on the Vegas strip, including the lackluster hotel amenities, disgruntled service staff, incompetent dealers, and the absurd slot payouts. 
Thus, I am hoping that you all frequent Wynn\/Encore more often so that they will be more profitable and could continue to offer me the best comps. On the other hand, if you are too frugal to pay for the resort\/internet fees, or too unattractive to either participate or too insecure to appreciate the nightclub scene, then Wynn\/Encore is definitely not the place for you. Consider my post a favor to help you avoid bitterness or awkwardness.",2,3,0

The casino itself is pretty standard, very nice clean chips like bellagio (unlike some places like Monte Carlo which also has ads on their chips).

It takes a while to get here if you live on the other side or even the middle of the strip. From Monte Carlo if you take Deuce you will have quite a few stops and with traffic that is really bad.

Upscale and great amenities. The pool and nightclub and - again - everything inside - is newer and arguably better than Bellagio to most people... well, I'm not most people.

I have gone a few times in the last year and have spent a lot of money there. However, this last trip left a sour taste in my mouth. I was enjoying a drink at the bar and was approached by a group of men. By that point, I'd already had my own tab open with a few drinks and was paying for my drinks. This had to be like 3pm, so I wasn't there in the middle of the night. This group of nice men offered me drinks and we chatted and celebrated being in vegas. My buzz was quickly killed when a female staff member came over to me and asked to see my ID. I explained to her that I was a paying guest and not a hooker. I had to say this loudly so that all of the men who were sitting at the bar could hear, since everyone seemed to know what was going on. She said that she needed to check ID to make sure I was ""of age"". Now, I know I look good, but I look older than 21. She proceeded to take my ID and give my name to someone over her microphone. I knew right away that I was being checked against whatever hooker list they have. This was very embarrassing for me and my new friends, because they felt like the other bar patrons were looking at them as if they were in the process of paying for a hooker. I felt like I should have at the very least received an apology when they realized that I was a paying guest. I don't care what the next woman does to make money but I've worked hard to get to where I am and to be able to afford to stay and spend my money at the wynn.

The Wynn is located right on the Las Vegas Strip but just slightly removed from the noise and grime further down.  The edifice itself is simple and classy without all of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ""Camelot"" ""Egyptian Pyramid"" decor.  Inside it's clean with an expanse casino.  It's sister hotel the Encore is similar in design with a smaller casino.  

The rooms at the Wynn are gorgeous.  Great views of the Strip or gold course.  Beautifully furnished and spacious, the rooms are a great place to get away and relax.  The bathrooms are fantastic with large whirlpool bath and separate huge shower.  Dual sinks make clean up easy for couples.

For amenities, the Wynn has a terrific gym that is included with the resort fee ($25 per day).  If you do not pay a resort fee, it's $15\/day per person.  The spa offers almost anything you could think of.  The Esplanade at the Wynn has great shopping with designers such as Brioni, watch stores, and jewelers.  The Wynn\/Encore has a Ferrari Maserati showroom but it will cost you $10 per person to enter.  They don't let you take pictures (which is pretty lame actually).  

The Wynn\/Encore complex has great restaurants from Chinese, Japanese, steak, to seafood.  There are more than enough restaurants to fill a week.  

The staff are friendly and helpful.  Do expect a line when you check in if you do so around midday.

Overall, the Wynn is a great basecamp for exploring the Las Vegas Strip.",1,0,1

Upon registration, the lady offered me an upgrade to a Tower Suites Room ""for $5 more per night and the $20 resort fee will be waived.""  I declined the offer but went back an hour later and asked another agent if the first agent's offer of $5 more per night was still valid.  He said yes and proceeded to upgrade me, and handed me a little card with a list of amenities for the Tower Room, one of which is complimentary internet.  When I received my bill, they charged me $25 more per night plus $13.99 for internet.  When I called to have this straightened out, I spoke with several different people before getting transferred to the front desk manager.  He said the agent would never have made such an offer since their upgrades start at $25 and there was nothing he could do because I signed a paper saying I would be paying $25 per night, but he would refund me the internet charge (that I wasn't supposed to have been charged with in the first place!!) as a show of good faith.  What a joke!

So basically, they told me one thing, deceived me into signing a paper that said something else, then refused to honor what they said in the first place.  When I pointed out to the manager that the regular room and Tower Suites room is EXACTLY the same, he said the difference is not in the size of the room but in the extra service you get.  What service???? What private elevators to the pools?? The pools were closed for maintenance so we couldn't even use the Tower elevators, and you tried to charge me for internet service which is complimentary, you fucking assholes!!!!! You would think a high end place like the Wynn wouldn't try to pull some bullshit like this, and when getting called on it, should've been more professional by doing the right thing and refunding my money.  It's not even about the money really, but just the fact that they would pull something like this is so appalling and shows how lilttle they care about customer service.  Whether this was some kind of misunderstanding or not, the professional thing to do would have been to refund the money in order to keep a satisfied, returning customer.  

Well, it's too bad since now they have an angry, dissatisfied customer who will NEVER return to their hotel, and tell everyone I know not to go to there.  So FUCK YOU, Wynn!!!",16,10,3

I was lucky enough to stay here for a work conference and get a good rate (which my work paid for -- yay!). I checked in and my room was number 50 something-something. Based on previous Vegas experiences, I figured that meant fifth floor. Nay, the 50th! Not only that, but I somehow got put in the Tower Suites -- behind its own special set of glass doors, no less.

When I got to the room, it took my breath away. The plasma tv was on, running a slideshow of flowers, with classical music playing. The room was positively massive, with a huge marble entry and giant mirror. The bed even had slippers set right next to it. I went to open the curtains but couldn't figure out how -- until I found the handy pushbutton. Oh, and an iPod alarm clock\/dock was there, too. The floor-to-ceiling windows overlooked the golf course. At this point I was literally jumping up and down and squealing, and I am not a squealer!

The bathroom was probably bigger than my bedroom at home, complete with dual vanity sinks, a huge glass-door shower and huge Roman bath tub. And best of all? Another plasma. I took a bath and watched tv JUST BECAUSE I COULD. And there was a full assortment of shampoos, soaps, creams, you name it.

The two days I spent there I never left the resort. Why would I? Great restaurants, bars, even decent clubs (for someone like me who has little patience for clubs). Tips on that -- they have plenty of free passes in the bars and gift shops for the asking, at least when I was there. That saves you the $30 cover. And I am very anti-cover.

After a problem with a room assignment last year, I received a very nice letter of apology from the Sr. Assistant Front Office Manager. Her apology came with an offer to upgrade to a Tower Suite room the next time I visited Wynn Las Vegas. In case you are not familiar, the Tower Suite rooms offer additional perks over a standard room which include no resort fee, twice daily maid service, and other niceties. I was also offered daily breakfast at Tableau restaurant, located in the Tower Suites lobby area. 
I had the occasion to visit Las Vegas again last week, and needless to say I was happy to exercise my optional upgrade.
So I booked a deal online for five nights (12\/4-9) for a regular Wynn room during a promotion which offered daily buffet for two (up to 3 visits for 2 people, or 6 buffet charges).
I then contacted the desk at Tower Suites and they pulled up my offer letter and the woman I spoke with joked about how I will not need to make any other restaurant arrangements as I have daily breakfast covered (at Tableau) for five days, and also have dinner for 3 nights at the buffet. Great!
I have to say the service across the board was incredible, absolutely the best representatives of the Wynn brand from the valet attendants and bell staff to the front desk and the housekeeping staffs. First class, all of them. And the restaurant staff at Tableau (especially Mary and Alberto) were fantastic, by the second day they knew my name and remembered my coffee preference (and water, no ice). Impressive. Food was perfect, too.
I absolutely loved the room on the 35th floor. Great view of the north part of the strip and also had some amazing sunset views of the Red Rock mountain area. The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in. And the bathroom was palatial. Everything was clean and in perfect working order. 
Even the elevators were incredible. The three car bank that served the 35th floor never had a wait of more than half a minute.
Had a chance to visit the pool and the attendants were friendly and polite and not at all intrusive. And the pool water was perfect, too. I think one of the attendants said it is kept at 82 deg. F. Nice!
The only hiccup came during check out; when I was presented with my folio it reflected charges for all of the Tableau breakfasts, as well as the three visits to the buffet. It also included the daily resort fee.
The woman I spoke with at the front desk was a manager and at first seemed reluctant to remove any of these charges. First, I convinced her to remove the buffet charges as she was aware of the promotion. And then I referenced the letter from management with the offer for complimentary daily breakfast at Tableau. She was quite stern, obviously reluctant, and took her time before removing those charges. 
But when I requested that she remove the daily resort fee she dug in her heels a little bit and told me that since I had booked a standard room and was moved to the Tower Suites, the daily resort fee would still apply and not be removed.
I mentioned that I had the letter with me with the upgrade offer, and she asked if the letter explicitly mentioned ""no resort fee"". I quickly scanned the letter and did not see these words, but I remembered seeing it somewhere in my reservation confirmation letter so I dug through my pile of papers and found the wording ""while staying in your Wynn Tower Suite enjoy...no resort fees"". 
She finally (and obviously grudgingly) conceded, but she wasn't done with me yet. She told me that she would remove the fees ""this time"" but that in the future I should expect to pay resort fees as they are ""non-negotiable"".
Wow...I have to admit that although I was happy to have all of the erroneous charges removed, I didn't expect to get squeezed and beat down like that at check out.
What could have been an absolutely flawless experience turned out to be a little less than that due to one overzealous front desk manager.",0,0,0

Wynn and Encore are my favorite places to stay, dine, and entertain in Las Vegas. One thing i do miss about the Wynn, is the restaurant by Daniel Boulud. things that i highly recommend visiting at the wynn include: dinner at SW, cocktails out on the pond, partying it up at XS, gambling at Encore (for some reason, i have better luck at Encore), and golf.

The rooms are spacious, smartly decorated in a comfortable, subtly elegant style, but most definitely not W-ish.  They even put a piece of art in the water closet.  Very comfy beds for the 4 hours of sleep a night that you're going to get.  Remote controls for the window shades.

The amenities... the spa at the Wynn is on par with the Canyon Ranch Spa.  Great facility!  The pool area has a more intimate feel to it, yet accommodates the huge crowd of guests.  Yes they have the European style tanning pool too, but you should expect to see a few drunk girls desperate for attention taking advantage of that freedom to get guys to buy them drinks.  I reviewed a couple of the restaurants; SW Steakhouse is a winner, the Terrace Pointe Cafe is some place to skip.  Try Stratta Cafe next to the sports book too, great for a late snack. 

The staff at The Wynn go the extra mile and really make the difference.  In comparison to The Palazzo, you just feel like they will go that extra mile to make sure you have a great stay.  Even at the nightclubs, they move you right to the front of the line with a flash of the room key.

The service was great, start to finish - top notch!

We didn't want to pack our plates full of food, so we got some of a few things and shared some bites.

My wife had the prime rib and gave me a few bites that were tender, and with excellent flavor, mmm gud! the horse radish was whoa! strong! but good. 

The meat loaf, not dry thank goodness, also real good!

The mashed potatoes were excellent!

Egg roll was just right, not over the top great, but not disappointing either.

The small slice of pork chop i had was very dry. whah-whah-whah. :-(
I like pork chops, so this was a bummer, but hey, it was one small piece that was probably sitting out to long anyway.

I had a chicken wing that was double crispy... the way I like it, but again, sitting to long and not hot. But it had good flavor and very crispy (a lite breading for crunch factor-not like KFC at all, dispite it not being hot, it was good none the less.

I'm not an expert here, but the calamari with rice and mussels was a great treat for me, i really enjoyed it.

Then my wife and I shared a small plate of crab legs and shrimp.
Both good, no disappointments. Mmm butter! Lol!

buy then we were done, except for dessert. Good thing they have really small portions so you can try a few things and walk away saying you got to try a few.

We shared a creme brûlée, great. then a creme puff, great, strawberry filled crepe with chocolate drizzled over it, divine! a rocky road chocolate mousse, good also, but what really put the whole night over the top and gave this experience 5 stars was the ""Salted Caramel Glelatto!"" OMG this was so good it gets the best in show for any desert to date! 

The Wynn is a beautiful place, really over kill on every level, the casino was elegant, the shops, the food, the marble throughout the restrooms, LOL! the Ferrari dealership next door! LOL! We could never afford to stay there but wow what a great once in a lifetime experience.   

I'm probably forgetting something, so my wife might have to chime in later.

If you try the buffet you won't be disappointed, you'll always have something to make up for what could have spoiled it for you. There was way too much food to try. Go for what you know and like and it will taste great.  :-)
 
To say the least we walked it all off over the next few hours after, man you really walk a lot n this town! :-)

We stayed at Encore during our last visit so we thought we'd give its sister property a try so that we could see what the Wynn\/Encore resorts had to offer as a whole.

Some good points about the Wynn is that it is directly across from the Fashion Show Mall, has a connecting walkway to Palazzo, feels larger and less isolated than Encore, and seems to cater to a younger crowd than Encore. 

However, Encore's topless European pool, spa, its suites, and nightclubs completely eclipse those at the Wynn. Customer service is also A LOT better at Encore. We had some issues with the shower over flowing in our room and although we had the issue taken care of in a reasonable amount of time after speaking with a manager, one of the front desk personnel I spoke to initially was very curt and dismissive - which is uncharacteristic of the resort as a whole.

I am a clean\/neat freak so for me to say the Wynn met my needs in these areas is very rare. I saw few obnoxious drunks staggering around the casino floor(okay, I might have been one my last night there). Every encounter I had with a staff member was pleasant and you can tell that people are genuinely happy to be working at the Wynn. I've been to plenty of hotels that this isn't the case. The dresses on the cocktail waitresses on the casino floor are probably the shortest I have ever seen, yet... in some way are still classy. The Wynn made sure every woman waitressing can wear the dress well :-)

The pool was nice but the ""European"" pool did not live up to the hype everyone had made it out to be. Maybe saw two or three topless ladies late afternoon Saturday but they could have done everyone a favor and kept the top on. Overall, this was not a big deal so, blah... The spa on the other hand, incredible! Steam & Dry Sauna, hot tubs... only thing is that I saw two guys in the main hot tub share a quick kiss and I could have gone without seeing that(they didn't do it in front of me but I saw it out of the corner of my eye).

One thing that I think would make the hotel better. In the rooms, the flat panels are too small and the sound quality sucks. The flat panel in the bathroom serves no viewing purpose and they might as well have a radio in there since all I did was listen to the tv not see it.

I must say that the Wynn is the second best and most luxurious hotel I have ever experienced around the world (beaten only by the 6-star Intercontinental hotel in Vietnam which is unbelievable)!

As soon as you walk into the lobby, it's like you've entered some Vegas version of ye Garden of Eden. The interior decoration is amazing they even have a cute little fake jungle of colours you can walk through. And of course, the casino is great but always smells of smoke. The line to check in is actually relatively short considering it was Christmas.

Oh and the rooms! Oh my God! They're spectacular, and they're very very reasonably priced as well. We paid about $450\/night for a Tower Suite, which was gorgeous! The Wynn is the epitome of luxury! And that's one of the cheaper rooms in the hotel! Of course the prices go up to about $1400\/night for the best rooms, but trust me, you will never feel like you are wasting your money. There was a stunning view of the Vegas strip from our room as well.

If you're staying in Vegas, there is no where I recommend more than here! Its luxury eclipses other hotels in the area (like the Trump) and I can't praise it enough!",4,1,2

Definitely expensive, but they do things really well.  It feels classy while also being completely over the top.  Has a little more of the elegance that is somewhat lost at a few of the other big hotels.  

The golf course is ridiculous and looks like it is in Georgia or the Carolinas and not in the middle of the desert.  Giant trees, waterfalls, lush green grass.  How they do that, I have no idea.

My first impression always starts with the parking lot and if the casino halls are smokey. The structure was easy and the hotel smelled super clean and gave off little to no smell of smoke. The complimentary valet for guests was super convenient.

The room I got was awesome! Super clean and comfy, and on the 56th floor right off the elevator with a great strip view (minus the shitty Trump tower). 

The pool area got packed early, but it was really nice. I swear I was swimming in Fiji water.

I don't always stay at supposedly 5 star resorts like the Wynn but I went there on business and booked one of their more expensive suites. I had a always heard that what makes a really great hotel is the service. Obviously the folks at the Wynn hadn't heard this or don't believe it. 
Our stay at the wynn got off on the wrong foot when the car the Wynn had arranged to pick us up failed to arrive at the airport. After waiting over an hour for a cab we made it to the wynn. We immediately went to the concierge to complain. I was expecting a profuse apology instead we got the ""well it couldn't be our fault because we never arrange cars"". After a 15 minute conversation where we were treated like idiots we had our office fax the email string arranging the car with their manager. So they gave us a lame sorry and eventually sent up a wine and cheese tray to our room.
I could maybe forgive the car incident if I felt any other service was provided to us. but the concierge was unable to find us a dinner reservation in the hotel-something I was able to manage in 5 mins by walking up to the hostess outside one of the hotel dining establishments and asking him to get me in. This guy was the one bright light in the stay--he was able to make it happen.
One last gripe on the service at the hotel-- Standing outside the hotel i asked the bell hop to get me a cab. He said they didn't do that. And that was that. 
Our room was spacious and elegant but for a $1300 a night suite it should be. Unfortunately,  the Internet connection didn't work in our palatial room. Needless to say when you go somewhere on business these days you expect to easily get online. It took over a day to get the Internet fixed and even when you stay in a crazy expensive suite you have to pay $11 a day for Internet access.
What else can I say....the gym equipment in the fitness center was sub par. It is also and additional $25 for use of the fitness center. And during our stay the men's steam room was broken.
If I hadn't been paying so much money and been expecting a lavish experience the wynn would have been fine. But I was paying a lot of money and basically I was treated as if I walked in off the street.

I got a great rate to stay here through the Red Card program, and so booked a double bed room at the Wynn.  I called and let them know that we would be arriving early (at around 9:30). I knew check in wasn't until about 3pm, but I figured it can't hurt to give the hotel a heads up in case something opens up.

Well, after our (very early) flight in, we arrived at the hotel at 10.  When checking in, we were told that they did have a room available for us (but on a lower floor). Lower floor, who cares? Just means we dont have to stay in the elevator as long!  BIG PLUS!

We immediately changed into our swimsuits and headed out to the pool.  The Wynn pool has two sections, the regular pool and another 21+ pool.  I was really glad to see that the 21+ pool wasn't a ""pool club"". Yes, those can be fun and all, but my gfs and I wanted a chill place to hang out, preferably without kids running around and screaming.

The service in the pool area was a bit slow (it took the server 15 minutes to tell me that the sandwich I ordered is no longer offered because she had given me an old version of their menu), and this was when the rest of the food had come out. It then took another 20 for me to get my (pre-made) sandwich. At least the turkey sandwich I got was good and very filling. Also, you MUST TRY THE WHITE SANGRIA. It was probably the best white sangria I've ever had.  Super delicious. 

Going back to the hotel itself, I absolutely love the modern yet whimsical decor of the hotel. I love how the lobby is nice and bright, giving it a nice, almost airy feel that you won't realy find in other casinos. In addition, the rooms are also very well light due to the wall of windows.  You have great perks such as a television in the bathroom (fun to watch while getting ready), to an iHome by the beds (great to charge your iphone if you forget your charger... like me).  Housekeeping comes by quickly when you call down, and the concierge will print out your boarding passes for you if needed.

Beautiful flowers, architecture, and people are everywhere you turn. It's a fantastic escape from the drudgery of everyday life.

Checking in was a snap and there is not a huge distance from the registration to the room elevators. Lovely entryway with trees lit up. Almost surreal. The lighting on all of the Wynn attractions is superb. Especially the waterfall shows by Daniel Boulud.

We snagged a resort room on Hotwire for $117 per night and figured what the hell. A few bucks more than other places, and no resort fee sold us on this property.

The room is a deep copper color and very calming. The bathroom was totally sweet! A separate glass shower and a seat by the vanity for doing whatever, like maybe watching TV right in the bathroom because you can!

Beds were wonderful though the pillow selection is weird. One hugely long and wide one, and on big cylinder one. The flat screen swivels off the wall and is big.

Wynn is at the north end of the main strip which is nice because you're still close to other things like the Palazzo, Venetian, Belagio, etc. but far enough away to keep most from just wandering through. I assumed most of the people gambling were staying at the Wynn since it was cold as shit outside and no one had jackets.

We spent a bunch of time gambling here and had great cocktail waitresses boozing us up non-stop. I think it's the classiest crowd of any casino.

The buffet wasn't anything great, but Daniel Boulud rocked my socks off. 40oz ribeye for two with bone marrow and mashed potatoes! Do it!

They also have a rapid roulette game here which we played for a long time.

Having said that, it will change in time.  If Echelon Place (a Boyd Gaming project) and some of the other projects that were once slated for development come to fruition, Wynn will become prime.  There is still activity down there, but it's slow at this time.  I don't know when Fountainbleu is due to open, but that will certainly help.  Wynn is between the Palazzo\/Venetian and The Encore, which is Wynn's newest property.

I only give 4 stars because as much as I like Steve Wynn and what he has done for Las Vegas, I don't really try stay here that often.  There is nothing really ""wrong"" with the property, I just prefer his older masterpiece down the street.  In any other city, this is a 5-star place.  In Vegas, there are so many options it is hard to stay loyal for long.  However, if you are a whale of a gambler, get ready because Steve knows how to treat his high-end clientele.

As far as the property is concerned, there is a lot to see and do.  Le Reve is a fantastic show that I have seen twice.  I have not seen the other shows and don't even know what they currently are showing.  I know Spamalot was there, but moved on.

Shopping at The Wynn is nice.  Think high-end boutiques as there really isn't anything else.  I always enjoy a walk through the Ferrari dealership.  There is an admission fee, but it is waived if you own a Ferrari.  Who says there aren't great deals in Vegas?

If you need ""regular shopping"" the Fashion Show Mall is directly across the street, which is very convenient.  They have everything.  Nordstrom's, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, and several hundred other stores, topped off with a food court.

Wynn has ambiance.  Encore, next door, has even more ambiance.  They are both fantastic places to gamble, hang out and people watch, or dine.  You don't have to stay at The Wynn to enjoy the best of what it has to offer which is probably why I don't stay here often.

The first time I stayed here was opening night.  It was a nice stay, but they weren't ready.  The television remote wasn't in the room yet, things weren't properly programmed on the phone, etc.  That was all fixed within a few weeks when I returned.

The basic rooms are a decent size, and have all of the high-end features you would expect from a new property that cost billions (literally) to create.  Flat-screen televisions, luxurious bed linens, a nice lounge area, and a lovely bathroom with water closet.  Very nice, but not the best buy on The Strip.  I recall these rooms starting at $359, but who knows what they are getting in June '09.

The Tower Suites are much nicer, but they are pricey for what you get.  If you are a good rate shopper in this price range, you are likely going to steer towards another property (Skylofts, Four Seasons, etc.).  The few times I stayed in a suite at The Wynn, it was in a Salon Suite.

The rooms feature a very cool design with a wonderful entertaining space complete with a full bar.  The bedrooms are full-blown luxury and the bathroom is larger than the bedroom.  The only thing I thought was weird were the benches in the rain shower.  It forced me to think about how well it had been cleaned since the last seating, which shouldn't matter since I don't sit in the shower.  Anyway, think luxury, not bench.  The Salon Suite is also quite large (just under 2000 sq ft), but the space could be used for so much more, in my opinion.  One of the suites did have a cool massage room in it.  The other did not.  All of the lights and curtains are electronically controlled througout these spaces.

The restaurants and great and the room service is great.  They did not cut corners here when I was staying with them and I doubt they do today, at least in the food department.  Everything was served to perfection, even in the room.  That is not easy to do.

I can also tell you that they have several clubs with quite a scene on certain nights.  I have never wanted to go to XS, which is more the bottle service type of place, but if I was in the Vegas club mood and looking to blow some money on booze, I would check it out.  Tryst, on the other hand, held my attention for a bit and is worth going back to.  That bar\/club is located just in front of the waterfall.  A must for one drink.

Overall, my advice is to spend time here, gamble here, eat here, and see a show or two here.  If you stay here, have a reason.  If the reason is you want to dine and see shows on property, by all means stay here.  If you are on a budget or want to get the most over-the-top suite for a decent price, look around and just visit.  There are always numerous hotel options in Vegas.  Regardless, visit the property as it is truly worth it.",2,1,1

The Hotel: Beautifully decorated, there is something eye catching every place you look. Check-in was a breeze and the attendant was very informative and personable. The room was clean (carpet looked like it needed a good shampoo but I guess with the volume of business the rooms see they can't really control that.) The bathroom was clean, it had a large soaker tub which my husband used. We had a view of the strip which was nice because we saw the fireworks from the Treasure Island show. The air conditioning did not work all that well, we set it to 65 degrees (as cold as it would go) but I am pretty sure it didn't get below 75 in that room. *Maintenance even come up to check it because it was hot. They changed the filter and said they flushed the system so it ""should"" cool down but it didn't seem to work.*

The Buffet: Skip it, had we paid full price for this experience I would have been really upset! The food was blah!

The Show: Le Reve is one of my more favorite Cirque du Soleil shows. The stage is in the center of the theater so there is not a bad seat in the place. The story is easy to follow, the music is great and visually it is a lovely sight. I L-O-V-E the red shoe synchronized swimmer girls. *I would see this show again!*

I'm really not a prima donna when it comes to hotels, and Wynn is certainly beautiful, with excellent restaurants, a terrific spa, and lovely guest accomodations. Most of our experience with the facility and staff were very positive. However, as others have suggested here, Wynn struggles with customer service--which is surprising for a high-end Vegas hotel in a competitive environment.

Here's what happened, as I recounted to Wynn's guest relations in an email immediately following our return from staying there:

""One thing marred an otherwise excellent weekend, and sort of
soured my Wynn Las Vegas experience overall. While most of
your staff were friendly and courteous, we encountered a
security guard at the entrace to the pool outside the
Terrace Pointe Cafe who was remarkably rude and unpleasant.
We were exploring the property on Saturday mid-afternoon,
and took the elevator marked simply ""Pool and Spa"" (I'd
taken the same elevator up to the Spa earlier that day) to
the pool. The guard in the tent near the entrance asked to
see our room keys, which we showed him. He informed us that
our Red Cards (which are also room keys) were not room keys,
and suggested that we were improperly ""trying to get in
here"" and should leave. We told him that our cards were in
fact room keys, that we'd been using them to open our room
since Friday, but he kept saying, in louder tones, that they
ere not room keys. Seeing no point in further discussion, we went
back inside.

""We later learned, at the registration desk, that that pool
area is reserved for the Tower Suites. That's fine, and I
have no problem with reserved areas, but nothing indicated
hat was the case, and the security guard obviously had no
idea what a Resort Room key looked like (nor did he bother
to explain, if he knew, what the situation was--had he done
so, in even a professional if not courteous way, we would
have understood completely). Instead, we were made to feel
like trespassers or party crashers, and that's not a
pleasant way for a guest to be made to feel in a high-end
property such as Wynn. Needless to say, I was very surprised
by the event, and it sort of clouded the rest of the
afternoon. I was also surprised that the staff person I
spoke to about the incident at the front desk was, while
polite, not especially distressed by our experience. ""Well, some
of our security guards can be a little gruff,"" I was told.
Certainly ""gruffness"" is good when the bad
guys come around; not so much when directed at guests.""

What's disturbing to me mostly is that we never received any response to this email. I'm seriously not shopping for comps, but I would have expected some sort of acknowledgment from Wynn management that something inappropriate happened, that a guest's experience was clouded by a staff person's poor behavior, but...nothing. Silence.

That customer service failure takes Wynn right off my list. There are many fine places to stay in Vegas that offer a reasonable level of responsiveness and customer service. I would encourage others to find them, as I will.",5,2,0

I've stayed at the Wynn multiple times and it always impresses me. The rooms are beautiful and it doesn't matter which side of the hotel you get because you either have a legit view of Las Vegas Blvd or you get to see the beautiful golf course and Wynn pool. Personally I like the golf course side because it's nice to see some green and water when you are in the middle of the desert haha. 

The beds in the rooms are so soft and luxurious. I love the duvets and sheets because they are so soft and the pillows are really fluffy. Everything is perfect and you are surrounded by sheer luxury. When you wander around the casino it has a very classy, European look to it. It's not crowded like some of the other hotels on the Strip so you feel like you can actually breathe and relax. There is ample room to walk and take in the chill ambiance around you.

They have a koi pond next to the side entrance to the hotel which is legit, and let's not forget the amazing restaurants!! My favorite used to be Okada but they changed that to Mizumi which I haven't tried yet. Red 8 is quite good though and the buffet is nom too. 

The flower display at the main entrance is an awesome place to take pictures =)

The reasons I love the Wynn:
1. Decor: OH MY JESUS. Their floral game is ON FLEEK (I didn't expect anything less for my wedding bouquet) and they use fresh flowers for everything! $$$$$ The ""garden"" (near the entrance) is a fantastic photo op for everybody. I also love their seasonal decor during the holidays. 
2. Rooms: The beds make it SO hard to get out of because of the plush pillows and high thread count sheets. And the VIEW... goodness! Your view will either be of the Las Vegas strip or the lush golf course behind the hotels. The bathrooms are spacious (there's even a TV inside so you can watch something while you get ready) and they have fancy products!
3. Nightclubs: In addition to having such a great hotel, the Wynn properties are also the hosts of XS, Surrender, and Encore Beach Club, which have won multiple awards for being the top dayclubs or nightclubs in the US.
4. Shopping: I have seriously died and gone to heaven because I've woken up in a luxe shopaholic's dream! You can find high end retail labels such as Chanel, LV, Gucci, Alexander McQueen, Christian Louboutin, Givenchy, Dior... the list goes on. Plus they have many limited edition or ""hard to find"" pieces at their stores here!
5. Accessibility to Encore: There's a tunnel connecting the Wynn and Encore hotels which makes it easy to hop from hotel to hotel.
6. Dining: They have a great selection of dining here! I'm not a big fan of the buffet but I really enjoyed my meal at Andrea's.
7. Service: All of the service that I've encountered here has been impeccable (especially the front desk and the bell hop!). They are always so nice to you, no matter how you're dressed.
8. Casino: If you're a gambler, this casino is classy. I've encountered friendly experiences with the dealers and the pit bosses. FYI: The minimums are usually higher than other casinos on the strip.
9. Pool: YAS YAS YASSSSSSSSSSS. They have TWO pools, one being a 21 and over area with European bathing (however, I've only seen one person topless during my experiences here). There are servers that will keep your drinks flowing. The food selection isn't too wide but it's mainly finger foods. If you love Bloody Marys, they definitely know how to make them real tasty here!

This review is about the beauty, class and convenience of The Wynn. I was not a guest of the hotel but did spend quite a bit of time enjoying the beauty of this property.

You walk into a bright lobby which permits you wander into the casino which is surrounded by shops and eateries. 

There are cocktail waiteresses passing you in the casinos regularly to see if they can offer you a beverage including bottled water which is readily available on their tray (Imagine toting 6-8 bottles of water on your tray! Yikes)

They have cleaners around, straightening chairs, emptying ash trays, removing used glasses and cups. 

They have staffing on the floors asking if they can be of any service whatsoever....

Their valet service is by far superior and very organized compared to other casinos along the famous Las Vegas Blvd (aka the Strip)

The eateries are AMAZING.... I will review the eateries separate of this review as this review is strictly for The Wynn...

Upon checking out my room, I called down to say that I wanted a room facing The Strip, instead of the golf course. They said they would ""work on it.""

I called later that night to see if they could move me. They couldn't so I accepted what I had. It seemed like a good room. Very nice view.

It was about 10 pm when I started to hear it. It started out as a low techno hum and as the night progressed it turned into a full blown nightclub in my room. I was on the 37th floor and it was loud! I cant imagine what it sounds like on lower floors.

I called the front desk and told them that I needed to be moved because the sound of XS, the nightclub, was deafening. They said they couldn't move me and suggested I turn on the air conditioning to drown out the music.

It didn't so I wore my noise canceling headphones to bed. Awkward.

The music did not stop till 4 a.m.!!!

I had booked the room for 3 nights. I tried to see if I could get a refund for the last two days or get moved and they wouldn't do either.

So I packed up my bags, ate the cost, and moved to The Four Seasons. Sorry Wynn, I may have stay at The Aria Sky Suites or the Four Seasons from now on.

The Wynn is the highest quality place to stay!!!  We are so grateful that they listened to our complaint and did something about it.  The Wynn truly is about the customers experience!!  Thank you Wynn Management!!!









BEWARE OF NIGHTCLUB NOISE that plays until 5am!!!!

We go to Vegas at least once a year and have stayed at the Wynn each time.  This year was the first time we were there on Thursday when the night club was open and it was horrible!   IF YOU WANT TO SLEEP AT NIGHT DON'T STAY HERE!!! I had heard other people mention that they were kept awake by the nightclubs so we paid extra to be at a higher floor just to be on the safe side (Floor 51).  We were scheduled to check out on Friday morning and after being in Vegas all week we just wanted to have a nice dinner and get a good nights rest so we could be well rested for our long drive home. At about 11pm I started hearing the loud thumping from the music so I called down to the front desk and all they said that it was probably from Tryst Nightclub"" and it would go on until 5am.  They didn't apologize or anything and said that they would bring us some earplugs.  It took them an hour to bring up the earplugs....again no apology for that.  Neither my husband or I got ANY sleep that night!  I have heard that the night clubs at the Wynn and Encore are the highest profiting night clubs in the US so my guess is that they prioritize the night club over the hotel guests. 

Also the earplugs didn't help at all.  Then at 5am when the music finally stopped there was a loud sound from some kind of machine running... that lasted until about 6am.  

The quality of the hotel is great.... very clean and comfortable, nice bedding, etc... but if you can't sleep at night it just isn't worth it!",1,1,0

I'm still figuring out what the theme is for this casino though. I think it's catered more towards Asians though because of the  red and yellow colored theme along with Asian decor\/statues. It's connected directly w\/ their newer casino Encore. You can walk from casino to casino without having to go out of one.

Encore has surrender whereas Wynn has XS for the nightclubs. I've never had any problems with the rooms I've stayed at in the Wynn or Encore. After so many years, the Wynn still maintains cleanliness and hasn't lost its edge like Palazzo or Venetian. The bedding at the Wynn is very plush and comfy, no bed bugs. The pool area and buffet are great as wellCasino floor isn't bad either. Try signing up for a players card or e-mail to get promo discounts!

I traveled to Vegas for 4th of July weekend with a group. We found a tower suite at the Wynn that worked for us. First, night life at both Wynn and Encore are handled separately from general hotel operations and as a result a premium guest pays as much, if not more than non-guests or passers-by. 

To the main point, while lounging at the Encore pool, someone STOLE my phone, wallet, and shirt.  The security team's response was so slow and PISS POOR that even with a million cameras literally everywhere, they couldn't find our stuff. The response from management has been so sub-par I feel like I would have been better off staying at some rat-hole motel. 

This place is NOT worth the money. Everyone has been totally unprofessional and not a single effort was made to help or accommodate us.  Think twice before staying at the Wynn\/ Encore.",4,2,0

Maintenance fixed the shower and left saying ""all done"".  There was no acknowledgement by anyone, at that time, of the inconvenience.  I typically don't come to Vegas to sit and wait for a plumber on my vacations.  

But silly me .... 4 days ago I attempted to stay at the Wynn again.  I called reservations with a offer THEY sent me.  I was asked several questions , I gave my dates of travel then I was placed on hold.  After being placed on hold twice for extended periods.  The reservationists Michelle stated I need to take a screen shot of the offer, place it in a attachment and send it via email to them.  And they will look into it.  Now 5 days later - I guess they are still looking into it - as there was no word from them at all.  Why the run around to make a reservation?

The prices are higher and the location poorer than so many other casinos. I have walked through it, though, and eaten in its cafes and sat at its tables and shopped its stores. And my impressions are twofold. First, I instantly concede its luxuriousness, the opulence of its quarried marble and the breezy cosmopolitanism of its casino and broad avenues of high-end material swag. I thoroughly enjoyed the feeling of monied well-being the Wynn so marvelously imparts. Health and pelf in the land of well-heeled conquerers--isn't this is the impression the Wynn wants to make on its herded masses, and the handful of ambitious social-climbers and delusional poker-playing dreamers who arrive at its gilded gates. 

All that is well and good, but also leads me to my second impression: the conspicuous absence of a theme. Where is the all-encompassing motif that ties everything together with a dash of self-mockery and comic irrelevance? What bemuses me about the Wynn is its utter lack of humor. No pirates waiting to savage unwitting sailors. No Roman gods casting a baleful gaze down on the mortals. No medieval arches, skylit French towers, or faux romance along crystalline Italian canals. How could you pour a billion dollars into a new casino without once ruminating on the thematic premise of the whole production? The only answer that comes to mind is that Steve Wynn is an extremely serious man. Only someone of monumental self-importance could build something so utterly bereft of humor. But without some unifying premise, some self-effacing bridge to the common man, of what use is all that marble and glass and light? 

As the summer of 2008 winds to a close, a second edifice has risen from the sands beside the Wynn, a complementary casino called Encore, suggesting that the first edition of the Wynn received such universal applause that it required a second act. Seriously? Perhaps in the mind of the man who commissioned it, but I doubt this casino will endure in the imaginations of the throngs who cross its glittering plain. Architecture endures when it offers a special interpretation of reality, or provides a clever and enthralling lens through which to see the world: life through the eyes of ancient Romans or modern Venetians or boroughed New Yorkers. Life through the eyes of the purposeless rich is hardly a theme worth contemplating for more than an afternoon...",1,1,1

I get that Wynn is a premier hotel that accomodates its guest thus the high hotel rates. But my stay there was the worst time i have had in Vegas. First it took me 2 hours to check in due to the incompetent front desk worker. 

I tell her i want to pay for the room in cash and put the 250 accident on my card which instead she charges everything on my card apoligizing for her mistake and refunds me back the 200$ in cash. She goes on to tell me it was her mistake that they charged my card over looking the initial first night stay deposit. 

By that point i am extremely disturbed that it is taking me 2 hours to check into the hotel so i request and ask 3 time that the 250$ accidetal charge not be charged and just be held in my account. She confirms and agrees it will not be and the over charged amount will be taken out of my final charge when i check out. 

I thank her and FINALLY check into my room looking forward to the nights festivities which i also bought tickets to XS. At this poit it was 2 in the morning with XS closing at 4 which I though its ok couples hours to get my drink on with no LINE!!! I get in and it is packed as they didnt open the pool side. 

I am no super annoye so i decide to screw it and get some rest. I get into my hotel with the outside weather being about 43 degrees turn on the heater in the room and to my surprise...it is broken. 

Given i paid for a king suite, i imagined something like a heater would work in the room. 

All that aside i has an amzing time with my girlfriend. However i get back to reality in LA and check my bank account and to my surprise a total of 751.36 has been chArged on my card. I call in and the floor manager tell me it is their fault but the amounts of 507.11 has been refunded so no compensation will be given at this time. WTF?!?!?!

The pro's was the service, everyone was friendly and nice. The concierge gave us bottles of water each time we stopped by. Also, while staying there I got to hang out in the lobby and hubby bought me a little present from chanel. There's two of them here, one inside the wynn lobby and the other on the encore side.

Speaking of the lobby however, we went during chinese new year and the wynn does not play. They went all out for this occasion and I really appreciated seeing my culture being celebrated.

These people don't care to listen either. How can I prove to them that I'm not a ""danger"", when my other party is sleeping and NOT picking up the phone? 

Am I supposed to sit on the carpet? Sleep on the carpet, what other solution is there? NONE, based on these people who only have one protocol! 

This is how a regular gets treated. Never again I will come here again. 

I'm never going to spend another dime on this hotel. I'm not upset, I'm just really disappointed.",6,1,0

Cocktails: About 10 rounds of Patron shots. First waitress had the nerve to water down our shots. But, a new waitress hooked us up.. it was all hell from then on. So hammered... lol.. We lost all my money and didn't even care. 

Comps: The Wynn is really generous with comps. Each time we played here we got at least 1-2 comps per players card to the buffet for dinner. 

Ventilation: I can't stand second hand smoke. I thought The Wynn did a good job clearing the air for non-smokers. 

Dealers: Talkative, charismatic, and offers advice. I can't play with stiff dealers.  We had one dealer who went through 6 brain surgeries. My god.. this man is insane... in a good way. lulz. Name is Erik.. look for him.

The Valet people are the worse POS people I have ever seen for such a ""5 star"" resort.

Avoid the valet people, really shameful to see bad service at the first place that makes an impression for a guest about the resort. 

Google or search online for something like ""Wynn Valet Rude"" and you will see the many complaints about them. 

It's just crazy to experience back to back to back bad service and hostile attitude from these people. I think they used to work at Terrible's Hotel and Casino and just brought their 1 star hotel experience over to a 5 star hotel.

Wynn's biggest selling point to me is its location with is beneficial for two reasons.  First, being at the far north end of the Strip, it doesn't attract as much foot traffic as many of the other hotels, namely the Bellagio.  It doesn't seem to attract gawkers and it's no-strollers policy keep families at bay.   Second, its proximity to Palazzo, Venetian and Fashion Mall offers tons of dining and shopping options at all price points.  There is something for everyone.

I also love the under-stated beauty of the common areas as well as the rooms.  We had the lowest-level room and it was still large with amazing views overlooking the strip.  The automation allows for easy temperature control and opening\/shutting of window treatments.  The bathrooms are huge and the separate water closet is ideal when getting ready.

What I didn't like....the walls seemed a bit thin.  I'm a deep sleeper yet was woken up many times by people talking in the room next door.  Comps are tighter than most.  With our play, we normally would have been fully comped at the Cosmopolitan (where we've stayed multiple times) but instead were only partially comped.  Some of the dealers seemed a bit snarky, which I also didn't appreciate (yet others were great).

I love the decor and layout of our room. Our bed was facing the huge window that has a view of the Encore and the golf course. 

They have a pretty cool lighting system where if you want all the lights off, it'll also shut the drapes for you with one press of a button which is conveniently located on your bedside drawers. The room is very clean and spacious for two people and had a massive full length mirror. This is pretty crucial for girls getting ready. You'd be surprised that not all Vegas hotels have a full-length mirror in the room. There's also a sitting area by the window which is a pretty sweet spot if you order room service for breakfast as well a super comfortable tufted couch.The bathroom has a really big tub which can comfortably fit two people inside and is separate from the shower. It also has a his and her sink with a vanity in the middle which is nice because you have a designated area where you can put all your makeup and get ready comfortably.

The room was not as soundproof as you would expect though. So if you're a light sleeper and your room is facing the Encore hotel which is where Encore Beach Club and XS are, you'll definitely hear the music from your room no matter how high you are (our room was in the 36th floor). 

As far as the restaurant choices in the hotel, they're not all that great and have very few selections. We found ourselves walking next door to The Palazzo\/Venetian hotels frequently to eat. I definitely didn't have any luck from their machines either, and for some reason you can actually smell the cigarette smoke in the casino much more now where as I never did before. 

Although I love the room and I can't complain much since our room was comped, I don't think this will be my first choice for a place to stay in Vegas if I'm going to splurge in the room. The only good thing about this place is if you're planning to do most of your partying in XS or Encore Beach\/Surrender, this is a good place to stay for convenience since the clubs are right downstairs.

I absolutely loved the whimsical, elegant and classy decor - from the colorful mosaic floors to the gorgeous flower garden, Wynn is pure perfection. The colors were vibrant and reminded you that you were on vacation. 

There was never anything out of place - if a chair was not flushed with the slot  machine in front of it, someone would swiftly pass by and tuck it in neatly. 

There are individual chandeliers lighting every table and slot machine section, giving Wynn a warm, romantic feel. 

We got to Las Vegas early in the morning but were still able to check in to our room before actual check-in time. There was no line and the woman who helped us was very nice and helpful. 

Wynn is not just big-picture gorgeous, it's great in the details too -- Even the room keys were beautiful - glossy fire engine red with our names imprinted in gold. Too classy.

The casino area was my favorite out of all the others we ventured into during our stay, hands-down - no overwhelming smell of smoke and no cheesiness. 

Our room was just as nice as the rest of the hotel. The floor to ceiling windows overlooking The Strip, huge flat screen TV, the upscale bathroom with a large bathtub and shower, and the incredibly plush bed made me want to simply vacation in our room. 

The pool is also great because there's plenty of nooks and crannies you can hide in and just relax in the hot desert heat!

Dear Mr Wynn,

When I first stepped into your hotel, my mouth dropped with ease. It was like fantasy with flowers, casinos, clubs, and I couldn't be more happy. I expected to check in at 3pm and have to wait 6 hours cause my flights landed around 9am, but you were so kind as to let me have a room right then and there. You workers stopped what they were doing to just give me a greet, but really if they are cleaning the floors don't work them so hard please? 

Deluxe room you say? Deluxe room NOT, but twice the size of my apt room in Davis and that is saying much! A couch with a table and bed to my liking. A TV that moves and one when I am bathing. 2 sinks are you kidding me!? how dirty do you think I must be? Yet, I like the shower and bath separate so I can pick as a please.

Your red card has brought me wonders and glory. The craps table you provided and dealers that stay, have shown me a new way of making my pay.  They kindness that they have shown to teach me what I have yet to know, lead me to making 4x that of my own dough. Don't worry i was kind and tipped to return the favor and trust me ill be back so don't change too much of the table. 

The Night life is fantastic as I love all of your clubs. From XS, Tryst, Surrender, Encore Beach Club, I feel like I'm in paradise! 

Of course I can't forget the most important thing, that makes all of people in YELP happy! Your BUFFET is gourmet all throughout the day, that is why I can't stay away!

It's great to walk around and admire the fresh flowers in the lobby and the detailed finishings on the ceiling, floors and walls. Staff here are very friendly and professional and address you as Sir or Ma'am even though you aren't a guest of Wynn. The stores here are very high end $$$$ except for the Cafe Drug store which has reasonable prices. Just walking around the hotel is great to just look around and check out the elite crowd and feel like a VIP even though you aren't.

Don't miss the Parasol Up and Parasol Down Bar located near the lobby and strip entrance. This bar is very elegant and they have a free lake show every half hour.

I stayed here a few years ago before I had a smartphone so, I'm just going to give my 2 cents on the Wynn. The valet and check in staff are very friendly and we were given a free upgrade to a panoramic view. We had a great view of the Fashion Show Mall across the street and we can see the top of The Mirage and Treasure Island which was pretty cool IMHO. Room was very clean with beige and red colors like what Wynn says resembles a Manhattan apartment. The granite counters tops and the dark wood in our bathroom gives it a very distinctive look and gave me some great ideas when remodeling my bathroom. Paintings on the wall are just replicas of what Steve Wynn owns in his private art collection and you can see it through out his hotel. 

It's great to experience luxury to it's finest degree and this hotel has proved it, along with Encore but that's a separate review. All the staff I've encountered were very friendly and smiling, if you look lost and need some directions, the staff are willing to help anyway they can even if you're not a Wynn hotel guest. 

Steve Wynn has outdone himself again with the Wynn and Encore Hotel and I heard he plans to add more towers if the economy improves and they'll obviously be the dark gold towers with the slant. The golf course is not cheap and costs around $500 but you get a lot of perks with that steep price. The Wynn is not cheap but be prepared to pay top dollar but across the street is the Fashion Show Mall and they have affordable restaurants like CPK and a food court, also there Treasure Island Pirate Show is right across the street along with the Mirage Volcano show.",2,2,3

So now, free of luggage, I get to roam around. But first things first I'm starving.  So I head over to Zoozacrackers for a salad.  Pretty good, doing some serious people watching now.  It's always comical in Vegas.  Now that I'm full, I begin to take a gander around the hotel.  It's gorgeous.  If you get a chance to watk through it , do so.

Family arrives, yea, we get our rooms.  Tower Suite of course.  Wow, incredible.  Room over looks the golf course and part of the pool area.  That's pretty high up.  We decide what to do about dinner and head out.  Mean while I had already scoped out some after hours eateries and the Buffet.

A lot of people complain that the Wynn doesn't have a personality and resembles a '70s office building, but I find the beautifully flowing architecture of both the Wynn and the Encore to be wonderful.

Attention to detail and seasoning are exquisite, here at the Wynn buffet. My family and I make it a point to visit the Wynn buffet EVERY time we're in Vegas.

Le Reve, the Wynn's signature show, is also AMAZING and one of my favorite shows on the Strip by far. I didn't know much about it, so I went in with no expectations, but was blown away by the athleticism and grace of the performers.

Would DEFINITELY recommend this hotel...",1,0,0

I think I know a thing or two about how to deal blackjack and  what attitude an personality u need to have..u would think especially in Las Vegas that all the dealers are  a little more up beat. I ran into a dealer by the the name of STEVE who was an elderly dealer with two gold bracelets on his right wrist and fairly not so nice attitude. I didn't think much of his persona or attitude because frankly he didn't have one and the part that got me pissed off to even say I will NEVER step foot into Wynn again is that he told me I didn't know how to play blackjack. I asked him clearly and asked him to repeat what he said and bluntly he said ""you do not know how to play blackjack"" joking or not joking as a dealer who make most of their money from tips should clearly be fired. It doesn't matter if your are a $10 player or a millionaire whale!  You NEVER, NEVER.  ever under any circumstance say those word to anyone even if they don't know how to play.

I've visited the Wynn in Macau and was impressed by the atmosphere and decor but actually staying at the Wynn in Vegas meant so much more. The service they provided from check-in to check-out was exceptional. They were very tentative and concerned even when it came to housekeeping. The prices for things aren't cheap, but go figure you are in Vegas and the Wynn is a luxury resort. It's huge and it's a great place to stay. We had a panoramic view room that was beautiful, neat, and clean with a fantastic view of the strip. The beds were clean and the sheets were great (because of the 800? 900? thread count) The minibars were stocked with drinks and snacks and the bathroom was tidy as well with some cute stuff, a big tub and a nice shower. I'd recommend it to anyone and I also plan on returning there. I've stayed at quite a few hotels\/casinos on the strip in Vegas and the Wynn is by far my favorite and my hotel of choice (even over a luxury suite at the Vientian). YAY FOR THE WYNN!!

The Wynn is a gorgeous luxury hotel. It was pretty much everything you'd expect for the price point. Our room was beautiful, the bathroom was a spa-like oasis, and the lobby was one of the classier environs in Vegas. We ate dinner in the hotel one night at La Cave and the meal was wonderful; I have no doubt the other restaurants are also excellent. To enumerate the many, many positives of this hotel would be repetitive of the other reviews.

A few things I'd fix: Housekeeping came early every day (before 11, possibly earlier) and left a sign on our door that they couldn't clean due to our Do Not Disturb sign. We had to call and request the room cleaned every day, and typically it gone done quite late after that. I think it would make sense to make the default cleaning time a little later, especially in a city like Vegas known for late night hijinks.

Despite its beauty, I'm not sure the Wynn casino is a good fit for my tastes. I'm not much of a gambler, and if I do play, I'm probably not betting much money. The Wynn caters to a high rolling crowd. As a result, I found myself going to other, more moderately priced casinos for entertainment. Ditto the shopping; it was fun to window shop at Alexander McQueen and Prada, but I'm not the type of person who's going to actually buy anything there.

I highly recommend the Wynn to you, classy traveler. You will love it. For me, I  might select something a bit less high-brow on my next Vegas jaunt.",1,0,0

Most of all, they seem happy to work there, and it makes a big difference in a guest's experience.

We've stayed at Wynn and Encore in everything from a standard King room to a Salon Suite. Every room has been clean, beautiful, and stylish.  In-room dining is delicious and quick, and the wait staff is very friendly and accommodating.  The casino allows smoking, but you'd barely know it.  The air is well-filtered, and unless you're sitting right next to a smoker, it's very breathable.  The shopping is first class, and there are plenty of awesome dining and drinking stops throughout the building.  (Okada\/Mizumi - yummm).  In the summer, the pools are a little crowded, but awesome.

It is a true masterpiece of luxe accommodations and comfortable surroundings. I tend to stay at very few places when I take a trip to Las Vegas and Wynn is definitely one of them. With a Ferrari\/Maserati dealership, gaming, great entertainment, a fantastic suite, a Tom Fazio\/Steve Wynn designed golf course, shopping and wonderful restaurants, Wynn has everything one would need. Be forewarned though, because possession of great amenities does not necessarily translate into delivering of said great amenities.

Let us begin with our stay shall we? Every now and again I receive a handsome letter from Wynn inviting me to have a stay with them. I, always happy for a holiday, oblige and call a phone number indicated in the letter and set a reservation date. Upon my latest arrival, I was greeted with a genteel but lame staff who could not find my reservation. After sorting out the matter, I was escorted to my suite and was bemused by the superior accommodations.

Feeling a bit famished, I decided to treat my weary nerves to a dinner at, what I consider the best restaurant in Las Vegas, SW steak house.

I eat here every time I am in Vegas because of its culinary prowess. My latest visit was no less than a delightful dinner, of which I have grown accustomed. What I am not accustomed to however, is the degenerate and bumbling waitstaff that was slow, ignorant of daily specials and customer needs. I waited and waited for my drinks to come and then again to be refilled. Don't ask about the appetizers!

After having my patience and loyalty tested, I decided to cure myself with some shopping.

Cartier, Chanel, Rolex and Brioni are but a few of the resident luxury purveyors found within the esplanade of Wynn and I freely availed myself to them and felt much better. Another great gem found within Wynn is the Ferrari\/Maserati dealership and accompanying showroom. Already having a few cars of my own, I decided to seek my next purchase.

Now what I found was the most offensive part of Wynn was the simple, smallest detail that threw me for a loop and left a bad taste on my expensive palate. If you would like to see the Ferrari collection, one has to pay $12 to do so. What the hell? Does Wynn really need every cent it can get it's hands on? The one caveat is that if you are a current Ferrari owner, then you get in free... HOWEVER, you must show proof, ie. through showing a key to your Ferrari. I am on holiday! Why in the hell would I carry a key to a car I am not driving? This is an absolutely ridiculous and utterly stupid request to make of people visiting Las Vegas.

Suffice to say, I was abhorred and left Wynn in a huff to the Mansion at MGM Grand. At least they don't ask me for the keys to my mansion! Wynn is still a grand place to stay though. With a great feel, less crowding than other hotels, a host of amenities close by and fabulous dining and shopping, Wynn is still on my list. Just don't try and look for another Ferrari... now to find my keys.",0,0,0

When I ordered a drink at the blackjack tables, they told me they no longer serve Grey Goose vodka.  WTF?  You're a AAA 5-star, 5 diamond property and you don't serve top shelf vodka?  My options were Skyy, Smirnoff or Stoli.  None I would consider worthy of drinking on the rocks.

Next, if you're looking for something to eat late night (you know...4th meal), the only options are the microwave sandwiches at the Cafe they throw on a George Foreman grill at the last minute so they can call them ""paninis"" or room service.  There is no food court.

One of the days I was able to wake up early enough for breakfast, my friends and I wanted to try the buffet.  They had a 1 hour line that looked as if it went all the way to the golf course at the back of the property.  Zoozacrackers Deli was not much better, in terms of service.  It was a 35 minute line just to place your order.

Finally on check out day, we weren't allowed to get a late check out (wanted to stay in the room an extra 2 hours before my flight) and couldn't check out through the TV.  Went to the front desk to check out where a gal took my information since the counter people were so backed up, left her my email address to send the receipt and am still waiting for the receipt to arrive.

I thought it was nice to bring my wife to this hotel for a weekend after a couple of stressful months. It wasn't even 24 hours before my keys stopped working. I went to the front desk to get them fix which was fine. My keys didn't work, so I went back again. The second time around, I was getting some attitude from the person at the front desk. When the keys still didn't work, I called down to the front desk, and then they said they'd send someone up. I waited for 15 mins without anyone showing up, I called down to the front desk again, getting some serious attitude again. In the end, my lock was fixed by the engineer (who was great) but this whole event took up over an hour, and cost our opportunity to go out with our friends because
a) We could no longer get into where we wanted to any longer, since it was so late.
b) My wife and I were way too tired after dealing with this whole problem.

Seriously Wynn, I'm paying so much for this hotel and all I get is attitude. I would have canceled my second night if I could and definitely will not be staying, gambling or dining at the Wynn again.

Honestly, if the staff at the Wynn had simply apologized, and not tried to make me feel like I was causing them trouble, then everything wouldn't have been that big a deal.

Good afternoon, sir.  I wanted to express my utmost and sincerest gratitude for allowing me to rob your beautiful and amazing casino BLIND over the past three days.  
As I write to you from the comforts of one of your many casino bars, indulging in one of the greatest Bloody Mary's ever to touch my soft (yet still extremely masculine) lips, I am reminded just how much I am looking forward to many more financial and deviant conquests I will have of your casino in the future.  I will also make sure to pack more lubricant (how does cherry flavor sound?) for the next time as I completely ran out during the numerous thrusts I partook in during my stay here on the beautiful Las Vegas strip.  

Your 'Wheel of Fortune' slot machine, craps and three card poker tables were especially sexually gratifying for me.  Please explain to the #2 Blackjack table to NOT worry about catching any diseases from me as I am completely STD-free and was just fine not incorporating the use of a condom after only the second hour on the casino floor.  

In summary, I will be anxiously awaiting your personal correspondence, via mail, inviting me back all the way from Miami Beach just to make your casino my bitch again.
Thank you for the lovely time and please excuse the mess I made on top of Roulette Table #5 as I was a bit ""premature"" during a particular late night thrashing.  Please feel fee to utilize a blacklight more than once during the cleanup.

Wha....all of the San Francisco people were a little terrified at the disregard for the environment and the tackiness of taking a limo 4 blocks, but WTF, we were in VEGAS and they forced me to slide into the air conditioned plushiness. 

Anywho, we had great rooms in both the Tower Suites and the Resort Rooms, and were treated very well by the staff.  This was a challege considering the manners of 36 drunken bachelor\/bachelorettes who also comandeered three separate pool side cabanas.  I imagine the others in the VIP section were non too thrilled to watch us display our cannonball techniques and also to watch us push an injured (only mentally) friend into the pool in a wheelchair.   Seriously, that did happen.  

I must give them five stars for accomodating our every whim, and I mean every whim (**um yes, roomservice, do you have masking tape, hairspray and a hot glue gun?  Yes, thanks...).  They were also great when they avoided staring directly at the strippers who were alternately grinding on various party participants while I signed for the bottles of champagne....as if its an every day occurance to see three strippers molesting a tiny female bachelorette on the couch....oh wait.....",0,1,1

I have been visiting Vegas frequently for the past decade and have stayed in multiple hotels in that time.  Even though I can stay for free at other hotels on the strip, I now choose to pay (a discounted rate for being a Red Card casino players club member) and stay at Wynn.  

The hotel and casino are beautiful.  Amazing floral creations, vibrant colors, high end shopping and great restaurants and bars.  You can even shop for a Ferrari!  The rooms are spacious with a double sink in the bathroom and a heavenly bathtub.  Floor to ceiling windows with amazing views.  After stumbling back to your room ready to crash, push one single button and the drapes, lights and everything shuts down!  Pretty cool.  Molton Brown shampoo\/conditioner, body wash and lotion awaits you...high end stuff!  If I don't use it all, it goes home with me!  

Lots of great restaurants, both casual and fine dining.  You can make reservations for all of the fine dining and some of the casual as well.  The restaurant hostesses are the reason Wynn gets knocked down a star.  They are such pretty girls, but some have such attitudes.  This has happened on more than one occasion.  When you work in the service industry, your job is to make the customer feel special, not act like you're being bothered by them!

Overall, I love this hotel and I will definitely continue staying here.  Make sure to get a Red Card players card or sign up for Wynn Insider on their website to score discounted room rates.

Is advertised as a fine luxury resort that takes care of your needs so you can enjoy your stay. Sadly, it does not meet up to the standards they claim. Valet  was nice- informative and quick.

Checking in was nice as well with the efficiency of it's service, and same goes for the room service which is a great plus. 

Sadly, everything else is not up to par.
We booked several shows via the Wynn - since the staff offered by email and phone that they can handle booking and printing out the tickets and shows for us in advance in their concierge.

After waiting for 15-20 mins of Jason calling and speaking to both his manager and the staff at the MGM where we purchased out tickets he was able to print out our immediate showing of KA tonight ,but notified us that we would have to pick up our tickets for O at the MGM. 

I find that to be a hassle -- especially since we were out and about and could have stopped by to pick up our tickets then and there rather then picking them up after our show ( if they are not busy and still open) and have the hassle of carrying them around for the rest of the night. 

The other matter that displeased me if this resort is the fact that they kept asking me if what occasion we are staying at the Wynn for many times and there was nothing to show for it. Why ask? No chocolate,  breakfast , or bottle of champagne. I've been to plenty of hotels and resorts where they offer some sort of complimentary dessert of some sorts or champagne to mark the special occasion.

We thought it was weird, considering we left them neat. 
* Board shorts, stolen out of the dirty clothes bag
* A bunch of Victoria Secret underwear
* While at our lily pad at Encore Beach Club flip flops stolen.
Then the hotel concierge hands us these nasty little brown prison looking slippers, and says, "" Sir, you can;t go in the hotel barefoot."" ... ""uh OK! , I wouldn't be effin barefoot if someone in your Club hadn't jacked my flip flops.

So back home after reporting the 3 incidents of theft and a few days pass. I receive a letter and it has a claim number, no items were ever recovered, And the hotel states that they determines there was no hotel personnel misconduct. REALLY?!

I moved a chair to exercise and there was a condom underneath it, I kid you not. Obviously, the cleaning lady missed it.

When the cleaning lady came the next day, she kept claiming that it was spilled coffee, which is funny because there are no coffee makers in the rooms!
I guess we could chalk it up to bad luck, twice.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice hotel but if you stay there enough times, you start to notice things.

My suite at the Wynn on the 32nd floor of the resort was perfect.  It overlooked the golf course and the amenities were amazing.  Everything was worth it and the hotel staff was great.  As a result, I got some amazing sleep (electric blackout curtains are a must!).  My only gripe was the lack of an ice machine on our end of the resort.

This place far outstrips any other hotel in gambling ($10 min craps even on Friday night outside of XS including fast complimentary drinks), food (Society Cafe), pools, and entertainment (XS, Tryst, & Blush).  

I definitely wish I stayed and just got faded at the Encore pool instead of wasting time at the Tool Academy reject party at Tao Beach.  The adult pool at Encore is fun.  You can hop right out of the pool and gamble.  Towels and water bottles are provided poolside which is a great service for guests.  Don't expect topless at the European pool - its mostly plastic cougars milling about for guys on 'roids.  I'd also advise hanging out at the Wynn pool if you have a large group since there will be plenty of space for you.

USEFUL: Go to the ""Drug Store"" - ask around... the small bags are $10 and the large ones are $50... j\/p.  Anyway, the pharmaceutical-less ""drug store"" is a misnomer but it is what they call their little convenience store on the casino floor.  By the register they will have free passes to tryst, blush, and XS.  This will save you the stress, time and $ to get into any club there.

the next day we go to get our car from valet (which has been sitting there for 2 nights now) get in drive out of the driveway onto the street- when it feels like ive all of a sudden lost control. I pull over at a gas station as soon as there is one available and notice a HUGE SCREW in my tire. WTF?!??!?! after allllll this and now a screw in my tire???

i call the hotel immediatly to let them know what happened. They want me to drive back and make a claim - they want ME to PAY for it and then they would ""possibly"" reimburse me after they investigated. No freaking way! 

if i had done that to my tire it would have been totally or at least partially flat 2 1\/2 days later. I asked for a manager.....


he told me the same story. I explained to him this whooooole situation over the whole course of our stay and he tells me well you can get it fixed and we will figure it all out when you get here. UM excuse me??!? how unprofessional is that?!?!?

we happen to be at a gas station thats also a shop so they fix it no pob for $20. I go back storm up to the front desk ask for the person i spoke with on the phone and hand them my reciept.

okay miss we will give you $20 credit as a courtesy to your room. NO! i tell them you will effing not you will give me $20 cash right now 


3 managers later i tell them look- im not tying to swindle you there is the reciept its $20 not $1000 wtf is the problem? they finally just give me the $20 to shut me up.

we had put the ""do not service"" sign up this time and when we get to our room........its clean. 


 and let me just mention that when they went for another mngr i took a peek at the screen 


that ""upgrade"" we got for our troubles- yea it clearly stated upgrade due to overbooking.

There's not much I could add to the other reviews regarding the beauty and luxury of the Wynn.  So I'll write my review based on staying at the Wynn with a baby.  The Wynn is as baby friendly as it can get in Vegas.  They provide a complimentary crib with J&J baby toiletries.  Since I have a baby I didn't leave the Wynn for very long and mostly spent my days at the pool.  I'd been to Vegas many times before and didn't feel the need to sight see.  The pool was beautiful and my baby loved to go in the water and splash in the pool.  On Memorial day weekend the pool gets very crowded and you would have to stake out a place early to get a chaise. I would've preferred to go on a non holiday weekend.  There were plenty of waitesses to come by to take food and drink orders and it's very easy to charge to your room.  

I'll also have to mention I ate only at the Wynn and Encore and it's very convenient to go to the restaurants as they welcomed the baby.  Of course, I didn't try any place too upscale and only ate at the Terrace Point Cafe and the Cafe at the Encore.  The food was decent, although nothing to rave about.  Next time if I can manage a night without the baby I'd love to try one of the upscale restaurants.  

There's also some shows at the Wynn\/Encore like Le Reve and Garth Brooks for evening entertainment and shopping like Chanel, Hermes, Dior, Cartier - almost anything a girl like me can dream of.  Best of all you can do all of this without leaving the Wynn\/Encore resort.  

The customer service is spectacular.  I actually didn't have much interaction with the staff since everything was running smoothly except of course for the waiters and waitresses.  What impressed me most was my husband accidentally knocked over the controls that regulated the temperature and lighting.  The screen actually broke and we confessed upon check out that we had broken it.  I was expecting some crazy charge, but the reservationist said there was no charge and she would make a note of it.  The answer was very customer service oriented and short.  Made me feel good to be honest about breaking something.  United Airlines has a lot to learn from the Wynn (see my review on my United flight).

After this Encore dining experience, I made the walk over to the Wynn for the first time in longer than I can remember.

Now I know why it had been so long. Honestly, the Wynn does nothing for me.

The big casino floor is just flat out boring and while everything is well-maintained, it feels out of date. And keep in mind that I was in there walking around in the evening, not in the morning or afternoon or late at night.

Same can be said for the Race & Sports Book and the bar adjacent to it. I fully intended to sit down in there, have a cocktail and watch some of the Monday Night football game. However, I was in and out of there in minutes and actually felt bad for the few people sitting in there watching the game because it screamed ""Loserville."" There also was no in-game wagering offered, which keeps people invested in a primetime football game no matter how much time is left OR the current score. (Hello!!! Who's running this book anyway and why are they stuck in the 1990's?)

Employees seemed as bored as the atmosphere overall and it just did not feel like anybody was having fun at all.

Because I was planning to do some gambling before this place sucked the wind out of me, I approached the Players Club desk to join their Red Card program. The male employee who signed me up almost made me feel unwelcome to do so. At one point he asked why I come to Vegas from Florida and I told him that I play a lot of golf. He asked if I knew of their ""Championship Golf Course,"" and then offered absolutely no additional information on how I could potentially play it. (Look, I never even attempt to get out on this golf course because it is insanely overpriced. I think the current owners would love to build condos or parking on the land instead, but the previous owners mandated that the course would not be bulldozed. Therefore, the golf course is absolutely wasted and attracts few passionate golfers like me who would truly appreciate it.)

Because the Wynn was such a major buzzkill, I headed back to the Encore where just the feel of the place (and the always impressive female staff and club crowd) hit me like a Red Bull for a second wind.

Maybe the Wynn is now just for older guests who want their gambling, drinks and dining accompanied by plenty of peace and quiet. If this is the case, why the heck does this crowd travel to Vegas in the first place? How many times can you look at the Bellagio fountains, watch yet another Cirque show and ride that new ferris wheel that the Linq tells its employees NEVER to call a ""ferris wheel"" before you realize you would have been better off staying home and simply going to the movies after dining out at Texas de Brazil?",5,4,0

Yes, the room is very stunning and took a hole out of our pocket.  The hallways itself was already making the walk special.  Once inside, wow.

Everything is weight sensor on there.  I like the set up, L shape couch with a flat screen that turns to view on the bed or couch. 

Ladies, my gf loves the bathroom.  Very nice and roomy.  Has a little seat that you can sit on and apply make up with a circular lite mirror. Duel sinks.  Your welcome.

We had a deal on the booking.  2 night stay, $50 in gaming, 2 tickets to Le Reve = $500.  Not bad since one night at Wynn is around $299?

While the hotel and the rooms are luxurious, customer service isn't as great and things just aren't at the level you would expect a Steve Wynn hotel to be at.

Check-in, where the hotel should be trying to make its best impression, was miserable here.  The reception area looks pretty, but the individual lines are confusing.  What was the worse thing about check-in was the hopeless customer service.  We had arrived early by about an hour and were told that in order to get two rooms together, we would have to wait until 3 pm.  Fine with us...I just wish that they could have directed us to someone who could hold our luggage while we waited out that one hour.  There are no seats anywhere near reception, unless you count that little bar out in the veranda overlooking the waterfall and ""lake.""  Even then you had to have a one drink minimum to sit out there.

We check back at 3 pm, only to be told that only one room was ready.  The other room didn't become available until 5:30 pm - way later than what was initially promised to us.  That room had wet carpets from a recent cleaning.  We complained and they moved us to a different room on another floor, which had a TV that didn't work, a restroom light that was burned out, and missing glasses.  So after a full afternoon of stress, we ended up on different floors anyway.  

Now, if maybe this was a Best Western or a Motel 8, we wouldn't have cared so much.  But this is the freaking Wynn, supposedly the most luxurious hotel on the Strip.  We expect that a stay at the Wynn will be free of problems and things like a broken TV (an engineer had to come up to fix it)!  A complaint about our check-in experience to the assistant manager on duty didn't bring about much, other than some excuse about how the front desk doesn't get much communication with the cleaning staff.  They did offer some chocolates as an apology, which I thought was just about the lamest apology from a hotel ever.  You comp people left and right and all you could offer to a really disappointed guest was chocolates???  Umm...thanks....guess who won't be back to stay at the Wynn ever again?

They do get stars for having a lovely swimming pool, as well as a luxurious room with the most comfortable pillows I've ever used.  I'd be back to eat at their amazing buffet, but I doubt that anyone from my family would go back and risk repeating the check-in experience again.",6,0,2

Every detail in the room added to our experience, and god it made me want to throw out all my apartment furniture and go to the Wynn store to buy everything.

Very nice gambling layout. A few nice restaurants and a cafe. 

We stayed at a room, that we got to luckily upgrade to 2 full size beds instead of 1 queen size.  We had a great view and at night it was so pretty. Right as we walked in it was real spacious, good layout and the lighting was real welcoming. I loved the bathroom. The sinks with a vanity in the middle. Perfect for 4 girls sharing a bathroom. And as you enter there's a huge mirror so you can look at yourself from head to toe. That's a plus for us ladies before we head out to the clubs and for selfies hahah. The bed was pretty comfy, which is always a plus. 

I went to the gym which is located in the spa area. The gym is a decent size. When you enter you check yourself in. They have towels, water and fruits. There is a few trainers on the floor. in the front is some treadmills and cardio machines. As you walk a bit towards the back there are weights and other machines. The gym was clean and great to get a quick work out session.

On the last full day, while my wife and I were at the pool and our room was being turned over by the maid staff, someone went into my wallet--that was tucked into my baggage--and removed $300. The maid that day was named ""Raj"", as was noted by the placard left in the room indicating that if anything was unsatisfactory to contact Raj. 

We immediately notified the Wynn's security, who came to our room and had me fill out a claim report to commence their ""investigation."" 18 hours later the investigation was over I was told by Erica and Kristen (Erica's manager) in Guest Services that they could find ""no misconduct"" on behalf of the Wynn and that they would be doing nothing. No reimbursement. Nothing. In fact, Kristen actually asked ""why didn't you use the safe"". As if the onus was on me to make sure their staff wouldn't be tempted to steal from me.

I understand that the hotel is in a difficult position to weigh legitimate claims of theft (such as mine) against specious claims from hucksters. But by my lights, their ""investigation"" must have only been a matter of asking Raj if he or she stole any money while cleaning the room. When Raj said ""no,"" the case was closed.

My wife and I are both socially progressive. The notion of needing to lock up all our valuables while we leave our room for a few hours was heretofore morally repugnant, as the implicit assumption is that someone - employed by the hotel - would otherwise try to steal something if it's not locked up. This bigotry of low expectations is not one that me or my wife have. But when we become victims of the very same stereotypical trope that our moral compass would guide against, we feel let down and somewhat foolish. 

The Wynn had multiple opportunities to write this wrong. I even went so far as to provide them incremental photographic evidence that just fell on deaf ears. We were simply looking for indemnification - what must be a trivial amount in the eyes of the Wynn - and they couldn't be bothered. When I posed my situation to Kristen, the manager I spoke to in Guest Services, and asked her if she thought she would feel that justice has been served if she were in my shoes, and she gallingly said ""yes, as someone who works in the industry."" By her measure, it is totally acceptable for things in your hotel room to go missing and for the hotel to effectively say, ""It's your word against our maid's word, and we're sticking with our maids 100% of the time.""

And if you're wondering, yes, we also filled out a police report immediately after speaking with the Wynn's security staff (a process that I am told will take several weeks to conclude) and contacted American Express, with whom we booked the travel. There's effectively no light at the end of either of these tunnels. If you're reading this thread for a glimmer of hope that your situation will somehow be different, I wish you all the luck in the world, but scarcely think it will be if you stay here and are a victim of theft.",8,3,1

1. Cleaning staff somehow throughout my lovely fiances retainer. However, once notified there were ON IT! I will update pending out come of whether or not the replace them.

2. 3 years in a row the drinks at the pool were WEAK! For $14 a pop for a margarita I want to get a buzz on.

Regardless, this is far my all time favorite hotel.

Cheers Mr Wynn!",2,0,3

We visit Vegas 4-5 times a year and since the Venetian opened in 1999 we stayed  there each time we went. You can say we are a hard core Venetian fans. 
This time we decided to have a different experience and stay at Wynn's. After we checked in to Wynn, I visited the concierge and ordered a bouquet of flowers to my wife. They asked how much I wanted to spend so I told them around $60-80 . The least expensive flowers they could find was a dozen of roses for $118 so I told them it's ok but I don't want roses only; I wish to have a mix of large flowers. They said they will find me the best but it could take around  2 hours for delivery. I said that's no problem, we'll be in our room.
After 3 hours passed I called the concierge and asked if we leave our room would they be able to deliver the flowers?
Don't worry, they said - just enjoy yourself and we take care of everything. I felt like a celebrity.
But that didn't last long. When we got back to our room , Instead of a large mixed bouquet of flowers, 4 small half rotten pieces of hyacinth and 2 half dried cymbidiums were waiting for us on the table in a small 4 inch vase.  We were SHOCKED. 
I immediately called the concierge and talked to the manager, Chris. 
I told him the flowers delivered were unacceptable and I would like to change it to a dozen roses they told me earlier. 
To my surprise, Chris told me  they cannot exchange the flowers and he asked me if the problem is the price. I asked him how much did they charge for the flowers? He said total $150.
I told him originally I want to spend $120 so the price is not the problem, the problem is the entire arrangement, flower quality, size of the bouquet. The flowers were dried and half dead and is not what I ordered. 
The manager told me he saw the flowers and he didn't see any problems with them. I told him in that case please came to our room and check them out one more time, because this is totally unacceptable not just in a regular day, but for Mother's Day, it's even worse. The manager refused to came to our room. 
In that case, I told him I would like to cancel the order. He said I can not cancel the order, the flowers are already delivered. 
I told him I don't care it's delivered or not the quality of the flowers are unacceptable and he needs to exchange them or cancel the order.
The manager told me ""if that makes me happy don't pay for it and keep the flowers"".
And he hanged up on me.
I took the flowers to the concierge. I told one of the assistant I would like to talk to the manager, Chris, and return these flowers.
They called the manager but he refused to come to the concierge desk. He told the assistant to take the flowers back, no apologies. 
This experience and the unprofessionalism of the staff was unfortunate. Our family just wanted to enjoy our vacation.
Unfortunately we have another reservation at Wynn in July for my wife's Birthday but she doesn't want to stay there anymore after that and I don't blame her. I guess we'll be back in the Venetian.",0,0,0

The rooms (huge and super high ceilings), the baths, the room technology, the service, the beds, the restaurants (pricey but good), the decor, the pool the casino, the stores (! the stores! Penhaligon at Apothecary...I hadn't found it in the US and always have to order online)- all far supersede any other hotel I've been in on the strip (Bellagio, Aria, Vdara, Paris.) Beautiful place and we got put on the 60th floor with a stunning view for a birthday. Much more tasteful than most other casinos.

HowEVER. Our stay was seriously marred by a bunch of really young kids (children are not permitted in the hot tub, clearly shown in the signs) in the hot tub at the pool. We mentioned something to the lifeguard, who followed us to the hot tub, looked at the group of 7-10 year olds in the hot tub, and walked away. Thats it. I have no idea what she did from there but nothing changed. Oh, and about a minute after she walked away?  One of the kids started doing snot shots in the hot tub. 

Yes, really, a 10 year old doing snot shots in the hot tub at the Wynn. There you have it.",3,2,0

Since their buffet was reviewed well as well, I thought it's going to be a perfect day trip with my wife. At the registration of the hotel, I was offered a promotional room upgrade and quickly fell for it because it only costs me 30 extra dollar for VIP treatment such as private pool & room access and no waiting at the buffet line. The guy at the registration desk described that I will be getting a special treatment that no 'regular people' can get. Yes, he literally said 'Regular People' when giving me a sales pitch and laughed it off when I recited 'regular people' with perplexed look at him. Anyways, the upgrade room was really good and I pat myself that I took that offer from him. But I quickly realized that it is NOT what I was promised. There was no line at the buffet and private pool was so small and completely under the shade made by its own building which blocks sun in the afternoon. It felt like I was just lying under a tree in cool somber day. So I didn't even need to use my sunscreen which I bought for 10 bucks from VONS right before I get there. Well, after spending good time with my wife in the strip by watching great show and having fun at casino, we went to the upgrade room at 2 am and realized that next room's guests are having a 'Hang Over' type party with blasting music on. I called the front desk and was told that Security will take care of them which didn't happen until 4 am. I believe that no security came to help me at all. They just went to sleep after having a party enough and got tired. Sleeping only few hours and with blood shot eyes, we went down to private VIP check out desk next morning and only to find out they charge 70 something dollars after tax to my $175 deposit which I paid at the initial reservation. When I inquired the difference and explained to the front desk girl that I was told only additional $30 will be charged for the upgrade, all I got from her was sarcastic smile and kept hearing (twice) that it is what I'm supposed to pay extra. Although I just walked away from the hotel without asking manager or making a scene with formal complaint, it was truly a bad experience from such a luxury hotel. I'm planning to revisit Vegas at least once a year since I'm a Californian, it'd be my first and the last visit to Wynn hotel. They really need to improve customer service as much as they strive to maintain its luxurious building.",2,0,0

Booked a 2 night stay at the Wynn because of a great package deal they were offering. The room was very pricey but since it was to include their water show ($200 ticket value), I figured it was worth it. That is the ONLY reason I booked with the Wynn as I believe they are overpriced for a hotel at the end of the strip. 

I will give 1 star for the folks that handled my luggage both to my room and later back when I was leaving. They were fabulous and beyond courteous. My original bell captain even took it upon himself to notice one of the lamps was out and so called housekeeping. I also was given a quick overview of the strip and places I might want to see. 

I will give 1 star for the room. It was incredible. The bathroom was laid out like a real spa, I never wanted to leave the shower, the bed was comfortable, my room was spacious and the vew at night was so good, I simply left the drapes open each night. At the price this room was running, I would have expected nothing less. 

Now mind you, I only booked this room because of the generous combo involving a show ticket to what was supposed to be as good as ""O"". Walking all over the strip that night, called the hotel 2 hours ahead of the show to confirm they had an additional ticket on hold for another friend. Was told the show was cancelled. When asked why didn't they notify us, a very rude woman stated she had no way to get ahold of us. HUH? We are guest in the same hotel as the show. How do you not have a wait get ahold of us? She was beyond rude and did not care. When asked if they would give a credit to the room fee she said the box office was separate from the hotel. BUT this was a bundle package. They have to have some relation to each other. 

Mind you, the entire evening was planned around this show. While I do not begrudge the technical difficulties supposedly which happened with the show, I do take issue with being treated like a disobedient child. No offer of any kind was made and when pushed, all she said was that she might give a $50 credit against the resort fee. Huh? What resort fee? Turns out you have a room fee, tax, then a $25\/day resort fee and more tax. Wether you use the facilities of ""the resort"" which I never saw, you will pay for it. 

At check out, we were given a bill for the full visit. When we explained we were to have the resort fees taken off, we were told that is never done; ever. We explained $50 was quoted to us. The gal looks a bit more and says ""OH, I think I see something here about that"". Then she takes of $50. That is it. No more, no less, no apologies, no comforting words, just took my credit card and said they hoped we would visit again soon.  Nope. Won't happen on my watch. 

All it would have taken was some courtesy. Let us know the show we already have tickets for was cancelled. They had our cell phone # as well as our room # for gosh sakes. Offer another show or credit to our room, food, gambling....anything. Pretend you care about this very disappointing news. Thank goodness we called ahead. I had a fancy dress with incredible shoes all laid out for the show. Had we not called ahead, I would have been standing at the theatre, dressed to the nines, and with no show to watch. 

I have no plans to ever allow the Wynn staff to treat me like a second rate citizen ever again. I salvaged the evening by going to the Monte Carlo and buying tickets to the Blue Man Group. Now that was a show !!!!!  Awesome !!!!!!",0,0,1

The bed was decent but the pillows could be a bit firmer. Housekeeping was great, loved how they ""organized"" my mess of stuff in the bathroom. It's the little things that impress a girl like me.

We hit up the gym one morning which was nice. But what really impressed me was the pool! Loved lounging around and sipping on $18 pina coladas. Ah, the life. ""Just charge it to the room.""  Beautiful grounds, comfy chairs, and chill music.
