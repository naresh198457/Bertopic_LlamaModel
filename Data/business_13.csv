After going down the hallway with tons of records, you'll see the counter and place your order. This place isn't that big, probably like 4 chairs and limited counter space. Luckily when we got there it was only us and we were able to grab a couple seats. I got super crowded after we ordered so something must be good. I just went with a couple sausage slices. The pizza was good. New York style pizza is my favorite and this spot rivals other pizza spots I've been to. I also had a bite of someone's white pizza... delicious! That's what I'll be getting next time I go.

Remember you're in Vegas so don't expect a bargain when coming here. This is the strip so it is what it is. Still a good option to grab a couple slices and be on your way.",1,1,1

If you're cunning enough to find this place, then you definitely deserve the pizza that they serve. Lucky for you, it's not that hard to find. 

Clues:
Third floor of the cosmopolitan.
If you see the pool table, you're getting close. 
Hallway lined with album covers. 

This little place only offers about five seats, but guests can grab a seat outside where the pool table is. It also has a pinball machine and an arcade game. Something to keep you busy if there is a wait. 

Slices are about 3 to 4 dollars, and are decently sized. There wasn't too much sauce on it, which I fully appreciate. And the sausage was good, and had a bit of kick to it. They have a couple beers on hand. I can't remember the other one, but the one of the selections was PBR. I was disappointed by both choices, and opted out of getting the beer. 

Overall, awesome place to go to if you're in the area. I just wish this wasn't tucked away on the Strip, because like most locals - I tend to stay away from the Strip and the tourists [who never seem to follow the crosswalk signs, and insist on crossing the street even if it isn't their turn].",2,1,1

However, in comparison to most of what I've tasted around Vegas, this pizza is pretty damn good. And after all these reviews, it's clear that many visitors agree. 

I have to agree with others that the idea of the ""secret"" pizza is pretty cute. My husband and I were quite excited at the challenge of finding this sneaky spot. It's true that there's no sign to be found and it's down a random hallway in a random spot of the Cosmopolitan. However, it's clearly not much of a secret anymore and with the hints other Yelpers gave before me, my husband and I found its ""secret"" location in about two seconds. That was a little bit of a let down. Maybe to keep things spicy, Secret Pizza should move its location around. I realize this may not be the most practical idea, but it certainly would keep customers on their toes! ;)

I'll keep this simple since the gazillions of reviews have already said what needs to be said. The pizza is good. It's not gourmet and it's not incredible, but it's good. I'm sure it's especially good if you're drunk and ready to feed the craving. Unfortunately, like every other Vegas place, the prices here are a bit steep. $24 for four slices of pizza! Oh well, I've come to assumption that good food is hard to find on the strip and this is a quick stop for some tasty pies. I'm sure I'll be back the next time I'm in town.

Thanks to all the Yelpers for their helpful hints!",2,1,1

Well the pizza had a nice crust which is one of my favorites. I had the white pizza with the different cheeses, the flavor was a little short of what I was hyped up on, but I can say I wasn't mad. I should have chosen something I could give a more honest opinion on like plain cheese or pepperoni. I'm sure I would've liked one of them, but I'm not that happy reading reviews and being hyped up on what other people are bragging so much about, being that I'm a Chicago native and I know real pizza.

But, given that it's a business and businesses need to make money, it would be my guess that being ""Known Pizza"" is preferable to the owners.  So, I'd think they're okay with the additional foot traffic.

If you are having trouble locating the hallway down which Secret Pizza is located, the smell and music help.  Additionally, you'll likely see people eating pizza near a pool table, which lets you know you're in the right vicinity.

When we arrived (Saturday around 12:15), there were already around a half dozen people either eating, ordering, or waiting.  So, given the size of the place, this made it kind of crowded.  There is a bar which circles the edge of the room, but only 6 bar stools that I counted.  This is why people leave and eat on the couches near the pool table.  I had a slice of Sicilian with sausage and a NY slice with meatball and ricotta.  These slices are not cheap when compared to other pizza joints.  A regular slice of cheese thin crust is $5.50.  Fountain drinks, served to you in a red solo cup, are $4.  But, you at least get refills, so there's that.

Both slices were good, but I preferred the thinner crust.  The crust was crunchy yet a little chewy, and the meatballs were FANTASTIC.  I want this recipe.  They went really well with the only thing I would call a bargain at Secret Pizza:  the dollar order of pickled hot peppers.  They aren't too hot, so if you don't like heat, don't be turned off on ordering them.  Nice addition to your slice.  The sausage on the Sicilian was also very good quality, and the pizza had a nice crunch on the crust.  It needed more cheese and sauce, the ratio was off.  This became more noticeable given the thickness of the slice.

I'd absolutely return, and recommend you do so as well.  It may not be so secret anymore, but a good slice of pizza is always welcome.",1,0,1

Its a thin crust pizza with the perfect cheesy flavor the sausage are legit sausage slices and not the kind from dominos. The normal red pizza is also really good too and typically they have more options for it available. 

It tastes extra good after you're done doing your business at marquee and have those drunchies. But the line is pretty long because everyone from the club goes there after.

After hearing so much hype about this ultra secret pizza place on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan... this place turned out to be regular pizza - gooey, cheesy, delicious. But not anything out of the ordinary. We came here for a quick lunch before starting the day (around 1pm - Good Morning, Las Vegas), so there wasn't too much of a line. Took 20 mins to get a mushroom pizza. It was a normal pizza - nothing to complain about. I think the appeal of the place is mostly its secrecy and the fact that it's conveniently located\/open to service the drunchie-driven crowd pouring out of Marquee during the wee hours of the morning.

If you get a single slice at $3, it's a pretty expensive piece of pizza. However, the large pizza was split among 6 girls and came out to about about $2.50 each.

Come to think of it, I think their menu just states the prices and some options but that's all I could remember. In any case, you choose from a handful of choices then they heat it up for you. Each slice is about $5-$6. A little steep for a New York slice but I get it since there was an ample amount of toppings on it. I opted for the pepperoni & sausage and a slice of just sausage. I had the sausage that night and it was goooood. They have red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese if you choose to top your slice with it. Without it was still pretty delicious.

This place is designed to be like a small pizza joint with a couple TVs to watch sports.  They just had a few side tables with 5 barstools.  If it gets a little busy, you just have to find space and stand.

-The combination was pretty decent but nothing too special topped with big slices of sun dried tomato, bell pepper, olives, onions.

At $5-6 a slice its really not too bad so it'll be fun to bring along new people as a little joke.",0,0,0

Some old Chinese fool tried to jack that shit from me and use it as his own.

I'm going to lay it down on how to get to this place.   Do not deviate from these directions.

-Walk by all the squealing Asian girls coming out of the club that think they're cuter than they actually are.  Actually...thinking they're cute at all is wrong.
-Five steps past the white girls riding the escalator barefoot.  
-Make a right when you see the Latinas showing off their newly acquired neck art ... hickies.
-And when you see an angry black chick....run the other way.  Fcuk the pizza.

Was the pizza really that good?  I don't remember.  My buddy liked it. I guess I did too.  Not as much as the Reyka tonics I was guzzling down at a frantic pace earlier. Evidently I waxed two slices, made it back to the room, and gracefully blacked out.   I woke up in the middle of the night with a shivering case of mud butt.  That means two things:  

1. It was greasy
2. It was good

I do faintly recall burping up pepperoncinis while on the throne.  I love those things.  Both the pepperoncinis and the porcelain La-Z-Boy.

It's on the 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan, inside the alley next to Blue Ribbon Sushi.  I came here with a bunch of crazy fun Yelp Elites to fill our tummies (& mostly to sober) after our crazy night at the Cat House!  

We ordered a white pizza and a 1\/2mushroom&sausage and 1\/2 pepperoni pizza. I gotta say, I prefer the white pizza better. For some reason, the white pizza had a lot more flavors than the sausage. Maybe the meat was too over powering for the thin crust. The ricotta on the white pizza was so smooth and ""FATTY"". When we held the pizza vertically, the fat was literally dripping!

The dough was too chewy for my taste. It was a little bite rubbery, which I don't think it's suppose to be like that for a true NY style pizza. The wait for the pizza was also way too long. We wait around 30 minutes for the pizza..... which is way too long to wait for any food.

Yelp, you make a perfect wingman, and I love you for it!

This tiny lil pizza spot, is a hidden gem, within the FABULOUS walls of the Cosmopolitan, serving up slice after slice, of mouth-watering thin crust pizza genius!

They don't call it ""Secret Pizza"" for nothing, you've gotta sort of hunt this place down. Even the staff of the Cosmo, is in on it. They'll give you some vague hints, as to the whereabouts of their exact location, but, the rest is up to you, to find the joint! Also, I'm not here to tell you where it's located, I'm here to tell you, you've GOT to go!

Small and tiny, but with nice decor (the walled corridor leading to the actual pizzeria, is lined with album {mostly Italian} art). The actual pizzeria is TINY, with MINIMAL SEATING SPACE! Think, stand and eat, not sit down. NOT a good place, for large groups!

The pizza, is DAMN good! I'm still upset that I didn't get a whole pie, instead of a slice! It's crispy thin crust, NY style! My style! 

You basically pick a slice from their selection of ready made pizzas, and they'll heat it up for you, or, you can order a whole pie. Just be on your toes, because, when you're slice is done reheating, they just assume you'll come to the front, to take it. They don't call out numbers or names or anything. So, if you're not there, someone else may snag it!

I came in at around 2PM, not AM, but PM, and even then, it was terrific people watching! Drunks EVERYWHERE!

The price is pretty damn good too, considering, you're in a 5-star resort.

If you're in Vegas, and you're in the mood for pizza, DON'T forget about this place!

What you want to do is go up the elevator from the Chandelier bar, past the hordes of short skirts and high heels of Marquee, and look for the album covered hallway directly across from STK.

A friend told me about the ""secret pizza"" place, so when another friend and I set up a date to meet, I suggested we try it.  Good thing that friend did some research, otherwise we may not have found it!  She knew it was near another restaurant and that it was a long hallway.  At the end of the long hallway was a pinball machine, making it look like an arcade or something.

We went down the hallway and it wasn't quite what I was expecting:  it was basically a counter with a menu board, and mostly seating facing the wall on bar stools.  For some reason I expected a sit down place, or at least something with more tables.  Fortunately we were there when it wasn't that crowded.

I found the menu a bit confusing - it sounded like you could order slices with customized toppings, so my friend and I were trying to figure out what we wanted since we didn't want to order a whole pizza.  Then we noticed that they already had pizzas ready to serve by the slice - we looked at them and decided on 3 slices:  pepperoni, sausage & mushroom, and cheese w\/ white sauce.  We each also ordered a soda.  The total came out to just under $20.

We cut each slice in half, and that was a good amount of food for us for lunch.  And the pizzas were all quite tasty!  It was definitely worth it, food wise.  The service was just okay - nothing bad, but nothing good either.  I wish the menu board was easier to figure out, maybe describing the ordering process or something.  The seating area isn't that great either, and it was pretty filthy.  When we first got there, it was slow - it seems like one of the workers could have quickly wiped down the counters before it got busy again.

But, nonetheless, it was good pizza, and I'd definitely go back again (but maybe do like what some other people did and take it out into the lobby area to eat).",0,0,0

I swear if I owned a restaurant, I'd name it ""Food"" or ""Eat""]

As long as you know where the 3rd floor pool tables are or where Blue Ribbon Sushi is, you can find it. You're going to experience a style and aura here that you just don't see often. The wall of record covers and the Galaga machine are my favorite touches. Well, they are really the only two touches. I've tried to make it to the top of the Galaga score board but for some reason none of the scores stick.

Now for the pizza: It's New York style and it's ricotta and it's foldable and it's soft on the inside with a perfect crunch on the bottom and it's cheap and it's marvelous drinking food. Every slice is unique and has character. Just like New Yorkers! My favorite is the white pizza. I can deal with deli meats any other day of the week, but when a white sauce and cheese can stand alone that well, then I dedicate myself to it. Just don't make the mistake I did one tipsy night and pound the garlic shaker over your white pizza thinking it's parmesan. You and anyone you kiss will reek of garlic for 2 days.

I give it 4 stars because: 1) The service isn't outstanding. For a $4 slice of pizza and PBR on tap you really can't expect Ritz service, but sometimes these guys look like they're going to go either comatose or Angry Birds on you. 2) When it's busy, you won't find a seat. There's more counter space than stools. (Do you think that was a coincidence? I think not.)

At first glance, it is quiet, discrete, and no frills. Yet when you dig deeper and get to know its personality you find something so much more. I am a firm believer that every establishment has room for improvement. However, when I think about it long and hard Secret Pizza really epitomizes all I would want or come to expect of a pizza establishment. I almost dare say that it was the best pizza I have ever had. 

Nestled in the Cosmopolitan, you would think it would be flashy and glitzy. Rather, it defies that convention and it sits in a nondescript hallway that you would easily bypass. Not that I am saying you should go down every service hallway at the Cosmopolitan, I'm just saying taking the Star Trek like elevator to the third floor above the Chandelier Bar and walk down the nondescript hallway till you find Secret Pizza. Note, the hallway has photos on it to give you some direction.

Once there, you will be greeted by the beautiful smell of pizza. While slices are available in the showcase, full pizza's are available as well. I'd probably call ahead if that is the case just to avoid having to wait. Since we didn't know any better, we settled on a simple pepperoni pizza. However as we waited to order, the guy working the counter clearly could tell we wanted a white pizza as well and mentioned that we could have a half pepperoni\/half white pizza and it came out to be one of the best decisions we made in Vegas. The pepperoni was really good, but the white pizza was much better. Both offered really great flavors that melded in a perfect harmony that would make angels sing. The pepperoni has just the right amount of salt and spice to counteract the fat and sweetness of the mozzarella. While at the same time the white pizza was an amazingly good blend of ricotta and mozzarella cheese. Both on a thin crust that was easy to work with, yet not being very greasy at all. 

Service was good with the staff clearly not only knowing their menu but also clearly having skill when it comes to making their pies. They keep the line moving at a carefully timed rate as if it were a well-made machine.

Definitely a great place to grab a bite, while they may not have seating grab a glass of wine or beer with the pie and head on out to the main areas. It is definitely one bite you do not want to miss.",8,4,7

There's not much to this place except that pizza will be pizza and regardless of how crappy it is, I think I will always eat it. For real though, I will eat it. Here's what the girlfriend and I had that evening:

-sausage & cheese

The minute we walked in we were greeted by the pizza maker, Nico.  He was very personable and explained what would make a good slice.  We start off with a basic cheese slice, a pepperoni slice or a white slice and make ""magic"" at the end.  We told him to surprise us so he made us a white pizza w\/ roasted tomatoes and basil + garlic.  Second slice was meatball w\/ green peppers.  This is the BEST pizza I have ever had.  I used to love Rocco's pizza in Summerlin, but now that I've tasted this, it is ultimately the best pizza.  The price is very reasonable.  It's $3.00 and $0.50 per topping.

This is one of my favorite post-clubbing places to eat on the Strip and the best pizza, hands down. The NY style manages to pull off the combo of a crispy crust and loads of wonderfully cheesy toppings with quality ingredients. I like the White Pizza because I love cheese, and with the piles of ricotta, it doesn't disappoint. 

As delicious and hangover-preventing as it may be, the lines can be frustrating, especially if there is a wait and you're hungry. They do have video games, or you can take a nap on the chairs outside (and people do), but the best time to go is not midnight-3AM when the club-goers are released, if you can help it.

For us, it was part of our Las Vegas bucket list. So this place is not so secret, it's a matter of fact pretty easy to find, tucked away in a corner, third floor at the Cosmopolitan. Both my husband and I ordered the pepperoni pizza. The pizza was just ok and that's not saying much since we were sort of hungry. After leaving there we went to In and Out to complete our late night dining experience.

Best way to describe the pizza, just think Sbarro's when you were 13 years old and your mom dropped you off at the mall. You and your friends having a Sbarro's pepperoni pizza was a fun experience and tasted pretty good. However, here are some differences, Secret Pizza is a bit more greasy, more expensive, your old friends aren't there, and less sitting space than at the mall.

They really do try their best to offer the ""cool"" factor, and what could be cooler than a pinball machine and old record covers on the wall as you walk in. For this place, once you have done it, the odds are you won't be back. But a fun thing to do anyhow if you happen to be at the Cosmopolitan.

We were wandering around Cosmo looking for a place to snack.  The ladies asked someone at the Concierge's desk, and then we were directed to what looked like a restroom hallway.  lol  When we got to the end, it was (from what i've been told) a typical NY style joint in that the pizza place didn't really focus too much on having much available seating.  

We weren't sure how to order at first since they were cooking a bunch of what appeared to be simple pizzas.  I don't recall seeing any kind of signs or food descriptions, or prices for that matter.  We witnessed someone customizing their pizza and decided to do the same.  We started with a naked veggie pizza, and then added on to it.  My wife added tomato slices and meatball slices.  I did the same, but also added some green peppers.  They added the items and threw the pizzas back into the oven to heat\/cook the newly added ingredients.  

Pricing was okay.  I probably would have enjoyed it more though had the price been $4 instead of $4.75 per slice.  Or I guess a bigger slice would have also made the $4.75 price feel better.  But hey, it was a nice snack to hold us over.  ;)",0,0,0

I grabbed a slice of the White Pizza, and it was delicious.  Oily, but still great.  Luckily there was a small line, so the wait wasn't as long as I thought it was going to be on a week night.

Location: In the Cosmopolitan Hotel, it's on the 3rd floor right above Marquee. Take the escalators\/elevator, make a slight left and the location is on the right hand side. If you see a big sitting area, you are at the right place. You just gotta go down that mini hallway and you are there. 

As for the wait, I think I got lucky both times (Saturday night 6PM-ish before XS & Saturday 11AM-ish before Marquee Dayclub), I barely had to wait 10 minutes for my food. The only waiting I had to do was when they had to heat up my pizza. 

As for the food it self, it's pretty good. It's big enough to satisfied my hunger before the club. They have a lot of different topping pizzas, and they make the pizza fresh every half an hour or when they run out of pizza. Although the last time I went, my pizza had so much oil I had to use some napkins to soak it up. 

As for the price, it's cheap! Under 10 bucks for a slice! The only thing that sucks was the price went up a dollar within a couple of months (January 2015  $5, April 2015 $6), but hey! It's still under $10 :)",1,0,0

1. It's no longer a secret.  If there's a line in the entrance, expect a 30 minute standing wait.
2. The pizza is not good.  It could be good if you're drunk and hungry, but as for pizza goes, it's pretty disappointing.  Thin oily crust and coagulated cheese, uneven slices.  One piece I had was about 50% larger than another, but cost the same price.
3.  The place is a mess.  Garbage is laying all over the place, with grease covered condiment shakers and empty napkin holders and virtually nowhere to sit because they have about 4 barstools up against the wall.
4.  Very limited drink selection.  Soda, wine, or choice of 3 beers.

Not so secret with 3200 Yelp Reviews, I thought.  Whether its for pure marketing strategy or for a nobler cause of filtering the unworthy from pure pizza aficionados, we didn't really care.  We just wanted a good pizza.

So off we went to the overly modern, sparkling Cosmopolitan Hotel on a Friday night with the street roaming masses in search of their famed New York style pizza.  Despite having looked it up, it still took two asks on two floors to find the spot.  Both staff members seemed well prepared for the question and soon we were walking down a narrow hallway decorated with records I'm pretty sure even my parents were too hip to listen to.  

The first thing I saw entering was the video game Galaga from the 80s and a couple of pinball machines in a very small square room with no tables and chairs and a busy counter to order from.  Gratification was quick as we moved with the line.  They had four different pizzas ready to serve: cheese, pepperoni, mushroom, sausage and peppers. And basically if you want more topping, they just grab one of these and add whatever topping you want to add.  So it makes it quick.  

The pizza.  Oh the pizza was quite good.  So good that despite my low carb obsession of late, rules had to be broken and I asked for more.  More. More.  Ingredients were quality despite the low price.  As the noise, decor, and the visual overload of a very diverse group of customers nearly tested my sanity- the gooey, greasy, meaty goodness of this pizza blocked it all out for me.

We grabbed up a pepperoni deep dish which was pretty decent, but not close to my favorite. The plus is that its nicely crispy and not doughy, lots of pepperoni  and sauce and cheese in it. Its much more filling than the thin slice so I suppose you get more bang for your buck with that.  

We got a slice of white pizza as well. This is one of my favorites here and the BF liked it a lot too. Its also good with their sliced sausage on it. I think if you wan't something besides a basic pepperoni, I think this is the best one they have to offer. Slices start at $4.50 for a already made slice or you can order in a whole pizza as well (I believe the last time I ordered one it was about $20ish for a 1 topping). Of course, having it fresh made is slightly better than getting a slice that's been sitting. They serve a few beers on tap or soda, and there is a water dispenser out with water cups. Other than that, they serve nothing else - just 'za! 

I think the ""secret pizza"" is not so secret, but if you aren't sure where it is, it's on the same floor as most of their restaurants. It's right next to Blue Ribbon Sushi, you'll just see a random corridor of albums and you'll see a arcade machine visible at the end. Theres some stools or standing bar. You can walk your slice out into lobby of this area as there's plenty of seating and a pool table even.

When I asked for some banana peppers, they guy said they didn't carry that and ended up giving me some peperoncino instead (similar, but a little sweeter imo).

Each slice is $5.50 and with a drink our total came out to a little over $20. The slices are a pretty decent size - although they're more on the thinner side.

Yes, it is not a secret anymore and there are often lines, and yes, it still is hard to find even after coming here several times (maybe it's just me).  

With all that said, I keep coming back and there is something to be said for that.  What? I don't know.  I kind of expect to pay higher than average when in Vegas so I'm ok with it.  I also kind of expect to wait in line from time to time.  Maybe my coping skills are better than some other reviewers.  But, back to the food.  It's just above or slightly above average pizza.  But after a few drinks or a big win at the tables, and it is a slice from the gods.  After a loss at the tables, its the only thing to eat because there isn't much around cheaper or more convenient.

Given the pizza joint at The Cosmopolitan is not listed in any of the hotel's customer collateral nor is it advertised on property and one has to both know it is there and how to get to it, my hubby and I figured this would be more the myth of ""secret place"" hype than good pizza. Happily, we were wrong.

Finding ourselves at the Cosmopolitan about 1:30 in the afternoon one day last week and hungry for just a little something, we went to the Pizzeria. What we discovered is this teeny place makes really good pizza. In fact, my Brooklyn born and reared hubby thought it a good rendition of New York style pizza and coming from him that is high praise. It was the chewy, foldable crust, he said, and just the right amount of sauce and cheese. 

A generous slice was about $3.50 so a good value for Las Vegas eats. Pies are sold whole too. 

The VERY little pizza shop has standing at counter space for maybe eight - and another two spaces that are low enough to be used by both people in wheelchairs and shorter people...love universal access like that. 

But you could not get my claustrophobic self to stay in that little space to eat, so we walked to the lobby outside the Pizzeria and enjoyed our slice in that ""game room"" setting with a pool table, board games, low tables, chairs and sofas scattered about and multicolored glass lit ceiling above. 

And here goes a nod to the very nice Security guy who walked over to talk to us. ""Oh oh"" I thought, ""we're probably not supposed to be eating pizza here."" But as it turns out, he wanted to simply ask how we liked the pizza and being from New York himself, he agreed with my hubby that it was very good indeed. He introduced himself as Chris (Cosmopolitan staff do not wear name tags - a tactic that is part of a service strategy to get the employees to introduce themselves to guests) and asked if he could answer any questions about The Cosmopolitan for us. That kind of friendly approach from customer facing employees was consistent with every one of our experiences at the hotel, by with way, with the exception of the staff at the Chandelier Bar on the second floor.  ( But that's another review.)  We made sure to leave the lobby table as clean as we found it. 

Pizzeria opens at 11a.m. and stays open until sometime in the wee hours of the morning. 

Here's how to get there (see photos included to illustrate): 

a) Take the elevator near the Chandelier Bar to the third floor. When the doors open you'll see the lounge with the pool table in front of you. 

b) Make a hard right hairpin turn as you exit the elevator and you'll be in the short hallway that leads to the tiny Pizzeria.  You'll see a pinball machine at the end of the hallway. ( If you make only a right turn as you exit the elevator, you'll end up at the hallway that dead-ends in a concourse of meeting rooms. Ask me how I know that. :-)  A hairpin right is the thing. )

c) The pinball machine you'll see in front of you as you make the hairpin turn is actually at the entry to the pizza place.

So there you go!  Mangia!",7,3,3

This pizza joint, if I recall, is located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan. Once you step off the escalator, look for a nondescript hallway, no signs, no nothing but  quite possibly a looong line of people. Congratulations, you've unlocked their ""secret"" venue, now prepare yourself for a good 30 minute wait. I won't lie. It's pretty much torture, especially if you've found yourself here after club hours like myself. You can try your best to entertain yourself with the semi-neato-skeeto album covers but who are we kidding, anytime you get a whiff of that delicious pizza or someone exits the venue and walks past you in that narrow hallway, you're reminded how you're STILL in line and STILL not stuffing your piehole with, well, pie.

After you've managed to snake yourself to the end of the hallway, you can start eyeballing which pie is destined to be yours, individual slices or a whole pie? I opted for the latter and had to wait longer but it was worth it. I got half mushroom & pepperoni and the other half was ricotta and garlic. I enjoyed both types immensely but favored the white pizza and would gladly bathe in slices of this pizza - so good! Uber good!!

Pizza had a nice chewiness and the cheese was cheesy goodness. Definitely hit the spot! I ordered a large pizza and ducked out to one of the open tables just to the left upon exiting the hallway and inhaled my little slice of heaven.

Oh, by the way. You might see some unusual happenings while in line. For instance, one girl got to the cashier, turned around, lifted her dress and shook what her mama gave her. My friend and I turned to look at each other and mentally said, ""Did you just see that?"" while one other patron yelled out ""Does that get you free toppings?"" Hahah, we all laughed.

Anyway, duty called (boyfriend back in hotel room patiently waiting) so I paraded out of The Cosmopolitan and made my way over to MGM. Unfortunately BF was passed out, sad story for him, but happy ending for me: I plopped down in our living room and helped myself to another slice :)

While walking around the Chandelier Bar on the upper floors, I stumbled across a long hallway lined with album covers, with a questionable ending.  What could be at the end? Narnia? Or the Springfield Mystery Spot, complete with Ozzie Smith? Of course, being the quizzical individual that I am, I walked down the hallway.  Couldn't believe what I saw...a walk-up pizza joint!

Anyway, with over 500 reviews, I don't know how this is a secret anymore.  No sign, no advertising, but excellent NY-style pizza.  At $4.50\/slice, with the Strip-markup, it's a pretty good value for wasteepants late-night munchies.  And if you're not ready to end the rager, they have beer and I think, boxed wine.

This is obviously a place to go after a night throwin elbows at the club.  At times, I've seen the line full of button-down shirts, fist pumps, sky-high heels, and dresses that leave little to the imagination.  Sometimes the line is long, which is understandable given its popularity.  But they try their best to keep the line moving swiftly.

I'm glad I stumbled onto this place, as it has become a staple when I visit.   I applaud the Cosmopolitan for this inspired idea.",8,5,6

Upon arrival the line was already out the door (Friday night at 11:30), I was a bit confused as I thought people would still be out partying but I guess its vegas and maybe people were just jet lagged.  Either way I cut to the front and check on my order and it turns out they had not even started it.  I was upset but the guy started the order right a way and offered me a slice as compensation.

Luckily, I've got a friend out there that my wife went to school with so we learned about it almost instantaneously. 

The walk up into this place is pretty impressive. The Cosmopolitan is actually one of the nicer hotels in Vegas, and you don't actually get forced in the casino the second you walk in. It definitely seems to cater to a 20 somethings crowd, which I think is very appealing for people that my age bracket, but I can imagine might be tedious for people that are a little bit older.

So, on to the pizza itself. The place is small and down a fairly long hallway. They've got some pinball machines and a counter where you order and pay. No seats, but there's a little lounge back out in the hotel, so it's really not  a big deal. Their pizza is greasy and has a good crust. 

It's fucking expensive. Seriously, I don't usually complain much about price with food, but $4 for a slice is absurd. David Chang isn't making my fucking pizza back there, and even if he was I'm pretty sure he wouldn't have the balls to overcharge on a slice. 

Bottom line, it's definitely good, and I'm sure it's absolutely fantastic if you're shit faced. It's worth probably once, but unless you're right in the area you shouldn't go out of your way.",0,0,0

If you are debating whether to get a slice or a whole pizza, definitely get the whole. It's 10 pieces for around $26 or ~$5 for a slice.

The white pizza is good if you like ricotta cheese. Otherwise the standard pizza with your choice of toppings is very satisfying. Get meatballs on your pizza no matter what.

Pizza was very good and the ingredients were quality. No joke, but some of the best tasting pepperoni I have ever had. We had a half white, half pepperoni pie.

I can't tell you how good this pizza is. It's a great combination of salty and cheesy goodness. I always get either a slice of their mushroom pizza or white pizza. Their mushroom pizza is delicious + a little bit of added chili flakes makes the saltiness of the pizza all come together for a flavorful bite. Their white pizza is probably one of their more famous pies and with good reason, it's delicious! It's a mozzarella (and parmesan?) based slice topped with ricotta cheese. At first, I thought it would be too much cheese for my liking but it all somehow comes together as cheesy goodness.  Now, the crust...it's all about the crust!! The pizza itself is thin with a slight crunchy bite to it. The crust is crispy but with a doughy inside that I love. The slices run pretty big so it's worth the price! ($5\/6) Usually all it takes is one slice for me to be done, two if I'm super hungry. I've never had to wait in a long line to place my order (my wait is usually like 5 mins) but I've been told it can get pretty crazy late night when the clubs close. 
My only complaint about the pizza is that it can be a little too oily. Seeing small puddles of greasiness is kind of gross, but nothing a pat down with a napkin won't fix. Just wish I didn't have to perform this messy task before eating it. 

Seating is available inside (best for parties of 2, not so much for bigger parties) & all around the lounge type area but it can be difficult to find an open space during a busy night. The pizzeria itself is located on the 3rd floor of Cosmo, down a hallway across from the escalators.",3,0,0

Sober or otherwise, I always stop by here for a great slice of pizza and honestly it is SO worth it. Depending on what time you go, the line can either be super short or out the door. Either way, you won't regret coming here.

As the name suggests, the location of it is a little secret. That is, you really have to know where you're going or you'll easily walk by it. To be honest, the easiest way to get there is to go to Marquee nightclub and then take the glass elevator up to the third floor. When the elevator doors open, Secret Pizza will be to your immediate right. (If someone knows of a quicker way to get here please let me know!)

My personal favorite here is the white pizza which has alfredo sauce and a variety of cheeses for toppings, but if you're lucky I definitely recommend the deep dish Sicilian pizza--is it TO DIE FOR!!

The cost of a slice can vary from $5 and upwards and you can expect to wait a couple minutes if you order a whole pizza as well (but can you blame them? Its fresh)!

Secret Pizza wasn't too hard to find. Just look for people eating pizza slices in the Cosmopolitan. =)
True, there is no sign and really no storefront. It's on the third level of the Cosmopolitan, near the big chandelier. The doorway is near a pool table and some really cool\/funky seating lounges.  Look for a door that leads down a long narrow hallway filled with pictures and you are there! The inside is sparse, a few stools for bar seating and some pinball machines. 

There was 5 of us so we decided to order a whole pizza instead of individual slices because it seemed cheaper. A single slice is about $4.50 without toppings. We ordered a whole white pizza with 3 toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms and olives) for about $26. Plus it was freshly made! 

Verdict? It tasted ok but greasy. I had to dab my napkins multiple times before I started eating it. I know the oil is a combination of the pepperoni and cheese but there was nothing unique about the overall taste of the pizza.  I appreciated the crispy thin crust but didn't find it to interesting. Although, I was thankful that the pizza didn't taste too salty and that it was freshly made. Nice and hot. The guy working behind the counter said that the white pizza is more popular than just regular cheese, and the white did have generous portions of ricotta cheese. It felt a bit heavy eating it as brunch. But I could see how this could be yummy drunk food over you come out of the club inebriated. =P

It's open super late so you can stop by for a late night drunchie after marquee. The price is very reasonable (especially in Cosmopolitan!).

My boyfriend also ordered a Coke and he ordered two slices of a thin white pizza.  Total bill was just over $26, and we left a few dollars in the tip jar.  We barely had to wait at all for our pizza and soda before I could sit down with my pizza as my boyfriend ate and loitered next to me.  By loitered I hope you get that that means he was standing.

When we got there, there were only 4-5 people waiting for their pizza to be made. My sister and I ordered the 18in white pizza. It only took like 10-15 for them to make it.

We took the pie back to our hotel and oh my goodness! I could taste it now just thinking back to it. I have never had a white pizza before, and I am never going back. It was hot, fresh, and HUGE for like $20. It was so soft (but not fall apart soft) and so cheesy. The ricota was a nice touch.

John, the 20-something estranged culinary chef protege-dropout, came into the final meeting for the architect's last proposal on the hotel to borrow some cash from his father, Jeff.  Jeff was following the pitch quite well from the design firm, but was starting to drift off.

The architect continued, ""We can probably put a bathroom in here, but it won't be very big.  I propose that we just scrap--""

An idea hit the little hipster like a flash of lightning.

""Dad,"" John interrupted.  ""I want a pizza kitchen in there.""

Jeff: ""Sorry.  But you've never owned a restaurant.  You'll fail.  There's hardly any room.  We can't afford any more signage to get people in there.""

""Dad,"" John repeated with a confidence his father had never heard before, ""I want a pizza kitchen in there.  I'll run it.  It will succeed.  It needs nothing but my skill.""

""Oooookay, John.  If you say so.""

And Secret Pizza was born.

So we're sitting at a party and it's been a while since I was in the Vegas area and a friend of mine says, ""Have you had Secret Pizza?""

And I was instantly intrigued.  ""Huh?""  An hour later, we came up an escalator and found (though no sign, rhyme, or reason pointed to it) a dimly lit hallway.

To my surprise, sure enough, I am greeted with a ""Welcome!"" Welcome to what?  Where am I?  How did the pinball machine get here? How come the arcade machine is broken?  Are we seriously watching the Clippers?  How come I'm asking myself so many questions?

And so we order a pie from the New York accented worker and 20+ minutes later I'm chewing down on the best pizza I've ever had.  I've been to New York.  I've been to Italy.  It could have been the surreal nature of the place's existence, the hype that goes with it, the excitement of finding a hidden treasure - but it was.  the best.  pizza.

We sat and watched people come and go.  Their non-brand Word processed menu was simply titled ""PIZZA"".  Yep.  Looks right, to me.

I made a suggestion of getting some slices at Sirrico's Pizza at the New York New York resort.  We would be cutting close and our friend suggested a new spot at the new and shiny Cosmopolitan.  I took to my faithful Yelp app and we were down with its near perfect five stars and late hours (until 5am!).

First and foremost, The Cosmopolitan might be the new Wynn.  It's beautiful with hot girls everywhere. The bars are plenty, the resort is bustling with nightlife and good times everywhere you look. We look for a hotel guide and interestingly enough, the pizza place isn't listed.  Odd.  We ask a staff member and up we go on a glass elevator that Tony Montana would have in his mansion.  

The pizzeria is nowhere to be found, but the hint of party-goers with paper plates and slices gives you all the info you need.  We head down a dark hallway and make it to our final destination.  The parlor is busy and cracking with hungry customers at all hours. The pizza place is still relatively new and it shows.  There was a small line and we waited a good 10 minutes in line.  As I approached the glass, they had a few pies, which included a combo, veggie, cheese, peperoni, and some other odds and ends.  

I went with their veggie offering and a cheese and ricotta slice. The cute cashier (Christie) rang me up and the damage was about $12 for two slices and a Pabst beer.  A set of stools offer a seating area for a few patrons, but expect them to be used at all times.  Fortunately, there's plenty of seating areas nearby. I took my first bite and the pizza was delish! The cheese was gooey and hot.  The veggies were fresh and had that contrast I looked for with the cheese and crust.  Overall, the pizza is great and the ""secret"" location adds a nice cool factor.  The pizza place itself is four stars, but the fact that it's open until 5am and the secret location bumps it one more star.",1,0,1

Food: During my visit here I got the sicilian pizza and I must say this may have just been the best pizza I have ever had! I am not exaggerating it was just that good! The crust was doughy yet crispy and they didn't cheap out on the toppings either! My slice in particular came with cheese, tomatoes and some deli meats on it! The portion is also huge so you definitely get your money's worth. 

Service: I came her after Marquee dayclub and there was already a pretty long line that formed when we arrived. This is why there is a one star deduction for the review. I think in total it took about 30 mins or more to get my one slice of pizza. I hope that they find a more efficient way to get people in and out faster in the future! 

Another con is the fact that there is no seating, if possible can you guys furnish the place with some tables and chairs so we can eat in peace! If you need a place to sit then go down the hallway, there you will find some comfortable one seaters!

I was dreading the wait because I've heard from friends the line here can be pretty long and crazy but good thing I went around 8-9 pm because that's when everyone is getting ready for the club or going to the club haha now I know that's probably the perfect time to go cause I didn't have to wait no longer than 10 minutes in line and the service was quick I was in and out before I knew it. The pizza slices here are ginormous ! I was having a hard time finishing one slice by myself lol. It's actually a good price for a slice too no more than $5. Good place for something easy while enjoying a beer to go along with it and pretty unique how it's kinda hidden.,1,0,1

If you're stuck at the Cosmo and don't feel like venturing out too far or just ended your ratchet night of clubbing at Marquee and you're dying for some pizza\/post club grub, then yes, by all means go here. It's located on the third floor down a hallway of record labels (next to Jaleo). They have a few bar style counters and a couple of stools, and the rest of the people usually end up standing and eating or taking it to go. The pizza itself is good, especially the pepperoni. I like how the dough remains crispy and crunchy and doesn't get soggy at all. They have this garlic seasoning that you can sprinkle on your pizza, and it really enhances the flavor. I also tried a slice of their veggie pizza and sausage with pepperoncini, but the pepperoni was my favorite. 

A slice of pizza goes for about $5 a pop, more with additional toppings, and a whole pizza starts at about $30. Soda is $4. I wouldn't say the pizza prices are outrageous, because the pizza is decently sized (about the size of a Costco pizza). You could say it's all about the experience here, but especially for Vegas locals, I think convenience plays a big factor. I don't know if I would want to come back again having to go through the Strip traffic, parking, up the elevators, and possibly have to wait in line just for pizza :\/",10,7,6

My friend who lives in Vegas says the three institutions are: Earl's, Pho Kim Long, and Secret Pizza. All of these places are delicious and Secret Pizza is no exception.

We ordered half white pizza and half sausage, pepperoni, and sun dried tomato. It was just as delicious as that sounds. I still prefer the white pizza though--can't go wrong with ricotta cheese and garlicky white sauce. The other half was a little salty for me, and the entire pizza was dripping in grease, which I suppose can be either a plus or minus. Don't get me wrong, this pizza is DELICIOUS, the crust is perfect, the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. It's a little pricey, about $30, and soda is $4 each, although you do get unlimited refills. But hey, it's Vegas, and it's in the Cosmopolitan. Definitely worth a try at least once, although I'm willing to bet you'll be back for more. Also, if you know you're coming in advance and you want to get a whole pizza, call in advance because it can take 20-40 min to bake depending on how busy they are.

I would definitely try to come here with someone who has been before because it's pretty hard to find. I would try to give directions in my review except I still don't know where it is, haha.

It should be Pizza Counter With No Name and not Secret Pizza... not important though.  

It was fun tracking through the Cosmo with my swerve on trying to find this place.  It took about 45 minutes.

We ordered the white pizza.  The crust is thin and holds up well when folded.   The crust was crispy on the bottom and had a slight chew to it.  The crust was perfect.  I would like a comforter made for my bed from this crust.

The pizza was topped off with a perfect melody of garlic and ricotta.  

If someone stole my car and left me 2 of these pizzas in the parking spot, I think I would be happy.  

Later that night I dreamed I was in bed with Selma Hyeck.  She was wearing a white tank top with no bra and my boxer shorts. We were watching Married With Children laughing having a good time.  I was eating a whole white pizza from this Pizza Place With No Name.  She reached inside the pizza box and tried to grab a piece.  I quickly moved the box from her reach and said ""My Pizza.""  Then I kicked Selma out of bed, and said ""go sleep on the couch CRAZY!""  She apologized and slept at the foot of the bed.

Lol, I almost wish nobody knew about this place. This is definitely a secret worth keeping. It deserves every one of the 5 stars I have given it! I mean the pies are pretty damn good, but it just goes beyond that with everything else. 

From the moment you walk in & are greeted by my Paisan, Nico until you leave, you just can't help but feel giddy. When you step up to the counter, Nico just lays it all out, as only he can, starting you off with the pricing & some playful banter & all the different magic you can make with your slice or pie. The magic is definitely limited to your own imagination ;) 

However, I went with the basics, a slice of cheese & a slice of pepperoni & washed it down with a Barq's. My date du jour had a slice of cheese & some water. At which time, we took our place on some stools along the counter & did the good old pizza fold & chowed down! 

We strolled in about 2 am-ish, after catching a movie at Rave. I was totally craving a slice! It wasn't too busy at all, fortunately ;) It looked like there had just been a crowd in there, as it was a little messy. But that only adds to the charm of such a place. 

The most magical part of this late night pizza craving was, that it was all ""on them""! Unfortunately for us, or them, depending on how you look at it, they couldn't take cards at that particular time, which was all I had on me. So yeah, SCORE! Cuz, I do likes me some FREE eats ;) However, we did leave a nice tip for them in the tip jar. 

Overall, an awesome place to grab a slice or a whole pie. Definitely a cool vibe & not something you would expect to be in a stunning place, such as the Cosmo.

I came here with my boyfriend, and I had the impression that the pizzas would be more unique.  The pizzas are pre-made and each slice is popped in the oven for a few minutes as you order.  We asked the cashier what makes this pizza so great, and she replied, ""It's just good pizza.""

For $5, we shared one slice of the white pizza, which is topped with ricotta and mozzarella cheese.  I never had an orgasm in my mouth from pizza before, and needless to say, my boyfriend and I should have gotten our own slice.  After devouring that slice of pizza, we pulled out another $5 and ordered a slice of sausage pizza.  That was also very delicious, but I prefer the white pizza.

NNPK 'SECRET' PIZZA

This Pizza joint has got to be the coolest thing ever on the Strip, there's no sign, none of your normal indicators that this venue actually sells food; just a open hallway line with albums and pictures-at the end all you see is a pinball machine and a throng of people.  The waft of crusty bread and pizza sauces permeates the halls and the lobby, marketing it's own original advertisement!

It's your typical Pizza Joint, Pies laid out in front with giant stacked ovens in the back; lines of people ordering and paying at the register.  The interior is remarkably chic; Carrera marble counter tops and other beautiful finishes make this the best dive to grab a cheap eat!

I was unfortunately, unable to help myself; a slice of Cheese and Pepperoni + Sausage somehow got onto my plate.  The Pizzas were just right; perfect crust-almost buttery it had both the texture and flavor that makes it an undeniably New York Pizza.

Tried the white pizza with pepperoni.

I have been here a few times and never been disappointed. There will be a line, but you will still have trouble finding it. It is down a very mysterious hallway right beside the sushi joint. It is truly tiny, but so perfect after a night of debauchery! There are just a few seats and a couple of pinball machines inside. Luckily, there are couches and a pool table right outside.

You can get pizza by the slice or wait for an entire pie. They continually crank out the pizzas here. The meatball and pepperoni is one of my favorites. Their sauce is delicious and the crust is thin. This is the type of pizza that you definitely have to fold in half to eat. There will be grease, but true New York pizza is also greasy. The meatball is so flavorful and fantastic. I do find the pepperoni to be a bit too spicy for my taste, but I like that it is not the generic circular pepperoni. Last night I had the opportunity to try a white slice, which was good and garlicky but seemed a little more like cheese bread and a little less like pizza, which is always a risk with white pizza. 

There aren't tons of options, just your basic slices. It is cheap for the strip, but actually a tad pricey at $5 a slice! The pizza is good, but you would only be paying $2 in New York.

My husband found the place during his visit for his bachelor party and this time the door was open so the secret was not so secret when we visited. I wanted to see what it would like with the door closed but it's alright, maybe next time.

The selection is small but don't let that deter you. The pizza is tasty, slices are  big and reasonably priced for Vegas. You get to choose if you want an inside or outside (crust) slice. I had the sicilian pepperoni while my husband had the one with 2 kinds of sausage, goat cheese and peppers. The pepperoni was classic. It was cheesy and had large slices of pepperoni. Be careful when adding stuff to your pizza, I accidentally poured a little too much garlic powder on my slice but it still tasted really good and luckily wasn't overpowering or salty.

I didn't get the same slice as my husband because it had goat cheese but I tried it and actually liked his a little more than mine. The sausage was good and I liked the peppers. Next time I'm going for that kind.

Slices are about $5 for regular slices and $8 for sicilian. Service is quick but be aware the line can get long 12-2am. Good luck finding the place if the ""door"" is closed.",4,4,4

The most popular flavors are white and meatball & ricotta, according to a staff member. We ordered a slice of white pizza and a slice of pepperoni & banana peppers.

While it may be as good as a booty call, (not that I live that kinda lifestyle) let me break it down to you.

Location 3rd floor next to the Sushi joint. All you really need to know is that it's on the third floor above Marquee and the shops. Chances are you will see a line crawling out of the unmarked hallway and people entering pizza nirvana on the surrounding chairs and couches. 

Skip the lines and call it in ahead. Plan for a 20-30 min until the pizzas are ready. Order a pizza pie or 2 or 3. Walk to the front and feel like a VIP as you pass the hangry people in line to pay. No need to explain yourself as there are those people who think you're cutting in line. If you got the pies, just find an open table or couch and start chowing down. If you feel like eyes are gazing at you out of jealousy because you have pizza & they don't, offer them a slice especially if it's an attractive member(s) of the opposite sex. Besides, who doesn't like pizza?

I like the pizza here because it resembles a NY style: thin crust. Awesome in the sense that there won't be the carb overload for the fitness-minded. The pepperoni & sausage is a killer one-two combo. It has just the right amount of grease that plays in a good way when you've been pounding drinks all night. The slices may be a flimsy so you better have a game plan with how you eat a slice (the fold, the roll, etc)

It may not be the best pizza I've had but when with a buzz & late night munchies, this is the go to spot in the wee hours of the morning. This cracks my top 5 Late Night Foodie Call spots.",3,3,2

Entering the Secret Pizza Parlor, there really isn't anything except the menu and a few workers making the pizza (both in slices and boxes).  

When I went, the price was around $4.50 for a slice for a cheese or 'white' New York style pizza, extra for a few more ingredients and they have PBR (and something else) on top along with some wine.  You order up and while you wait, there's an old Galaga machine along with two pinball machines and some parlor style chairs.  I ordered a 'white' pizza and a PBR.  The white pizza is a cheese pizza mixed with several piles of feta cheese with herbs mixed in.  What an amazing combination.  That pizza was quite delicious and downing it with on tap PBR, it was well worth everything.

We were like, ""What the hell?"" Curiosity got the better of us and we ventured down that dim hallway which is covered with vinyl album covers.

Order by the slice ($5 and up) or a whole pie ($30+). Pabst Blue Ribbon beer is $5 a red Solo cup. IPA is $7. Only buy the soda if you are super thirsty: $4 a Solo cup. That's as bad as Disneyland, if not worse. Maybe that's a standard Strip price.

You can argue the merits of all the different types of pizza out there all you want...the bottom line is that it's about balance, without going overboard.
In my opinion this pizza is far and away better than anything I've had west of the Mississippi. The crust is fresh made, but has just the right amount of toasted crunch from the oven.
The cheese is not so overbearing that it's all you taste.
The sauce on both the white and the red are amazing. 
I like the white, but I really like the full flavor of the red sauce. It tastes more like a quality marinara than it does just pizza sauce.
The toppings are all premium ingredients Quartered roma tomatoes, really good and greasy pepperoni, real cheese.

Guess what? Those cost more. It's a complicated business concept I know.
Really though...I'm the most price sensitive person I know, but if you think $5 a slice is not an accurate price point, then I would say stick with the 2 slice combo at Costco.
Have any of you considered where the hell this place is? It's in the Cosmo...on the strip... Does anybody know how much 2 slices & a drink will run you at Sbarro?

& just in case you think i'm just taken in by the ""secret"" theme of the place. I actually went inside & stumbled across it the first week Cosmo was open. I didn't know it was a ""secret"" until I started hearing people talking about it.
Then the only reason I finally tried it was because Angela H. dragged me over there and force fed it to me. Usually im pretty ""meh"" when it comes to pizza. I don't tend to seek it out. If it's there I'll eat it. But this place really does it for me.
If you have only been once I say this...
Give it another try. Everybody who does the volume they probably do for such a small shop is prone to have an off night.

If you had it twice and just don't like it....well....Little Caesar's is open til 10.",3,5,1

I heard about this place on yelp, so I wanted to check it out. I have been to the cosmo twice already and never seen this place, so I had to ask around, and they pointed me toward a long hallway all hidden in the back.

No menu, so you just have to look at the pizza and decide. This place is crazy small. It might fit 15 people. Only like five seats so it's a race to find one. I stood up and ate my pizza because I didn't want to walk around cosmo trying to find a place to sit. 

The pizza was pleasant, nothing bad about it.

A lot of people have mentioned that ""Secret Pizza"" is not really a secret. Well, I just want to point out that ""Secret Pizza"" is not actually the name of this restaurant. When we were there someone asked them what their name was and they simply said ""there is no name."" Now, Matrix references aside, I'm sure they have a name on their license to run a restaurant, but for all intents and purposes, there's no name. 

Basically, go to third floor and walk straight forward toward a hallway lined with record covers and you'll see a pinball machine. There's ""Secret Pizza."" When we were there they had a white pie, a margarita with roasted tomatoes, and a sausage and pepporincini. It was hard to tell if they still offered toppings on plain cheese slices, but we ended up going with the margarita and sausage. The prices were not as cheap as some of the business photos imply; most slices are around $5. That's not cheap normally, but for Vegas, it certainly is. 

The pizza worried me a bit because it had been sitting there for an indeterminate amount of time. Boy was I wrong. The crust was pretty much perfect. Toppings and cheese and everything ratio was great. The sausage and pepporincini is very spicy, I think because they let the juice from the peppers stay on the pizza and soak in as it bakes. There are just a few seats and some counter space. They have soda, self-serve water, and beer, but $5 for a PBR is pretty ridiculous. They have a multi-game machine in a Galaga cabinet so if you want to channel your inner George Costanza, like me, and play some Frogger, you can go for it. I can see why this place gets packed after the clubs let out; if you don't want to wait 45 minutes for pizza, come during the day, when there's no line at all. Worth a stop at least once.",3,1,1

Its the kinda good you don't have to be drunk for, the kind that makes you want a few slices or a whole pie.

Ok, so one thing that's totally awesome about Secret Pizza is the fact that you can add ingredients to the slices. I almost always add ricotta cheese to mine, unless they have a slice with it already. I see people adding onions and peppers etc etc. Still just as fast, but freedom to customize... Huge plus. 

They also offer a white slice which is excellent, but a tad garlicky... Just a tip for those trying to pick up a date afterward ;)  they usually have a wide variety of slices to choose from, and like I said you can add on ingredients. 

The price point is typical of the strip.. I usually pay around $6 for my slice with 3+ ingredients. It's a large slice and it fills me up, though I do see many people with 2 slices.

I'm not sure what to say that hasn't already been written by fellow Yelpers, but this pizza is really good. One slice was enough for me for lunch. I ordered the sausage and peperoncini and thought it was great! My traditional guy had the cheese. Both had a thinner, crispy crust that New York-style devotees will covet. Both slices were hot and fresh. We also appreciated the friendliness of the staff and just how kind they were (makes a big difference to me... not sure how others feel about that). Our server was so polite and went through all of the available pizzas with us with patience.

The pizza crust was thin, moist, yet crispy, the cheese and sauce was also very flavorful.    

However, I had them again a year later (which was week ago), and it really tasted and looked like they went a couple notches down in the ranks.

$0.50 a topping

1 slice Sausage and pepperoncini pizza $5.75

Total damage: $15 (for 2 slices and a drink)

As much as I love thin crust pizza, theirs was all sorts of soggy and mushy this time around. Last year, it was actually crisp and held the pizza topping well. Also, they really salt bombed the crap out of it. It was soggy doughy, and salty. Not what I would like to expect from my beloved secret pizzeria.

Plus, there is never any Parmesan in those shakers on the countertops and the countertops are always greasy and filthy from previous drunk people. I never see any employees out on the floor refreshing and keeping the store front tidy.

First lets talk about the pizza. I had heard of this place from yelp and it was on my list of spots I had to try. Well there where 10 of us in our party and we decided pizza and beer would do for dinner. We made a trip down and found the pizza place. Everyone is right, it is down an unmarked hall to a little counter with an oven and pies sitting out if you buy a slice. Small menu board, but they do have PBR on tap ($5 for a red cup) We ordered 3 pizzas with a variety of toppings. OMG this was damn good pizza. The slices where massive, but with a very thin crust and a very thin but crunchy outside crust. All very good and we only ended up with 4 left over slices.

Price, I do not agree with the other reviews about value. Each pie for us was $23-24. While these are large pies they still seemed expensive. I know this is vegas and I know it is going to be more expensive, but this just seemed over the top for me.

There is virtually no room to sit and eat, a couple of chairs, a little bar, and another little bar to stand and eat. If you have more then a couple of people be prepared to stand and eat.

Now on to the service. This gets a 2 star. We walked in and reviewed the very simple menu. We wanted to ask a couple questions about toppings because nothing was listed on the board. The girl helping us was not helpful at all. She just kinda spewed out some ""answers"". Not sure if she was having a bad day, or if she does not really give a shit.... i lean towards not giving a shit. The manager offered to bring them up to the room for us as soon as they where done, we where told 30-40 min.

After over an hour and still no pizza we made a call. After getting handed off to 2 people we still had no answer and no pizza. At almost the same time the manager showed up at our room, brought the pizzas in and gave us a hand getting the pizzas out. He even brought up a stack of napkins and plates. What kinda annoyed me was he then asked for a tip for bringing them up. He never said sorry for being late or anything else. If he had of called to say hey we got busy it will be a bit longer then I would of gladly handed him a tip.

Overall I would 100% go get a slice and a PBR, but really don't expect much as far as service.",1,0,0

  So Secret Pizza hides on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan serving NY style pizza for $4.50 for a slice of cheese pizza, and everyone seems to rave about it.  I guess I'm the exception.  Not that it tastes bad, its decent.  But if I didn't work downstairs I'd probably never go.  Its convenient to anyone in the Cosmo that doesn't want to spend serious cash on an elegant dinner at the other restaurants.  But for two slices of pizza and a cup of soda you will spend over $15.  Which is cheap in comparison to the restaurants, but expensive considering you can buy a large pizza and a 2-liter for the same price at most pizza joints.  Yes, yes, I know its inside a strip casino - it doesn't make me feel any better about being robbed.

  OK its NY style, but it tastes nothing like pizza from the north east.  The slices are thin (which is NY style) and sloppy (often falling apart as you pick it up) and sloooow to come out.  The choice is often limited to one or two types because they never have enough pizza ready. The line tends to get long, and even when its short the service is way slower than it has to be.  Be prepared to stand around in this closet sized restaurant (if you can call it that).  There are a few stools at a counter with no leg room if you want to sit, otherwise bring it out into the Cosmo and find a seat somewhere in a lounge.

  Maybe I'm spoiled because i grew up in NJ.  I've had great pizza in Jersey, Philly, and New York.  And honestly in Las Vegas I have had nothing but horrible horrible pizza.  So I guess I could say at least Secret Pizza is some of the best of the worst pizza.  But I always leave feeling like I've been had.

  The one good thing it has going is the place often stays open until about 4:30am.  You will likely have to ask someone where its at, its down a hallway with no signs.  

  Bottom line, I've been to this place over a dozen times because of my job, so this review is no fluke, its consistant.  This is average pizza (above average for Vegas), but unless you've lived in the South your whole life (or Nevada), I doubt you'll find it especially delicious or special.",3,2,1

While this type of slice if commonplace in NYC, they are few and far between outside of NYC. On the left coast I would only rate this place and Mulberry of Beverly Hills as being the 2 pest places to score a NYC style slice. 

Often imitated but never duplicated... A thin, doughy crust, with a little crispness, easy on the cheese, and a sweet basil tomato sauce. 

A real NY pizza expert will start with a slice of cheese. This one made the grade. I was also a fan of the sausage and banana pepper.

The ambiance - Full of drunken Californians mostly. There will be some women walking barefoot and carrying their shoes. Possibly a couple natives from the land of vegas. Feels much more sterile than a NYC place, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.",0,0,0

There was a short wait at the time. The pizza sits out but they heat it up in the oven after you order it. For $8 per slice, we expected a lot more. It wasn't anything special - just the basic cheese, sauce, and crust. We ordered the Sicilian and a Combination pizza.

What was Ordered:

Pizza with 4 toppings ($26.00) - A-Okay (3 Stars) - My sister and fiancé chose a 3 topping pizza.  One side was pepperoni and green peppers pizza.  The other side was sausage and roasted garlic.  All pizza here is thin crust and the large pizza has 8 large slices.  Here is the breakdown by slice:

*The Crust - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - You are looking at approximately a 14"" diameter of thin crust with tomato sauce and melted cheese.  One word comes to mind, ""greasy.""  

*Sausage and Roasted Garlic - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - The sausage was good, but I think the Roasted Garlic was forgotten--maybe that's why they charged us the 3 topping price.  Plus, I do not think they gave us enough of the sausage per slice to make it more fulfilling.

*Pepperoni and Green Peppers - A-Okay (3 Stars) - Probably the best combination of toppings that made the pizza tasty.  The pepperoni tasted like it was suppose to.  What brought this slice up a notch was the flavor of the roasted green peppers.  

The Secret Pizza is really in a nondescript location--with no signage at all.  If you are near a random billiards table, you are in the right place.  The place is A-Ok, but I've experienced better.  Maybe if I was crazy drunk and just got out of the club, this place would have been rated higher.  Unfortunately, I'm sober.",24,28,20

Took them about 25 min to prepare it, and the pizza was huge!!!! I mean I can eat, but that was really big... 

There wasn't enough mushrooms on the pizza which was a little disappointing to me! and there was one string of the green pepper on each slice! Good amount of cheese and ok amount of pepperoni...... It was waaay too oily for my taste... I had to dab it down with napkins to soak up the oil...  The crust was amazing though... we ended up eating half of the pizza and took the other half to go... at night while I was having my red bull vodka, I was taking the crust off of the rest of the pizza (which no longer looked appetizing) and it still tasted great...

But I was disappointed. It was a lot of fun to find and I love the concept of the the best kept secret, but this really is not what it is.

The service to start with was pretty shitty and probably discriminatory. My friend and I are in the service industry so we would never be one of those rude or extremely picky guests so I know it had nothing to do with our personalities. We witnessed guests in front of us receive friendly service from the cashier lady's good side. With us, she rolled her eyes and rushed us. I was prepared to let that go, given extremely good pizza.

Annnnd the pizza was okay. It was nothing to rave about. I might be bias because I favorite NY style pizza and this was just not close at all. The crust was plain, not enough sauce or cheese and the topping was okay. 

It was a fun little hunt inside the Cosmo though, just wish the treasure tasted better.",5,1,1

Better yet, if you have a room at Cosmo, just order the pizza for delivery to your room.  It will take an hour or so but at least you can relax in your room while you wait for pizza.

After seeing Secret Pizza on Travel Channel's 'Secret Eats' with Adam Richman, we were on the hunt! Taking a look at hints on Yelp, we quickly found the spot! It really isn't that hidden, but for unsuspecting and not-so-curious guests, it is easily missed. Take a hallway filled with records and old band photos down to a New York style pizzeria with arcade games, a simple menu, and plenty of options!

We ordered the best of course: a slice of White and a slice of Ricotta-Sausage! 
Let me start off by saying the crust on these pizzas is superb. fantastic. amazing! So thin yet so crispy, nicely charred, and great flavor!
The white pizza was oh so cheesy, oh so garlicky, and oh so fantastically amazingly delicious!
The ricotta-sausage was oh so cheesy as well, and the sausage was magnificent! The best sausage on a pizza I have had yet! Nice spice, juicy, and paired well with the ricotta!

This is an absolute must for any pizza lover!",2,2,1

Within 15-20 minutes we were at the counter to order. Crap. They ran outta White Pizza. Another 20 minutes wait. Shoot me. So, my hubs orders the pepperoni and I get the Sicilian. Big mistake on the Sicilian. Thick, bready pizza crust with just a bit of the ""white"" pizza part - which is mozzarella and ricotta I think. However, the pepperoni was super crunchy and chewy and it totally did not say in the middle (hate that). We liked the thin crust pizza we went back for another slice of cheese.

Each pizza was 10 slices, and since there were five of us, we each got four slices.  Not eating the crusts, I was barely able to finish my four slices and felt extremely full afterward, which is uncommon for me. Most of my friends were not able to finish their slices as well. The pizzas were not too expensive either, so the price to portion ratio was great.

All we could hustle was a piece of cheese cake from the freezer...until somehow by the grace of God and our (more my sisters) charm we managed to pull it off. The pizza maker wanted us out so he gave in. haha!

The restaurant is very small. There are not a whole lot of seats. The decor is a throwback to the 1980s and 90s. Including the music, an arcade video game machine, and two pinball machines. It was not busy when we went, around 2 PM on a weekday.
You can order pizza by the slice, which costs around 5 to 6 dollars, or a whole pie. The friendly workers will pop your slice of pizza in the oven to crisp it up. This is a very nice touch. The pizza is New York style, with a super thin crust, and high-quality toppings. The sauce was flavorful, the cheese was delicious, and the toppings extremely tasty. The crust was chewy, but super crisp on the bottom. It really hit the spot! Tastes exactly what NY pizza should taste like, in my mind.
We tried three flavors: the combination pizza, the sliced meat ball and ricotta cheese, and pepperoni and mushroom. The combo pizza had the most flavor, but the other two were also outstanding. They also have a vegetarian combo pizza and cheese pizza for vegetarians out there.

You can probably compare my palate for pizza to pure vanilla; I'll eat any toppings, eat any style crust, order delivery or sit in a restaurant...in the end, most of it is just pizza to me.  So in my book, you've created something special when you stand out above the rest.

Now just because I'll eat anything on a pizza doesn't mean I don't have some preference.  I'm always happy with sausage and mushroom on my pie.  During my first visit my buddy and I ordered a sausage, mushroom and ricotta pizza.  This...was...divine (to quote a fellow yelper).  It is a New York styled pizza, a bit light on the sauce, thin and droopy if not folded in half, and has this magical crust that remains soft on the inside and has a bit of crunch on the outside.  Note that I said New York styled; I've never been to New York or had their pizza, so I can't say if it's real or not!  What I do know is that my taste buds screamed for more pizza after that scalding first bite (guys never learn, do they?).  

On my second visit I placed two orders, a sausage, ricotta and garlic pizza; and a slice of mushroom and cheese to hold me over until our personalized pie was done.  I will say this: if you order one of the premade slices that is already sitting out, you're in for a lot more crunch than if you order a whole new fresh pie.  So bring a friend or two and go for fresh, if want that easy foldable pizza.

Another thing to note is that on my first visit, the chefs were cutting up actual sausage links for our pizza (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=ZT3AiU5KP2xY-mJsXmNZnQ).  Not so on the second visit  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=NBkD80-Yb6ykjKGuQctSoA).

She marveled at how there's no signage, no listing, and I replied ""That's why it's a SECRET! Lol"" Even at 3am there's a long line but thankfully everything moves pretty quickly. True to Vegas party scene everyone in line with us was pretty much wasted and the folks behind us were obnoxiously drunk. 

We finally got to the front and the pizza guy chit chatted with us about what slices they were offering at that time. I honestly marvel at how nice everyone is at Secret Pizza because if I had to deal with all the tomfoolery I don't think I'd be nearly as patient. We each got two slices and a Coke to go. The prices have gone up from $3.50 to $4.75 per slice with an additional $.50 per topping. Still not so bad when you consider that you're in a very touristy area and it is 3am. 

Overall still a really great experience and literally a ""hidden"" gem on the Las Vegas Strip. We came back the next night again for Secret Pizza as we were hanging out at the bar and my girlfriend came back a third time the next night because she wanted to make sure she got another slice before we headed back home!

Okay, I would only maim someone over this pizza... not actually kill.

To tell the truth, I wasn't expecting much when I laid eyes on boxes and boxes of this pizza floating down to the first floor of the Cosmopolitan, feeding hungry oafs watching the Super Bore game. Yes, I was one of the oafs trying to stay awake and hoping the game would pick up - shit, I was hoping that Elway (sitting in attendance) would jump in and take over for Manning.

Anyway, the pizza looked a little ""blah"" and the pepperoni\/sausage looked a little grey. Although, I now think it was just the lighting in the Chandelier Bar, where we were posted up. 
After the friend and I shared a burrito from the mall across the street, and some very pricey ""street tacos"" from China Poblano (on the 2nd floor) - 3 dinky tacos for $16, I volunteered to go in search of this secret pizza place... why not? All the other oafs seemed to really enjoy this pizza. 

I will give you exact coordinates to find this pizza joint: 36.1100° N, 115.1753° W.... or just take the escalator, near the Chandelier Bar, up to the 3rd floor, make an immediate left off the escalator, stroll a few paces past the other restaurant, and veer to the right down the non-descript hallway which appears to be designated for employees only, or passage to purgatory. Tucked away is a little door to some pretty damn tasty and reasonably priced pizza. It's a tiny little spot, smaller than a Kardashian closet - no sitting area, just a couple of small bar tops where you can stand and scarf down.

They sell pizza by the slice, whole pizza, and some kind of obscenely delicious looking fat\/chicago-style pizza (but, you have to get your timing right to get your hands on one of these slices - may even be a special order thing). You can also add more toppings to whatever slice you choose. I nabbed a couple of pepperoni\/sausage with bell peppers for myself and friend. Damn, I wished we knew about this spot earlier in the day - would have ordered a whole pizza. It was very, very tasty. Can't believe I wasted good $ on sub-par Chinese\/Mexican tacos. 

I highly recommend this spot not only because the price is right, but this pizza is actually worth maiming someone over.",2,2,2

The hallway you walk through is super cool too with records all over the walls and once you get in there are retro arcade games as well!

Let me tell you, this pizza is not for the health-conscious. It is super super oily and cheesy but hey, what good pizza isn't? The pizza is literally one of the best thin-crust pizzas I've had!

Judging by the crazy long line, Secret Pizza is probably the worst kept secret in Vegas. The establishment is located on the third floor and has an obscure entrance right in between 2 restaurants. It's not hard to spot because you just have to spot the crowd.

The pizzas are good but don't take my word for it. I was pretty inebriated and extremely starved when I consumed my slice.

I meant to only eat a bit of everything-especially because I'm lactose intolerant-didn't care, I was in heaven! Many beautiful women admiring my selection- couldn't ask for a better meal in Vegas. The cannoli? I had just been in NYC, made it a point to visit Little Italy and find the 'Best Voted Cannoli'. This one blew it away.

...not the same. It was good, but not as good as fresh. I asked if they had anything fresh- they did. It was 'almost' fresh but much better than the over crispy crust of the reheated pizza.

I couldn't find the name anywhere but I did see a Yelp sticker on their glass pane so I knew the name was floating somewhere!  

I literally thought we were going to grab a slice of pizza from the restaurant next door that was visible but don't be mistaken!  If you're looking for this place, it's in the same lounge area as the STK steakhouse near the pool table next to the restaurant with the wooden decor.  I just realized how ridiculous that sounded.

Anyhow, try the white pizza.  White sauce and balls of ricotta make it rich and heavy but perfect for a late night snack.  This slice was $3 and well worth it.  It's NY style but if you're not going to eat it that way, it could be floppy so fold it.  The crust is nicely crisp with a slight chewiness.  I hope that I and the 643 other reviewers weren't too incoherent to give it an accurate review but I think I know good pizza when I taste it!",1,1,1

Once all the way down, the ""secret"" has been revealed that of a pizza parlor. Hm! This better be amazingly good!

I ordered the mushroom pizza, and was highly recommended to get it with meatball on top. It looked amazing, but right when I picked it up for a first bite, the pizza fell apart. Sad. The slice I had was probably too soggy and the crust was really thin that didn't even feel like it was there. However, that doesn't stop the fact that the pizza is absolutely delicious! Gooey cheese with tasty tomato sauce, soft and earthy mushrooms, and the meatball! Omg, the meatball was amazing! Super tasty, meaty, and flavorful.

Sure, the place is dark and dank, but who the hell cares when you're eating pizza THIS good.

IMHO this place is overhyped. I ordered a regular cheese slice, and my two friends shared a white sicilian. 

The supposedly ""new york style"" cheese slice: Decent slice? Yes. New York style? Not so much. The cheese was good. It had a complex flavor, a little sharp, and cooked crispy. The crust left a lot to be desired. It was a little hard, chewy, and maybe a little stale (to be fair, it was midnight, but still... c'mon it's Vegas). The sauce was fine, but not enough. Hmm... size-wise, a small slice, not worth the $4.50 Overall: Meh...slightly above average. Hence, the 3 1\/2 stars.

The White sicilian: A much more subtle and delicate slice, slightly sweet also. Different white cheeses blended gave a nice flavor. Little islands of good cheese were sweet and refreshing. The crust was soft, spongy, and very thick. It reminded me more of a loaf of focaccia bread. Not exactly a new york style Sicilian, but good. I would give this one 3 stars, only average.

The condiments bar: A new york style condiment counter with oregano and garlic powder, in addition to the typical crushed red pepper and parmesan. I appreciated this, it's nice to have.

The atmosphere: First of all, it's really really hard to find this place. We had to ask four staff members through what seemed like an endless maze and multiple floors. The pizza place itself is a little hole in the wall pizzeria down a long tunnel hallway, which instantaneously transports you from the Cosmo glitz to a no frills NYC pizzeria (ok a fake, touristy, manufactured NYC pizzeria). There's only one counter bar to eat on inside. So, we chose to port our pizza to the retro glam seating area right outside (back into the Cosmo Glam world).

Price: $4.50 for a slice is ok at the Cosmo, but no New Yorker in their right mind would pay that much, especially for such a small slice. (Ok, Ok I know this is Vegas...but YOU try this small slice, and then tell me if it's worth the price). 

Bottom Line: The pizza is ok, not worth the schlepp though (or the price for that matter). I would come back if I'm drunk and hungry after midnight. I have a feeling it's good drunk food. *wink*",0,0,0

I think my problem is, that while LV has a ton of recreations of things and places, they are all loaded up with kitsch, and secret pizza keeps the kitsch minimal- like they are going to trick us into not noticing what they're going for.

Okay, if you've read this far, you're probably like ""Why is this girl giving them 4 stars if she's just gonna complain about stuff?"" And to you I say, ""SORRY- had to get it out of my system.""

Anyway, the pizza is good. I wouldn't say it's the best pizza I've had in my life or even the best Pizza west of NY, but it's a good pie. I know everyone makes a big fuss over the white pizza, but the homemade sausage they put on top their pies is SO good.

If you're in the cosmo and you're drunk, hungry, or even if you think you can't eat another bite- GET A SLICE!

drinks are a rip off and come in a red cup that is super hard to handle if you're juggling slices of pizza, a bag, children or whatever in your other hand.",4,2,2

So, $30 for a pizza sounds high, right?  But when that pizza is bigger than the wheel of a monster truck and you're on the notoriously expensive and overpriced Las Vegas Strip, this is a screaming deal.  One pizza kept two of us fed (off and on) for easily three days and probably saved us from at least two or three $50+ meals.  

The key to making it worthwhile is to time the line so there isn't much of a wait.  We skipped this place a few times when the lunch lines were massive, and although we tried once to call ahead and place an order, they never picked up the phone.  But on a weekday at 2pm - no problemo!  We ordered, took a quick wander, came back 20 minutes later and they practically greeted us at the door with our pizza and a big smile.  This place beats the pants off the late night pizza joint in NYNY, and if you've got a fridge or a big group, a full pizza pie is a great option.  For smaller groups, the individual slices are well worth checking out.",3,1,1

- Pepperoni and sausage
- Sun dried tomatoes

Conclusion:  I am definitely going to be the minority opinion here *bracing to have tomatoes thrown at me*....The Pizzeria at the Cosmopolitan didn't quite hit the mark, but if left with middle of the night munchies, I still welcome it as an option for late night pizza.

Pizzas are $5 per slice. Not cheap, but worth it. The server provides some clever banter while the cashier is all business. I'm a straight cheese, homey kind of guy. Need that red sauce, though. Friend swore by the white pizza, but the cheese was money. Also got that pepperoni, sausage, veggie, and other mix and match optionality. Or build your own pizza and sell it in the hallway.

Why? Because as we left, the line doubled in size. You walk out with your slice, loaded up with parmesan and red pepper flakes, and everyone ooh's and ahh's at the deliciousness. Jealousy abounds.

Sit down on one of the couches or seats in the third floor lobby. Fold that slice long ways: for the paper airplane inclined, that's hot dog style, not hamburger style. Get that sucker in your mouth. Prepare to be amazeballed.

Got our friend his re-up. Not a moment too soon. Another guy was completely passed out and the cops asked if he knew who and where he was. Not our problem; we got our guy. The pizza rejuvenated him...to lose more money gambling. You're welcome, Vegas.

Went back two days later sober to make sure the pizza was legit. No line. Still was.

FOOD
The pizza is NY Style thin crust. It was OKAY, not spectular enough to be worth $5 a slice! I've had wayyy better pizza for half the price. IMO costco pizza even tastes better.

White pizza - Just okay. Really heavy-handed on the ricotta. There was just thick globs of it scattered everywhere.

Cheese pizza - Average. Kinda greasy

Mushroom - Average

Sausage & pepperoni - Probably the better one of them all. It actually had some flavor to it. 

SERVICE
SUCKED! Pretty much you walk up to the counter and the person takes your order. The lady who helped us was rude. Honestly seemed like she HATED her job. Just gave us her frowning face & asked us what we wanted. The pizzas were just laid on the counter in front of her and it didn't even really look all appealing. But since we made it all the way here, we might as well order. She only warmed up two out of our 4 slices. So our food was half warm, half cold.

This place is on the 3rd floor of cosmopolitan near the Blue Ribbon Sushi place. But there are no signs mentioning the pizza place. At first, we couldn't find it and had to ask someone where it was.

It's great for late night or a quick bite. The pizza is super tasty and reminds me of grabbing a slice in NYC. They generally always seem to have margherita pizza, a white pizza (mozzarella, ricotta, garlic, spinach), pepperoni slices, and pepperoni and meatball slices. 

It is a bit pricey for a slice, but that's to be expected in Vegas and especially in the Cosmopolitan.

The Secret pizza in the Cosmopolitan is definitely by far one of the coolest ideas that the strip ever came up with after a night at chandelier or the dry bar or hanging out at marquee whether it be the poor or gambling upstairs it doesn't matter everybody loves the secret pizza it's just like you are in Manhattan for a second there is a quick line but you have to find a place first if you ask the security guard or someone that works in the hotel they will tell you whether it's located yes it's a secret only because there is no advertise meant there is literally a door and inside it is a replica of the New York City pizza parlour that is open late and it sells pizza by the slice
The pizza is absolutely incredible but it's something that you do when you are at the Cosmopolitan.

I got a slice of the pepperoni and a slice of sausage. I was quite upset with the amount of toppings on the pizza. Only a few pieces of sausage and pepperoni per slice was not what I expected.

They also have Coke Zero on tap (served in plain red Solo cups, a nice touch), which delighted one of my friends. We took our haul up to the room and dined there. 

The slices were both quite nice. Big, satisfying slices, with good quality cheese, the right quantity of sauce, and plentiful toppings. The pepperoni was meaty and delicious, and the mushrooms were great, if chopped a little small. 

Sure, it's a bit of a gimmick, but it's fun. Check it out. If you can find it. :)",1,0,2

If you are looking for a cheap eat in a pizza form Bonnanos on the strip does the job and a much better tasting slice or if you want similar to east coast style pizza  Grimaldis at the Venetian is amazing...pricey but worth it.

Why 3 stars then? Well, I went on a Tuesday at around 1:45 in the morning and stood in line for 30minutes. Not too shabby. I wouldn't say that they were extremely busy and they seemed to be well staffed too. Thing is, it was DIRTY. The parmesan, oregano, chili flakes and garlic powder was scattered all over their counter tops as if they were having a party. I don't mind dirty when you're slammed and short staffed but there was absolutely no excuse for dirtiness that night. Especially since there was an employee stuck to her phone in the corner. She didn't even TRY to crouch down so that no one could see her. 

Not to mention the fact that the guys there didn't seem too enthusiastic about being there. I know that I wouldn't want to be at work at that time in the morning but, come on. At least be a little pleasant? Anyway, if I didn't have to consider their employees they would've been a solid 4 and a half stars.

Don't let my review scare you though. Pizza dough was crisp and the small burns that it had was still enjoyable. There was a good amount of cheese and, was perfectly melted. Pepperoni had that juicy yet still crispy feel. Their Blanca slice was OK. Nothing too special but you definitely see and taste the ricotta. 

I would definitely go back since the pizza's great. I just hope they step up their customer service.",4,3,3

They also have arcade games and pinball machines. It's really small, so don't count on eating in there unless it's not too busy. 

The line was pretty long when I went especially considering it was 2:00 am, but the pizza was worth the 15 minute wait.  I got 2 slices of pizza ($5.50 each). One had pepperoni and banana peppers and the other had white cheese. The pepperoni and banana peppers slice was good, but the white cheese pizza I think is the one everyone should try if they come here.

Overall, it's easy to see why people love this place: it's open basically all night, there's mystery surrounding it being ""secret"", and its old school theme is really cool.

Starting off on one of those nights, my three friends Jerry J., Matt B. and Gracie C. and I hit this place up last night (6\/29\/11) after we all got off of work. The plan - get dinner and bring it back to Gracie's place at the Veer Towers to play pool. 

After a short little walk from Caesar's, Gracie and I walked right on over  - it's right by the pool table on the third story. Jerry offered to buy dinner - buying a whole pizza is definitely the way to go at this joint - $18 for a huge cheese pizza and an extra ridiculous $2.25 per topping. We opted for 1\/2 cheese, 1\/2 pepperoni which came with 12 slices for $20 plus some change. It's so much cheaper than buying by the slice, but you'd never know because there's no menu. 

We sat around for a bit until one of our coworkers showed up with some people while giving them a tour of the place. There definitely isn't enough seating here whatsoever. After about a 15-20 minute wait, we had our pizza. The four of us then made the trek to CVS to pick up some pop and water.

After our trek to CVS and battling the wind, we headed up to the 37th floor of the Veer Tower chow down on the pizza. It had been at least a good half hour since we got our pizza and it was still relatively hot when we opened the box

I've definitely had better pizza. Metro, for one, is super delicious and this doesn't hold a candle to Round Table. Yes, going to a ""secret"" pizza place might be ""cool"" but their pizza is not even remotely close to the ""I'm a fan"" 4 stars or ""As good as it gets"" 5 stars that so many people are giving this place. Novel concept but again, the pizza is meh. The crust is hard. Not chewy, not crispy, but break your teeth hard. That automatically disqualifies it from getting higher than a 3 star.

Food Quality: 5 Stars
-  Great pizza! Get the Meatball, Pepperoni, or their most popular slice, ""The White"".  

Meatball - Large slices of Meatball and globs of ricotta cheese.

Pepperoni - Large slices of real pepperoni, makes pizza chains seem like they are using intimidation pepperoni?   

""The White"" - its all cheese, fresh ricotta, and garlic sauce. There is no pizza sauce on that one but trust me, its good! My wife loves Chicago Deep Dish Pizza and dislikes NY style, but this was the best pizza she ever had. 

Pricing: 5 Stars
- $5 a slice, if you're hungry, get 2 slices as they are large, but thin (NY style). It costs more than other pizza joints but factor in that it's located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. 

Service: 3 Stars
- Nothing incredible but it is just a pizza counter and they are just mashing out pizzas. The workers were friendly and helped me choose some good slices. There is a little bit of a wait but its worth it!

Atmosphere: 5 Stars
- Has a real NY pizza place feel. A couple pinball machines and some TV's playing sports. Hallway is decorated with vintage vinyl records and adds some class but once its opens up to the pizza counter, its straight NY style! 

Place is really a secret, I had to ask 3 different hotel employees to find it. Its a hallway that is missed in a blink. Its to the left of glass elevator and across from the ""game lounge"" (pool table, scrabble coffee tables, wooden dice seats). 

Comfort: 3 Stars
- It's a narrow hallway any little counter space to eat, but you will be there just to buy and run so no worries there. 

Location: 3 Stars trying to find it but as far as theme goes (being a secret, 5 Stars)
- Place is really a secret, I had to ask 3 different hotel employees to find it. Its a hallway that is missed in a blink. Its to the left of glass elevator and across from the ""game lounge"" (pool table, scrabble coffee tables, wooden dice seats). With a name like ""Secret Pizza"", mission accomplished! 

- The Fat: 

My in-laws were in town and of course we needed to take them out to the Vegas Strip. There was 25 of us so no need for a sit down dinner, especially with many small children. I found ""Secret Pizza"" on Yelp and opt'ed to go there as we made our way to the Bellagio fountain show. 

It was tricky to find, had to use my GPS and ask 3 hotel employees to get there but it really is a hidden treat. You will have to wait a little bit, I was there on a Sat night around 11pm and we waited about 20-30 mins?

The pizza is delicious! hot, fresh, and kills any other pizza I had, only rivaled by Grimaldi's Pizza in NY under the Brooklyn bridge. I would go out of my way to go here again. If you are on the strip and want fast, inexpensive, but quality food, go to Secret Pizza!!!",1,0,0

Yes, it's a cool concept where you have to find this place through word of mouth and there are no signs anywhere that tells you where to go. However, the quality of the pizza and selection is subpar. (BTW in case you are wandering, this is located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel)

The first time I went, I had to wait in line for almost half an hour and there's almost no seating inside the place and minimal seating outside as well. This makes eating pizza while holding your water cup extremely difficult. This time when i went, at least there was no line. The choices of pizza were whatever and it wasn't that clear you could add toppings onto the pizza. Each slice was about costco but it cost around 6 dollars without toppings and probably more with each topping. The plates they gave us were very flimsy and the oil leaked through. The pizza flavor wasn't very rich and and crust was not good at all. I have had way better pizza and I don't understand the hype here.",2,1,1

Saw this place on the TV show, Man Finds Food. He endorsed the white pizza which in my opinion is the best pizza they have! There was quite a line when we got there hence, my reason for stating that it's not much of a secret.

I ordered the supreme combo while the hubby ordered a slice of white pizza and their sausage pepperoni. 

Their supreme combo is comparable to Costco's combo pizza and to be honest ( as I should be on yelp), I prefer the Costco combo pizza. 
As for their famous white pizza, it definitely deserves its fame! This pizza has one topping and that topping is cheese!!! Why is it so delicious?! I think its the garlic and whatever combination ingredients they used to make the white sauce. Also, this pizza is made out of sour dough which adds to its delicious flavor. Their sausage pepperoni had some good flavor to it as well.

The place is small. Only a few bar seating on the perimeter. The line typically stretches out to the small hallway and ends at the counter where you can order and pay. 

They have a small variety of fountain drinks and alcohol. There's also a water dispenser. 

Staff are friendly and work very fast. 

We ended up sitting on one of the Cosmo hotel loungy areas which wasn't bad at all...

Overall, don't even bother with the other pizza's. Just go for the white one and have your friends save a seat either inside or outside.",1,0,0

The white sauce pizza has a heavenly bite, it's the slice I'd recommend above all else if you're being skimpy and only eating one.  But this pizza is great and life is short, so you should definitely have two.  The peperoncino and sausage is my backup, and also wonderful to the taste buds.

There's not much to say about the restaurant itself, it's basically just a pizza stand tucked down an alleyway on the third floor of the Cosmo.  They have pictures lining the walls with celebs who've visited, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  The Cosmo is also quickly becoming my favorite hotel in Vegas, because even though I haven't stayed there yet I seem to find myself there on every trip whether it's to gamble, take in the young nightlife, or drink at one of their nice bars\/clubs.

Pizza was quick and fast, although the worker seemed like she was not happy that day.  They ran out of the combination pizza we saw and she was not about to make anymore so the only ""vegetable"" they had left was a plain mushroom one which is what I got.  It was greasy, but after  a few dabs it was good.
The worker also said she didn't have water on tap so we had to pay quite a bit for the water bottle. My friend who is a vegetarian wanted cheese pizza, but she said she was out of that as well and wasn't going to make anymore. She insisted we just buy the more expensive pepperoni and pick it off.

The pizza is totally acceptable, but doesn't compare to a place like Hot Lips in Portland, or [insert random place in your neighborhood here].  To be clear, it is better than average, and I have no issues with the overall taste.  It just didn't blow me away.

If you're at the Cosmopolitan or in the area (especially late at night if you're hungry) I would say to stop by if you're in the mood for pizza, but I wouldn't go out of my way walking down the Strip to get here, or get lost inside the Cosmo looking for it.  It's a cool looking joint once you make it inside.  So, Secret Pizza may not be special, but it's definitely ""A-OK.",8,6,2

And since he sampled a bite of my slice it was only fair he gave me a bit of his pepperoni, which I enjoyed just as much as my own.

There are like 4 seats inside here so you're probably taking your pie somewhere else to eat it. But, you can play old school video games while you wait like Galaga so that's pretty sweet.

They also sell a few beers and wines next to the sodas, but we went with Orange Fanta all the way when we stopped in for sustenance.

I admit it. While celebrating my 25th extravaganza in Vegas last week, I am guilty of being a repeat offender of Secret Pizza. For a bunch of girls (and boys) who revolves our schedules around eating and trying new places, I would say that is quite a compliment!

Here's how it all started. Before we decided to go bar crawling in the Cosmopolitan, a local friend of mine told me that I should get the white pizza at Secret Pizza. Intrigued by this mysterious pizza joint and white pizza, the gang and I headed over in our tight dresses to devour some deliciousness. Being greedy as ever, I decided to go for their famed white slice and a combo. Halfway through, I realized my stomach is much smaller than I thought and had a difficult time finishing. The unique taste of the white pizza (composed of 3 different types of cheeses) had my taste buds jumping for joy but the familiar taste of the combo had me equally impressed.

Secret Pizza makes me feel like I'm so ""in the know"". From the outside, no one would know what the hallway leads to. For those who rarely ventures off into random hallways, well that's their loss! I plan on coming back next time I'm in Vegas, so yelper's-- please keep the long lines as short as possible by keeping this place a secret!",8,6,6

The line moves pretty steadily, most of the time. If it's slow, it's probably the customer, not the workers. Just a wittle ""for-your-information.""

Their white pizza is the definite winner. The gobs of different cheeses that they use are just too delicious. Pepperoni and sausage is a close second! They use thick slices of sausage that just complement the rich tomato sauce perfectly. Their crust is chewy and crispy at the same damn time. 

If you come here you have to order an entire pizza regardless of how many people are in your party. Nothing beats a freshly baked pizza! Just be careful to wait a second so you don't burn the roof of your mouth.

We were able to get helped right away. My fiancé got a slice of pepperoni and a slice  of sausage and bell peppers, I got a slice of the supreme-which included sausage, pepperoni, and veggies. They had charged us for three slices, a salad, and water. They served us four slices. I brought it back to the guy and he said ""no worries, enjoy!"" So, we did! The pizza was delicious and each one of them was well worth the calories. The salad we ordered was much better than a salad you would assume would come from a pizza place. Prices were OK. Altogether, I think we spent $30. Not bad at all. Especially, for Las Vegas. It's very casual, there was a lot of people there that you could tell came straight from the pool. After a long day of drinking and being in the sun I'm sure they were definitely ready for pizza. There is limited seating, we were lucky enough to get two seats. Overall, the place is very small.

Out of the three, the white was our favorite, and the meatball and ricotta was delicious too. However, the mushrooms on the cheese pizza with sausage was way too undercooked. It was a disappointment.

I am actually not a big fan of pizza, more for weight watch reason. So I want it good when I have to spend my calories on it. And this worth every bite as much as every single calories on it. My favourite is their sausage jalapenos pizza. It's just simple, thin crust and so so so flavorful. I don't even understand what they put in there. I like that the crust are crispy and thin, yet the pizza is still very moist. With the pamasen and chilli flakes, I can eat half a pizza if I have burn it out in marquee dance floor before hand. 

Being said, it is in the comospolitan hotel, on the 3rd floor, above marquee.

That is how I felt when I took my first bite of Secret Pizza. This is one of the main reasons I came to Vegas.  Cheese drag, fat juicy chunks of sausages, and pepperoni that was to die for.

Secret Pizza really had it all. The mystique of not being formally mentioned anywhere inside of the hotel, a cool hallway of music records to give it a chic and classic kind of feel, sports playing on a TV in the corner, and the delicious pizza to go with it.

On the real, though, I don't think there's any way I would've been able to find this place on my own if The Empress hadn't been there before and led me there herself. But, that's Secret Pizza's whole thing, isn't it? I think it's pretty cool! It makes the place feel almost a little exclusive. 

Onto the food! The pizza was phenomenal. I mean, I'm by no means any pizza expert or anything, but I do know that that was the best pizza I've ever had; hands down (and I've been to Chicago, folks). The pizza that I had wasn't even a freshly baked one. It was from a hot plate and then put back into the oven for a few minutes. That's how good it was! The cheese, as mentioned above was oh so stringy. Legitimately the most stringy cheese that I have ever had on a pizza, and I loved it. The sausage on the pizza was also just amazing. They were the largest chunks of Italian sausage that I've had on a pizza before, and they were just as flavorful as they were large. Even the crust was nice and perfectly crisp, but soft at the same time. The pizza was spectacular.

To say that Secret Pizza lived up to my expectations would be an understatement. The only thing that bums me out about any of it is that I'm lactose intolerant and could only bring myself to go get pizza there once in the few days that we were in Vegas.

If you can manage to find Secret Pizza, then I absolutely suggest that you make a point of stopping by to get the same experience I did. You won't regret it!",11,7,12

Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor across the billiard tables and chandelier. 

There's an element of mystery when trying to find this place because the hallway leading up to the actual pizzeria has no signage or pizza advertisements. You can easily find it, though, when you see people walking out of the hallway carrying their food out... I felt like Alice going to Wonderland except there's pizza on the other side, and not talking flowers and such. It's kinda cool knowing that this place is literally a hole in the wall, especially since the NY style slices offered here are really good.

The interior is pretty small and it can get packed so fast. There's very limited seating (I only saw like two or three chairs) and then the rest is standing area. There's a few arcade games in there as well. 

Overall, the pizza was slightly doughy and had a bit of crunch to the bottom of the slice. I had two slices of pizza: a white pizza slice and a mushroom one.

The white pizza with ricotta was so good. I think the ricotta elevated the flavor of the slice because when I bit into it, my mouth was hit with the rich, cheesy goodness. The mushroom pizza didn't really have that strong of a mushroom taste, probably because the mushrooms were more like small bits scattered all over the pizza slice. It had a very subtle mushroom flavor going on. I ended up spending $11 on the two slices of pizza. 

I think the pizza is a little pricey (what isn't on the strip?), but so worth it. In my opinion, I'd say I believe in the hype this place has got. It can get crowded and you may bump elbows with other people if you dine-in, but this place definitely did not disappoint!",11,6,8

Even though I read where it was I still had a hard time finding it. It is on the 3rd floor near several other restaurants. Literally look for a dimly lit hallway with old record albums lining the wall. If you see a pinball machine straight ahead you've found it! 

I lived near Chicago for 11 years so it's hard for me to appreciate anything other than Chicago style pizza (deep dish an\/or thin crust with sweeter sauce). That said, this pizza was pretty darn good for thin crust and fair priced at $3 a slice for cheese and an extra 50 cents for each additional topping. I tried a cheese slice and a slice of pepperoni. Both were good but I must admit that I did use a napkin to soak up some excess grease from the pepperoni slice. 

The option to just stop in for a slice of pizza is great as long as you can locate it. I heard the beer price is reasonable but I forgot to look into it. I would recommend just running into an ABC store on your way over for a huge beverage selection.

It's comfort food. And, you can add toppings of your choice (for some extra $).  They have the basics premade -- cheese, pepperoni, white pizza, and some other choice pie of the day.

No its not hard to find, just take the cylinder elevator in the center of the east tower to the 3rd floor and bust an immediate left down the corridor with pictures all on the wall. No its not cheap, I had my supreme slice with an orange soda for $10, pretty expensive even by New York standards for just 1 slice, but maybe not so much by Vegas standards. BUT, did you know for $4.50 they also have huge slices of mind blowingly delicious SECRET CHEESECAKE?!?!?! This is my second time staying in the cosmo, and thanks to a craving, I hunted down this delectable gem, after speaking to various workers in different restaurants in search of a cheesecake to get my fix before my flight.

It's nice after a show or having met friends on the Strip to just run in and grab a slice. Most of the time that's all I'm really needing anyhow.

Once you get down the hallway you walk into what looks like any slice pizzeria I've ever been in. You wait in line, order up a big slice of whatever they have made in the last 10 minutes, and find a little counter space to enjoy pizza and wine\/beer. 

Every time I've been here they I've gotten through the line quickly, the staff  has been friendly, and the pizza has been good. It is a bit pricey for a slice but you're on the Strip so that's what can be expected. If you weren't being overcharged then it wouldn't be a Las Vegas restaurant.

Secret Pizza is a small joint, located down a long, secret hallway lined with music record covers on the third floor of the ___________hotel. Since SP is not listed on the hotels website or in their directory, nor do they have any signs indicating they are even a buisness, they can be hard to locate. 

Since SP is open till the wee hours of the morning, most people usually stumble in here in the early AM to cure their drunken munchies. Not me though. I stumbled in here right when they opened at 11am to cure my I just woke up and I'm hungry as hell munchies. All they serve here is pizza and beer. Simple. Delicious. You can buy your pie whole or by the slice. These are the slices my wife and I bought;

1 white pizza slice http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=24ppCiDbltVR9nt4spAUFQ

1 sausage & Pepperchini slice http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=AwEEKS68Y2WnPRDIJYzHNg

Since we got there right after they opened, each slice was just coming out of the oven. After waiting a few minutes to let the huge slices cool, I remember my girl Michelle T's warning about burning my mouth, my wife and I dug in. All three slices were great. They had lots of cheese and toppings, flavorful sauce and a nice, crispy crust. At $5 a slice, this is a great spot for a quick, tasty meal.

Definitely worth the search. The slice is pretty big, so one per person is pretty decent. It isn't too expensive either. If you get one whole box, it is a little cheaper per slice. I suggest getting this if you have a bigger group who doesn't mind getting the same thing.

It's like the hole in the wall pizza by the slice places in NYC. There are no thrills. A pizza counter and guys making fresh dough and heating slices. A single slice is HUGE and is $4.50\/$5.00 a slice. Trust me, you'll only need one.  They also sell whole pies, beer, soda, and 2 liters.

Approaching my Vegas trip, a friend told me to check out this place in the Cosmopolitan hotel.  I don't know how he found out about it, but apparently this place had really good pizza and was hidden somewhere in the Cosmo.  Oh it was hidden all right.  When I jumped on the Cosmopolitan hotel website to find a list of their restaurants....no listing for this place.  Luckily I stumbled on it here on Yelp, listed as ""Secret Pizza"".

I followed other reviewers' directions and hints for finding the place: it's down a sorta-hidden hallway next to the pool tables on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo.  We could smell pizzas in the oven once we got to the 3rd floor, so we knew we were in the right place.  Even in the hotel there was no mention of this pizza place and no signs pointing towards it.  Even the restaurant is unnamed!

But my friend was right, the pizza was delicious (although I think its novelty partially adds to the taste, haha)!  Crispy crust, fresh-tasting dough, and a delicious blend of cheese\/sauce as topping!  I got the white pizza (feta and mozzerella cheeses instead of tomato sauce) with mushrooms on it.  I guess because mushrooms aren't a super popular topping, the chef just put raw mushrooms on a slice of white pizza before sending it through the oven to heat it up.  It's okay; still super good!!

We lucked out coming in at 2pm, which I guess isn't part of the lunch crowd, so there wasn't a line.  However, I've heard there can be a pretty long line for this place, especially in the wee hours of the morning when the nightclubbers come out of Marquee.

For 5 dollars a slice.. And these are relatively small slices, I thought it wasn't worth my money. Don't get me wrong it was good though. The crust is very thin and crispy and I loved it, but I feel like the location uped the price so much. My slice only had three pepperonis on it. Cheese was decent and kind of stringy.

But once Tropfest ended, the planets finally aligned, and Diane and I quickly left the Boulevard Pool via escalator and easily found our way to this highly touted haven of late-night pizza at last.  The line to order was fairly long even after 1:00 a.m. on a Monday.    And, I quickly learned that if pizza slices rather than a full pie are sought, what you are able to get totally depends on what comes out of the pizza ovens just before one's order is placed.  

But luck was with us on this visit, for we were able to buy fresh hot slices of pepperoni, sausage, and cheese pizza, plus commandeer two adjoining seats at the counter to be able to eat while sitting down.  Although I might have preferred slices of pepperoni & mushroom pizza, no such combination was available when I reached the head of the line.  But getting to try three out of four flavors is pretty good!

I was really pleased with this pizza.  My expectations were high going in, but they were exceeded.  The crust was nice and buttery, with no char on the bottom.  While the wide slices were relatively thin, they were not noticeably so, and the nicely finished crust was chewy, resilient, and foldable.  All slices were just saucy enough, and really cheesy and tasty.  Pepperoni was lightly spicy, and sausage was very mild, just as pizza maker Luigi had indicated when I asked him on my way through the line.  A small amount of grease was present, but to me that was a good thing for this New York style pizza.  Even though they had come out of the oven just a few minutes before I reached the cash register, each slice was given a little more fire before they were handed to me.  So they were hot and gooey, and a true treat to consume whether drunk or sober.  For, I loved this pizza, and unlike many other guests, had only water to drink all night.  In fact, the Secret Pizza establishment graciously offers free cold water out of a dispenser, with plastic cups and utensils provided as well.  

Besides probably being the cheapest meal available inside a Strip hotel, IMHO the Secret Pizza likely serves the best pizza on The Strip, and is neck and neck with Biaggio's and Metro Pizza, and just a shade behind Dom DeMarco's, for the best pizza served in the entire Las Vegas valley.

It's hard to find but that's part of the fun. 

You even get just a touch of attitude from the pizza makers, New York style! That only makes it all the more authentic to me. Just enough attitude to make it interesting but not enough to annoy you. That's why I keep coming back. 

So a slice will (as of this writing) run you about $5, which ain't cheap for pizza. But it's very well made, slowly baked and they'll reheat it for you without even being asked. So I knocked off one star for pricing but in fairness, they DO give you a free cup of water if y ou want it. Also keep in mind it's standing room only and no place to sit but plenty of counter space to stand and eat along the walls. 

Love the atmopshere, 80s music often blaring in the background with a few vintage arcade games from that era as well. It's like a time warp back to my teen Generation X years and I love it. Some great art and photos on the wall as well. All in all, a lot packed into a little place.

After walking in it is a totally normal pizzeria with a Brooklyn flair to it. Again just pizza, no garlic bread or knots. Nothing on the side just pizza. A tad over priced pizza. $6 for a slice seems steep when a pie is usually double that price but I mean I forget it's strip prices. I was going to get two slices but was not paying $12. 

The slice I got was a white pizza. It was very good. Nothing over the top but still good. I'm from NY so impressing me with pizza is hard to do. 

The staff was nice and friendly and pizza didn't take long. If you can actually find this place try it out. Only if you want pizza though. GOD SPEED!",5,4,4

-good crust (crispy and thin)
-really accommodating staff (changed my order to go)
-packed to go slices well
-no wait on them making pizza. very efficient in having all the slices prepared
-HUGE slices (i ordered two)
-cool space

CONS:
-over priced (about $5.50 for a basic slice... get whole pizza for about $30 if you're sharing)
-VERY oily... i usually don't care about oil\/grease but this pizza had too much

After a night of clubbing in painful 5 inch heels, walking around Cosmopolitan to find a slice of pizza was never a priority of mine.

Located on the third floor of Cosmopolitan between Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Jose Andre's Jaleo. If you enter from the strip, see a giant red shoe sculpture and take the escalators up -- you're going in the right direction! There are NO signs, no banners, nothing to indicate where you are, so just look for the hallway with a line of people. Leave it to that long, long line in the hallway to make you antsy and even more hungry as you see other people leaving with their slices of pizza.

We decided to order an entire sausage and pepperoni pizza, which took about 40 minutes to make. To kill time, we went down into the Cosmo casino and gambled for a bit. Once the pizza was done, we took it back to our room to be devoured. It was not the best slice of pizza that I have ever had but hey, it was 3 am, tasty and hit the spot. Thin crust pizza, somewhat greasy, and fair amount of cheese and toppings.

Really, there is no secret cause it's pretty obvious where all the after party goers straight out of Marquee go when they are done clubbing.  And for those that don't know or are a bit reluctant at getting in line, just trust yourself and follow the smell of oven... baked... pizza.

Yeah, I didn't think you'd resist, and neither could I.

I LOVED Secret Pizza... if only for an after clubbing meal cause my ass surely was already dehydrated, and the idea of tomato pasta sauce to ""quench my thirst"" was more than enough.

The pizza was delicious, even though I'm sure the alcohol made it taste better.  The crust was doughy and delicious, and a very generous sized slice for your stomach.  The Pepperoni Sausage was a personal favorite!  Gotta go for the meats to curb the appetite.

The only thing I was sad about was that if you wanted to order a whole pizza for yourself, it could only be one kind (as in you can't have half of it be veggies, and the other half be pepperoni salami meat lovers delight).  But fair enough- it helps keep the crowd moving.

Not too shabby, Abby!  Ended up going here after the Yelp event at Chino Poblano a few weeks ago.  Even though Jose Andres and his crew did fill me up with the great goodies and libations, the lady and I were curious about how good this 'hidden' pizzeria at The Cosmopolitan was.  After gambling off the buzz we had (boy does losing money sober you up quick), we were off to the 3rd floor.  Folks were right on the money, you'll see the hidden hallway going to the pizzeria right near the pool table.  One massive line later (damn was it busy with people dressed in sequins for some reason) we were finally at the front.  

I had no clue what to order since most of the slices looked pretty good.  I went with what a lot of yelpers said was tasty, the cheese slice with ricotta.  Must be pretty good because when I went to order it, the cook took out a hidden pie from below from what was already out on the counter!  Kinda like a secret menu item, eh?  Back it went into the oven for a quick reheat.  I'm not big on the reheating of a pie but I guess there ain't much choice here because the line seems constantly busy.  The price?  $11 for 2 slices, kinda ehhhh for me on that front (I guess I'm a cheapie.  Sue me.)  because at a place like Broadway Pizzeria you can get an entire large pie for nearly the same price.  And yes, the pizza at Broadway is a good NY style thin crust!

The 2 slices of cheese and ricotta we had at The Cosmopolitan?  Luckily, they were pretty good!  Good flavor and a crunchy crust pleased me pretty well.  I liked my slice even better with red pepper, oregano, and garlic on top.  However the slices seemed a bit smaller than what I've recently seen on the reviews here.  Economic crunch perhaps?  Price and portion made me had to knock off a few points here.  It really left me wanting a bigger slice.  Although considering this is the Strip it's not too expensive for a meal.  The pizza pie is good, but I think it's cheaper if you and a few folks go in and just order an entire pie around the $20 range with toppings.  Save some dough, and then eat it!

Service was fast and friendly, but pay attention to the prices!  Good thing for Yelp, I avoided the overpriced drink in a small red cup!  Seriously, almost $4 for a soda in a regular red party cup with no lid?  I'd rather buy an extra slice of pizza and live with the minor halitosis from the extra shake of garlic I'd be putting on!  Ha Ha, does the pizzeria know folks get a Heineken from the casino downstairs for just $1 tip?  Ooooh, good idea!  I think I'll do that next time!  Pizza and beer.....winning!",2,2,1

Had it not been for my fellow yelpers I would have never found this place. Like everyone else has said-it's down a long hallway of album covers with a pinball machine at the end thinly sandwiched between 2 other restaurants on the 3rd floor, behind the game area. If you really need anymore help, just go to the Cosmo's website and look at the building floor plans. It can be pretty hard to find. 

At the end of the skinny, slightly creepy hallway, it's as if you've set foot in the type of pizza shop you see pretty much everywhere except Las Vegas. 
It's $3.00 a slice, which may seem steep but by the standards of The Strip that might as well be free (The Strip is the place where bottles of water can be as high as $4.00 and the dollar menu doesn't even exist at McDonald's people).

They offer parmesan, oregano, garlic powder, red pepper flakes and pepper on the tables, which is perfect but at the same time rather unnecessary - this pizza is good enough without flavor enhancement. The crust is so good, it's burnt enough to be really crispy, but not burnt enough to just taste.....burnt. The cheese was bubbly and piping hot. My only gripe is that it was a little bit too greasy, but I'm willing to overlook that. 

Two slices of pepperoni pizza and drink (with as many free refills as you want) came out to be: $10.81. Not bad at all for The Strip.

What was good about this pizza joint is the fact that it's New York style pizza and I'm a sucker for crunch thin crust pizza by the slice. I have to be quiet honest though that this place is a tad pricey compared to the normal pizza by the slice spots that I go to in the bay.

Me and the wifey simply came here on a very very small appetite, but the fact that we were in Vegas and looking for something to do, I suggested we searched for this so called ""Hidden Pizza"" spot I can always go for a nice slice of New York style pizza. Anyways we only ordered one slice of pizza to share amongst us two, as I mentioned before that we came here not hungry at all. Well, we ordered a meatball pizza, which was something we have never had before and thought it would be interesting to try something new along with this new place. The taste of the pizza was a bit odd, probably because the whole time I was eating this pizza I was thinking that meatballs can't belong on a pizza. But all in all the pizza was good, and I can't wait to come back here for another slice when I'm in the area. I also like the fact that this place is open late, not a lot of pizza joints that sell pizza by the slice is open this late.

Better believe I'll be back for more, and just maybe this place will get another star.",1,0,0

There is not even an inkling that Secret Pizza exists unless you look for it. 

It's on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, next to the elevators and this really red open restaurant.

Order pizza by the slice for ~$4.50. YES. IT IS  $5\/ slice (added toppings at 0.50 more each). MEH.  Despite the ridiculously steep by the slice price,  it does serve up some delicious thin crust Manhattan, NY styled pizza -- really crispy through and through crust with very ooey, gooey cheesiness. 

There is a NOTICEABLE difference between freshly made and those sitting cold on the counter (they reheat when you order). The crust is fuller and softer. Try to wait for the fresh ones to come out (though, the reheated one was not bad). The reheated one kind of...cut the top of my mouth. mmmhmmmm

Pizzas are greasy, oily and unforgiving, but for those who crave the real deal, you sop up the grease because it's unfortunately.. delicious. It is much saltier than most pizzas I've had though, which probably is due to the need to heighten taste since all your other senses are already bombarded. 

They also sell whole pizzas ... to go ... with boxes that have no name on it, of course. 
Why blow a perfectly good cover? :)

The pizza itself is fairly basic. You have a few options and a slice will run you about $5-6. It's simply delicious pizza. Greasy, but not too oily. Just the right amount. It's perfect.

My favorite has always been the sausage\/pepperoni pizza with the italian peppers. 

Take your slice and sit outside in front of STK on the chairs, especially at night. You'll have a front row seat to the Hot Mess Express from Marquee & other parts of the hotel.

My group and I had gotten back to our room early at Elara after clubbing, and we all realized that we were down for some food... Where to go? SECRET PIZZA!!!
So we hopped over to the Cosmopolitan and searched for the hole in the wall.. it's not on the directory, so you gotta know where you're looking. Just ask any drunkards walking around with slices of pizza.
Anyway, we found it no problem, not a newb, but HELL... this is the first time I waited in a long line for it.  Oh and you gotta have some skills blocking people off because there are mad line cutters.  I was able to stop on chick and her friends when i realized she thought we were drunk and could slip by us with ""our friends are up ahead"". Gotcha. Although she was cool and joined us later at blocking off the other douchebags that tried to get through. Some blocked, some got through.. gotta choose your battles.

oh yeah, the food.. bomb.... make sure you sprinkle parm cheese, red pepper flakes, or that green herbstuff(dried parsley flakes?) onto your pizza for extra an special zazz.",2,1,2

First off, my friend and I walked all of the first floor and second floors and back in the first floor but no sign of this place. We even saw some dude that ran inside the casino with a box of pizza, we wanted to ask but the guy was to fast through the exit doors, we just missed em'  I had to ask a Cosmo casino security directions to this place. This is what to remember take the elevator to the third floor, make a right from the elevator, there you will see a small hall way full of photos, finally the hidden gem. 

You have choices of a full pie or slices: $5 slices? Expensive but your in the Cosmo but hey they back it up with some bomb-ass pizzas. What I saw is that they have some pizzas ready in the kitchen, the choices: white, plain cheese, pepperoni, meat lovers, and supreme you choose a slice then they reheat it for you or you can order by request and customize it made fresh, which there is a pizza guy who makes pies in front of you, and to top it off they offer free re-fills on soda purchases.

The first visit my choice was the meat lovers, not as dry, but the flavor still holds up. Same thing goes on my second visit still flavorful and all I had was a white cheesed pizza. Their pizza dough ain't old, and stale that leaves it bland like other joints but it's so opposite of that. It's NY style pizzas here that makes you wanting more.

This is the first place that I've used garlic powder for pizzas which is provided on the counter along with crushed peppers and Parmesan. 
I've learned that the garlic powder adds taste and seasoning to an already awesome pie, it compliments it and thanks to this place Ive learned something new.

This joint is small, only two chairs inside , you might want to hangout where there is a pool table outside  if its not crowded theres a few sofas to get comfy. I found that if your coming from the second floor just take the escalator to the third floor go straight left were you see a small hallway of portraits. Very hidden I must say, no signs here, but worth finding.

I've had this place bookmarked for years & finally had the chance to try it as we're staying at the same hotel of its location.

If I could remember, LOL! It was good, but way overpriced for a slice! Gotta pay by the slice.

$5.00 for cheese pizza
$5.50 for 1 topping pizza

For 5 slices, I don't know how we ended up paying for 2 slices of cheese pizza because we got 2 pepperonis, 2 pepperoni & mushrooms, & 1 cheese garlic ricotta slice.

I don't feel like airing out the location completely, but try following the line of club goers on any evening to the restaurant floor of the Cosmo, where eventually they'll queue up in the hallway of records. It's not hard to find and as for the pizza, it's totally worth it.

This might serve as drunk pizza for some (or most), but the quality is definitely above the subpar slices on the Strip. This pizza is airy, thin sliced, and features the kind of ingredients that make it semi-reminiscent (#1) of stuff I'd find back in New York. I was impressed with their white pizza and regular cheese pie, though I was less fond of the pepperoni and the premium ""deluxe"" option. The latter is their signature pizza, which while tasty, isn't going to win over any diehard NY pizza lovers. Sobriety will really determine a lot of the emotional responses to these slices.

The staff and even the pizza is at its best around these times, and the secret spot is a good place to kill time over retro arcade games and the occasional drink. The lines aren't always a bad thing, but here's a pro tip: call in ahead time and just pick up the pizza later. Bonus points if you decide to let room service handle it all.

It's pricey for pizza at $5+ a slice (depending on topping) and ranges from $30-37 a pie. This is the Cosmo, where even a standard breakfast plate \/ potent cocktail is $16-20. The hype is more real here than most other eateries and certainly worth its weight in tastiness when the cravings get real.

The place is cleverly hidden (almost like a speakeasy) and much more low key than the other the Vegas venues. I ordered the ricotta with sundried tomatoes and my boyfriend got the sausage and peppercini. The toppings are robust and the dough is amazing - full and crispy! It was just delicious from the tip to the crust. Moreover, the guy behind the counter is super friendly, and served our slices within minutes. He also didn't let me pay when I was trying to pay for our meal - that's how you could tell he's a real gentleman!

It's also made with herbs and huge chunks of ricotta & mozzarella cheese. It's an amazing alternative to your standard pizza with red sauce.

Came at around 10PM on a Sunday and there was no line. The menu board is simple, but I wished it listed the available toppings. The pizza that's laid out also isn't labeled so for a first timer you'd have to ask what pizza is offered. They also don't offer cups of water, only bottled so bring your own drink. After you pick your slice, they'll toss it into the oven to heat up a bit for a hot slice of pizza! Anyways onto the food...

Combo Pizza - came with pepperoni, sausage, onion. The pizza was a bit too salty for me but I'm sure it would pair well with a drink. The crust was delicious though! Very thin and crispy, though it can get tiring to chew after a bit. Throw some of that garlic powder (or chili flakes\/parmesan) that's left on the counters and you're set.

And this unassuming and ""hidden"" pizzeria, which is not even what their name is (according to the man I spoke to behind the counter) is located in the newest luxury casino to opened in Las Vegas.  It is on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, across from the escalator and located next to Blue Ribbon Sushi.  There are no signs indicating that there is anything down the short hallway adorned with album covers, besides of course the pinball machine and flat screen televisions mounted on the wall clearly visible to anyone who bothered to look in.  But instead of finding a hidden alcove of arcade games, you will find a counter where you can order your pizza by the slice or by the whole pie, and work space where they prepare the NY-style pizzas from scratch.

Prices are reasonable.  Slices starts at $3 per slice (plain cheese), $3.50 (one-topping), $4 (two toppings combo), and for $6 (you get a slice of plain cheese pizza and domestic draft beer).

18"" Pizza by the pie: $17 (Cheese), $18 (White Pizza - Ricotta & Mozzarella Cheese), $22 (three-toppings), or $25 (five-toppings).

Available Toppings (in alphabetical): Black Olives, Extra Cheese, Fresh Garlic, Green Peppers, Meatballs, Mushrooms, Onions, Pepperoni, Ricotta, Roasted Tomatoes, Sliced Sausage, Spinach, White Anchovies.

Beverages: Coca-Cola Brand fountain drinks, beer and wine (domestic and premium draft), Illy Coffee.  The cup of soda is pretty small, but you can ask for refills. :D

Desserts: New York Cheesecake Slice and Cannoli.

Also if you are staying at the Cosmopolitan and too busy\/lazy\/important\/lost :p to make your way to the ""Pizzeria"", you can ring up the hotel to have someone deliver your pizza order.

BTW, the concept of selling pizzas by the slice has been around for a long time, just ask any UCB students, but to implement this concept inside a mega luxury casino is as Misti (LV Yelp CM) stated, ""genius""!

My friend told me about this place in the hotel called secret pizza. The owners were from statin  island yadda yadda. So I had to give them a try. 

Well. Finding the place took a bit. So much so. I ended up going to another place for lunch. That night at 4am we were coming back from the club. Decided secret pizza was the spot. Took awhile but we found it. The line. Was crazy long!!!  It was a good 25-30 min wait in line for pizza. No joke. Everyone was drunk in the line. It was this narrow hallway. One way in one way out. People were saying excuse me trying to get through. It sucked. Finally. We got up to the counter. 

One of the guys asked what we wanted. So I told him in from NY. I don't eat any pizza out of state. I heard you guys were legit. Please don't disappoint me. The guy laughed.  He said he was from the island. His brother moved out here and started the business. He talked with me for a few mins. Then said hold on one min man. He turned around. Reached under a counter and pulled a pizza out. Then warmed it up in the oven. He came back and said I'll take care of you man. Apparently. If I'm understanding what he did. The pizza on display and what people were ordering were NY style pizza. The special under the counter local NY pizza he pulled out was there original pizza.  It was pretty cool. 

The pizza was really good. I only eat pizza in NY sometimes jersey. But this was the closest thing to NY pizza I have had on the west coast. Really good thin crust pizza just like home.

At first I thought this was one of those casino arcades but my sister assured me theres a pizza place inside. Going all the way in, sure enough it's there. Pretty small area, no frills, one of those menu boards where you can snap plastic letters onto it. Board did mention they have house made pickled peppers but didn't try those. One downside there was no open view of the toppings or posted anywhere unless I totally missed it. They sell by the slice or 16"" whole pies so they had a few pies you could see over the counter. The sausage and pepperocinis on white sauce looked intriguing. We ordered half of that and other half had sun-dried tomatoes. Ricotta comes on top of all white pizzas too.
The pizza is NY style and it didn't disappoint in that aspect. It was very flavorful. Slices were big n floppy. Nice and thin, crust was nice and chewy. Edge crust still had a nice slight crispness on the outside. Pretty good if you're looking for a decent NY style pizza fix on or near the strip. A bit pricey($34.50 whole pie 1.5 topping)but theres not alot that isnt on the strip.

We got a white pizza and a pep and sausage pizza when we first came here and with every trip since then, this is the first thing we pick up after finding our hotel room. 

I would suggest ordering a whole pizza and eating on the spot if you aren't staying at Cosmo. You'll be able to enjoy each bite the way it was intended right out of the even. Just hope that there is a spot to sit down and eat as it does get pretty packed depending on what time you go. Unfortunately, it was packed one time and we took a taxi ride back to our hotel after picking up the pizza one time. By the time we got back it wasn't as fresh, hot, and tasty.

The down side is that the pizza is REALLY greasy  so if you're a health nut you might want to stay away. If you are going to order a whole pizza, it does take a while for it to come out. Also, if you order by the slice, beware its not going to be as good as when its right out of the oven. My girlfriend and I bought two slices that were sitting out and man were we disappointed. They even reheated it for us in the oven. The price is also pretty high...$20 for a whole pizza if I remember correctly.

In the end, the positives outweigh the negatives. Imagining the tastes of each bite at this moment gets my mouth watering. Secret Pizza is a place I would recommend to anyone who loves pizza and is in Vegas. And if you don't, maybe this establishment will change your mind. It's that good!",0,0,0

In two days, I have overheard about this place from a complete stranger while waiting in line at another restaurant, read the stellar reviews on Yelp, and today, heard about it on a morning radio show. I knew I had to try this place ASAP.

Lucky for me, I work on the Strip so my co-workers and I went during lunch. Good thing I did my research or we would've never found the place. It was like a treasure hunt... third floor, next to Blue Ribbon Sushi, down a secret hallway lined with album covers... and there it was!

Once I saw the white pizza come out fresh from the oven, I knew I wanted a slice of it before even hearing what's on it. A slice of the white pizza and a soda cost $7. Not too shabby at all.

The pizza was heavenly. The crust had the right amount of crispiness, garlic and cheesiness. I'm usually not a crust eater but I devoured every last bite. I seriously considered buying a whole box but didn't want to share with the whole office.

The real test was when I brought back a slice of cheese pizza to my co-worker, who is a New Yorker, and is very critical about restaurants that claim to have ""authentic New York pizza."" He said the pizza was ""pretty damn good.""

Since I'm pretty sure everyone knows exactly where this place is by now, I won't go to far into it's whereabouts. But, if you do happen to have a hard time finding it, here's a little tip. There's a strange little glass elevator on the 3rd floor...look just to the left of that and you'll see the dark, but wondrous, hallway to pizza heaven. You're welcome.

Inside you'll find an arcade game, a few counters to stand at while you eat, and the pizza counter itself. Yup, that's it. After you place your order, you make your way down the line and pay for it at the register. Now, I'm not sure if anyone's really paid much attention but there's well over a grand hanging up on the wall as a decoration near the register too. Maybe a slightly over the top take on the ole' first dollar made thing? I don't know, but it was fun to look at it.

The pizza selection itself is decent. They have single slices in several varieties, including their infamous white pizza, as well as full pies and somewhat of a build your own option. I also saw a few deep dish slices sitting out but they were huge, and at $8 a slice, I didn't think I'd be able to finish it all. So, I opted for just a single slice of the white. 

With all the hype, I was actually surprised at how good this pizza was. And sure, it's $5 a slice, but they are so big it was easily justified in my eyes...and stomach. Plus the flavors are great and the crust is on point. I really dug the large clumps of ricotta with the hint of garlic, and it's not overly greasy either. Perfectly foldable, and delicious. No complaints and I'm dying to go back to try a slice with some meat added to it. One of the workers said sausage really adds to the white pie.

One thing I suggest is trying to hit this place up in an off time, if possible. We missed a big rush of people just before 6pm, but as we were leaving, the line was starting to hit the hallway. With standing counter space for only about a dozen people, you might end up juggling your greasy pizza plate and your beer filled red solo cup while tourist play running back to the counter.

30 minutes later, we sat down outside of the restaurant on the couches to a white pie and a meatball\/roasted tomato\/olive pizza. The crust was semi crisp but also a little bready for a thin crust pizza. The white pie had a light garlic topped with seasoned and herby ricotta dollops. The three combo pizza was straight forward although the meatballs weren't anything to get excited over. And the peppers? They came in a little condiment  cup with more liquid than peppers.

Granted, it is a great place eat at 2 am when you're wasted and hanging out at the Cosmo. I felt like the price paid ($5\/slice) for the portion size given was unacceptable.  I know it's Vegas, but you can get a slice twice the size for $3-4 in New York City a.k.a. The mecca of pizza. They also didn't have much variety this time.  I had a sliced sausage and pepperoni pizza which skimped on the sauce and the crust was too chewy.    

We waited about 30 minutes in the line which we didn't mind so much, but it's kind of a letdown when you're overcharged and don't feel completely satisfied at the end. It's still decent drunk food, but I would never consider going there in any other circumstance. 

Being from Texas, I didn't really understand the whole ""No Ranch"" thing.  It's just ranch dressing.  Its not that expensive, you could probably charge a small amount for it and still profit and make tons more customers happy (This is for all of us in TX and the Midwest who require ranch dressing).

Honestly, the pizza is OK. But as a disclaimer, I may have become more of a gourmet pizza snob over the years not having lived in places like Chicago or NY where they have more of those classic pizza joints.

Okay, so maybe I am a little excitable, but even if they were serving DiGiorno down this album-decked hallway, you'd have to give the brilliant masterminds credit for hiding a New York style pizza joint on a floor of fine dining in a world class hotel. People love surprises. People love pizza. People love being in on the secret. I love the secret pizza joint!

The set-up is brilliant. Down a long mysterious hall lined with amusing album covers (example Saturday Nite Fiedler), you arrive in a New York City pizza joint. You feel as if you are really in New York standing in front of a pizza counter, peering over the edge to decide which slice was made for you! I felt as if I had just been out clubbing all night on Manhattan and needed to grab a slice before tunneling my way back to Jersey City! 

And, the best part, the pizza is goooood. (Yes, that is good with extra o's to demonstrate that it is in fact better than good.) At least one of the pizza makers here is straight from Italy, and he used to work at an off the Strip pizza place where he earned the nickname Picasso for his beautiful, delicious pies. As soon as we heard he was here, we knew we had to go and partake in one of his masterpieces. 

I am no pizza expert, but this thin, crispy NY style crust even had the slight burn to it that I have heard pizza connossieurs adore. The crust had a nice, simple flavor, and I thought the sauce was tasty especially with a heavy dusting of crushed red pepper. As for the toppings, this may be the one place where they disappoint. I had a plain cheese. A glance of their buckets of toppings did not inspire me to load up on anything. However, the construction of the pizzas is darn near perfect- not too much sauce, not too much cheese. Each bite is the ideal balance of sauce, crust, cheese, and I think that is a key element for successful pie. Then again, I am not pizza expert, but I am a value expert. $3-ish a slice is a steal when you're on the Strip. 

I can see the future, and the future holds long lines for a taste of the secret pizza, so get there now before the secret ain't so secret anymore.",41,21,26

But you cant really miss the club-goers carrying out their whole pie or eating a slice as they lounge on the sofas. I mean.. come on. Hence, the lines\/wait can get a bit long. 

Ever since my first experience, I cannot call it a night out in Vegas until I've had my Secret Pizza Fix.  I can hit up a club on the other freaking side of the strip and still take a taxi to the Cosmo to get a slice.

FYI.. the other pizzas (cheese, pepperoni, etc.) are fine.. its just you will wish you had like.. 3 slices of the white pizza IMHO.

A few days ago, my fiancé and I got into a random conversation about what we would want to eat for a last meal if we found ourselves on Death Row.  Both of us were kind of stumped.  Now we know.  SECRET PIZZA.  In fact, if Secret Pizza was ONLY served on Death Row, I would commit atrocities against society to get my slice.  I would.

Finding the place was kind of fun.  I had an idea of where it might be based on other Yelp reviews, but I found myself tugging on door handles that do not open and trying to push on panes of glass that looked loose.  I guess I expected it to be so secret that I would have to prove my worth in death-defying feats of strength or manifest the entrance with the power of my mind.  Oh I figured it out alright, but not before I made a total ass of my dorky self in front of lots of scantily-clad club-goers.

My fiancé started freaking out first.  For him, it was love at first ooey-gooey sight.  I heard nearby diners launching expletive-laced raves about how it was the best ""mo-effin' pizza ever.""  Yet, until I took that first bite, I didn't believe.  Now I have seen the light... I have come to Pizza Jesus.

During the entire consumption of my portion of our pie (pepperoni, sausage, and pepperoncini), I giggled like I did on my first date with my fiancé.  It was so good that I found it almost hilarious, especially since I just now found this place and I'M MOVING AWAY IN JUNE.  Oh, the cruel, cruel irony.  It's a cold world indeed.

We had plenty of leftovers.  On the way to the car with our ginormous pizza box, my fiancé and I argued over how I was apparently ""mothering him"" by making him hold our precious treasure with two hands.  Maybe he has a point - maybe I need to have a baby to detract from my abnormal attachment to inanimate objects (like pizza).  But I digress.

Oh, and we had to remove a shelf in our fridge to make the box fit.  I'm not even sure it was meant to be removed.  I actually think it's broken now.  Oh well.  It's worth sacrificing the security deposit on our apartment to preserve the pristine state of our perfect pizza.

EDIT:  FYI, the REAL secret of Secret Pizza is that you really need to order the whole pizza so it is fresh and hot.  It isn't nearly as good if you just buy whatever slice is hanging around.  Take my word for it.  Buying the whole pie and having it piping hot takes this pizza from around 3 stars to 5.",5,10,2

It's not very big.  They have a few bar chairs and a ledge but if there's 5 people eating then you better take your pizza elsewhere.  You can buy a whole pizza or by the slice.  I personally had the white pizza, which is just as good as it was promised to be, and added toppings.

A pie can cost you around $25-30 depending on what you get and if you add anything. Your choice, your money. Of course, they also sell by the slice premade but we also order a fresh one and just wait, sometimes 20-30 minutes for our pie.

There's a water cooler for drinks as well as beverages for purchase. The interior is a vintage arcade meets pizza parlor and there are several pinball and video game machines for those waiting.

Got to first floor of Cosmopolitan and looked at the floor guide by the escalator. Looked for ""Secret Pizza"" but nothing. Scanned the board again and didn't see a word of pizza.

Secret pizza is tucked away behind walls. Can only get to it if you walk into a narrow hallway next to some restaurant.

And, the door was wide open and there were a bunch of people standing in line. We got there around 2AM and we waited 20 minutes to simply order a pizza. We ordered a whole pizza with 3 toppings (sausage, onions, mushrooms) and they told us we had to wait another 25 minutes. We were so hungry, so we bought a slice of white pizza ($5, ricotta cheese, no tomato sauce) to hold us over. It was unremarkable and the crust was dried out too.

We waited and waited, and finally we got our pie box. It was piping hot. Everything looked amazing. We dove in. And it was unorgasmic. There was nothing unique about the pizza and again the crust was dry and not chewy. I threw on hot peppers, garlic, and herbs to make it more tasty but to no avail. 

I'd rate the pizza 3 stars. The price is 2 stars ($26 for a three-topping pie). In conclusion, it is not worth the 45 minute wait. If there is no wait and you're terribly hungry, I'd say go for it.",3,2,0

Enter the Cosmopolitan Hotel off the strip and go to third floor using the escalator. Then go straight down the unmarked hallway right in front of you which is lined with old record sleeves. it opens up into a mostly standing room affair with a few stools along the walls, some pinball machines, and 2 TVs with sports.

Drinks are sold from 2 liter bottles and poured into solo cups at something like $4 per cup. This is crazy expensive. Luckily they have a little water filtration machine that you can get free water from in the corner next to the cash register. This is the way to go.

You can order a custom pizza which takes a while, or they can just heat a slice from the already made pizzas. $4.50 for a cheese slice is the base price. You then add 50 cents for each additional topping. I had the pepperoni and sausage for $5.50, and felt like the price was a little up there for a single slice that wasn't even over-sized. 

Sausage and peperoni was only ok. Sausage was there physically, but lacked any flavor. I'd skip that topping. Pepperoni was tasty and a little salty. Still not a huge winner, but a good standard slice.

The crust was good. Thin and crunchy, resisting sogginess for a while, and is a great starting point for these pizzas.

If the first rule of Secret Pizza is to not talk about Secret Pizza (right Yvette??  Haha), someone definitely wasn't paying attention!  Not that I have a problem that they did...because now I can write my review without having to feel guilty about it.

Tucked away on the third floor and with no signage to point it out, finding the entrance is to literally look for a hole in the wall.  Once you do though, it's just a short trip down a hallway until you find yourself in a small room and in front of their pizza counter inside.  They offer a variety of pizzas by the slice at any given time, as well as whole pies that you can customize.  Since there was about ten of us there, we opted for two large pizzas - one with pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom, while the second had mushrooms, sausage, and green peppers (I think...didn't try that one).

All in all, the pizzas were pretty solid.  There was a generous amount of tasty toppings and I liked how there wasn't a ton of sauce.  I certainly wouldn't say it's the best pizza out there, but it was good and a lot better than I had expected.  The best part of all though was their prices - at about $4-5 a slice and $22 for a three topping pizza, they're comparable to what regular pizzerias would charge and definitely budget friendly for the Strip.  As far as late night\/post-partying food options go, Secret Pizza is a solid bet.  

BTW, a word of advice from my friend - in your potentially inebriated state, try to remember to wait before taking that first bite.  You might not feel all that hot oil burning your mouth when you're drunk, but you'll definitely feel it when you wake up the next day (""Dude, my tongue REALLY HURTS"").",10,8,9

My friends and I went looking for this place because we heard about it through a friend.  We had to ask for help to find this place...no wonder we couldn't find it.  There's no name posted outside and you have to go through a long hallway.  The line can get pretty long, so the wait of course is long, and you have to wait even longer (30-40 min) until your pizza is ready.  Whole pizzas are nearly 30 bucks.  What a rip.  Since it was pricey, I was expecting good pizza or like the best.  During our wait, my friend and I got water from the water dispenser.  That thing is so slow.  Someone needs to adjust the nozzle.  Just to fill a cup, you have to wait about a minute...how ridiculous is that!

My friends and I ordered a pizza with sausage, dried tomatoes, and cheese.  We hung out outside for a long while...

Finally, when our pizza was done, we ate it and wasn't amazed.  It was at least fulfilling to our appetite.  We ate it at the couches and was approached by a promoter who had just moved to Vegas from London.  Nice fellow...  He's never been to this pizza place before so we gave him a slice to try.  We even gave a slice to our taxi driver when we made our way out.  Maybe they'll decide to drop by this place sometime.

Okay, Secret Pizza isn't secret, but they make some surprisingly legit NY-style pizza.  They serve three kinds of New York style pizza here: red, white, and Sicilian.  I'm still Jonesing for the Sicilian (they were out the two times I visited trying to get a slice); of the other two types, I think they're both exceptional examples of NY's finest.  My favorite of the two so far was the red, with Sausage, Pepperoni and garlic.  Both red and white slices are made with premium, super-sized, toppings and the crust is great tasting, chewy, soggy at all, and shaped exactly the way NY pizza should be shaped.

There are no signs announcing either the presence or location of Secret Pizza.  Legend has it it started out as a room-service pizza source built for guests, but it was decided before it opened to allow walk-ins from outside the hotel as well.

My friend had read about this place on Yelp and knew where to look in general. However, if we had not known beforehand to be on the lookout we likely would have never found it.

I really loved the meatlovers ($4.75) & sicilian ($8). The sausage on the meatlovers was amazing with a little spice regardless of the flacid crust and the garlic and fluffy thick crust on the sicilian was really great as well.

The pizza guy gave me a ""wait you know what I gotchu"" look and pulled out a fresh pizza - meatball ricotta. He said it was his personal favorite and swore I would love it and that was the best pizza advice ever been given. It was so good!

If you go at night, take the elevator instead of the escalators so you don't have to wade through the ridiculous crowds waiting to get into Marquee!

Go down the dark, narrow hallway that's completely lined with picture frames...if you get off the elevator, the hallway is immediately on your right, probably less than 10 feet away.  If you pass a restaurant with a row of sushi chefs wearing little white hats, you've missed it!  Turn around!!

Looking at the menu pix that other reviewers have taken, prices have gone up a bit.  They start at $3.25 for a simple cheese slice and up to $4.75 for a combo slice ($0.50 for each additional topping).  Full pies range from $18.50 to $28.00 ($2.25 for each additional topping).

The pizza was delicious - large, flavorful, NY-style thin-crust slices.  If you're picky about grease...just blot it off with a napkin.  They have glass shakers of oregano, red pepper flakes, parmesan cheese and garlic salt on the counters that line the walls.  

My fave was the white pizza w\/ fluffy, soft ricotta & mozzarella cheese, second fave was the pepperoni & meatball.  Sausage & pepperoni was delicious as well...the only one that was kind of meh was one with pepperoni and green peppers (possibly because I'm anti-green peppers?  I thought they were thinly sliced jalapenos!).

I have heard about this place for a long time, and can't say I am a pizza snob. (Unlike sushi)the crust on this pizza is a perfect balance of chewy and crisp. It had good flavor with what eve special blend flour and the toppings were fresh and likely ordered just for them.

If you look at the hours.. it's practically open 24 hrs a day. I do not think the ovens ever shut down. That is an import feature, because it takes a long time to properly heat up an oven of that size.

I am going back today for a second piece later on!

The cheese was not oozying, but the pizza was mad oily and it was not crispy but soft. Only the crust was crispy because it was burnt.

Friend: It's Secret Pizza place.
Me: Yeah, you said, that, but what's it called? ......

We swung by for a quick bite early Saturday afternoon before hitting up the casino. The place is not easy to find! We had to consult yelp photos to get an idea of where it's hidden. The place is really small, with very few seats. We noticed that most people take their pizza to-go and sit out in the open areas of Cosmo to eat.

Slices are expensive ~$5! The toppings are really limited (usually 1-2) by which types of pizzas they have out at the moment. The line moves relatively quickly, but the pizza is fairly cold by the time you get it since it has just been sitting out. They are pretty hefty in size -- just 1 slice can be filling.

Called to ask if they had  white pizza and how long it would be to order a whole pie .. Joe answered was super nice and helpful .. told me to head there in twenty min or 35 for a whole pizza .. was worried about time since there was some traffic so opted for four slices.. got there in ten .. I luckily the pizza hadn't come out of the oven yet b.c there was quite a line .. paid for four slices $20 .. waited ten min .. inhaled a slice and they packaged three for me to go ... with transportation these four slices costed me $15 a piece .. but I still love this pizza and so worth it .. and I don't even like pizza

So he orders a whole white pizza instead for my friends and I (40 minute wait btw). Next my 2 friends order and ask for a slice of white pizza. BAMM, THEY GET THEIR ORDER?! So I go to front and ask for a refund because they basically lied to my husband about NOT HAVING WHITE PIZZA! The worker claims that when I ordered and asked for white pizza, it was not ready yet and they just came out when my friends order after. BUT, my husband said their was a slice right in front of him when he did ask (btw, he didn't know what it was at the time). WOWWWWW. They straight up lied! SO i ask for a refund, cancel my order of the whole pizza and ask for the white pizza slice that is sitting right in front of me. The worker calls for a manager, and the manager is more than happy to get my refund. But because my husband DID NOT ASK FOR A RECEIPT, he has to manually print out the last transactions and manually look for my card. THIS MANAGER LITERALLY PRINTS OUT A LONG LIST OF TRANSACTION FROM LAST 30 DAYS or something!? He is going one by one.... OBVIOUSLY he is trying to buy time... after 5 mins of useless looking... I ask my friend (the one that order right after me) for her receipt and give it to the manager. He's like OMMMG THANK YOU!! THIS WILL HELP!

We got 2 pizzas, one cheese and one with mushrooms, bell peppers and pepperoni.  It took about 30 minutes or so for the pizzas to be done but it was worth the wait.  The crust was nice and thin, although I do prefer it to be a little more crunchy on the bottom.  The cheese was delicious.  Overall, great pizza and good at room temperature as well!

The Prices ---
It was a little pricey.  I think the cheese was $24 and the other one was $29 or something.  But the pizzas were huge.  We had 8 people and had about 5 slices or so left.  And it is in Vegas, everything is more expensive in Vegas.  

Yummy yummy pizza!",2,2,2

And find it, we did! (It wasn't difficult. The front desk clerk advised us, when we checked in, that the hallway to this pizza place is on the third floor, beside Jaleo restaurant). 

We had heard this was the best pizza in LV, so our expectations were rather high. And it did not disappoint! Sure, it's a no-frills place, where you stand in line and order and pick up your pizza. There's barely any place to sit down inside there, but right outside the hallway there's a big open space with lounge chairs and end tables (along with a pool table with two tip-less cues. Cosmo people, can you get new cue sticks for this table? Please?). We ordered individual slices: hubby had a meat-based slice (pepperoni and other meats), kids had white cheese-based slices with some veggies on them. They said they were the best pizzas they ever had, and if we lived nearby, they'd be here every single day for pizza. Knowing them, they would, too!

We didn't encounter a long line, like the other reviewers mentioned. We probably came at an off-time (although if it wasn't noon on the dot, it must've been within the hour, as we all get ravenous by then. Maybe we were just lucky. There was no line to speak of). 

Excellent pizza, great price, fun experience. Who needs more?",1,0,1

As an aside, the pinball machine didn't give me a play for the money I inserted, and the response from the guys behind the counter was a shoulder shrug. Tacky way to make another 50c on a $24 pizza.

Came a little bit after midnight on Christmas and luckily it wasn't packed.  Waited about 10 minutes and was able to order a slice of pizza.  Ordered a slice of the white pizza.  At first, the server (or do you call the guys pizza slice giver...he doesn't actually serve you...) looked and they were out of it and said we had to wait 15 minutes but luckily, the pizza maker told him that they had one ready in the back of the oven.  Winner winner pizza 4th meal dinner!  Fresh pizza right out of the oven.  For around $6, you get the ricotta with garlic and mozzarella.  Looked for a place to eat inside on the counters but it wasn't particularly clean so we decided to just take it outside.

Split this with my sister and we both thought it was OK.  I can see how this can be AHHHHMAZING if you were drunk (Almost everything is).  I didn't drink so it was just OK.  The dollops of ricotta were the best part of the pizza.  Very creamy when biting into those places where it had ricotta.  The pizza was hot and the cheese was melty but I couldn't get over how salty it was.  I felt the burst of salt pellets with every bite.  No bueno (again... probably great after a night at Marquee or any other club in town)

A good place to come and say you have tried.  With all the other places throughout Vegas (and after a night of clubbing), this place wouldn't be on my list.

Also thought it was overpriced (I paid $11.50 for my two slices), but hey it's Vegas, I shouldn't expect too much.

There was not a long line (just about 5 people in front) when I went (around 7:30PM). A friend of mine recommends me the place cause she knows what Vegas is all about! It took a long time to make the whole pizza pie for 3 people to share though (35 mins), but it was definitely worth the wait. Waiting was not so hard, it's good to walk around and do something else around (gamble). ;) 

The pepperoni and meatball are delicious toppings, and the center of the pizza was magnificent. That first bite has the perfect ratio of tomato sauce and cheese, then as you eat towards the crust more cheese! The dough was so good that I ate everything! I normally don't eat the crust but it was really that good to me.

It's inside of the Cosmopolitan hotel, on the second story, through an unmarked hallway. If you ask a worker they'll point you to it. Nearby is a place that sells gelato... :) we did not go wrong with that combo!

Order a box for approx $24, or a slice for approx $6. A box has 10 slices. They have red or white base. I think it comes with 2 or so toppings. Ea. addt'l topping is $2.50. 

They can split your whole pizza into 2 flavors. We did that. 

Loved the white pizza with super soft, melt in your mouth ricotta, and garlic which is a store creation. The taste was sooo good, I said I think this might be the best pizza i've ever eaten! Next time i'll try to ask for more fresh garlic on top to make it even more like new york pizza.

For the red pizza, we had sun-dried tomatoes, thin slices of thick round sausage, mushroom, and pepperoncini. pretty good, but the flavor of the white had more depth to me..but i'm a white pizza kinda person.

the slices are huge..i should've been done at 2, but i stuffed a 3rd down. The first pizza's hot grease was super delish. The 3rd's was gettin' heavy & guilty feeling. My hubs ate 4 pieces, and said he could still have another. But I wonder if he was just saying that to prove that we did right in ordering the whole pizza instead of individual slices (which I was tempted to do in order to try different flavors). :D Either way, in the end he was right, because you do the math. $24 vs. $60 for all the pizza we got.  We only took home 3 leftover slices...i'm glad we got a whole pizza!

Oh, and the service is super friendly and patient. We stood there FOREVER trying to decide on what to order! You get to see them toss your dough and stretch it out in the air. 

The only thing negative was not enough seating. There were only around 2 parties of a few people each, and we had to take our pizza out to eat somewhere else around the hotel which was a little awkward as everyone stared at us and our pizza.",1,0,0

Nico was such a sweetheart, he told us stories, listened to ours, and gave us advice on life, love, and all things worldly.  He was like an elder teaching us life lessons while he kneaded dough and turned it into pizza for us!

It literally turned from this.....

Great pizza, nice crust, and awesome company.  Nico hooked us up and managed to teach us about life all in 30 minutes.  He made me feel like I was in Italy and if this was his pizzeria he'd have given us the pizza for free!  Nico made our trip a memorable one.",60,62,60

Secret Pizza was second stop on my cousins food tour in Vegas. Not that it much of Secret anymore. I was happy that got chance finally check out the hype. I know tradition says order by the slice. Since there was three of us. We just ordered whole pizza. Think if you were breakdown the cost per slice paying more for whole pie. We were hungry besides leftover pizza ranks up there next too asian leftovers for me. We got sausage and pepperoni. It was awesome. I like the dough thin crust style. The sauce was solid, sausage and pepperoni tasty, and overall good pie. You can make up your own pie, We just based ours on one of the four or five that can order slice from. They also serve salads but come on now got come here for the pizza. They also serve beer they have two choices on tap and couple bottle beers. We went with gooseneck IPA. Nice beer and good pizza talking about the good life. 

As you walking down the famous hallway to no where. Hint maybe that the secret of it! LOL!!!! The old school vinyl albums covers the walls is very very cool. Just the fact that no sign in the whole Cosmo that tells you or guides you to Secret Pizza. Personality. Once get to the end the hall just tiny pizza place. Not really a table to sit down. Just bar stools and counter that eat your slice. Again personality! Like! 

Secret Pizza not place that would go out of my way get my pizza urge in. If staying in the Cosmo or in the area looking for quick bite Secret Pizza great idea!",8,4,7

The pizza is not cheap.  It probably averages $4.50 a slice and the average person will probably eat 2 slices.  Its made fresh to order and its delicious.  I've never had this sober but I'd guess I'd probably go elsewhere to avoid the line and the premium mark up for pizza.

I got 2 pizzas, with 3 toppings each and the total came to $64.  $32 a pizza would definitely be considered a premium.  It was a good amount for my group of 7 as we barely finished everything.  Its more along the new york style, think crust pizza.

I really wanted a pepperoni pizza but they didn't have one ready when I got to the front so I just got one with jalapenos. I like how the pizza is freshly made and then reheated when I order it. It was good pizza, but I don't think it's anything spectacular. It's thin crusted and a large slice... I had to fold it in half to eat it!

The only downfall is that there really isn't a place to sit and I ate my pizza standing next to a counter...

If you give your brain a second to clear itself out you will notice people walking around with cheap paper plates and a huge slice of pizza. At first I didn't even notice but I kept seeing this. It was odd seeing people holding $20 drinks in one hand a slice of pizza on a cheap paper plate in the other hand.

I actually had refrained from drinking alcohol that night because.. Well.. I was hungover lol. I walked from Vdara (took the tram and walked the rest of the way which took ~ 20-30 mins total) with a few friends after we finished clubbing at the Wynn hotel. The wait was hellaaa long (about 45 mins) so I decided to reward myself with two slices. 
TIP: Get your order a lot faster by ordering slice by slice. If you want to order a whole pie, have fun waiting an additional 30+ mins. :X

The slices were HUGE. I swear, one slice could cover my entire face. I ordered the white slice and the pepperoncini + sausage slice. 
*White slice - 4.5\/5
Mmmmmm... So flavorful it'll awaken your taste buds and keep your breath nice and garlicky for the next 12 hours. At first glance, the slice looked so plain and uninviting with its layer of grease so shiny you could see your reflection. But, it was love at first bite. I just have one suggestion: an acidic component to cut through the grease! 
*Pepperoncini + sausage 
OMG! There were little slivers of pepperoncini and sausage scattered over a tomato based sauce on top of the yummy carb-y goodness. This was BY FAR my favorite. The layers of flavor ranged from savory, tangy, spicy, and smoky - L. O. V. E. 

With that said, I also want to mention that I am not a thin crust type of girl. But, this place won me over.",1,1,1

I usually find myself wandering the streets of LV with co workers on a nightly basis (usually during the months of April - June) and usually not the same ones every night either, so every night is a new night. And one night someone suggested ""The Hidden Pizza Place at the Cosmo"" so intrigued (and hungry) I said ""MEOW"" which in our terms means...well a number of things, but in this instance it meant ok.

So being that only one person had been here and more than likely was intoxicated while going, only knew how to get us to the Cosmo, after that it was like Beer Feast where I thought to pour a liter of Goldschlager down his throat to make him remember so I didn't have to stand between a rave bar and a place that smelled delicious. But forward we went with our caravan of folk in tact. 

Upward and onward, through the chandelier bar, past Marquee, and around the corner from burgers we had found it. . . like the bright tunnel of light you see after you die.... 

I love it for a few reasons and here they are:

1) No signage to show were it is, makes it kinda mysterious

2) The pizza is actually pretty good, I mean not like ""NY, NY"" but still pretty close, I know that my NYer friends liked it.

3) There's a cool little lounging area with a pool table to chill next to whilst you eat your pizza.

I went here with a group of 12 people.  The place was easy to find since there was a long line and I think the hidden door was open.  The place was fairly small with not much dining area.  We divided into three groups to order three different pizza.  We received our first two pizzas in around 30 minutes, which was fine.  The pizza was  mediocre.  They were fairly large and soggy in the middle area of the pizza.  I was content.

Our issue with this restaurant was our third pizza.  The first two we received in a timely manner, but not so much with our third.  I sensed a problem when people after us were receiving their orders before we did.  I checked with the cashier and he said, it's coming.  About 12 mins later, I checked the status and another employee said, it's the next one out.  About an hours, 8 people in our group finished their pizzas and 4 remaining were still patiently waiting and were starving.  I was worried about them and ascertain the status.  I talked to the same person who said it was the next one out and she said it's coming out.  I was having a bit of an argument with her because she lied and was making excuses of it being busy.  I found out later that they broke the pizza as it was completed, so they had to make a new pizza and we had to wait double for it to finish.  All they had to do is tell me that they were sorry and it will take longer because it broke.  I was not notified and they tried to sweep it under the rug.  I detest liars.  This was unacceptable and very unprofessional.  I asked for a refund and it took a long time for the manager to come out.  We paid cash and just needed cash back, I don't think we had to wait that long for a refund.  Such a waste of time and this place is so overrated.

For the place being filled with a ton of overly drunk people, the staff is surprisingly patient and likes to describe the pizza if you ask. Also a shout out to the hotel staff for them helping my group and I find this place (it is really hidden with no sign).

Ambiance: 5\/5
The place is hidden and down a long hallway but it opens up to a tiny 5 seater bar with a pizza bar where you watch them make the pizza and cut it up and serve it to you. Amazing! Also, it has an old arcade (I think it had two games, a pinball and an actual arcade game). Cool retro art littered the walls. I loved this place and it's definitely a new fave!

Yes, it tuck away in a hall way between a restaurant and non-operating glass elevator, and it was a side of a Pinball machine which guided me to the path  of their kitchen.

I'll give this place this much, the sauce and topping was very good, but my crust was very questionable at best for a East coast style Pizza.    The dough toward the middle of the pizza is too thin, and because of this..it was way too soggy from the grease of the cheese, and sausage..    It sagged when they put it back in the oven to reheat for minute, and still sagged when I tried to bite it..    I always felt the pizza dough is the heart of pizza, but for some reason, this didn't work for this slice.   Perhaps, I had a bad pie.

From the past reviews, they have jacked up their prices quite a bit, but If I was jonesing for a slice of Pizza on the strip; I might come back to this place, but remember this, it's a little pricey for what you get.",0,0,1

There are counters along the walls to post up at and get your eat on.  Fellow Yelper Ingrid R came along and we shared a slice of cheese pizza.

Either I came with super high expectations (based on all the rave Yelp reviews) or our particular slice was off because the pizza was just ok.  There really was nothing spectacular about it. I'm pretty sure had I been buzzed and starving from a night of clubbing at Marquee, a slice of pizza from here would be money.

The entrance of Secret Pizza is through a tiny hallway on the 3rd level of Cosmopolitan, in between this restaurant and elevator outside the Marquee ticket holder entrance and re-entry line. There was a short line at 11:30 pm, which moved quickly. I got a slice of NY-style Cheese and Craig P. went with a slice of deep dish. Tasty and pretty standard in terms of what you'd expect. Way later in the evening (morning?), some of my friends brought back an entire Secret pizza to the hotel for some amazing drunchies. Cold, but still very good!

There's no seating, only standing room with counter tops along the wall for you to stuff your face. However, you can eat in the resting area right outside; there are plenty of sofas and chairs, as well as a free pool table.

PIZZAS:
This is greasy stuff but also DELICIOUS.

Two whole pizzas - $50 (one white pizza and one half mushroom\/half pepperoni). 

Sooooo good! I loved the white pizza because of the flavors. The mushroom was also addicting tho. It was just really good!

SIZE: 
No room to sit but they did have video games. Fun stuff. Donkey Kong. 
But you sit in their waiting area

I was still skeptical too after I read it since there was no sign for this place. Luckily, I found it. Great yummy pizza. Good thin crust pizza and delicious bread with a hint of a garlic taste to it.

Secret Pizza is the best tucked away place to grab a slice (or a full pie, or two, or three) of pizza on the strip.

Only for the drunk, the hungry, the desperate.

I typically get the regular marinara pizza with hella meat: pepperoni and sausage. Best way to have it esp at 2 or 2 in the morning. For the veggies in the house, the white pie is best (ricotta cheese, not sauce), with just bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions. 

It is pricy considering how a slice of pizza the same size in NYC is $1. But it's Vegas, you're most likely intoxicated, and you just want something in your stomach.

This place is tucked away on the third floor across from Marquee - look for a long hallway with vintage record covers.

I got a piece of the white pizza ($5) - obviously, no tomato sauce, and lots of cheese (almost too much cheese). There was a ton of mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, and a garlic oil. There was a bit of a pool of garlicky oil on the top of my pizza, and I had to pick around some of the mozzarella cheese. I loved the NY crust - it was not soggy and was both crisp and chewy. If you're at the club and have found ""someone special"", you may want to avoid this white pizza since you'll have garlic breath for the rest of the night. The white pizza was great, and I was sober and hungry, so I'm sure if you're inebriated, it will taste even more delicious. 

I came back the next day after going out and drinking a lot and got the Supreme pizza. It was good, but not as good as the White pizza.

The white pizza is really good, and so is the plain cheese. It gets pricey when you want to get drinks and dessert from them as well, and sometimes, depending on the time, you might have to wait for a while.
The staff has always been very nice; one time we ordered a whole pizza, and the guy ended up burning one half. He gave us the good half and made another one, so we got half a pizza for free, but had to wait a half hour extra (if you get a whole pie be prepared to wait a while).

Best pizza in Vegas, perfect Brooklyn style, delicious crust, melty gooey cheese. I've been probably a dozen times since the Cosmo opened and only once has it not been the best thing ever.  Go ahead and bring a friend or two and order a whole pie because a slice only leaves you wanting more.

About 6 years ago (early January 2011), I remember entering the brand new Cosmopolitan in search of the secret hallway (which was located in between the glass elevator and sushi place). Stumbling upon the vinyl album covered hallway for the first time was an ""only in LAS Vegas"" experience on its own. 
Looking past the line up of pinball machines against the left wall..you see your prize. 

WHITE PIZZA. The perfect combination of ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and olive oil.
Pick up a slice (or two) if you're alone or live it up and buy the full pie to share.
Honorable mention: Slice of meatball & ricotta.
For the Sweet tooth: Try the cannoli!

Since that fateful day in January, my visits to Secret Pizza have been quite frequent. Whether its white pizza for lunch, dinner, or late night snack (somehow, despite whatever club I may have gone to..Secret pizza is always a ""close enough"" walk.)

Seating areas are very limited! They have bars where you can just stand at and then about 4 stools (first come first serve!)

We had slices from pies already made which were of mushrooms and one of tomato with ricotta.  Also ordered a diet coke, which was $4 yet came in one of those red plastic cups you buy for parties.

I love NYC pizza with a deep, lustful passion.  It plagues my dreams, calls out to me through windows with its seductive aroma, and makes me yearn for the next cheesy slice.  Secret Pizza is a place in Las Vegas that serves it.  My friend Grace C. went last year when Cella R. told her about it.  Ever since then, I've been plotting my return to Vegas and partaking in this secretive pizza joint.  

My fellow elite Yelpers and I made our way over to the Cosmopolitan after a YEE at the Cathouse and ordered 2 pizzas ($50 total): one white pizza and one half pepporoni\/ half sausage & mushroom.  It came out to about $5 per person.  Secret Pizza is located up on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan food court next to the sushi restaurant down an unmarked hallway.  There are white tiles and picture frames welcoming you into this unremarkable looking pizza place.  We ordered our pizzas around midnight and got them about 30 minutes after.  It seemed like forever to a slightly inebriated and starving person such as myself.  I was hungry and watching others get their slices before I did, was excruciatingly painful.  Drew M. started to play Donkey Kong while waiting.  Watching his arcade game progression only made me hungrier.  

Where was this pizza anyway?!  Why didn't I just order a damn slice?!  Oh wait, there it is.  We brought it outside to the sofas & coffee table.  We dug in.  Silence.  Everyone is chewing and gulping their pizza in a very methodical fashion.  Delicious garlicky white pizza with greasy pepperoni pizza.  I was in heaven.  Was it the best pizza I've ever had?  No, nothing compares to real NYC pizza in NYC, but it comes close.  Too bad the crust wasn't as crispy as I would have liked but the flavor of the white pizza still makes me drool as I write this.  Pizza is the perfect food in the wee hours of the morning when all you want is carbs.  Thanks for making my pizza dreams come true, if only for the night!",15,13,14

I found this place from a secret blog I found a couple months before our trip to Vegas, and we were bound and determined to find it. It's a long hallway with a couple guys at the end in this little room behind what looks similar to a deli counter, flipping pizzas back and forth the whole time. The ""white"" pizza is by far, THE BEST. Made from an assortment of cheese, ricotta, fresh herbs and well, I'm not really sure of what else, but it doesn't matter because it's AMAZING. It's the definition of a laid-back, pick-up-your-pizza-and-go, type of place. But it has a casual, authentic old-style-italian atmosphere. It looked like a couple of grandson's working for their old-school italian grandpa behind the counter and you can tell by the atmosphere in there, that they love it.

HIGHLY recommend finding this place, and keeping it on the down-low, so that it can remain a low-key (secret), special place, for the people that know about it!",0,0,0

3rd floor of the Cosmo, look for the hallway with the records lining the walls and people with drunchies standing outside. Bomb ass pizza: pepperoni and white are stand-out. May take a bit if you order a whole pie-- it'll be real fresh.

The hotel doesn't even have it listed on their website. The casino is 3 floors away, and unless you're LEAVING Marquee, you wouldn't have a reason to discover this pizza place.

We found a random hallway with albums all along the wall, and I knew from reading yelp that this was the place. There was a bouncer right at the mouth of the hall, and I was half expecting them to say something, but they just nodded and said, ""Enjoy the pizza.""

Then things started going downhill. The pizza was over-priced ($5 a slice for cheese) and mediocre at best. I had even been drinking, and it was just a let-down to be honest. The pizza was not a lot of food, and the crust was flimsy and a bit over-worked to have a nice chew\/mouth-feel.

The toppings were typical of any hole-in-the-wall pizza place, and the slices waiting to be served harkened a less than stellar Sbarro feeling. The place looked out of place in the otherwise impeccable Cosmopolitan, and the drinks were served in red plastic solo cups. I'm not in college anymore, and I'm not at Circus Circus... please just give it to me in the bottle, or better yet an actual glass.

The line wasn't too bad when we arrived. (Around 9:00pm) But apparently it gets ape-shit when the clubs start to close down. If that was the case, I'd definitely not wait in line for this. But the 10 minute line wasn't that bad.... too bad the food wasn't even worth it.

This place was packed with people when I came here due to the fact that nobody picked up the phone(fail). At least i get to see why this place was oh so secret haha since there are no signs or even a name to let you know it's here but I guess seeing a bunch of people lining up for no apparent reason is your sign of knowing where secret pizza is. 

Fairly decent price for how big the pizza is when you order the whole thing. I actually really like the pizza...my favorite toppings to go along with it right now is probably pepperoni, onions\/mushrooms, and garlic. Man the garlic makes the pizza absolutely delicious!!! I really like the thin layer crust even though it doesn't exactly get me full :p but as long as it taste delicious then there isn't much to complain about. I guess my real only complain to secret pizza is probably the amount of oil you see on it which i should of use my napkin to soak it up because i remember i had a stomachache the next day...you know the rest. #tmi 
BUT YEA make sure you use the napkin to lessen the oil and you'll be fine as it is a delicious pizza to enjoy.

It's tucked away in a little hallway, full of people who just got done clubbing. I guess some can easily say it's drunk people food. Absolutely not!!

The crust is extremely thin I assume so it can cook much quicker, some of the veggies are pre-cooked in advance, and the mushroom is sliced paper thin to reduce cooking time.

I've eaten pizza from here at least 10 times, and I think it's safe to say it's my absolute favorite pizza joint!

Well I think only in vegas will I be willing to cough up $40ish for my pizza. Worth every penny though!! The slices are very big, and they are pretty generous with their toppings. I ate at almost every eatery\/ restaurant in Cosmo, and I must say, this place was my favorite! I had to eat here twice, and still craved for more!!

Normally not a pizza-bone (crust) eater, this was a wonderful way to introduce myself to a perfectly crisp one that I surely will be disappointed by when it comes to any other. I believe the reason I 8 it this time around is because I just simply didn't want it to end. 

I only enjoyed a slice of plain, but it was $4.50 well spent. Go ahead and eat at that $$$$ steakhouse or Asian\/fusion place. You'll come here 3 hours later and you can, since they're open until 4-5am, depending on the day of the week.

People, the line is worth it and it moves pretty fast.

The downside to the secret pizza is the location. It's got to be a secret because the place is tiny. It's hard to stand in there. It has a TV which is nice while you are waiting, but it sucks as it's an incentive to keep people in there as well. There's not much room for much. Plus, the cheese and pepper flakes were running dangerously low and there wasn't a napkin to be found.

The pizza is thin, crispy, and pretty good. At times the toppings slides right off which is a little irritating, but I always end up folding it in half anyhow.

There were a few factors that made my first time experience at Secret Pizza whatevers...
1) Hard to find! I know I know it's in the name... But when you are hungry and tired at 12am you just want to find the damn place for some food... Eventually figured out where it was after asking hotel staffs and asking random people where they got their piece of pizza. 
2) Long line! We waited 1.5hrs in line to get 1-2 slices of pizza. Um... the pizza was not worth that wait... esp at 12am when you're hungry. By the time we got our food and started eating it was 1:30am!!! 
3) Price! It's around $5\/slice of pizza... Just decent pizza... Not worth it! We can get a whole pan of pizza at Costco for ~$10...

For my 20th review, I'm going to share with you a golden gem secret...The best place to eat in The Cosmopolitan won't cost you all of your night's winnings, and you won't be ready to go buffet again right away! But it's whereabouts are incognito, so I will yelp you out & share the secret! After a long night of committing sins in Sin City, you must find & dine at the clandestine ""Secret Pizza."" 

Secret Pizza is a hidden gem located in The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV. It's a tiny, gemazing pizza joint located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmo next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill. You will see an unmarked hallway that's lined with cool, vintage record album covers that is across from the pool table located in the middle of the room, go down it & enter secret pizza paradise! 

Secret Pizza sells a variety of bomb, thin\/foldable, NY-style pizzas sold by the slice that are pre-made & they warm up for you in the oven. The price for 1 slice is around $5-6, more if you get a specialty slice or add extra toppings. (Secret Pizza also has a ""deep-dish looking"" pizza slice option, but I didn't try it. This isn't Chicago, stick with the original, thin slices!) You can also order & carry-out a whole pie or customize a cheese slice like I did. My fave was cheese with mushrooms, green peppers & banana peppers, 5 gems!!

When I stayed at The Cosmo, I ended every night\/began each morning at Secret Pizza or ate there after an expensive app at Milos! The pizzas are cut into big, triangular slices & have the perfect ratio of thinness while still having some girth; softness for folding with a nice, crispy crust; and contains the perfect amount of grease to equalize the night's BAC! Definitely not the kind of 'Za I typically consume but what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas! 

FYI: Secret Pizza also has a free, self-serve\/purified water tank, sells beer & has limited seating, only countertops & some barstools, no tables. However, you can sit & eat at the couches by the pool table I mentioned above.


So if you're stayin' or playin' in The Cosmo, win, lose or draw, you will definitely wanna make Secret Pizza your last call! Cuz one thing is for sure, you can bet your ass, ya will friggin' eat it all!",50,35,48

It's hard to get good thin NY style thin crust like that in California so I may be biased. But the price is steep! You're better off ordering a whole pizza if you want more than a couple slices.

I like the old school aesthetic with the pinball machine and arcade games and the staff is extremely friendly. Pizza is handmade and they reheat it in their furnace when you order. You can request your pizza to be extra crispy too. What I found disappointing was that none of the napkin holders on any of the counters were refilled; I had to go to the cashier to request some more. And the counters were really dirty too. Maybe that too is part of the aesthetic?

Anyway, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if you're in the area and craving some pie this isn't a bad option for a splurge, especially if it's late night (they're open until 4AM).",0,0,0

This place is no longer a secret. It hasn't been for a while. Over 2000 reviews, come on. This ain't a secret. 

Try to find it without reading, it will add to the lore of this place. BUT, if you need help..

HINT ONE, it's in COSMO.

The above is super vague, if you can find it with just knowing it's in COSMO, then hooray for you.

HINT TWO, it's on the 3RD FLOOR

Knowing it's in the 3rd floor should shorten your hunt.

HINT THREE, it's in the 3RD FLOOR OF THE EAST TOWER.

Ok, at this point, that is all you should know and try to find it yourself.

There really is no name for this place. It literally is a hole in the wall. You walk through this hallway with ambient light shining out, that you think is part of the establishment next to it (but it's not), and then at the end, you see a small space, with a few bar seats, some arcades, and a place to order your pizza. The paper menu you can grab, simply says ""PIZZA"" in the front. 

The price is a bit high for pizza IMO. You will be paying $5-6 a slice. $30+ for a whole pie. Some have said this is reasonably priced in Vegas? I disagree. There are many affordable places. 

With the pricing out of the way, the pizza is legit though. Thin crust, good sauce, cheese, and ingredients. It definitely tastes of a quality pizza. A pretty authentic New York style as some others have said. OH, I WASN'T DRUNK OR IN ANOTHER STATE OF MIND, so nothing was altering my taste. I bet this place has such a high review from people who came right after drinking and partying. Don't remember the price, and anything you eat is automatically great. lol

Like I said,  in the beginning. A solid 3 and a half stars. The pizza is legit good, but the price is a bit high, even for Vegas. I would go again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so. I recommend you try and find it yourself with little help, and experience it.

Keep in mind, there is no dining area to sit, etc. BUT, there are plenty of tables and seats right outside in the Cosmo to enjoy your pizza and people watch.",1,0,2

It was the white pizza ricotta and mozzarella and a deluxe pizza with all of the meats (pepperoni, sausage, green and red bell pepper with mushroom and olives.

I believe that good pizza is very hard to find. It's one of those foods that is often made to be a quick cheap fix, and I find myself calling the majority of the pizza I eat average. I'm rarely ever wowed by a slice of pizza and I've grown accustomed to that. When I heard about all the praise this pizzeria was getting I was a bit skeptical, but I will let you know that all that praise is very, very well deserved.

You need to go on a bit of a hunt to find the pizzeria at the Cosmo. They don't advertise it, you wont find any signs pointing you in its direction, and they don't even mention it on their website. It's located down a random hallway on the third floor nestled next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar. It's a very small pizzeria with only a few stools for sitting and eating. They don't even have a menu. It's all about the pizza here.

The sauce is delicious, the toppings are delicious, and the crust is delicious. This pizza is delicious! It's made New York style with the floppy pizza that needs to be eaten taco style. The sauce has the perfect amount of flavor to accompany the toppings without being overwhelming or becoming overwhelmed. You can tell that the sauce is fresh along with the toppings. They don't have the largest selection of toppings but the ones that they do have are fresh and beyond tasty. The crust is just the right consistency and is one of those crusts that you wont mind eating the ends of the pizza. It all comes together to make the best pizza in town that I have tried so far. It is a bit pricey when compared to other pizza places but you pay for the quality. 

I can't stress enough about how good this pizza is. It is one of the very few pizzas that has been able to wow me. If you want to taste how a real pizza is supposed to taste like go to the Pizzeria at the Cosmo.",4,1,2

We came in at lunch time on a Saturday to find that there wasn't a line. We stepped up, peeked in through the window, and selected our slices.

The board showed that they offer pizza by the slice and pizza by the pie. I saw people picking up whole pizzas. This would be a good option for someone looking for food to take to the pool or a quick meal to go. Pizza is $5 per slice which isn't cheap, but not ridiculous for strip food either.

1. If you are looking for something cheap, easy to eat, and convenient at odd\/normal hours, this is the place for you. After a night of gambling and walking the strip all I wanted was some comfort food and I knew exactly which alley way to turn into. 

2. They limit your selection -- meaning it isn't a vegas buffet in which you way 30+ bucks and have billions of things to choose from. It's more like you have 10 bucks and you should just choose 2 huge new york slices that will satisfy your tummy for a while...unless you can handle more but that's all you!

3. They have a unique white sauce pizza that has a dollops of ricotta cheese and tastes like high caloric heaven, but is worth every bite. 

4. The beauty is in the simplicity. A simple menu, simple products, simple food, simple happiness. There isn't an easier key to great food. Yes there might be a long line of drunkies at 2am, but that's why you plan ahead ;) Seating is an issue because the place is literally a narrow alley, but the great thing about pizza is that it's a walk and eat kind of item. 

5. If you think that the slice is missing something you can add individual toppings for a cost and they will do it begrudgingly, for a SINGLE slice! Something I think that other pizza places can definitely learn from.

When you place your order, they put the slices through a warmer so everything comes out crispy and melty! There is mostly just standing at their counters to eat, but I believe there were a few barstools. There are shakers of parm cheese, red pepper flakes, and oregano on the counter that is easy enough to share with patrons. They also had some arcade games like Galaga! The game was on the tv, so many faces were turned in that direction.

I also asked for a sprite fountain drink and got a free refill. I don't know if I got the refill free because that's how it always is, or if it's because they momentarily forgot my cheese slice and I waited an extra minute for it to get warmed up.

So the next visit to the Cosmopolitan, I had to find the pizza. I asked an employee and he looked around, replied in a whisper to tell us how to get there.

It really was a secret. How would anyone know to go down an unmarked hallway? The hallway is pretty sweet-it's lined with pictures of old album covers.

The customer service was great, prices are reasonable and they even have Galaga to play. If you don't know what Galaga is, you probably weren't born during the time it was popular.

It should be obvious by now that Secret Pizza is probably the worst-kept secret in Las Vegas.  Since everyone knows where it is already, I'll just go ahead and spill the beans -- Cosmopolitan hotel, third floor, tucked between Jaleo and Blue Ribbon Sushi, down the short corridor lined with vintage album covers.

Okay, now that I said it, don't kill me, please?  This isn't Fight Club, right?

I wasn't joking when I said everyone knows about Secret Pizza already.  The lines to eat here are obscene.  It's most popular in the middle of the night, when the post-Marquee crowd drops by to feed their drunken munchies.  However, when a group of us dropped by at 2pm in the afternoon, we still had to wait over 30 minutes just to reach the cashier.  

Not that I minded waiting.  I could spend hours looking at the collection of vintage albums.  There's also pinball.  The pizzeria itself is decked out in gleaming white subway tile, in fitting with the New York theme.

We shared a variety of red slices, some plastic cups of PBR, and a slice of cheesecake.  While the pizza was fresh and delicious, it was doused in enough grease to make the paper plate translucent in no time.  (Remember that episode of the Simpsons when Bart rubs his pizza on the wall and then the wall turns clear?  Yeah, like that.)  There is barely any seating inside the pizzeria, so we carried all of the grub to the lounge area outside.

At $5 a slice, it's expensive, but not unreasonably so.  A better deal is ordering a whole pie.  I recommend that if everyone in your group can agree on a single topping.

All in all, Secret Pizza is a solid place to go -- if for no other reason than being able to help all the other confused tourists who are curious to find out where you got your pizza and beer from.  :-)",18,17,14

I think most of the 'buzz' (if there still is any) has to do with the location. As the name suggests, this place isn't really promoted or advertised anywhere in the Cosmo, or in Las Vegas in general. There is not menu, or even a sign in the hotel that says that it exists. 

It's actually called the pizzeria according to the cosmo, but its found pretty much on the 3rd flood right by the elevator. Look for a corridor decorated with golden album all over the walls. When you come in there is no menu printed anywhere, instead you just look at the pizzas they have and pick one.

The costs is usually around $5-6 a slice depending on what you get, which I think is pretty price for quick slice of pizza. The food itself is decent, the white pizza is excellent as I am a fan of ricotta, but there are quite a few average pies as well (pepperoni is no different than most other places). 

I think the real attraction is the fact that it is pretty much the only place in the Cosmo where you can get food for less than $10 a person.

The first pizzas I tried were the pepperoni pizza and the plain cheese pizza. The large slices of pepperoni were perfectly salty and balanced well with the tomato sauce, cheese, and crust. The cheese pizza was rich and flavorful, but I thought it could have used a little more cheese.

The second time I came, which was the next day, I ordered the Ricotta cheese pizza and the  Pepperoncini (banana pepper) and Sausage pizza.

The mild sourness from the pepper helped breakdown the saltiness from the cheese and just complimented the sausage real well. As for the ricotta cheese, it was creamy and rich which added flavor to every bite. Here's how I rate the pizzas:

Pepperoni & Cheese - 4\/5
Cheese Pizza - 3.5\/5
Pepperoncini & Sausage - 5\/5
Ricotta Cheese Pizza - 4.5\/5 

After trying the pizza, I told a few of my friends and they went to try it for themselves and fell in love the same way I did. A lot of pizza joints can't do that nowadays! My only critique would have to be that the pizza was a little bit on the greasy side, but in my opinion, some pizza are just made to be greasy -- it helps add flavor!   

If I could give one advice to the owner, it would to change the name to  Luigi's Pizzeria in order to reflect its more Italian roots! Also, they should have more signs because I had to ask twice from different employees at the hotel where to find the 'hidden' pizza place.",11,8,12

Upon first bite the pizza was chewy, the sauce was the right amount of tang, and I do have to admit that it is one of the best pizzas by the slice in Las Vegas ...but that was upon first bite. After those first couple of bites, the bread and crust was burnt and charred.

 I tried three slices: regular cheese, ricotta cheese, and cheese with beef slices (not sausage, some other type of beef). The regular cheese was greasy enough for me to use up the entire napkin dispenser and the crust was crispy black at the ottom so 1 out of 10. The ricotta cheese was a 10\/10, if all the slices were this good I would definitely give this place a better rating. The beef slice was good, kind of what you would expect so 6 out of 10. The employees were nice, it was cheap, and like a lot of other people I'm a fan of its location, album decked hallway and close proximity to the pool table and dominoes board but the pizza really was just a little off.

There is a line that doesn't look too bad, but it is deceiving! A tip is to call in before and pick up your pizza to save time. In Vegas, time is money, so save your money!

The pizza is good! They offer a red or white (cost a bit more) sauce and it's all thin crust. You can buy by the slice (which also saves time) or you can get a full pizza which is the better deal if you have a lot of hungry people. They are literally 3-5 stools in the restaurant only because there's just enough room for people to stand around to wait for their order.

I guess since its open till 5am on most days that it is a perfect place to grab some cheap drunk food when everything is else is closed.

The white slice just had too much ricotta cheese for me - as in piles. The crust was thin and was super crunchy, which I enjoyed very much!

The combo was good although my crust was already soggy. BOO! 

The slices were filling, but you may just wait to share a pie with someone else. There are only a handful of chairs, a couple of video games and a couple of standing tables. You can bring your slices out to the lobby area to eat, as many people did.

The line for this place was nearly out the door when I came on Christmas Day, which was also my very 1st visit here. I can see why the lines are so long...because it's the only affordable place to eat inside the Cosmo! The pizza itself is decent depending on what you get. I got 2 slices: pepperoni and sausage\/banana pepper. The pepperoni one was alright...I've definitely had better at cheaper price points. the sausage and banana pepper one was pretty damn good though and it was a good combo together. I'd come back for that one.

Slices range around the price of 5 bucks each depending on what kind you get. Cheese slices are under $5, while ones with tons of toppings will push the price closer to $6. Whole pies are around $26-30 and may be a cheaper option if you're wanting more than 4 slices. Drink selection is sparse here, and bottled beer is 8 bucks! I guess it is the Strip though...They had a water cooler there but it was broken. Thanks for putting a sign on there to let us know because a few customers and I tried messing with it and wondered why nothing would dispense. 

I would come back here but only if I were already near the Cosmo. It's definitely not worth the drive down. I'd much rather drive to Metro Pizza or Costco for cheaper and more tasty pies.",2,3,4

they serve thin crust pizza (NY style) and it's just your average greasy slice of pie. 

The first few visits, the pizza was too soft and greasy. To my pleasant surprise, my last visit here a week ago, the pizza was crispy and DELICIOUS! If this becomes a consistent thing, I might just bump them up from 3 to 4 stars :)

There's no signage at the entrance (a long hallway) so if you weren't looking for it, you'd walk right past it.  (However, it was pretty funny one night when my girlfriend and I sent our boyfriends to get pizza at 2am and the line was super long so it was definitely NOT a secret that night, haha)

Once inside, you'll see it's a small NY-style pizza joint that primarily sells pizza by the slice.  No tables for sitting but there is a counter where you could eat your food.

I had high expectations when I first came to this place, and I am glad I wasn't let down. My first time I ordered their Signature White Pizza (garlicky with chunks of ricotta and mozzarella cheese) and instantly became of fan. This pizza was delicious! I really enjoy how this pizza seems to always be perfectly done, including the crust. It is never too burnt, or too doughy. It's just perfect. Although I find their pizza to be amazing, don't expect too much when it comes to the design, this place is barebones inside. 

I love this place so much, that this is actually one of the first places I took my wife for some late night grub, and she too became a fan immediately. Now I've created a monster.

This place is Secret (Not so Secret), there aren't any signs outside or anything indicating that there is a business there. It is inside a long hallway, although if you go late night, you'll likely find a long line leading all the way outside of this hallway. It is located across from STK. You may sit and eat inside, although stools are limited and usually occupied, but you may also sit and enjoy your pie outside where there are more seating options, and hey, you may even be up for a game of billiard after you're done with your pizza.

Because its secretly and conveniently located at the upper floors of the Cosmopolitan by STK and Scarpetta. I recommend the Scillian Slize.

With many of fellow Yelp reviewers, it appears to be nothing less. The dreadful experience seemed at one point like a practical joke, not only on myself, but on countless inebriated individuals in line here. How silly is it to have to wait in line 30 min or an hour to get a pizza while intoxicated? This test or as I'd call it, a vegas human experiment, focuses on dedication, foolishness and trust of social media.

Perhaps, waiting in line of completely wasted people at 4 in the morning has a certain charm for some people, like people watching or making a last minute effort to hook up after fruitless efforts to do so at a night club. Those dedicated souls who choose to do the latter here are probably going to get the most satisfaction out of this restaurant experience as they'll either exhaust their last resort to go to bed satisfied or, actually get satisfied in bed. In either case, good for them. 

Now, what if one was foolish enough to come here for the food despite endless nighttime food options in Vegas. That's where this experience can turn sour quite quickly. I got the white pizza and a pepperoni pizza with Greek peppers. If it was not for the huge wait, i'd give this pizza its fair 3 stars that it deserves. Was not a fan of the crust, but the pizza was decent. It was nothing really bad, but nothing great either, I've had frozen pizzas of similar caliber before. The pizza style is classic American thin crust. However, after waiting in line this long, expectations were a bit high and I can't say I'd ever put myself through such an experience ever again for a very average pizza.

Enjoying it on the couches outside the joint also has some fun to it, you get to converse with fellow clubbers and subjects of this silly experiment. Nobody seemed to like the pizza and frustration with Yelp reviews of this place was rampant. ""How?"" Kept coming up as an inquiry, followed by ""Why?"" People were just lost. It's a vegas prank for the young and foolhardy, fall into it, and Vegas officially owned you on this night.",4,3,2

That guy should be rewarded like a BOSS because having the pizza literally 30 seconds away is about as clutch as you can possibly get.  Again, this is why the Cosmo rules.

Yeah, it's expensive, but what in Vegas isn't expensive?  Usually $5 a slice, and that's before you get into multiple topping slices.  Honestly though, at least the pizza is pretty damn good for $5.  Crust is has good complexion. the cheese is delicious, and the toppings are always quality.  They always make sure to stick it in the oven before they give it over to you, so it is piping hot when you get it.  Ain't no other way to eat pizza than piping hot.

This is it. 

I managed to end up here for dinner not once but TWICE on my recent Vegas vacation, and we were only there for four evenings total.

The night we arrived our flight had been delayed a couple of ours. It was 3 AM our time and we were tired, groggy, and didn't feel like making an adventure to anywhere for dinner. Secret pizza seemed like a good solution. It was actually pretty easy to find- the hallway with album covers leads you to the pizza. I had a slice of sicilian and my boyfriend had a slice of the meatball & pepperoni. Total cost for the two of us was $14 - considering most dinners in Vegas start at around $20 a person, this is a good deal! There was no line when we went. The pizza itself was nothing special. I would say it probably tops Sbarro but wouldn't go far beyond that.  The guys serving the pizza were really nice too- so thumbs up for that.

Then another night, we were all very drunk by around 9pm because we had been KILLING it at a craps table and hey...they kept bringing us drinks. We were definitely in no condition to survive a meal at a regular restaurant without knocking over a few glasses or napping at the table. So secret pizza it was. We stumbled there from the casino- luckily it was just a short escalator ride. My very drunk friend was VERY excited about the fact that they had mushroom pizza on deck. I think I got a slice of cheese but can't remember exactly....I remember just looking at all the options and pointing at the one that looked most delicious. I have no clue what my boyfriend got that night but I think he got just one slice. I paid...drunkenly, because I found the receipt the next morning. It was just over $20 for our three slices. I actually don't remember eating the pizza that night.  So I think what we can say from this experience is that the pizza wasn't spit-it-out terrible nor was it moaning-worthy good. It satisfied my need for non-liquid calories and  that's about it. 

This place gets 4 stars because it serves a need that was not previously met on other visits to Vegas. I'm pretty sure the servers at Jaleo are counting their lucky stars this place exists right next door and they don't have to serve all those drunken people. It's nice to have a place to grab a quick bite and a decent price (compared to other Vegas places).

I got the mushroom pizza and also the veggie. Both were excellent. $5.50 per slice of $28 for the whole pan to share with your friends. We loved it so much, we made 3 trips!

When you walk down the corridor, you are invited by the smell of pizza wafting in the air.  It is a surprisingly lively joint that is reminiscent of an old school pizza joint lined with pinball machines and a huge oven to heat\/reheat pizzas.  Whenever I come there is usually a line of some sort so be prepared to wait a little. 

There are several ways to order here.  You can either get a whole pizza or get it by the slice.  From there, you can order one of their set pizza slices or create your own.  One slice was pretty filling but if you have a big party then it may be worth buying a whole pie.  It takes about a 10-15 minutes for them to heat up a slice if it has already been made but that wait is well worth it when you get that nice hot slice of pizza.

Both were good--I'm a little biased though since I'm a fan of most people. The dough was chewy but had that nice crunch to it and the crust wasn't hard like a cracker.

The pizza is delicious. They make things simple for you, giving you the choice of standard or white cheese pizza and a few toppings. I'd recommend the white cheese pizza with just one or two toppings. You will rejoice, especially if you are a thin-crust fan. It's great. It's not the best pizza ever, and it could benefit from being less greasy - I think people would be much less forgiving of the copious amounts of grease if this were a standard joint, for example - but it's great pizza, and it'll at least be one of the most memorable slices you'll have. 

They also serve a few desserts; I've only had the New York Cheesecake, which is pretty good, but is definitely overshadowed by the pizza. It's a convenient, in-theme dessert, more or less. 

The staff is a bit split; some of the staff are engaging and receptive, eager to help the lucky wandered-in tourists, while others are surprisingly impatient and blatantly unhappy. In the end they all make awesome pies fresh through-out the day, and it's an over-the-counter place, so it's not too much of an issue. As for the place itself, there's a lot of character in the decor - it's worth a look into the place (if you can find it), even if you're not interested in the food.

This place ain't so secret anymore. 
For you newbies, I'm going to keep you guessing, but I would imagine that just scrolling through a few of these reviews would pinpoint this place for you. Hint: Look for the hall...

Plain and simple, Secret Pizza REALLY needs to be renamed. How about Scrumptious Secret Pizza? But really, this place is so damn good. I've been about half a dozen times now and I've had a consistently tasty product. They have various pre-made pizzas, and then they stick the slice(s) in the oven once ordered. Sounds cheap and ""not good,"" but let me tell you, IT'S GOOD. I love their flattened meatballs and their large pepperoni slices. Hell, it's all good. The crust is really what helps make this pizza way above average..crunchy yet a bit chewy and dusted with flour on the ends. Again..yum. Plain pieces of cheese pie run $4.50, and each topping is $0.50. My meat-lover's slice I had in December ran $6 but it was so worth it. 


TIP: This place's peak hours tend to be when all the drunkies leave Marquee post 1 or 2 AM (uh...guilty). Be prepared to wait maybe even 30 minutes for that late night snack to soak up all of the alcohol you may have just imbibed in Marquee. 
Beware: You want a soda? That'll cost you $4, and it's served in a red solo cup. wait...what? 

Unfortunately, I have to take the ambiance into account...and SP is not exactly what I consider pleasing. Yes, I understand that it went for the New York parlor pizza type of replication, but there are some sketchy people in here pretty often (last time there was a pimp...you just know when you see one).

Choose your slice from what they have available at the time you get to the front or order a whole one and customize it just the way you want.
I prefer to have my slice quickly heated before I get it - it crisps up the crust just enough so the toppings don't flop when I pick up the entire slice.

I went to Las Vegas to celebrate my 21st birthday and my boyfriend strongly recommended that we go to Secret Pizza. So in a slightly buzzed stupor, we made our way to the Cosmopolitan on the Las Vegas Strip. There's no point in asking the hotel or Casino staff because the location is low key and they even act like they've never heard of a pizzeria in the building. Did you think that the title Secret Pizza was a joke?  

So we went up 3 flights of escalators from the casino floor. Next to a quiet lounge area and Marquee nightclub's exit, there is a dark hallway with decorated art tiles. From Friday-Sunday night, this place is super popular and some might confuse this line for being a bathroom. However, once you see the literal light at the end of the tunnel, it is a small pizzeria with white walls. The whole pizza box orders shuffle out in blank white boxes to maintain secrecy. Even the receipts have no brand or address printed on them.

Prices are higher than most pizza places on the strip but the quality is top tier. I ordered a white slice with sausage and mushroom and my boyfriend ordered a white slice with pepperoni. The slices were topped and reheated to order. The surrounding bar stools and eating area has powdered parmesan cheese, oregano, and chili flakes to sprinkle on your pizza.

Despite being a Friday night at 1:00am, the place was poppin with customers. We went out to a closed restautant's lounge area and ate there. The pizza was crisp and the ingredients were really fresh. This is better drunk food than you can possibly imagine. This might've been one of the best pizza slices that I've ever eaten. So much that throughout my entire stay in Las Vegas, I wouldn't shut up about getting more secret pizza",1,2,1

3pm Tuesday 6th August 2013
Four Stars

Located on the top floor of the Cosmo restaurant\/shop area, this little pizza place delivers a great snack.  We enjoyed a $5 slice of Mushroom and $5 slice Green Pepper and Onion.  The crust had a crisp outside and soft inside.  The toppings were nicely cooked.  They even serve beer in red plastic cups.

If you a person who is price sensitive, then here is a tip about Vegas:
1. Look at the Vegas Price
2. Divide it in Half
3. Think: would I buy this for this reduced price at any other place
4. If yes, then Buy

Example: $5 slice of pizza in Vegas is really a $2.50 slice of pizza anywhere else, which is a great deal.

Note: This formula works in a lot of places, such as Disneyland, the Fair, and any sporting event.",1,0,0

Pizza is all right. Honestly, I don't know what the hype is all about. A slice is definitely on the larger side, but I just don't think the quality of the crust is great. Worst of all, they don't always have all the types of pizzas out. When one type is gone, you have to wait like 25 minutes for the next one to come out... pmo. This happened to me over the weekend when I wanted to order the supreme pizza but the person right in front of me got the last slice! UGH. I ended up getting a slice of their sausage, which had barely any pieces of sausage. What really disappointed me was their crust. It was hollow and hard.

Their white pizza is the best!! Three different kinds of cheese with no red sauce. Sooooo good! It's like the best cheesy bread you'll ever have! I love the dollops of fresh ricotta that's on it. Their red sauce options are pretty good also, but the white pizza is the best!

Was late into the wee hours of the night but man the line was damn knarly! First time I went it was in the afternoon and there was definitely nothing like it was at that moment.

That always seems to be the case though when you're surrounded by good company and drunk people! 

There were six of us and at $5.25 per slice, we opted for buying a whole pie instead ($28). It was and extra 20-30 minute wait but price wise would say it's definitely worth it. We went with the White pie and you can't go wrong with a crowd favorite! Came out piping hot! But I'm sure it always does since it's always does since it's always so busy... Something about an entire pie dedicated to you that makes it taste THAT much better.

That white sauce instead of a traditional red sauce was amazinggg. That light and airy ricotta cheese crumbling all in my maofz... So good. Slices were very large and we were still left with 2 extra slices which I had very little hesitation taking since the girls didn't want to eat much since day club the next day!

And toppings (we had the 3 meat- pepperoni, sausage and meatball) were real sliced meat, not those crappy crumbles you get at some pizza places. After eating one slice, I was asking for a friend to handle the rest. So don't think you will need several slices to get your fill.

Ok, the taste and quality of ingredients would earn this place a 5 star rating with me, but I could only give them 4 stars because there is absolutely no space remotely close to enjoy eating the pizza. I wanted so badly to get that first bite in, and it took forever to find a spot ( down the escalator twice and a random seat in the casino at Cosmopolitan) to eat my pizza. I was so uncomfortable trying to hold my plate and napkins in one hand while folding one slice to eat with the other hand. So my suggestion is to scope out a spot to eat your pizza before you get in line. A pizza this good should be enjoyed immediately and in a comfortable environment.

I usually like to keep my pizza real simple: either margherita or pepperoni. My friend wasn't hungry but we both got 2 slices of pepperoni pizza anyway. We got our food pretty quickly. My friend thought the shaker he grabbed had parmesan cheese in it but it was actually garlic powder that he just dusted all over his pizza. I did the same thing but only because I like the taste of garlic. It was soooo gooood. The crust was perfectly crisp and not soggy. They're pretty generous with the toppings. It's about $5\/slice but it's worth it.

It's kind of a secret, not really. But it can be hard to find after the club if you're not too familiar with its location beforehand. THIRD FLOOR OF THE COSMO.

Bf and I circled the 2nd floor a few times before I went back on Yelp to figure it out where it was. Once we found out it was on the third floor, it was easy to find with the seating area full of used plates and napkins and a loud group of drunk people waiting in line at 4AM (the photos on Yelp should help you figure out which hallway it is). The line was pretty long, but good company always makes it bearable.

White pizza is definitely where it's at. Getting a whole pizza with a larger group is definitely better. 

There isn't much room inside to sit and eat comfortably, but the seating area right outside the hall isn't too bad. 

During the daytime, there wasn't much of a line and wasn't as chaotic. Had it sober and it was still a delicious pizza. At $5 a slice, it's probably the reasonably, deliciously priced item in Vegas.

The perfect late night munchies after going to Marquee or just out in Vegas. It's a narrow hallway with a bunch of pictures on the side. No sign or anything but if you see a long line and people coming out with slices, you're in the right area.

CUSTOMER SERVICE: 4\/5. The only reason I'm putting this is that if it is busy, be prepared to wait a good 45 minutes to an hour for a slice. Especially for boxes. Went on a Monday night at 4AM and only waited about 15 minutes. 

WHY I DOCKED IT: The only thing to ruin the experience was we ordered a box of white pizza and they said it'd be 10-15 minutes. So we walked around and came back in about 10 and waited for our pizza. Our pizza was already DONE and the two cashiers who helped us didn't even bother to tell us they were done. A guy that was cooking the pizzas had to ask why we were just standing there. How are you that lazy to tell us our pizza is done? Unless your memory is that bad, what's your excuse? Worst service so shout out to the two ladies that were there chillin' at the register and not bother to tell us our pizza was done for another 15 minutes.

PRICE:
$5.50 per slice
$28 for a box

WHITE PIZZA: 5\/5. White sauce is the best sauce. On anything. Alfredo sauce with a bunch of cheese is what this baby is made of. Love the globs of ricotta and it's thin pizza too! The crust isn't the greatest but still amazing.

OVERALL: 4\/5. Go for the food, not the service.

I knew they were in the COSMOPOLITAN but once I got in I couldn't find them. There are no signs that point to their location that I knew of. The establishment itself didn't even have a sign upon entering. I found out that they were 

LOCATED on the 3rd floor of the cosmo. There is an entrance hallway next to the pool table and escalators. I should have looked on the yelp reviews but I didn't so I just asked a hotel worker. 

The ENVIRONMENT was exactly what I expected, SMALL with no tables to sit. They have a counter and that's about it. They do have an arcade machine which kept my son entertained while we waited. This place gets really busy so you will have to take your food to go (Don't know where though) or eat standing up. 

The SERVICE was not a good experience.  We were the only ones there at the time we walked in and we had no greeting whatsoever. Then, it took about a couple minutes for someone to even take our order. Next came the over promising. Since I ordered an entire pie, I was told that there was a pie in the oven and it would be about 10 minutes. That pie that was in the oven...you know the one the guy said was for us...well, it did not go to us. Nor did the second pie. On the third pie, we had to go back to the counter and remind them we were still waiting.  Only then did finally we get it. No apology. That is my pet peeve.   

The QUALITY of the PIZZA was such a disappointment.  Since there were 5 of us, we just ordered the entire pie because it was a better value. Each slice is about 5 dollars and the entire pie is about 27 dollars depending on which one you get.  Our choice was pepperoni.  I understand that sometimes people can order the wrong item but, in this case, I doubt it would have made any difference.  First, their pizza is thin crust which is fine. I like thin crust pizza but the crust is very soft and limp which made it hard to eat. Kinda like a new yorker but worse..almost uncooked.  It just kept flapping all over the place and going limp just prior to getting in my mouth. Second, it was very very oily. I'm talking about Pizza Hut type sprayed on oil dipped in more oil. I had pizza juice running all over my hands and mouth.  Some of you might like that, which is totally cool but not for me. 

I am going to give it two stars though because I don't think I can ever give any pizza joint 1 star. Plus, the employees did speak in a friendly manner. Even though they did not serve us well.  Bottom line is, the name matches perfectly. Nobody should know about this place.",10,9,10

I think that a lot of the reviews hype this place up a bit too much, either that or a lot of these people have never really had NY style pizza IN New York.

That said, it's good, especially for NY style pizza, outside of NY. However, it's far from great, and it's on par for other Vegas pizza joints.  

The crust was far too crunchy, rather that that perfect crust for the fold it in half true NY pizza experience, I think if I had folded it in half it probably would've just snapped. The cheese and grease level were perfect however.  The slices are HUGE, which they should be for $4.50 for plain cheese.

Definitely a great find, and good pizza, but if you're from NY, like me, don't go in expecting the best pizza you've ever had and you'll certainly have a much better experience.",1,0,0

Take a gamble and go searching for Secret Pizza. I've heard all the hulabaloo and thought, well, it's not so secret now is it?! Well, yeah, it is a damn good secret to be found. And well worth ""the search""...

I was no mood to be searching for Secret Pizza. So thank goodness my Yelp friends are not as mysterious as the blank rectangle on my Cosmopolitan hotel map. After reading through some tips & reviews, I found the long, mysterious hallway - ok, well, I lied, I just followed my nose and smelled the pizza deliciousness wafting down the corridor. Thankfully, there was no line and five pies to choose from. Hubby and I chose the White Pizza and a Combo slice. I must say, the White Pizza is the way to go. I'm pretty sure my husband was bummed that I suggested we try two because he would've loved to eat that White Pizza slice all by himself. Don't get me wrong, both were excellent choices, but the White Pizza is a mouth explosion. 

Besides the pizza, I'm thrilled to share with you that they offer all-you-can-drink FREE filtered water. Yup, #waterfanatic here and trust me, that water was YUMMMMM.  So, fill er' up!

My advice: 
YES, check out Secret Pizza
No, don't wait until 2 or 3am
YES, go at lunchtime - there was little or no line
No, don't go looking for signage - there is none
YES, you know you've found it when you see pinball machines
No, don't plan on sharing
YES, #alwayshydrate (free filtered water FTW!)",5,4,5

saturday night \/ sunday morning at 3 am, after stealing some money away from south point (a rarity!), we decide we're hungry and see that secret pizza is open til 5am-ish.

and when you're hungry, a bunch of drunk ass college students on their first trip to vegas yelling in your ear is beyond annoying.

30-45 minutes later, after resisting my desire to stab directly in her pie hole the annoyingly loud and obnoxious girl standing behind me yelling ""pepperoni!!!"" every 2 seconds, we start to approach the counter to place our order and, wouldn't you know it, someone cut in front of us!
lucky for us, captain awesome behind the counter promptly and sternly advised the cutter that he couldn't cut the line and that he had to wait in line just like everyone else and no matter how much protesting he attempted, would not be served!!!
with tail tucked between his scrawny legs, the douche bag turned and left.
we were then greeted by captain awesome with an apology and a huge smile, got our slices, paid and left.
$26 for 5 slices is steep and, next time, we'll just get a whole pie instead.
i felt slightly ripped off until i bit into my white slice and then all was well in the world again.

Secret Pizza is on the third level of the Cosmopolitan inside a small alley sandwiched between two other places whose names I don't remember. Secret Pizza is more like a take away stand with a handful of barstool type seats along the wall to eat your pizza. The menu is simple, basically New York style thin crust pizza that is sold by the slice (~$6). There are basically two types of pies that you can get the regular peperoni pizza which has the regular red sauce or the white pizza which basically uses ricotta & mozzarella cheese as the base. We decided to get a whole three topping white pizza (~$40) and went with meatballs, half peperoni and half mushrooms. After this it was a 15 minute wait in which time the pie was freshly baked and come out piping hot.

Upon receiving the pie the first thing I noticed is that it was pretty big but the toppings were sparse covering only 65% of the pizza leaving a large outer crust bare. As soon as I picked up the first slice it was clear that it was extremely oily. I've eaten pizza's in NY so I was expecting a little grease but this was way too oily and not in a good way. The pizza itself was great. I don't like super crispy crusts that result from overcooking thin crust pizza's so I was happy that this crust had the right amount of flexibility that allowed you to eat the slice by gently folding it. The ricotta & mozzarella cheese base was excellent and had the perfect amount of seasoning. Unfortunately a tiny amount is put on very much like the other toppings. Pricewise I felt that it was relatively more expensive when compared to other joints on the strip even after giving it the Vegas Strip plus large Casino handicap especially looking at the miniscule amount of toppings.

One last comment would be that this place is super popular and is a testament to word of mouth that spreads by social media. In the 25 minutes that we spent eating the pie on the 3rd floor lobby we were approached by no less than 6 parties asking us for the precise location of secret pizza.

The nice folks at check-in directed us to Secret Pizza and we pretty much ran over to it. At 4:30pm there was next to no line and the people working there were super friendly. We each had two slices - me the mushroom slice and white pizza, my bff a pepperoni and white pizza. We both ordered a bottle of water to go with our food and sat down after paying the $30 total for everything. That's nothing to scoff at when the other options for sit-down meals would have easily been double that. Anyway, we sat for a minute, chowed down, and then made our way back to the hotel room to setup for the weekend.

The only down note I'd have to give this place is the price for a slice ($5 is on the pricey side).  It's not out of line considering the location of this place, but I guess the fair value of a slice of NY-style pizza in a casino hotel in Vegas is $5.",1,0,1

After a long night of clubbing at marquee,  my friends and I  decided to stop by here for some late night eats.

On the third floor there are pool tables and lounging chairs too so you can lounge around and enjoy your pizza. 

My friend and i shared the white pizza, which was AMAZING and delicious. We also shared a sausage pizza with green peppers and pepper jack cheese. That was amazing as well.

Located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo next to the pool table, Secret Pizza is not only making some serious dough (in both senses of the term), but is also quite a bit of a wait at any time during the day. Three of us opted instead to get a whole pizza (some sort of supreme concoction) and a slice of the square cheese pizza (CHZ). The cheese square was basically cheese bread; delicious, but when was the combination of cheese and bread ever a bad idea. We got our pizza a few moments later and decided to eat it right outside in front of the pool table. We ended up only being able to eat one slice\/ea because they were so massive (except for the guy in our group who ate 2) and took the other half back with us to feed the rest of the  crowd we were with. The pizza was super salty (from the sausage topping, I think), super oily (BARELY saved my clothes from a stain of a lifetime!), and the crust was pretty dry.

You can't just order any toppings on one slice, it's whatever they have already made, however if you choose to order a whole pizza, you may very well choose any topping to your desire!  They usually have their most popular ones like the white pizza or the sausage and peppers and they always have pepperoni, cheese, or sausage or a meat lovers available.

My boyfriend stumbled upon this place some months back and would not stop raving about it to me. ""Have you heard about the secret pizza place at the Cosmo?!! IT'S UNREAL!"" I loved how he genuinely ""found it"" while exploring the Cosmo, considering how we are accustomed to relying on Yelp on finding new places to eat now. We recently had a chance to visit Vegas together and omg, he hit the nail on the head!

The White Pizza is basically cheese pizza with roasted garlic...super simple. However, the cheese will make you swoon. The mozzarella was perfectly melted and the mounds of light ricotta will make your eyes roll to the back of your head. I believe there was a bit of fresh basil on the slice as well. I'm usually not a fan of most pizza crusts but this was perfectly thin & crunchy. SO GOOD! I have to note that I was NOT drunk at the time, so take my word ;)

Tweedle Dee is running the register and popping slices in the oven, Tweedle Dumb is moving like molasses, making a pizza at cruise control speed while the line is growing even longer, Sarah Marie asks if more white pizza is gonna be made
and  Tweedle Dumber's answer? ""No, not any time soon."" Really? All the ingredients are staring you in the face and you couldn't hustle to get another one in the oven?
Wifey and Sarah Marie got other slices cause he was to lazy to get another one going.

After BS like that, I wish There was a way to give no stars. Nico took all of them when he left...ALOHA!!!",13,5,5

Always had a little doubt about this place since I've only been here after a night at Marquee.  I always remember it being awesome (or whatever I can remember of it) and all of my friends love this place.  Came on a Tuesday night since I was in Vegas for work.  As expected, sorta empty and just two guys working in the back.  I went with the White Pie while my coworker went with the sausage.  

After it was heated up, my White Pie looked as bomb as I remembered it.  In fact, it tastes even better than I remembered!  Creamy, garlicky, and cheesey.  I don't remember it being as garlicky as it tasted but it was great.  You can even add some garlic powder, which I did since I'm a huge fan of garlic.  Added some parmesan and sprinkled on red pepper to give it a bit of kick.  I tried a bit of the sausage but the tomato sauce and the cheese didn't stick to the pizza so it ended up being this gooey mess, but so good.  I did notice that my slice of White was smaller than all the other pizzas there... meh.

Glad to say that when sober, this place tastes just as good, and for the the next time I'm here after a night at Marquee, I know I'm eating a good piece of pie!",2,0,1

The wait times for this place is pretty long...expect a 45 minute wait time from the time you start standing in line to the time when you start to chow down.  $30 for a full pie isn't bad for vegas, especially if you can feed a small group for that price...just don't expect a magical pizza.  Ask for a side of marinara for the pizza, it'll add a bit more flavor to it.

Pizzeria is a tiny little pizza joint on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan.  I don't recall even seeing signs for it.  Someone told us about it so that is how we happened to find it.  

We first attempted to order on a Saturday night...well...Sunday morning after Marquee Night Club and were standing in line when I was plowed over by a very intoxicated Australian man.  After gaining my composure, he plowed me again.  Before I killed someone, I made the decision to come back later.  So my point here is...if you go late night, your experience may not be so pleasant as this place attracts the overly intoxicated\/drugged.

My second attempt, which was late on a Sunday night\/Monday morning, was much more pleasant.  The pizza guys aren't very friendly and I am pretty sure not one of them cracked a smile.  The girl who was taking orders, etc. ,though, was quite pleasant and tolerant of the late night clientele.

The pizza is delicious.  It is the thin crust, not overly greasy, cooked to perfection, perfect cut slice kind of pizza that is so rare to find!!!  Some of our crowd went back for seconds and to try different flavors.  I had the supreme and could not have been happier.

I will definitely be returning to Pizzeria for more pizza on my next visit to Vegas!!!",0,0,0

Slice for slice, Secret Pizza is probably my favorite Vegas institution (over the traditional staples such as Earl's, Pink's, etc.) to visit for all my late night fatty indulgences.  

Secret Pizza delivers the quintessential New York style slice: a sparing amount of zesty sauce and cheese without an abundance of toppings. The crust is thin and crispy while the base holds up well for folded consumption rapidly.  You should probably order at least two slices.  I've gone so far as ordering 4 slices at once and even a whole pie.  The variety of slices differs by the day.  If you want something that isn't featured on the display, you'll need to go ahead and order a pie.  Always order it with a beer.

My addiction is out of hand.  I once left Hakkasan early just so I could beat the lines and get my hands on these slices (wait times around 2-3 am are approximately 30-45 minutes). On most trips, I'll go at least once.  Other times, I'll venture here two or three times.  When I stayed at the Cosmopolitan for my birthday, I had it three times in one day.

(And chances are, you may have already lost an arm and a leg at one of the tables).

In probably the worst kept secret about the hotel, Secret Pizza (honestly, I think the place has no official name and ""Secret Pizza"" just sorta became the de facto name over time) offers people from all walks of life a slice of New York styled pizza at reasonable prices in one of the swankier hotels on the Strip.

Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan and tucked away in the restaurant area (read, baller food court), you'll see a hallway that could pass as a restroom access area. If you smell pizza and you see some old vinyls decorating the walls, you're on the right track. Just keep going and you'll soon be in line for pizza, made available essentially all day. You can also tell you're in the area once you start seeing more people walking or sitting around with pizza on paper plates.

Secret Pizza has a couple pinball machines to keep people preoccupied a bit, as they scarf down that 'za. The quality (particularly of the pepperoni) is pretty damn comparable to New York styled pizza (for all I know, they could have brought some of the water to Las Vegas).

A big slice and a drink can run you just shy of $10 bucks, which isn't bad, considering where you're at. They also serve beer, served in red plastic cups, naturally. After all, you need to keep that party mentality going back at the suite, right?

My only suggestion is that the place consider a wider beer selection and offer glasses to drink out of. There's a considerable difference in drinking beer out of a plastic cup versus drinking out of a glass. Outside of that, I realized that it's the place's secretive location in a nice resort and design that has made it one of the best known places for a late night slice.",12,7,8

I asked the guy what time they closed in case we wanted to go back late, and he said 5 a.m., so you can get your pizza fix as late as you want. 
Two slices and a soda will run you about $15. Totally worth every penny! The slices are huge!",0,0,0

The Pizza: Delicious Giant Slices of Wonderment. However, don't be fooled into thinking you don't have options. They have pizza available that's already out and on display, but things are coming out of the oven all the time and they will add extra toppings to their slices for you. Also everything tastes better with Dogfish Head IPAs. (Which is a beer if you're curious).

Not hard to find if you're looking for it, but you're not going to know it's an establishment if you don't. Tiny little place, no room for seating unless you count the top of the pristine Galaga Machine or go when one of the five seats aren't taken. This place is probably to be avoided if you hate lines or crowds and you go during peak.

I got out of there for $15 bucks: Two Giant Slices and a Dogfish Head. This is a great deal on the strip. Also as a bonus: the girl at the cash register was crazy hot. According to my friends, I of course am not in the habit of oogling random females; they are the childish barbarians.

TL;DR:
Cons: No Seating. Pizza arrangement vague. Only two kinds of beer.

Pros: Lots of seating outside. Pizza is spectacular. Beer on tap includes the best of the worst (PBR) and Dogfish Head 60min (the best of the best).",0,0,0

What's not great about this place is that it can get packed during late hours when EVERYBODY piles in line to get drunchies.  Minus one for that, but other than wait time, quality pizza right hurr.

What makes it more fun is that it's known as ""secret pizza"" and it's like $4 a slice. Dude, $4 isn't even gonna get you water in Marquee!

The guys in there are hilarious always chatting up the folks, drunk or sober.
One of 'em even told me the story of why they call the white pizza, ""the sunset.."" Let it be known that the cheese are the clouds and the tomatoes in the middle are the sunset...So romantic *blushing*

Even though mushrooms are my favorite pizza, I really love their white pizza. And all it is is cheese, sauce, and tomatoes. It's sooooo simple and yet, oooohhh so good.

They don't have it marked on any of their directories, and the front desk staff will remind you where it is with a hand drawn circle in an empty space on the property map.

We arrived around midnight and it wasn't too crowded. I was more in awe of all the old records on display down the main hallway you walk down to get to the small pizza parlor. If that wasn't cool enough, they had some retro pinball games waiting for you, too. I had total ADD and couldn't focus on the pizza and I was too busy scoping out the room. It's not like I really had to pay attention to what I was ordering - I knew i was going to get pizza, and I was okay with making a last minute decision and pointing at the one that looked the most appetizing.

With that being said, I went with pepperoni and sausage and they warm the slices up to you while you're waiting to pay. Once you've finished your transaction, you're given a hearty slice of pie served piping hot. We took ours back up to our room as seating is pretty non-existent, and if you do find a spot, it's probably going to be standing room only.

We must've made it right in time, because minutes after arriving, there was a huge line down the corridor we had just entered, and it was wrapping through communal restaurant spaces pretty quickly. Again... not so secret, especially since it was a Wednesday night!

We enjoyed our late night snack. Slices range from $5-$7 depending on what you want on it. Just note, if you're buying multiple of the same slice, it's way cheaper to just buy a whole pizza! Someone was doing the math while in line, but it also takes a while longer, so you gotta weigh out those pros and cons.

Staff was really nice and they had a good system of getting people in and out pretty fast. I'll be back when in Vegas!",55,32,48

PIZZA STYLE: here is New York style. It is freshly made with hand tossed dough. with a excellent crispy crust.

GET: the White Pizza(Ricotta & Cheese) this one usually sells out, based on how much Ricotta Cheese they have available. 

PRICE:  is comparable to your mall pizza slices(around $5 a slice), I would order a whole pie since the price is $24 which gives you 10 slices. Slices are pretty decently big. But, your going to be eating more than one slice.

OPEN LATE: Perfect spot after clubbing or late night grubbing since its open til 4am. But be prepared for a Long Line in the evening.

Although it's meant to be a secret, the line the goes throughout the hallway sort of gives it away.

On the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel there is no sign for Secret Pizza, just a hallway lined with Italian-American singer's LP's that lead you to the pizza promise land.

It is the best pizza in Las Vegas and there is no debate about that. Dollar for dollar this is the best meal in town.

The space is small and there are only a few stools to sit at but this pizza was made for standing. They are constantly pulling out fresh pies to serve by the slice, or you can order your favorite toppings and they'll whip it up for you.

I got the sausage and pepperoncini, which was right out of the oven and then had them throw some meatball on an existing pepperoni slice to reheat.

They were both outstanding but the sausage won out because of its freshness and spiciness. I will be getting that combo again.

When you come do what you will, just know that if you want to taste the true genius of this place get whatever is freshest out of the oven.

My girl got the white Sicilian square, and because she loves me so much she allowed me to sample. Pretty fantastic.

Dig in and don't let go!

Secret Pizza you get the FlavorBoner trophy on this trip.

I'll be wrapping my teeth around you soon, just not during nightclub hours as I have heard the line is way too insane.

BTW....

When at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, if it is a weekend or holiday, go to the Chandelier Lounge on the main floor. They have a band called MARK and The Martinis and they are excellent.

Yes, the pizza is huge, and yes, maybe the fact that one needs to weave through a couple of corridors to find this place is a little exciting, but the quality of the pizza is mediocre at best, subpar realistically speaking. I've definitely had better.

As for the atmosphere, it is not a place to sit down at and talk. In fact, there are no tables to sit down.

Being a Californian there's not a lot of pizza joints that  satisfy my needs when it comes to pie. Secret pizza hits the spot, being the foodie that I am it's totally worth the 4 hour drive down to Vegas ( YES, IT'S THAT AWESOME ) and order a box of pie from here. I recommend pepperoni ( can't go wrong with that right? ) and the white pizza, the pepperoni slices are SOOOOOOO good, its unlike what I tasted before, I feel like I haven't had true pepperoni until that day I had it here at Secret Pizza. And the white pie... Oh my god. I've never had white pie before and I'm glad I lost my white pie virginity here LOL, sprinkle on some red pepper flakes and your slice is solid. 
This was all i ate on a 3 day trip to Vegas while staying at the Cosmo, every day..
I just wished they delivered :(

The second time I came here wasn't as flavor packed as the first but I still love it anyway :)

As far as ordering goes, I would definitely call in and order ahead of time if you're planning on getting a fresh whole box of pizza. YUM. If not they have a selection of pizzas by the slice you can choose from and they reheat it in their oven for a couple of minutes for you so it's nice and hot for ya.

Really great New York style pizza for Las Vegas strip prices, so don't be surprised at the cost of each slice! The slices start at $5 for a plain pizza and go up from there. You get a fairly decent sized slice, though usually 2 does the job for me.

YES they DO NOT tell you exactly where it is, you have to find it on your own! (what a pain in the ass) I hoped this pizza was worth it for all this run around BS.

We finally found it and we were greeted to a line of people outside of a narrow hallway...GREAT!...but as soon as I saw the pizza pies lined up against the glass window like NY pizzerias are, I started to think positively of this whole situation.  They had white pizza, regular, pepperoni, sausage..etc.  I had the sausage and mushroom and a small soda, it came out to 5 something and change, ok close to an NY price.

Now the real test..took my first bite.....and YES it was freakin GOOD!  I swear I heard ""Dream Weaver"" play in the background..LOL.  The crust was crisp, sauce and cheese was just right, it wasn't greasy or soggy...ahh man! brings back memories!

I had ONE SLICE...what a mistake! I would get a whole pie next time..
It isn't better than NY pizza but I must say, It is as good as it gets!",1,1,1

You go back in time through a hallway of old records; you could see two pinball machines in the distance.  It as if to a college pizza shack, you pick your pizza and get served your drink in a read party cup. There are not many seats they have a TV kind of to make it more of a small hidden hang out spot.

I tried the meatball with banana peppers; it was to die for it had the savory along with the tangy lemony taste giving it a great balance. The pepperoni had an authentic taste as if the peperoni was sliced a little thicker and cured a little longer. This is a must for an in-between meal or even ideal for after the bar spot.

They offer a variety of pizzas, and I always go with some sort of meat combo. It's served NY style and is a perfect thin crust. Slices come out to be around $5 or more depending on the toppings your pizza has. Affordable for Vegas, but $5 for a slice of pizza is pretty ridiculous elsewhere. Their slices are also pretty greasy which is a downside and definitely doesn't sit too well especially when you're drunk off your butt; delicious for the time being but regretful afterwards.

The sauce is excellent--that's what makes\/breaks most pizza IMO. Cheaper pizzas are either too sweet and bland or have this odd metallic taste.

I also loved that the parmesan was very salty (as it should be) but the pizza itself wasn't. That's also an indicator of bad pizza--cheese that's way too salty like American Cheese. 

Just make sure you don't get one that looks like it's been sitting out all day. It'll be dry. It'll still taste good but just dry.

After searching throughout the casino we finally made it to the our destination and the people here are very inviting. *Hint* Look for a pinball machine at the of a hallway.  

The register lady claimed that their White Pizza is their 'bread and butter': Ricotta, mozzarella cheese, parmesan, garlic, basil, oregano, and NO sauce.  You have the option to top it off with slice tomatoes an alternative for a sauce which is highly recommended by Nico, our pizza guy.  The tomatoes helps brings out the flavor of the White Pizza more and are place on after the pizza is removed from the oven.  This is a little different from the norm, so I didn't want to fully commit. 

Nico overheard our dilemma and normally he wouldn't do this for anyone, but for us he was more than happy to modify our pizza. . Half White, half Pepperoni and Sausage.  Score! 

My first slice i was in loved, but after my second i thought it was too much of the same dry cheese ricotta taste.  It was good, but i wouldn't be too quick to go back for 3rds.

The sausage and pepperoni pizza were freakin' good.   The slice sausage and pepperoni has a greater caliber than your typical pizza joint.  The oil from the cheese and pepperoni goes so well with that lightly burnt crust, and the sausage had a nice bite to it.  I saved one of these for my last slice ;P

You can ordered by the slice which they will reheat one of the premade one or you can be fatties like us an order a whole pie.  Takes about 15min.

You go down an unmarked hallway on the 3rd floor and it leads to a teeny little hole-in-wall pizza joint like ones you find on virtually every street corner in NY. The guys keep the huge pies coming, which you get by the slice. A slice will run you about $5, depending on toppings and with a draft of PBR it's almost $10 but that's really a bargain in these parts. 'Sides, the pizza is legitimately good. Big and floppy but with a crunch to the crust, it really made me feel nostalgic for the NY slices I used to get.

My advice is to get a big old plastic cup o'boxed red and then head down to one of the other, more pretentious ""mixology"" bars in the Cosmo...where you can get soused in style, smug with the secret knowledge that you're getting totally f*cked up for less than the cost of one of those lame blocks of ""art"" they sell in the ripoff trending machines -- I mean VENDING machines.

It's a relative bargain compared to ordering by the slice, which can be up to $5 depending on how many toppings you want. 

Everything was just as good as before, except for the soggy middle. Since a whole pizza was made fresh to order, all the cheese and grease gravitated towards the center. Plus all the cheese and toppings just slid right off the mushy crust. It probably could've used a few more minutes in the oven to develop a better crust in the middle. But it was still damn GOOD, and burned the top roof of my mouth way too many times.

If you order per slice, they'll throw it back in the oven to reheat, so you won't have the soggy-crust-in-the-middle problem. So it all depends on your preference.

I will start this review with the following disclosure: The following Pizzeria does not exist. It has no menu, it has no website, it has no signs advertising a family meal deal. It is also not down a long hallway lined with old music album covers on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. It is not one of the best deals on the strip. It is also not the Best Pizza on the Strip. I HAVE KEPT THE SECRET.  Now onto the food review... for the best pizza and best pizza deals in Vegas you need to find the secret Pizzeria at Cosmo. The cost is almost two dollars less per slice then any other pizza joint on the strip ( including my other favorite at the Wynn) and the super thin crust , fresh taste and general New York ambiance just can't be beat. Although thin , the crust is still sturdy enough to bend without breaking and strong enough to hold any toppings. Speaking of toppings... unless you order ahead of time ( is there an actual number to the place?) then you will be having your pizza topped with whatever the chefs whim is. There is no formal menu.  On this day Simone and I had our choice of 5 different pizza pies. We both choose for our first slice portabello mushroom pizza with red sauce. With meaty fresh thin sliced mushroms, sweet fresh tasting marinara creamy mozzarella cheese and a crispy blistered crust this one was a winner. Savory till the last bite it leaves you wanting more... so I obliged. This time when I went back to the counter looking me in the face was a white pizza with fresh roasted garlic, Ricotta Cheese and Olive Oil. This one may have been better then the mushroom. The crust was sauce less and had even more crunch. The garlic was sweet, the Ricotta Creamy and slightly melted and the Olive Oil was the icing on my pizza experience.  
The Pizzeria does not seem to offer any sides and I didn't ask because none were needed. They do have fountain drinks and beer. Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes can be found at the stand up bar that you can eat on. Without any other choices, The pizza definitely stands alone (although three days later we went back and tried a cannolli for dessert and that was delicious as well).

This review is only based on yesterday's service\/experience. 

I have been to Secret Pizza numerous times, basically it's a must every time I go to Vegas. It's a combination of going after the club, mid-day snack, and even going the morning before heading back to LA. Yeah, it's great pizza, we all know that. However, last night around 11pm, I was so upset with Secret Pizza, I couldn't enjoy pizza because of the attitude and up charge! I went there ahead of my boyfriend as he told me to go first while he cashed out downstairs at the casino. Since it was only 11pm in Vegas, there was no line. Yes! The beauty of not getting Secret Pizza post-club. By the time I was about to order, 5-7 people started forming a line before me. My boyfriend got to me as soon as I was about to order and told me he wanted any sausage slice. The guy behind the counter rudely in a harsh voice told my boyfriend, ""You, go to the back of the line"". I mean, come on, I was going to order for my boyfriend either way. He's not cutting. He came to me to let me know what he wanted. We were not in any way behaving improperly or drunk or even doing anything wrong to be spoken to in that manner. Then when I went to pay for my two slices of pizza, the woman at the cashier said ""what did you order?"", I stated ""one sausage with toppings..."", she entered $6 on the register- understandable. I gave her my credit card and I then told her, ""second slice is just sausage""...and again, she entered $6 on the register- not understandable. I asked why the $6 charge on the plain sausage and she didn't bother to explain and  charged my card and gave it back to me and moved on to the next customer. I didn't even get the chance to get an answer or reasoning behind her over charge. Thanks.

Fine, most pizzas take about that long when you order them for delivery - no problem.

However, for some reason, it took 2 hours from the order being made to the handoff from Secret Pizza to the delivery guy.
When I opened the box, it was thin, greasy and ice cold. If the pizza had really taken 45 minutes (or whatever) to make, why was it not at least a little fresh or lukewarm and why did it take so long for Secret Pizza to give it to the delivery guy who sat there the whole time waiting? Clearly someone had forgotten about it. But that's just the delivery experience.

I basically ate pizza dough and it is way overpriced at $5.00 for a cheese slice and goes up from there....that's called rip off. The line was very long but reading the reviews this is the norm. There is very limited counter seating.

Okay okay, maybe the moniker is because the place is unmarked, tucked away down a hallway next to a sushi joint, and you really will miss it unless you're looking for it. But it's still the worst-kept secret in the Cosmopolitan.

It's thin-crust (but NOT crispy) pizza and for slices, you're limited to handful of choices - cheese, pepperoni, and white pizza. You have more flexibility for toppings if you order a whole pie, but beware the wait. It took us upwards of 35-40 minutes for two pizzas, and save for a half-and-half topping on one of them, we didn't really order anything complicated. I was, however, extremely grateful for the FREE WATER!

The white pizza is the standout here. So much garlic and olive oil that it will leave your paper plate soaked. It was a little on the soggy side because of all of the oil, but at 2am, it's exactly what the doctor ordered. If you're wearing insane heels and you've just finished a night of going big at one of the clubs, you will want to sit on the couches outside of the place to relax and eat.

There is also a Donkey Kong arcade game inside the place. It's a great way to pass the time, but beware the Kong. It will suck you in, beat you down, frustrate you, tease you, and leave you with a hole in your heart. Have fun.",5,6,5

Instead, it channels those ""street slice"" pizzerias you first stop at because you're hungry when you walk by, and then later because you know it's there.  You might not even know the name; it's just ""That pizza place on Bleecker Street.""  The unmarked entrance on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan echoes the phenomenon perfectly.  For many twenty-somethings, stopping for a slice after hitting the bars has also become a way of life, and this place brings that experience to Las Vegas.

Of course, it does so at Vegas prices, which means you're paying an outrageous $5 for a slice of pizza.  More problematic is a potential wait in excess of 15 minutes thanks to the raging popularity of this place.

The pizza is actually decent for what it's trying to ape.  It looked like a greasy mess when it was handed to me, but the crust is vaguely crispy without being crumbly, and the cheese actually adds some quality flavor instead of just adding weight and texture.  I've had far worse pizza-by-the-slice in New York itself.

Las Vegas has so many good eats that I can't really recommend making this a destination you go out of your way to check out.

The fact that there is no signage and the corridor is only marked with records makes you think you are going down a hallway to a restroom or back alley. But the blaring music and everyone outside standing around eating pizza slices makes it a dead giveaway. 

For its prices, it's decent pizza. They have a handful of slices to choose from, so I went with my typical white pizza - how I wish they put spinach or another type of green on top! My friend's husband got one with meatball topping and my boyfriend got traditional pepperoni. Our slices were warmed up quickly (my boyfriend lucked out with a fresh slice) and we grabbed our drinks and sat outside the pizza place near the pool table. 

Crunchy thin crust covered with decent toppings and lots of cheesy goodness - it's hard to go wrong.

It was $5.25 for a pretty small\/medium sized slice of pizza, but let me tell you... it was a game changer.

I've had cheap, expensive, just right... you name it- BUT this baby right here, this whats up. 
I love how they don't have a sign or name or anything, its almost like they willing to put their reputation solely on their pizza. 
This joint is basically NY style but with some pop on its dough and flavor. 
First, the dough doe. The crust was perfectly crunchy and slightly soft just the way I like it. The bread overall was not to thick or too thin. There was just enough for the tastebuds. 
The cheese is what you would expect from any pizza house, but the white sauce and cheese was off the hizzle. When I looked at my slice I saw that there was some garlic paste mixed in it, which is what gives the extra kick. Everyone before and after me got regular slices (presumably because of the cost?), but you are missing out if you don't get the white slice.

My family and I have taken the drive down there twice now, both times they screwed up the order.  The first time they left off one of the toppings we paid for.  We had already left when I realized they left one of the toppings off the pie and didn't want to return to get it fixed.

The second time, they did the same thing with 2 toppings.  Normally I'd say $hit happens but after seeing others complain about the same thing, they either have really bad quality control issues or they intentionally do it to rack up extra revenue for ingredients they do not plan on giving to the customer that paid for it.

The second time really took the cake and made me question whether or not I will return.  They left two toppings off the pie.  So I brought it to their attention and they offered to replace the pie.  Sounds good, right?  They even offered to give us a few slices to tide us over until they made another pie. They handed me the first wrong pie and a few slices and said it would be another 20 minutes.   They are always super busy, so that would take another 20+ minutes.  This is after we already stood in line for 30 minutes and another 20+ minutes to make the first pie.  So now at this point, we have waited for 50+ minutes for the wrong order and would have to wait another 20+ minutes.  Since they offered to replace the pie and gave us a few slices to tide us over, I felt compelled to wait and get what I paid for.

So we waited in the pool table area outside of the hallway you walk down to get to the pizza counter.  And waited, and waited and waited some more.  After getting frustrated it was taking so long, I went back inside to see what the holdup was.  I had to wait until the girl behind the counter had a lull in traffic to get access to her.  When I asked when the pie would be ready, she says ""Oh, I gave you the slices and the other pie.  That was it.""  So why would you tell me it is going to be another 20 minutes to wait, if you weren't making me another pie?  VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!

At this point we had been waiting for about 105 minutes for our correct order and I didn't have enough patience to sit around and argue with them.  So we left.  Should we go back?  We do dig their pizza but the service is so crappy that I don't think the trip down there, parking on the strip, schlepping our way through the casino just to get good pizza and BAD service is worth the headache.

Pizza is OG NYC. I don't know the story behind this place, but my vision is like this. A New Yorker had his fingers on the concession plans for The Cosmo Hotel and was like, screw this crappy Pizza My Heart, food court pizza insanity! We are gonna do it NYC style over here! 

I haven't been to NYC in years, but I felt like I was there when I tasted the crust at this bad boy. 

First of all, Sicilian square slices are legit. Thick square and delicious! The selection we had was topped with sliced meatball, roasted tomato and ricotta cheese. Bomb!!
Now, the thin slice was salami and peperoncini and boy were those little suckers spicy! When I got to the end and took a bite of the crust, I was transported back to the good ole NYC. Delicious crust is tough to come by but this place has it all.

A couple of tidbits:

Tiny inside BUT you can eat at the pool table area outside

If you're planning on ordering a pie, call in advance about half hour and it'll be ready for you for pick-up and you don't have to wait in line.  We did this the second night and just b-lined to the front counter to pay and picked up our pie.  Yes, they do have a free filtered water machine near the cash register but it was down this night.  The white pie deliciousness made up for it though.  Second pizza we ordered was half pepps and half cheese.  Was pretty greasy this time around and needed a couple napkins to dab the oil off.  Still good though.  Will definitely be back.",1,0,1

After dinner with a good friend, a few shows, some gambling, daiquiris from Fat Tuesday and a Bellagio water show behind me, I finally made my way to Secret Pizza around 1am. This was probably a bad idea because it's the time everyone starts getting out of clubs and lining up for pizza as well!

Secret Pizza is located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel, on the 3rd floor behind the free pool table, and I'm not gonna lie, I got a little lost finding it. If not for Yelp and TripAdvisor, I probably would've never found it. 

Right away, I noticed a fat line of drunken people in the hallway and thought ""great..."" The line was actually moving reallllly slow and the hallway was as loud as a market. A lot of people also came from Marquee nightclub in the same hotel, making the line twice as long by 2am.

After about 40 minutes, I was starting to wonder if I really wanted pizza that badly but by now, the line was starting to move and I was almost to the front.  

Once I actually got to order, I got about 4 slices to bring back for people at the hotel, two pepperoni and two white sauce (which Yelp said was the best flavor). The pepperoni was really good but the white sauce was extremely tasty!

A little heavy for thin pizza (there was a lot of grease) but it's late night food, so what do you expect? Next time though, I think I'll line up a little earlier and beat the crowd. Maybe buy a whole pie to share. 

For 4 slices, it came out to about $20, kind of pricey but cheap for Vegas. 

If you do get pizza after midnight though, make sure to bring something to do or go with lots of people to keep you company since it is a long, long wait.",3,0,0

That was the fun in finding it and having the pizza.  Now it is way too crowded.  The pizza is only okay, it's nothing I would write home about.  The last time I was there, I had just a slice of pepperoni pizza.  It was SO greasy, which I wouldn't mind at 4am, but it was only 10pm.  I didn't quite have enough to drink to soak up that grease.  And the service is super slow.  I mean, the pizza is already prepared, how long does it take to put it on a paper plate and hand it to someone?  Also, I know that it is the strip, but paying $17 for 2 slices and 1 beer is pretty ridiculous.

I do love that they have reasonably priced beer here.  Not that I feel OK about paying $6 for a Stone IPA, but it's better than the $10 they charged for the same beer at The Chelsea.

Nah.  Just read this.  I'll give you precisely what you need to know.

Cosmo.
Third floor.
Just behind the pool\/billiards table with retro lounge seating and shag rug.
Between what is (at the moment) Blue Ribbon Sushi and a cylindrical mini-elevator.
Down the little hallway lined with kitschy music memorabilia.
And... you're there.
(Not So) Secret Pizza.

After a couple of years, it ain't much of a secret anymore.  And it's cashing in.  What once was only three Georges a slice, is now at least an Abe per.  Still, probably the least expensive, hot-- or at least warmed-- meal in this mega-hotel.

Pizzas are already baked, sliced and, oddly, re-distributed and... arranged miscellaneously back into pizza rounds??  Yup.  Presumably so you can see all the varieties in one glance at one pie.  Just peruse the mish-mash of slice variety and choose what you want.  They then throw it in an oven for a minute-- and only a minute, in my case.

Move to the left, pay the cashier.  Dispense some agua from the cooler, gulp it down, then step back and wait for your order.

Sausage slice was quite good.  The everything with green peppers was nothing special.  There are *maybe* three seats next to the counter where you line up.  Usually taken though.

Or just take your Secret Pizza back out to the pool table area.  You might have a smidge better luck snagging a seat there.  But if not, just stand there and chomp your slices, it's kool.  Guaranteed, someone around that lounge area will hit you up.  Conversation at the very least.

Ah yes.  Nothing like a kid getting his first legal taste of alcohol in a public environment.  Classic.  Just standing around, dazed, taking swigs from a giant malt liquor bottle.

""Hi where you guys from... I live here, yeah in Vegas... never had a f*k*g drink before... I f*k*g just turned 21 so going out tonight getting f*k*g wasted... these my friends we're just hanging getting f*kd up actually I live here in vegas.  No f*k*g way, you look like you're 23.  Do you drink.. f*k*g never had f*k*g alcohol until tonight do you do weed, no.. oh okay that's okay, i f*k*g do it all the f*k*g time it's the f*k*g best.  yeah i'm in some f*k*g classes, i go to paul mitchell salon school uggh shittt it's ok, nah, it sucks... well it's, no i f*k*g hate it, hate school.  f*k*g live with my mom it sucks... f*k*g hate it because she's with some f*k*g d*k f*k*g a-hole now.  do you have kids, no... alright, that's so kool, i f*k*g hate kids they're so f*k*g obnoxious f*k*g hate 'em, my f*k*g mom's trying to have more f*k*g kids and i f*k*g can't stand the sight of them so f*k*g annoying give me f*k*g headache all the f*k*g time.  f*k*g kids are the f*k*g worst.  well nice to meet you, have a good time here.""

And with that, he just wandered off with his friends.

I've been hearing a lot about this place, good and bad. I love pizza, so when a group of friends couldn't decide on what to eat, this place was the perfect spot.

There's no signs, just an open door leading into a picture framed hallway. You look up at the simple menu. Immediately we noticed NO RANCH. Dang!! It's ok though. The pizza was still good without it. It's about $5 a slice for a plain cheese pizza, but with 5 of us, a couple dollars more per person got us a fresh whole pie. We opted for the white, which comes with mozzarella cheese and ricotta. It was quite tasty!!! A little but on the greasy side, but that's what happens when you order a pizza that's ALL cheese. 

It was a solid pizza spot, but for the pricing and the fact that there's hardly anywhere to sit, I'd still rather have Grimaldi's.

($31 for 1 topping, not including tax...). there will be at least a25 minute wait time bc it is made to order. A lot of people come here to get pizza after a long night of partying\/ clubbing\/ drinking.  The con about this place is you can't really eat there.  There's not enough seats (usually taken up by people who are waiting on their order). You can find a spot outside in the hotel lobby area... If you're lucky.",0,0,0

The myth of secrecy now completely debunked, let's start with directions to Secret Pizza: Take the elevator near the Cosmopolitan's Chandelier Bar to the 3rd floor. You'll see a lounge with a pool table in front of you when the elevator doors open. Make a hairpin turn (hard right) as you exit the elevator and you'll see a short hallway completely plastered with vintage record album covers; this is the hallway that leads to Secret Pizza.

They serve three kinds of New York style pizza here: white, red, and Sicilian.  On my most recent trip to Sin City, I visited Secret Pizza twice - once on Friday night and once on Saturday afternoon.  On Friday night the line was all the way down the hall; we waited for over an hour to get to the counter.  On Saturday the wait was really short, but they were out of Sicilian :-(

The main idea behind my Saturday visit that trip had been to try the Sicilian, but they were all out when we got there!  However, both the red and the white pizza were surprising good, so my pizza Jones and I made due.  I ended up trying the red and white slices both times.  The toppings I chose were Sausage and Pepperoni on the red slice, and sun-dried tomatoes on the white.  On my Saturday visit I added garlic to the red and the white; both are MUCH better with garlic!  

Let's talk about the pizza in detail.  The classic NY pizza is a simple slice of cheese pizza that's shaped and sized a certain way, with the crust discernibly thicker on the edges.  It's also got to have what I like to call ""independent suspension"".  This means that even with a decent load of toppings, the crust most be firm enough to eat with your hands either as-is, or folded in half.  The crust at Secret Pizza is totally legit; it's shaped exactly like NY pizza is supposed to be shaped and it's got wonderful independent suspension.  The toppings are premium; super-sized, and very tasty, and the crust is chewy, not soggy, and tastes great.

Strangely enough, the pizza was better on the Friday night when the line was colossal; the slices didn't get cooked enough on Saturday, even though the lines were short.  The slices were still pretty darn good though.

Despite how exceptionally busy the staff is, they're efficient, good humored, and informal.  How informal?  I brought my own bottle of wine and asked about a corkage fee; the dude behind the counter just handed me a corkscrew and said, ""go for it!",20,17,21

They close at 5am so it's perfect for those hungry night owls, or owls in a drunken stupor.
It's a bit hard to find in the afternoon when there isn't a line of drunk clubbers leading you to the hole in the wall. It's also cleaner in the afternoon when there aren't any drunk clubbers throwing napkins everywhere like a bunch of animals.
The lines during the night however is savage. It makes people angrily stomp away, drunkenly slurring ""I'm not waiting 2 hours for f***ing pizza!""  Then you breathe a sigh of relief as the wait time weeds out the weak and the long line gets shorter. But it does get hard with people walking past you with the delicious smell of pizza pies being waved in your face. Then your stomach starts to eat itself from the lack of pizza in it.

The employees are quick and the ovens can only work so fast, it's the people who order that are slow and absolutely inconsiderate (did they forget the rest of the people behind them??).

The pizza is usually thin crust, which is good, nice and crunchy. They also have a deep dish one too. The sausages are pretty salty, especially the sausage with peppercinis, which is good for the drunken animals that roam Las Vegas when the clubs are closing. But my favorite is the regular cheese pizza or the white cheese pizza. Soooo frickin good. Get yourself a slice! They're pretty big slices too.

I mean, where else will you find a pizza joint with no markings or signs of any nature. No Name Pizza Kitchen? Check. This place isn't even in the resort directory -- not on the Cosmopolitan website, nothing! How I came across this place, I have no clue, but I sure am glad I stumbled upon this place. After a journey around the Cosmopolitan, up and down elevators, back tracking and such, the mission was complete. At first, I couldn't find it and thought, ""maybe it doesn't exist"". Walking through the hallways, I smelled the scent of freshly baked pizza dough. Thinking it was an oasis of some sort, I convinced myself I wasn't going crazy. Literally following the scent of that yeasty goodness, I was finally at the small little hallway entrance that led to Secret Pizza AKA NNPK (No Name Pizza Kitchen).

The Inside was interesting. The hall way was filled with framed pictured, side by side. A relatively small place, the inside had a few pinball machines, flat screens, white walls, and hungry diners. Not a hint of Cosmopolitan's design cues bleed into the restaurant -- You are no longer at the Cosmopolitan, not even Vegas for that matter. You are totally transformed into this small hole in the wall pizza joint in New York City.

With each slice near 5 bucks, we opted for a whole pizza. We ordered it half white and half meatball with pepperoni. The white pizza was my favorite which had mozzarella, ricotta, and garlic. The garlic was fragrant and savory and the mozzarella and ricotta gave it a smooth texture. It didn' have any meat, but I preferred the white pizza over the meatball and pepperoni. The meatball and pepperoni was tasty, but it tasted to normal for me. It was a bit salty, but still very delicious. The crust on both pizzas were very impressive. Though not cooked in a wood burning oven, it was as close to a Neopolitan style pizza as can be. The slices were large and thin, and could hold its own compared to any pizza from New York City.

If there were to be a secret pizza joint with no names, no marque of any kind, Cosmopolitan would be the place to have it. But then again, with word of mouth, and the scent across the hallways, people won't have a hard time finding it. I think looking for the place is half the fun of it all. The excitement of trying the pizza, getting your pizza in unmarked white pizza boxes, its all part of the dining experience. I was amazed by their pie, probably some of the best I ever had. All you have to do is go find it. You may be wondering, exactly where is this place exactly? There isn't a sign, but you will find a ""Marquee"".

Perhaps Slightly Hidden Pizza, or No Signage Pizza - that last one begs to be said while touching your thumb and forefinger together and shaking them as you say the name in your best Italian accent.

1) Tasty Pizza. Full of garlic and cheese, this name is far more apt than ""Secret"".

2) Food and Drinks for Two for $19.50 Pizza. A big mouthful for sure, but so are their slices.

3) Opens at 11am Pizza. It's pretty popular with the late night crowd, but at 11am we had the whole joint to ourselves. I'm guessing all the 3am pizza eaters are still sleeping at this hour.

4) Near a Pool Table Pizza. There is a pool table out front. Nobody kicked us out, or charged us a penny for shooting a game of pool while we waited for Secret Pizza to open, so we shot a game of pool on the most entertaining landmark you will see on your way to the best pizza on the strip.

GOOD:
+ Food: NY style pizza, thin, perfectly crispy crust, delicious! Absolutely one of the best pizzas I've had. And I've had lots of pizzas. (I might even like pizza more than the Ninja Turtles.)
     + Drinks: free refills! (and they have a water cooler on the side by the register)
     + You can buy by the slice (~$4) or the entire pizza pie (large, ~$23?). I do recommend NOT buying by the slice though, because it's pre-made and lamp-heated.  If you buy the whole pizza, it's freshly made and baked on the spot--you'll get it in 12-25 minutes and taste how good this pie really is. It really differs in comparison.
+ Tables: there are tables outside of this place to eat. You get to enjoy their pies in the mall atmosphere, with a beautiful ceiling and two areas of lush cushioned seating space.


BAD:
- Location: How the heck does anybody find this place?! Seriously. I didn't even really see a name outside or anything. It's just by the elevator, down a long dark hallway... over the hill and around the bush and into the woods we go.
- Food: The white pizza was a little tooooo greasy for me (because of baking all that cheese, the oils secreted and oozed and dripped out everywhere giving everyone a nice coat of oily lip gloss), but still was oh-so-delicious. Just shouldn't have too much of it.....
     - Also, I really like pineapple. My guess is maybe this is not a traditional NY pizza topping? But still...sadness.
     - Drinks: comes in a red party cup, no lid, no straw... and our coke was kind of flat.  For ~$4 for a party cup of flat coke, I was pretty disappointed. (However, the refills were a little more fizzy than our initial drink, so I guess it's ok. Still, I'd like to have a lid and straw...)
- Atmosphere: This place is really a nook in the wall. It's so tiny. There's no place to really sit and eat, but there are small counter-tops that line the wall if you want to stand around and eat. Otherwise, you should really get your pizza and GTFO. :) So others can order and try some.
     - There are classic arcade games and pinball machines inside, but they don't work? It's really more for looks and atmosphere than anything. It adds charm to the place, but the space could have been used for, oh, I don't know... seats?  They probably did this for two reasons though:
          1. For a classic\/casual pizza atmosphere, to have some of that Vegas pizazz in that tiny little room in the back of some random obscure hallway.
          2. To encourage people to not sit around and stay and just GTFO so they can serve more customers. Geniuses, they are.

There are only a few counter seats, so most people take it out in the seating area on the 3rd floor or back to your room.

I tried a variety of the slices during my stay, but the simple white pizza slice was the best, which was topped with a healthy amount of garlic, olive oil and cheese. The meatball slices on the meatball pizza are full of flavor.

Only minor challenge with this spot would be if you showed up when they were really busy. They aren't the most efficient at the counter, so I could imagine there are some long waits to order and get your food when busy.

It's a better deal to just get a whole pizza. A 5 topping whole pizza come out to be around $35. For Cosmo standards, I think that's freaking worth it. Even if it's just for two people, just order a whole pizza, eat your couple of slices, then take the rest up to your room. And voila, you have breakfast the next day. The greatest thing about the Cosmo rooms is that they have microwaves inside the kitchen area so you can nuke your pizza the next morning for some hot breakfast or be like me and eat it cold. 

Also, if you get lazy and you're staying in the Cosmo rooms, they also deliver. How awesome is that? 

Anyways, their pizzas are actually pretty tasty so it's a win win for all!",1,1,1

I highly recommend the classic pepperoni.  Perfect ratio of sauce to cheese to meat.  Their crust is thin and crunchy.

I feel like people would want to go to this pizzeria only because it's sort of a novelty - there's no sign, it's hidden in a long hallway with old school arcade video games, and you feel special when you know where it is since not many people do. 

The style of pizza served is NY pizza - it's got that nice thin crust and large cut slices. The pricing per slice is very reasonable and they're open late for the after clubbing crowd to get their late night munchies.

The pizza itself is a very average New York style pizza. When you finally get up to the window, you can either order a whole pizza with up to six toppings, or you can choose a slice from four already-made pizzas, alternating the toppings with each new pizza.

We ordered the white pizza special with pepperoni and some sort of sausage and a mushroom and sausage pizza. Both were delicious! Total came out to $11 for the two pizzas. You can also use your Cosmopolitan Identity Players card to pay for your meal if you have enough points. There isn't really much space to eat inside but you can take your meal outside by the escalator where there is a nice lounge area with plenty of seating. You will find many people devouring their pizzas there! There is also a pool table you can use for free. We will be coming back here again!,1,1,1

You can grab a slice or a whole pizza. They have some ready to go ranging from pepperoni, cheese, combo, and white slice. Recently they even had a deep dish version of the white slice, looked awesome but a bit much for me. You could also add toppings to all he slices and they will stick it in the oven for you.  

My go-to slice is simple: white slice with roasted tomatoes. The ricotta and white sauce combined with the tangy tomatoes is out of this world. The only thing I would recommend they change would be to add fresh chopped garlic to their menu.  I made the mistake of getting 3 whole pizzas with extra garlic, only to find they use powered garlic which left an awful aftertaste in my mouth.",3,1,1

We ordered a whole pie - standard pizza - half with pepperoni and half just plain cheese.  I had some of both - the sauce, the cheese, the dough.  SO GOOD.

Picked up a slice of white deep-dish pizza ($9) and it was enough to share. It was a bit on the hard side. I'm sure with it being so late, it had been sitting around longer than it would have during the day. All the same, it tasted great. 

All the stools were taken up, so Bran and I laid about on the vintage chairs they had in the food court common area. It was quiet and away from the hubbub and Axe body spray downstairs.

But here's why their service is not good... A stranger walked up to us and offered to buy us our pizza when we were near ordering towards the front of the line. We didn't think anything of it at the time until the cashier lady scolded us for letting him buy us pizza. He cut the line, bought us our pizza and some slices for himself and then left. I'm just wondering why WE were the ones who got in trouble instead of the man that cut the line. If they really did not condone people cutting in line, then they shouldn't have served the guy.

Then turns to US and tells us that she'll kick us out next time if we let someone cut the line...

I get it, we shouldn't have let him buy us our pizza, but it was our first time there. I'm sure she sees that kind of stuff all the time so why didn't the employees of Secret Pizza protect their customers? Why did they allow someone to cut the line and take advantage of another customers gullibility? Yea, I fell for it and I've learned my lesson, but seriously, why scold us for the other guys actions.

It's but a small 60'x60' room filled with a few pinball wizards and people patiently waiting for a slice of heavenly pie (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=o7wcJPIoRt13Dx7coGNEtw#o7wcJPIoRt13Dx7coGNEtw).  

Behind the counter, workers pound and toss their gooey dough (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#lW79LoJSUg1RwIPrp_kAKw), making sliced triangles ranging from $4.50 on up based on 50 cents a topping.  For those with a more voracious appetite a pie be available with prices ranging from $25 to a deluxe of $35.00.  Pie additions cost $2.50 each.  Quite expensive, but not on my ""Lost Wages"" radar, as I wanted it by the slice and by the slice I did receive.  The toppings looked plain and just nominally adequate as they sit in their aluminum bins just waiting to be tossed sporadically on round pie pans laid with golden flour.  The prices of drinks are on par with private Taoish bars:  Sodas 4 bucks, IPAs 7 bucks.  Good Ol' PBR sewer agua a ghastly 5 bucks.

We asked the chef what be best in his opinion.  Although we weren't really impressed with what was presented, we opted to go with his picks of white, deluxe, and veggie-tar-e-yan (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#VpTrXV0-B3IXvr2iCQiTtQ) (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#ns2AT1cd63Rihd8BiVwDqw) (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#Kh_DKlGnEKPQcgDBnzmw2g) (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#yYP2x9gRAHoDEx9R5E_1dw).   

Various choices to choose:

(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#q3VPFuV-SQjXhIab6f_9aQ)

We paid and waited just as patiently as others, noticing everyone kept within their small cliques, or busily eying their mobiles (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#c9cbpz6hdIG_qINg5huokg).  The slices returned to the broiler and there they sat, until our names were called and then it begat!

No idea if I be drunk or needed to be buzzin' to enjoy these hot tempting pie slices, but whatever it was, it really worked for me.  It was but a warm slice of heaven that was on par with some of the best I've put in my mouth without worrying about spitting up some hairball.  The crust was just crisp enough with the flexibility of NY-stylin' that wrapped around my hand.  Just enough grease and just enough cheese, the deluxe was nothing but 5-star tasting'.  We ate at the small alcove bar to take in and enjoy the happening surroundings.  I actually think the re-heating is probably the key to getting the crust texture just right.

It was such a pleasure to finally unravel your secret, and while the surroundings are a bit crewed, as long as you're with friends or loved ones this place can satisfy any of your late night whims.  I will loyally keep the secret of this unnamed hallway as faithfully as a yelper should.  The last buck stops here (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA)!",16,16,14

Meaning I judge a pizza place by a simple cheese slice. If that is executed well it's a good sign of what's to come. So I ordered cheese and pepperoni.  Did I need two slices? NOPE... I am miss piggy so I had to get them. The cheese pizza was right up my alley. The thin crust with a decent amount of cheese and sauce ratio.

After a brief stint in the oven, I took a bite of the pepperoni, sausage, and meatball slice ($6.25). I could see the grease dripping down and with each bite, I could feel my arteries clogging. But, I kept eating as it was just so good. The best part was the soft and chewy crust.

The place is pretty small, no tables, 4 stools and a few pizzas that were premade. Each time I went, I ordered the white cheese pizza with pepperoni and meatball for $6! Each slice is pretty large so it should fill you up (think costco pizza). As for a whole pizza, it's about $30 plus.

Try finding this place at about 2 am is a lot easier, there are tons of post night clubbers, or other late night eaters trying to get their grub on.  You'll most likely see a line into the hall or at least bunches of people scarfing down pizza near the entrance.

As for the the pizza,  it's not like there are crazy weird toppings or anything.  It's just a plain and simple good pizza.  They are constantly baking them so they are coming out hot a fresh.  They are just under $5 a slice, which may seem like a lot, but they are large like Sbarro, but wayyyy better.  Keep in mind you are on the strip trying to get food.  They also sell beer on tap and soda too!  I love the white pizza, but I usually select whatever just came out of the oven, and haven't been disappointed yet.

Many a Yelper have just accidentally stumbled onto this pizza place in the Cosmopolitian en route to something else. Unlike them, I cheated, using Yelp and the Internet to do the dirty work for me. It also helps that I saw other people just randomly going into the 3rd floor with whole pizza boxes. Once you hit the 3rd floor, look between Jaleo (the Spanish place) and Blue Ribbon (sushi) for a small hallway filled with records.

The pizza place is supposed to be small and simple; No1DP notes that it's reminiscent of the pizza joints he used to frequent back in NY\/NJ. There's seating and counter space only for ~5 people and there's only 2 pinball games. The concept's really simple: pick pizza for slice or customize a whole pie. 

No1DP was craving pizza as Japan really doesn't know how to do a good pizza. I was there for another reason: to try the concoction known as ""white pie"".
Crust: Thin and crunchy, which the No1DP says is the way to do a New York-style pizza. The pizza gets cold quickly so eat it while you can. No1DP says that this is why you see people eat this pizza fast - there's not much crust to absorb the heat.
-Veggie Supreme: Came to ~$8.00\/slice as he had lots of toppings. He says that this is the best pizza he's had in a while and can easily put this in the top 10 pizza joints he's visited.
-White Pie ($5.50): The No1DP said to me that each pizza joint does their white pie differently, but in essence this is a cheese pizza with NO tomato sauce. When fresh off the oven the cheese is stringy but it held together well. I really liked the garlic and they are generous with the ricotta - this soft cheese literally just melts in your mouth!

No matter how many world class dining options Las Vegas has to offer, it always comes down to the basics, bread, sauce, cheese, and some type of wannabe Italian meat. To be honest I don't care where I get it from, just be close to either a. where i am (club, bar, etc), or b. where i am going to be (my hotel). 

Secret pizza fulfills all that, and it has a certain enchanté about it. Tucked away on the third floor of the cosmopolitan, your first time there is like walking into a closet and ending up in Narnia, or going through the fabled Platform 9 3\/4. It's secret (heh) passageway lined with rock memorabilia leads you with the scent of melted cheese, meat grease, and drunkards. A small waiting area and kitchen, Secret Pizza boasts ready made and made-to-order pizza with the assistance of a few pinball machines to burn the time while your pie is getting fired up. The staff is friendly enough, and the pizzas are huge and greasy. There's nothing more a guy can ask for.

If you have any trouble finding it, it's no secret. My girlfriend and I literally just asked a custodian on our first visit, and he pointed us right to it. So end your night right with Secret Pizza and try not to pour half of the red pepper jar on your one slice to prove a point.

Last night, I went in to pick up an order I called in an hour earlier, and they did not have my order. And then the situation escalated- I spoke with the manager and rather than fix the situation, security was called and I was escorted out. At the time, I was explaining to the manager that I had placed an order and he kept repeating that they don't have an order ready for me to pick up, told me to go wait in line to order and essentially accused me of lying about placing my order in the first place. I have never experienced such rude management in my life. I get that they are busy and have a long line, but if your staff makes a mistake, rather than accusing a customer of lying, they should probably apologize and fix it. After explaining my situation to security, the security guard apologized for how rude the management was, but unfortunately, he couldn't do anything to remedy it and I was left without any pizza at the end of the night.

This was my first time here. I only came here upon my friend's recommendation. I decided to skip the fancy buffet to try something new. When I first walked in I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting a large fancy pizza place. I thought to myself ""why is this place so popular?"". There were no signs that said ""we're famous for blah blah blah"". So I asked the employee what they were famous for. The guy told me this place is famous for it's ""White Slice"".

I recommend getting the white slice with pepperoni. The original white slice itself will not come with any meat or toppings. The flavor and taste of the white slice is quite unique. It is something other pizza places do not offer. It is a taste unlike any I've ever tasted before. If I had to describe it in words I would say cheesy, garlicky, and damn good!

It was Monday morning at 11:00AM and the girls wanted to grab some slices before heading home.  Wandering around the hotel, I asked one of the nice Cosmo' staff where the pizza joint is.

Staff: ""Hmmm.. I don't know if I can trust you. This is some top secret pizza.""
Me: ""Really? Because it got a gang of reviews on Yelp. How top secret can it be?""
Staff: ""Hmm good point. You're standing right in front of it.""

So the pizza place opens at 11:30 and there was a wooden door\/wall in between 2 restaurants, so we waited. 11:25 came and there were already people lining up. 

Once the place opened the wooden wall was flipped and we walked down the long corridor and finally saw the pinball machine people were talking about.  We were greeted by some young cheery staff members. They had 4 pies ready which included: white, meat with mushrooms, plain cheese and a pepperoni.

As we placed our order, the pizza maker told us it'd be cheaper for us to get a pie.  We decided to do a half white and half sausage\/pepperoni\/mushroom. It came out to about $24 for a pie.

White pizza. Good if you like ricotta cheese. Very soft texture but very flavorful. The meat\/mushroom pizza was just okay to make. The dough was nice and soft with crisp golden edges but the ingredients lacked the umph.  It could be in the marinara sauce. Who knows.

Overall a good pizza for something on the Vegas strip at a swanky place like the Cosmo. I wouldn't say it's to die for (unless you're broke and needing to save all the $ you can for gas so you can make it back to LA). LOL.

At first glance, I couldn't decide which slice to get..one had  more pepperoni and the other had more peperoncinis...why can't I just have the best of both worlds?!

I'm just going to keep this real short.

Secret Pizza isn't much of a secret. You'll notice where it is as soon as you see people eating pizza while in the sitting areas. It's an awesome place for food when you're drunk or right after you get out of the club. Or any time, really. I usually go at night.

Their cheese pizza is best. Stringy, gooey cheese. 

Their pepperoni is really salty and covers the taste of their cheese. Good if you like pepperoni. Not good if you want to just taste the cheesey goodness. 

If you're with friends, get a whole pie. Split it. Much more cost efficient and you get more pizza that way.

One slice is around $5-6. One pie is about $28-30. That is assuming you're just getting a cheese pie or pepperoni. The more toppings you get, the more expensive. Price is average to be honest, especially compared to places like Grimaldis. 

If you haven't tried it, try it. Always start off with a slice of cheese pizza.",1,0,0

But the pizza was amazing and delicious! I ordered two slices and I thought it wouldn't fill me up, I was wrong! The slices are pretty big and it fills you up quickly! 

The place is nothing fancy and there are barely any chairs in the restaurant. They pretty much warm up your pizza and serve 'em on paper plates. The drinks are uber expensive though, I think 3 bucks for a cup of soda or whatnot. 

It's also all kinds of shocking that this pizzeria is tucked away at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and it's on the 3rd floor.

You walk into this unmarked hallway lined with classic vinyl records. Then inside there are a couple pinball machines and a Galaga arcade game. There are no tables--only counter space--which is unique unless you want to sit down. This place has a really authentic '80s vibe to it--music and everything.

Also, if you sign a dollar bill, they put it on the wall with the others.

The main reason why it wouldn't get a full 5 stars is because it's somewhat overpriced. The 18"" pepperoni pie was $28.50. We could have added more toppings, but it would have significantly increased the price. But if you take into account that it's at least that amount for two people in Las Vegas no matter where you go, then I guess it's not too bad. 

The toppings list was also quite limited, with maybe 10 options--all very common ones too.

It's not the best pepperoni pizza I've ever had--that one would be up for discussion--but it's probably top 5. If anything, the meat could have been slightly less salty and the cheese could have done better to balance the flavor out, but overall it was very satisfying.

I would go back here, but only while in Vegas. If Secret Pizza was in the real world I would have a hard time dropping $30 for a pepperoni pizza--let alone $5 per slice! But since I'm spending a lot of money on food anyway, I might as well pick this place.",0,0,0

The line can be hit or miss, but I've never waited less than 10-15 minutes every time I go there. It's just a fact of life that you're gonna have to wait a while so don't come here expecting prompt service. At least they have record covers of Italian musicians for you to stare at if you don't feel like staring at the fellow patrons in line.

The setup is like the typical street-side quick Pizza joints you find in major city downtown areas.  The Pizzas are pre-cooked and warmed up to order by the Slice or by the Pie.

You can smell the freshly baked pizza and you know it is authentic and delicious just from the first impression.

The pizza itself is giant, greasy, and absolutely delicious. After a long night out in Vegas, not much else can hit the spot as perfectly as a slice of the White Pizza can. Secret Pizza is open pretty much all night so it is here for you when you need it most. It is a bit expensive for one slice of pizza, but the slices are really large and after all - it is Las Vegas.

I'd eat it again but the cost taste factor overall didn't warrant a higher rating. For a full pizza it's a little high on price but it's on the strip, every thing is expensive on the strip.

Some positives, it's open really late and the pizza is decent, the crust is really good, just my opinion the red sauce could be better.

This place is very deserving of the name. It's so well-hidden that it's easy to miss if you don't know it's there. You go down a dark, narrow hallway to find this hole-in-the-wall type place. Décor is nice, like the rest of the casino. It has a cute subway vibe and is very clean. 

I had a pepperoni and mushroom (red sauce) slice, and my hubby had a spinach and feta (white sauce) slice. The crust was thin and chewy. The pizza tasted good, but was a little on the greasy side. 

Yes, it's tastier than your typical Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns, Costco, or any chain pizza joints. However, $5 for a thin slice is too much. $30 for a whole pie is out of the question. There are so many better deals in Vegas. 

I've tried it now (and it is good), but I'm not willing to shell out that much money for a slice of pizza. We left hungry after eating a slice each, but we didn't want to spend another $10 there.

Once as a quick mid afternoon bite. As we walked up they were pulling a fresh meatball and pepperoni pie out of the oven. It was excellent. 

The second time was just after Marquee on a late Friday night. When we were in earlier in the week my GF thought to ask about a menu, the woman at the register gave her one. After a quick read through ( it's only two very short pages) we noticed it did not have a phone number. We asked, can we call ahead and order before we left the club ? The answer was yes for full pies, In fact, if your staying at the Cosmo, you can have it delivered to your room. Salvation !!! no more waiting in line with lots of other drunks. 
So at 2:30 am before the haze of Grey Goose took over I called and ordered a full pie to the room.  An hour later, just after we got got back, there was a knock at the door and there it was, hot out of the oven. The delivery guy also brought several packs of fresh grated cheese and hot pepper seeds. It was perfect after a night of clubbing.

We were very intoxicated, and in need of pizza!

The wait wasn't bad, especially since we got a whole pizza.  Service was pretty standard...not overly friendly, but not super happy to have a room full of drunk guests.  

At my level of drunkenness, I think the pizza was the BEST pizza I've ever eaten.  Now, you also have to keep in mind that I've been dieting for 8 weeks, and have been craving pizza, too, so I'm sure that figured in a bit.

It was hot...it was greasy, it was smothered in garlic...(well, that was our fault...didn't realize the ""Parmesan cheese"" we were putting on the pizza was actually garlic salt!)...it was good!

Consider it a convenience tax.

They have nice pepperoni and they have a bianca with ricotta, which is kind of a dying breed these days.

Having a drunkard unattractive man in a suit telling me and my friends while waiting in line that the pizza isn't good and he found a hair in his pizza and to eat the pizza at our own risk was pretty lame especially since him and his buisness partners left hellah trash everyhwere with not even a single crumb of the so called nasty pizza anywhere.

I think the key to getting a pizza here is to order a whole one fresh and take it to go.  So now that you know the ""secret"" I'll go on with my review...

I was worried about even finding this place since it's supposed to be a ""secret"" but all the restaurants mainly being on the 3rd floor give it away a bit.  You'll find the secret pizza shop down a long hallway lined with album covers.  It's a very cool concept really!  Hide the cheapest option in Vegas so you feel like you've ""hit the jackpot"" when you score a New York style slice for $3.50!

I was a bit confused by the menu.  Well, it's not even a menu, it's a sign that says slice of pizza $3.50 and whole pizza XX amount (sorry, can't remember the whole pizza amount).  Since a lot of the business I suspected was by the slice, my idea was you can add on toppings and they'll ""bake"" (reheat) it on the spot.  Not the case...

There's around 4 or 5 pizza's sitting out that you choose from.  Better hope you like what's sitting out, because that's your only option by the slice.  I love mushrooms, so I wanted a cheese and mushroom pizza.  No luck for Rachel.  

I instead ordered the white pizza with tomato and spinach and I thought they'd pop it into the stove for a couple seconds to heat it up.  No such luck.  It's served to you right then and there.  I think that's why it came out a little dry and underwhelming for me.  It wasn't ""right out of the oven"" but out of the oven a couple minutes\/a while later...And that really made me not a fan.  But I really think I would have thought differently about it had it been right out of the oven.  So order the whole pie and do it the right way!",4,1,1

It reminded me a bit of Pepe's in New Haven even though they use a modern gas fired pizza oven to cook their pies.

The service was great for a pizza joint.  Any cashier that volunteers free refills on the soft drinks is getting my business.  The only thing holding this place back is the lack of tables and stools.  We made due with the limited counter space.

Lunch or Dinner I think it beats all the high end restaraunts in the Cosmo...especially for the price. The Tapas joint has salty foods, the sushi joint is just ok, Comme Ca - I have yet to try. The cafe on the ground floor is good if you can beat the line.

Now DO NOT go here after the clubbing hours. Its madness, the pies get picked up almost immediately and it takes forever to get a couple slices because people just want something in there tummies to take the buzz off or kill the hangover that is going to come the next night. 

GIven its next to Marquee - all the clubbers will hit this spot immediately after partying.

I have met the chef here, and he was real friendly as is most of the staff (Unless its post clubbing time - which is crunchtime for them)! I recommend the white cheese pizza and a simple Pepperoni. But if its late - good luck whatever comes out of the oven first is what you are going to get - but alas - the pies here are all good. I have tried 5 or 6 flavors and none have dissapointed me.

They're opened to 4-5 a.m.  The drunk and partially drunk slur their way in to get that ""sober me up munchies"" on.  Wouldn't you want a sign up to attract more customers?  How passively cruel is that to the wobbly and incoherent?   Wandering like zombies seeking to feed, one could only chuckle at the priceless visual as they search for Secret Pizza.  

Contrarians (sober people) would say signs would defeat the purpose of their marketing goal...it wouldn't be called SECRET PIZZA...logic is never logic if drunk.

Through the corridor on the right of the Japanese restaurant within the Cosmopolitan, you'll find Secret Pizza.  There I said it.  If that's not enough, you're probably too drunk to even eat.  Within this hallway is a massive collection of interesting prints of musicians.  I think they were musicians.  The pizza aroma pulled my attention away from the pictures.    

My monstrous hunger, which developed from searching the menu, told me to get two slices.  Give up looking for a poster board list menu or what have you.  Just ask, because there are none.  Peering down through the glass, I eventually chose the meat lovers and the cheese with white sauce.  

Pizzas are the thin crust.  My crusts were a tad burnt on the edges after the oven warm up; each crispy bite was filled with a healthy (so to speak) dose of cheese and ingredients.  Both slices were delicious.  Both had surprisingly good taste considering since they were just thrown into an oven and reheated for a minute.

After being bumped around and not being able to dance with my wife across the street at the Gallery Nightclub inside Planet Hollywood, we decided that we were at wits end and that pizza was the only thing that could make the night even better.  I suggested Secret Pizza to her and we started our trek.  We made a short jaunt to The Cosmopolitan and started our pizza pilgrimage.

The Yelpers before me did an excellent job at describing where the place was located and that helped a great deal because it would have taken me a while.   Secret Pizza is tricky to find because you're essentially looking for a hallway.  Once you get up the escalator on the third floor, you walk a little and turn to the left.  When you see the hallway, just walk toward the end and follow the incredible smell. 

I've had good pizza before as I've had it in just about any locale you can think of.  I've only been to NYC once and I remember how good it was there.  I can say with pure certainty that the ""White Pizza"" is quite possibly the best that I've had anywhere and that is monumental since I have this weird obsession with ranking EVERYTHING that I eat. 

If a long wait isn't too much of a deterrent then I can't recommend this place enough.",1,1,1

WHAT: Standing in the line, I was looking for some sort of menu, but there actually wasn't one! I was somewhat confused because I am so used to there being a menu explaining it all!

When you get up to the counter, there are toppings you can choose from to make your slice of pizza to your liking, or there are also pre-made slices you can get! I just chose one of the pre-made slices that looked pretty interesting!

On my pizza, along with the mozzarella cheese, there was another type of cheese that I didn't get to remember, but it was REALLY GOOD! I also had mushrooms and green peppers.  I did get to try the White Pizza from my friend!! That was actually one of the most unique slices of pizza I have ever tried!!

Our group settled for simplicity. Two large pepperoni pizzas that was an additional 1 hour wait after order was taken. LONGEST HOUR EVER, but I think the wait made the pizzas so much better than it really is. It was the greasiest two slices I've had, with pools of pepperoni juice sitting in each curl.

Didn't realize til after we had finished the pizzas, but the boxes can be deconstructed into 'plates' in case you didn't ask for plates. I'm sure that's only doable if someone was sober enough to figure out the instructions. There's pictures, but it may require some muscle ahah.",1,0,0

I sort of like the mysterious theme, and the long walk down a record-cover filled hallway with the lingering smell of fresh pepperoni and mozzarella cheese wafting the whole way.

When you do finally find it, you might notice that the prices are a little absurd for a slice of pizza.  And toppings make it even more.  If you're with a group, and none of you are particularly addicted to meat or veggies, I'd suggest just getting a full cheese pie.  Your wallet will thank you.

Apart from the high prices, the pizza itself is really something special.  I'm originally from the Philadelphia area where, next to cheese steaks and soft pretzels, it's the pizza that we pride ourselves on.  Even in Los Angeles where I live now, I have yet to find a truly comparable pizza place.  But Secret Pizza absolutely delivers on that expectation.  Maybe that's the secret afterall.  In any case, totally worth the price of the pie.  The individual slices are a little small, so I can't say with confidence that if you bought by-the-slice, you'd be satisfied.  But it's definitely a tasty, east-coast-style pizza.

The girl helping out new to the operation, so there was a bit of a learning curve on keeping things going.  No problem; I've been in the same situation.    However, once the pizza went into the oven for re-heating and the money was in the register, that about ended an otherwise okay experience.

I swear it took like 20 minutes to get our 3 slices.  3 SLICES.  Another guy took over the pizza-making duties and made it his priority to only check up on the full pizza orders.  So when our slices finally came out, they were burnt at the crusts and essentially crackers at the base.  I told my fiance that I was not eating my ONE slice, he had to bring it back and ask for another slice (I told him to take his back too, but he was too nice to do so).  Another slice of margherita pizza that had been sitting there for quite some time that they could just throw into the oven for reheating.  I was really disappointed that they even gave us the pizza burnt - who serves burned pizza?!  That's already been cooked once?

We should've just gone down to Fashion Show Mall and had a few slices at Sbarro for a fraction of the price.  I guess if you want average pizza in a pretentious setting masquerading as hole-in-the-wall (literally) joint, this could be heaven.

Next time I'll check out their burger joint or that Chinese\/Mexican food fusion place down the way.",0,0,0

We came in during the early evening for a quick snack. They actually had a decent selection of pizza slices and their vegetarian slice had a nice variety and amount of veggies. While it didn't blow me away, it's good for what it is: a good slice of no-fills pizza.

Maybe it's their secret way of keeping the place hidden and away from all the tourists.   Just find the public billiard table in the open floor, and then look for a long dark hallway which seems like it's a private entrance for staff.  Once you walk the long dark hallway, you will walk into a small pizza shop, and the smell of fresh pizza will immediately engulf you!

My friends split a cheese pizza, white pizza, and a pepperoni, olive, and mushroom pizza.  The line can get long, so be prepared to wait!  Once you order, the server will take your slice of pizza and bake it in the oven for a few minutes to get it nice and melty.  I believe a pizza slice comes out to be around $4 per slice.  I thought the price was slightly high since it was a super thin crust, and the slices didn't seem all that big.   The pizza was pretty good, but definitely not as good as the stuff served in NY.  I did not care for the white pizza, but the cheese and pepperoni pizza was pretty good.   Also, the crust was slightly chewy, which I did not like, but I really liked the cheese and spices they topped on the pizza.  One slice of pizza is like an appetizer, so I would suggest you order 2-3 slices a person, if you want to actually get filled up or eat it as a dinner.

I think the ""secret"" is more the location versus the actual pizza itself.  You'll find this small pizza parlor\/station at the end of a very nondescript hallway in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  After walking past pictures and portraits of various people, you will soon reach the secret pizza.

Order by the slice or the whole pizza.  Go big or go small, it's your choice.  For me personally, I chose a slice of pepperoni and that was it.  Was it the best pizza I've had?  Was it worth the all the wait to finally eat this slice of pizza from the mysterious and difficult-to-find pizza palor?  Well, let's just say when you're hungry any slice of pizza will satisfy your appetite.  

NOTE:  Slice of pepperoni was $5.25.  Absence of seating.  Stand and eat at the available counter space or go find some tables and eclectic chairs within the Cosmo.

Simple and good food, quick, friendly service, and open from 10am - 5am (for those midnight pizza cravings!). The pizzas are hot and cheesy and crispy! Pretty much exactly how I like them. 

Prices are reasonable, about $5 or so a slice. You walk up and see what they have to offer, choose your slices, and they pop it in the oven to heat it and crisp it up for you. The meatball ricotta pizza they had was ridiculously yummy - dollops of ricotta mixture, yummy meatball. Mmm. It's a thin NY style pizza I'd say, but they sometimes also have these fluffy deep dish offerings that pretty much taste like huge crispy cheesy garlic breads. Very yummy!

But since it's not 8 months ago, I happen to find myself craving pizza while on the Strip, so I figured this would be a perfect time to get me some not so secret pizza.

So my buddy and I go to Secret Pizza and there is no line, maybe 2 people in there.  So i guess all the hype for the place died.  Then I saw the prices, $5 for a fucking pepperoni slice?  If that slice of pepperoni pizza could actually fuck, then I'd pay $5 for it.  Not even all the concessions stands at carnivals would charge that much for a slice of pizza, and even then those slices were very good and worth it.

My buddy told me he paid around $3 or less for his slices when he went there, and I was sure that was the price 8 months ago.  Either way I asked for a pepperoni slice and the server looked pretty out of it\/didn't give a shit.  I know they just give you a slice and there isn't much customer service involved, but throw a fricken smile and be glad that i am paying you 10X the amount of what that pizza slice cost.  I'd be jumping for joy if I had that gig.

The pizza itself; Very good.  Digged the crust and the sauce, great texture, no complaints about the quality.  However, it's not $5\/slice good, but very good nonetheless.  But it wasn't very filling either.  

I dunno, I felt like the charm it once had that made me want to try it out for the longest time is gone.  This is not a ""little gem"", ""neat place"" or ""hidden secret"", or not anymore.  It's just ""hidden"".

I was surprised the pizza was still nice and warm when he got back to the room. I was a bit scared at first because all the reviews kept saying it's super oily, but this definitely was NOT the case for us! Compared to Five\/50 pizza in Aria, Secret Pizza was way better!!

I've had really good pizza in NY and the pizza here was a NY style big slice (big, foldable, and not too much sauce). It held up the toppings and everything nicely. The crust had the perfect crunch and texture. They were also generous w\/ the toppings here especially the sausage. I mean you can see the whole sausage link on my pizza. I really liked the cheese on here too, it didn't have the stinky cheese smell. The roasted garlic spread smothered on the white pizza was sooo robust and good!! The white pizza consisted of various cheeses as well, the ricotta stood out and tasted fresh.

Located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel on 3\/F (it's at the end of that funky tunnel), Secret Pizza opens until 4-5am pretty much every night, and is my #1 go-to spot for drunchies in Vegas. 

You can order pizza by the box (your choice for toppings) or by slice (depends on what they have made). There are two kinds of pizza--thin slice or thick slice. I ordered 3 slices (don't judge...): a thin slice of peperoni, a thick slice of peperoni, and a thick slice of veggie w\/ ricotta. To be honest I could barely finish one slice...the generous size of the slice and amount of cheese and toppings makes the pizza extremely filling, I only ordered this many slices because I was starving after dayclubbing for hours at marquee XD I prefer the thin slices, actually, because I feel like the thick slices are waaaaayyy too much and even though it's delicious, it made me feel a little gross afterwards.

It could be months, even years, between Vegas trips and yet Secret Pizza is that go-to joint when you need great tasting grub that is cheap and will fill you up. Its especially the place to go late at night. 

First-timers in Vegas will ask you where you got that huge pizza slice. Its a nondescript shop with no signage so for anyone wanting to find this place you pretty much just take the Cosmopolitan escalator all the way to the top floor, spot the narrow entranceway where people are walking out with boxes of pizza.

If you go before people are let out the clubs, its a brisk stroll up to the front of the line and the pizza comes out as soon as you put in your order. The combo deluxe slice is my favorite ($6.00) but I had the Veggie too and it was not bad. Seems like all their pie slices hit the spot. Plus, its always comforting to see the same dude in the New Era baseball cap working here every time I come. 

Not really a secret anymore but still churning out great pizza. This place is awesome.

Definitely a treat, whether you're going out drinking, coming back from a night of boozing, or just taking a short break.

If it wasn't so greasy, I would have gave it 5 stars. Had to use a napkin to soak up some of the oil.",4,3,5

NY style pizza? with how much I have been missing my home lately I needed to get my crack pizza fix. After walking all around, hunting, and putting my super pizza senses to work my friend and I found this place. 3rd floor. hidden back with a walk along vintage album covers. I am giving it a star for all the top secret pizza business going on, but to be honest I was let down with the pizza. The employees were eh and after waiting and looking at each other for a few minutes they asked if we needed any help. I ordered the margarita pizza while my friend just had the cheese. It was thin like nyc, but very hard. I had to work to fold my pizza. (yes, i am a folder. stop judging me las vegas.) i'm use to my pizza being so hot that it burns the roof of my mouth leaving me with a reminder for days of that glorious pizza i consumed days before. This one was warm but not hot. It lacked a certain flavor, but I couldn't put my finger on what. My friend said his basic cheese slice tasted no different then sbarro's, I was mad at myself for paying 4 bucks for this slice, but what can ya do?
the hunt was fun and maybe this would be good pizza after an evening of drinking inside the cosmo, but coming from a new yorker this is not new york style pizza.

So grab one after the club. It's literally the closest thing to Marquee after hours. Ill admit it's a cool kid hangout before or after the club since there's a pool table to play on and it's free. It's near the bathroom so that's always nice. Pizza here runs about 5 bucks a slice, you won't be breaking the bank and the slices are huge. 

However the reason why I'm not in love with this place and jumping for joy is because the wait here just sucks. Since Marquee is also a day club, getting pizza here during the day takes some time as well. The pizza here is good, not great nor amazing.

They also don't serve ranch here either but it's not the end of the world.

Keeping in mind, I've been to New York City quite a few times and have had authentic slices; so my expectations were quite high for this place. Although it's supposedly ""Secret"", felt like everyone knew about ""secret pizza"". It was quite a good 20-30min wait around 10pm for just couple slices. Once at the front counter, you'll see pizza already pre-made for you to choose from and then the pizza makers will throw it back in the oven to reheat. However, 10secs isn't long enough to reheat pizza. My slices  (meat lovers slice & mushroom slice)came out ""luke-warm"" and crust was hard as cardboard. My fiancee' was lucky and was able to try a slice of the white pizza that had just come out of the oven(which was quite delicious. One of the best white style pizzas i've tried). 
3 slices came out just under $20. 

Cons:
-long line
-long wait
-drunk people in line
-expensive slices
-no place inside to dine-in

Pros:
-only worth trying if it's fresh out of the oven

Overall:
First experience was meh. You are better off getting a slice somewhere else. And if you are eager to try this place make sure you order a whole pie because it is not worth having reheated [($5per slice) save it for the craps table] for mediocre quality(unless you're drunk).",4,1,2

I am rating this on the food not the concept. A Sbarro that you can choose your own toppings is all  you get. If you are hammered coming from Marquee then you will probably love this place.  

If you are like me and have had good pizza before and are sober when trying it or only a few cocktails in then OK is what you get. . It is the cheapest place to eat in the Cosmo so that probably why people rate it so high.

They serve up amazing custom pizzas by the slice or the entire pie. Our group came in during dinner time, so the line was pretty long, but customers walking out assured us it was worth the wait. Our group of five people ordered a custom pie, and it was more than enough to feed me and a bunch of hungry boys! We got the white pizza with five toppings, including a unique apple sausage and creamy cheese. Although the pizza is on the greasier side, it's the perfect indulgent pizza you want to find in a city like Vegas. The dough itself is pretty thin, barely enough to hold up all the cheese and toppings. I'm all about the crust, and this was one was baked to perfection with a crispy, charred outside and a doughy, chewy interior. The pizza is extremely generous in size, leaving me more than full after a slice and a half. I definitely recommend this spot to get some gourmet Vegas-worthy pizza on the go!",0,0,0

""Oh, what's it called?""
""I don't know. It's just the secret pizza place?""

Yes. Apparently it really is just called ""Secret Pizza.""

I had always heard of Secret Pizza, but had never figured out exactly where it was. If you're searching for it, you will find it, but if you're just casually passing by, you probably won't even notice it's there. 

How to find it: Go to the Cosmopolitan. Find the entrance to Marquee and take the escalators one floor up. You should be smelling the deliciousness of freshly baked pizza by now. Straight across from the escalators there's a narrow corridor. Follow your nose. This is where the smell is coming from. This is where the secret pizza is hidden away.

You'll probably spend a while stuck in the hallway, being taunted by the smell of ahmazing pizza wafting over you. When you turn the corner of the hallway, you'll be greeted by what looks like an ordinary pizza counter. But do not be fooled. 

You can get a slice of pizza for about $5, which is actually fairly decent since each slice is huge. And delicious (trust me, try the white sauce! Zomg. So gooooooood.) If you're trying to order an entire pie, beware, the wait is most likely going to be terrible. 

There's two TVs, which makes the wait somewhat more bearable. There's also barely any seating, so most people end up just dumping on the cheese and peppers and taking their slices to go. This seems to be the way to go because we grabbed a seat outside on the couches\/stairs in front of Secret Pizza and someone had already snuck a cheese and pepper shaker outside.

Also, for those who enjoy a little late night snacking post-Marquee adventures, Secret Pizza is the place to be. But again, the line, the line! Beware.

tl;dr: If you're in Vegas and searching for a truly delicious piece of pie, Secret Pizza is the place to go. But beware the line! (Because for a secret pizza place, it sure is poppin')",3,2,2

After more than two years of searching for the greatest pizza in Las Vegas, it should be no surprise that I would find it on the strip. What is surprising is that, despite being located in one of Vegas' trendiest casinos, Secret Pizza (if that's really what it's called) does not include the usual mind-blowing wallet smack.

For 26 bucks, you can get a 3 topping pizza (they only have one size by-the-way) that blows away every other za in town. I highly recommend the sausage and the meatball as two of those toppings. Not that hungry? Then just grab a slice or two.

Add 5 bucks for valet parking, take the great glass elevator to the top (just don't press that special button Charlie) and you can be enjoying one of the best slices of pie you've had since they threw you out of NYC.

This place has no signage and is located on the 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan. It's hidden... yet tons of people seem to be able to find this place and devour their pizza. Proof that if you offer something good, people will find you. 

I came here with my friend after watching Rose. Rabbit. Lie. I had one drink there... but it was sooo strong that it made me feel sick and I was in some dire need of some quick comfort food to ease my tummy.

We looked for this place on the signs... none of which says Secret Pizza anywhere... so I looked on my trusted Yelp for clues. Like I said initially,  it's located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel. It's in a corner... but if you spot the pool tables (which are easily visible) the wall of records leading to Secret Pizza is right in front of it. 

The hallway is not too long... but it feels very exclusive\/secret at you have to walk this hallway to get to it. Lol. The pizza place itself is very small with very few seats. My friend and I beat the crowd because we were able to get seats and have no line, well, only 2 people in front of me. After I got my pizza and came back to my friend who was saving seats... the place was packed! Even just standing it was packed!

Anyways, as far as it being just one slice of pizza... the price was okay. I'm used to Costco's $2 slices haha. Here, they have pizza with the red sause (tomatoe) or white sauce. A cheese slice is $4.50, white is $5, or red with toppings is $5.50. I had a red slice with pepperoni,  sausages,  and mushrooms. The pizza was good!! Very tasty and the crust was cripsy. I loved it! A nice warm cheesy, crunchy, savory,  and tasty bite each time. The slices are pretty big... so for $5.50 it wasn't too bad! Of course I ate the whole slice and my stomach was satisfied. So glad we came here and got some pizza to counter the alcohol I was carrying in my stomach. It was the perfect counter to drinking in Vegas. Just beware that the slices are pretty greasy... so if you're worried about that, use napkins to soak up some before you eat!

Service here was nothing special. Not good, not bad. Seating is bar style on 2 walls... but there's only like 5 chairs I saw? Definitely not enough for everyone to sit... the rest of your party will have to stand... ot take it out to the pool table area where there are a few couches around. Chili and permeasean cheese are out at the bar area along with napkins. They also have a pinball machine here! I'm not sure if it works as I didnt notice anyone playing it.

This place is open all nigh, and late night too. So it's perfect after a night out in Vegas of drinking, dancing, partying.

Went for dinner w\/ a friend, Angelica, and had some bomb diggity pizza. 

This type of pizza may institute the fork and knife method but stay away from it! Food always tastes better when eating with your hands. 

Be careful though of the ""The Cheese is so Hot and will burn the Roof of your Mouth"" monster when biting into that first slice of freshly baked pizza. Then also watch out for the avalanche of cheese that may ensue afterwards. 

If you don't listen to me and hear a ""I told you so"" in the back of your mind after that hot gooey cheese that burned you, that PBR should help cool it down.

My friends and I waited in line, and they managed to order their pizzas. I was behind them, and the guy taking orders\/making pizza looked me over and went on to the next person. I figured I'd have my order taken at the cashier, but no dice. When I got to the cashier, she asked me what I'd ordered, and when I told her nothing yet, she looked to the pizza guy. Dude had the gall to say I'd cut in line? Maybe he missed the fact that a friend of mine ahead of me handed me a water bottle as they were paying for their order. Not sure what his deal was, but my business is better spent elsewhere. Took them about an hour to make the pizzas, too- way too long for anyone impatiently waiting to get their grub on.

But that's not the point. I don't mind dropping a few hundred bucks on an amazing experience in Vegas, but what fell short for me was the customer service here. 

When you first walk in 9 times out of 10 you'll be stopped in your tracks due to the line that is down the walk way and could possibly be out the entrance all together. Line moves fairly quick and if you're ordering slices you get the right away but if you're ordering a whole pizza it could take 45 minutes or so. They have many diff options to choose from like toppings or even red or white sauce. 

We ordered a pizza and it took about 30-40 minutes.  
Pizza was decent size and came out piping hot and had a decent amount of cheese and topping but honestly for the price of $32 for a whole pizza I figured it would be waaaay better.

So reason I will never come back here?  And I wouldn't recommend anyone I know to come back here? Well employees and staff are beyond rude. I understand that they probably deal with a lot of customers who are drunk and or rude but come on, you chose to work in customer service and worse you chose to work in Vegas where you're going to come up against people like that all the time. Nonetheless doesn't give employees a right to be rude to everyone because they know that people are going to come and eat here regardless. One employee in particular named Steven was beyond rude and didn't care that he was openly rude to customers. Makes me wonder if management knows and if they even care.

Don't come here waste your time in line and money. Better to go elsewhere and be treated with respect.",21,14,17

I been to chicago, miami, new york...  and a bunch of other places.  I got a decent basis for judging pizza. So everytime i go any where i order a pepperoni and then whatever special...

now...  The pizza was average.  The cheeses were not high grade and you can tell because a high quality cheese will melt evenly and you won't see too much of a cut between the oil and the cheese.  This pizza had pockets of oil... so instantly i knew it was a midgrade cheese.

In new york, (which doesn't have the best pizza by the way but are top contenders) they throw chunks of mozarella...  they look like little mcnuggest and boom...  you get this sexy cheese spread.  And no pockets of oil...  

The sauce wasn't knock your socks off good...  but it was decent.  Not too sweet. a little on the thin side for me...

But it was a decent slice.  What killed it is the price.  I paid for two slices and a can of orange crush 15 bucks.  I was like... for serious?

a.) it really keeps to its mysterious charm.
There's no sign, just a dark hallway that you would pass and wouldn't even know it was there if you weren't looking for it on purpose.

b.) Its so unexpected.
You'd never think you'd find a place that serves pizza for $4.50 a slice in the trendy and posh Cosmopolitan hotel.  There is nothing fancy about this place - they serve your pizza on paper plates and soda in a red dixie cup!  They also have beer.

c.) The pizza is SO DANG good!
Good in a ""Man I'm so drunk and I hella want a pizza right now"" way as well as when you're sober.  The thin crust is perfectly crispy and you know that its really good pizza when it stays that way even if its been sitting out on the warmers and reheated for you.  The WHITE pizza is has no red sauce but olive oil instead, and has a great combo of parmesan, mozzarella and dollops of ricotta.  Super flavorful and super cheesy.

Pricey? Yes. Worth it. YES! A large pie will run you about $20.

They should be constantly making pizzas for the customers wanting just a slice.  When we finally got up to the front, they only had a pepperoni & mushroom pizza.

We found a seat near the pool table and each took a bite.  DELISH!  Crust has a good chew, good flavor in the sauce and the cheese is fresh.  Pepperoni and mushrooms were tasty too. My husband even ate the whole thing! The slice was definitely a good size and I was full after just one.

Once you walk through the hallway lines with record covers, you'll see this little quaint slice of heaven.  The place always has a line, there's a few stools to sit on in the back and a few vintage arcade games for your pleasure.  What I really like is their wall of money by the paying station.  The top row is lines with $100 bills.  Bawlllerrrrr!  LOL.

When it's your turn, choose the pizza they have and they'll reheat the already cooked slice.  Usually runs about 6-8 dollars depending on the type of pizza.  I was with a group of 4 peeps.  We all the Chicago style pizza square with sun-dried tomatoes on top with 4 PBR drafts.  Total came to about $50 which was a little steep, but soooo worth it!  The pizza was full of cheesy goodness and the bottom of the crust was super crispy.  Every bite was amazing and it really filled us up!  Beer was crisp and very cold.  Perfect Sunday meal.

The fanciest pizza I've ever tasted was anything of the ordinary from the countless pizza parlours of Italy. To me, margherita pizzas were a real treat, gently wrapped in parchment paper at 2€ a slice, and an additional 1,50€ for sea salted chips. 

However, there is something different about Secret Pizza. You can find this little gem on the third floor between the corners at the Cosmopolitan. Purchased by the slice or by whole, the open face kitchen allows you to choose your slice of heaven from white pizzas to red pizzas. When I first tasted Secret Pizza my friends purchased whole pies of everything pizza and a pepperoni pizza, and even at 2am, they were outstanding & melty, just the way I like my cheesy pies. On my last trip here I tried the white ricotta + sausage pizza which is now my only preference. Full of flavour with just the right strength of spice & herbs, this pizza was a winner on my taste buds. 

Keep in mind that the line to Secret Pizza is absurd; I think the best option is to telephone in your whole pie only.

The only secretive part about this place is that it does not fancy any signs around it so you have to walk around to see this hallway. Once you see a hallway with pictures, you know it's for this place. Not only that, you can smell the pizza fuming in the hallway.

The pizza slices are large. The slices are heated in the oven before serving you. The pizza isn't overly salted like domino's or pizza hut. It has a crispy crust. It does its job. Now, there is limited seating so be prepared to eat standing up or taking back to the room.

There are a lot of people coming in and out at all different times of the day so there will be times that it is crowded to even stand as people are wild when drunk. Besides that, this place has decent pizza with late night times and the grease is increased for hangover help.

If you're staying at the Cosmopolitan, then this is a good late night choice.",0,0,0

Personally I thought the pizza was alright. I mean its great when your drunk. But sober, mehhhhh.

I went here twice after going out and each time they only had 2 choices of pizza =\/

We came here with Stephen's mom and each got a slice of something different. We wanted 3 diet cokes, and the guy suggested getting a 2-liter of diet coke for $6.50 versus 3 separate cup of cokes for $4 each.  Wow, what a nice guy!  He could have easily had a $12 sale on drinks, but saved us $5.50.

So 3 slices plus a 2-liter came to $22.  We took our slices down the hall and watch snotty 12 year olds attempt to play billiards.

They have an assorted variety to choose from, but my favorite is their white pizza, which is filled with garlic, cheese, and olive oil. Perfect after a long night of drunken fun!",0,0,0

Located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo, its long corridor makes for a great experience to bump into those who had too much to drink.  First class entertainment.

Then at the end of the tunnel, you are awarded with the best pizza in Vegas.  Definitely a place to try.",3,1,0

It's expensive but you are eating at Cosmo, not Costco lol.  The pizza is above average but it's not super-mega out of this world awesome.

If you are getting late night eats then expect a long wait (both in line and while they make it).  I think we waited in line for 25 minutes and another 20 minutes for them to make it.  

Seating is limited so you might find yourself eating in the lobby just outside (especially if you are rolling w\/ a large group).",2,2,1

While the experience and food wasn't terrible, it failed to live up to the expectations. My friend from New York praised their ""authentic New York taste,"" but for me, it was overall just disappointing. Nothing stood out; not their crust, their sauce, their cheese, or their toppings. The line moves terribly slow and the price is way too high. As many Yelpers have mentioned before, get into larger groups and order an entire pie. It's a great way to make new gambling buddies in LV.",3,0,0

Our friend had told us about the ""Secret Pizza"" that was somewhere inside the Cosmo, and with that our search began.

It honestly wasn't that hard to find and there wasn't much of a line when we went but right after, a huge group came in. PERFECT TIMING. The pizza is fairly thin and mad greasy, get those napkins ready! I had the pepperoni and sausage pizza and it was a solid piece of pizza. Best I've ever had? Nah, brah. It was still pretty good and wouldn't mind venturing there again in a drunken stupor.",2,1,1

Yes, that's right, Yelperati, you got it wrong.  Normally, I wouldn't be so confident saying so in the face of nearly 3,000 prior reviewers, but due to the fact that it's in Vegas, and it's aimed at the post-midnight and pre-dawn crowd, I feel pretty safe in bringing this to light.  

I tried the pepperoni and sausage, meat lovers, and cheese varieties.  Thin, greasy slices are North-Dakota-flat on flavor (sorry North Dakota, you didn't deserve that).  The crust is tough, chewy and literally difficult to swallow.  It's extremely difficult to bite through; think ""beef jerky"" or ""inedible leather"".  On top of that, it tastes like chewy cardboard with cheap, flavorless cheese and meat on top.  

I've only had one pizza in my life that I thought was worse than this, and I involuntarily regurgitated that one a few hours later.  Yes, it's suitable for late-night, greasy sustenance, but let's not lie to ourselves: this is NO 4- or 5-star joint.  Not even a 3.  I refuse to believe anyone in their right, non-inebriated mind provides this ""Secret"" more than a 2, and even then, it would have to be about the magical journey of finding it.  For me, it's a sure-fire 1-star due to the horrible food, ridiculous gimmick, and worse value.",9,9,2

Well, I guess I'll have to wait over 30 minutes in line at 3am for these $5 slices. Verdict? Wrong. Crust? Falls apart when you try the Brooklyn fold, and it doesn't have any flavor. Sauce? Can't taste the fresh tomatoes. Cheese? This part is pretty spot-on. Service? Asked for two regulars and a sausage. Got a pepperoni and a regular. What? Their sausage is of great quality, but that's about all I can say. Slices aren't large like Brooklyn ones, and this isn't a secret anymore. Is it decent West Coast za? Definitely. Is it the ""perfect NY slice""? Not even close. Tony's does it better, as does Slice of New York in San Jose. Moving on. Next.",0,0,0

We found it on the 3rd floor down a long hallway. I believe there are maybe 7 seats and 3 video games in this small place. We were able to stand at a counter. We must have arrived at a slow time because there wasn't a line and fresh slices were coming out of the oven. 

The pizza. I'm not a huge fan of cheesy pizza. But I do appreciate a good New York style. I had a meat lovers slice and a slice with salami and banana peppers. Both were excellent. The sauce wasn't bland but not overpowering either. 

I definitely enjoyed my slices and the uniqueness of Secret Pizza. Also loved the menu - ""no ranch"" - which is a makes me laugh. I know ranch dressing is quite controversial.",1,1,1
