Smaller salad bar with fewer options. Pao de queijo (cheesebread) is not fresh and sits in a heated serving bin. Same thing with the fried plantains. The caipirihna drink needs to be sweeter. I've been to Rio so I know what a caipirihna should taste like.
Meats just not as tender and of the quality that you can find elsewhere. They are just a tad below par on many details of the food. For locals it's not worth the hassle of hauling yourself to the Miracle Mile Shops.",1,0,0

We went with the Meat ridizio for 2 for our dinner. That's unlimited servings of different types of meats. When I saw unlimited... They had me sold. It also comes with a salad and side bar to add to your meal as you eat with a good amount of choices, but once they start coming around with the meats, you'll forget the side bar exist. My two favorite meats they serve are the sirloin and sausage. All of them were good though, ever the lamb which I don't even eat. They will make your plate full, so make sure you come with an empty stomach. The sangria is also a good choice to have as a drink. 

The service was excellent. Our waiter stayed on top of everything and the servers of the meat will make sure to find you immediately when you're wanting more. 

I was very impressed. I give 5 stars all across the board. You'll be plenty full and satisfied when leaving here. Pampas is definitely in the rotation to make a visit to every time I make a trip to Las Vegas.",2,2,1

Walking in, we were greeted right away, and sat right away. After being seated, we had to wait about 15 minutes until we were even looked at by anyone. Finally, we were approached by our waiter, who said he would be with us in a few minutes. What?! The fifteen minute wait wasn't bad enough? 

When he finally came bakc ,we ordered our drinks. We all got alcoholic drinks - and I also asked for some tap water to go alone with my meal. Upon returning, he brought back water in a glass bottle. Now, I've been to restaurants before, where they put their tap water in glass bottles to make it look more fancy - so I thought that's what this restaurant did too. WRONG. 

After seeing a couple tables next to us, with just regular cups of water, we flagged down our waiter to ask if this was the TAP water we had asked for. He said no, and that they charged for each bottle. We asked how much it was for each bottle, and he said he didn't know and would go find out. There were two things wrong with this situation:
     1. How the hell do you not know how much a bottle of water costs? As a server, you should know your menu inside and out. 
      2. It took him fifteen minutes to get back to us with a price, which meant we went fifteen minutes without anything to drink, because we had all finished our drinks as well as the water. 

0 stars for service. 

As for the food, bleh. Everything was salty and overcooked. They came by our table at least fifteen times with sausage, but we were only offered their beef items a few times. As for their salad bar, they had a lot of choices, but none of them really worth while. I will say that their chimichurri sauce was pretty good. Actually, it was the highlight of the meal. It was the only thing that was actually good. 

I would never set foot in this place again. HORRIBLE service, and sub par food. You are better off going to Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil.",4,1,0

Even with a reservation, we had to wait a while (about 30 min), it's a popular spot.

You are seated, a friendly waiter greets you and takes drink orders, then you're sent to the serve yourself hot\/cold food bar. This includes sides such as rice, grilled squash, salad, and my ultimate favorite part of the whole night.... (Gluten free) Brazilian cheese bread aka Pao de Queijo... Oh my goodness is this bread amazing. It may have been the highlight of my entire trip to Vegas!

Our travelzoo deal included a bottle of house wine, it was a Cabernet Sauvignon, and it was nothing special- a CA cab that was metallic and pretty cheap tasting. This wasn't even offered by the glass on their wine menu, so I know it was a cheap offering just for the deal we had.

Then came the meats...  I believe there were 12 that came around? Chicken thighs, bacon wrapped filet mignon, sausages, lamb, pork, it seemed unending. We had to turn down most of the meat they offered because I was so full from the sides. I had the idea in mind that they would be bringing a huge slab of meat around, and that it wouldn't be fresh. This is not the case, they cook a fresh item then walk around with it once until it is gone, then bring something else fresh a few minutes later. 

There is a sign to put on your table, a wooden sign with a green side (bring more food) and a red side (we're taking a break\/done right now), but even when we had it on red they still didn't skip our table just in case we wanted the new meat.

There were several items available at the salad bar.  Most items that I had were ok.  

Our lunch came with shrimp and they were horrible.  I have never received shrimp as overcooked as these were.  To the touch they were very pasty and they tasted very dry.  We did not finish the shrimp.

Having visited other Brazillian steak houses in the past, we were disappointed with the selection of meats that were available.  The roasted pineapple was presented multiple times while the steaks only came around once.  They also served ham, which we thought was funny as it didn't seem anything more than what you can buy at the supermarket.

It included cheese rolls (even though just brought out, I could play baseball with them), mashed potatoes that I could re-stucco my house with, flavorless mozzarella balls, and house dressing so thick it wouldn't slide off the spoon. So sometime in the 10 minutes or so we were up at the salad bar, a plate of mystery fish, salmon, shrimp, and mussels was dropped off at our table. There was 10 shells in the mussel plate, of which 8 were empty. My 2 mussels were not half bad though. The shrimp was still fully shelled including legs, and overcooked making them too tough to enjoy, was like eating rubber. Mystery fish was cold after sitting there so we didn't try it at all. We did try 11 of their meats, but we had to ask for them each time. They regularly brought around the cheaper meats (chicken and pork), but we had to specifically ask for the picanha (the Brazilian grills signature meat) garlic steak, filet wrapped in bacon, etc. The chicken was passable, and the pork sausage was rather good (but I don't come to a Brazilian steak restaurant for its sausage) The best food of the night was definitely the picanha, but it was no where near the best I've had in Vegas. The service was another part of the night that was sub par. Our drinks were constantly empty and we would have to ask twice for things like sugar. We'd ask for certain meats and the waiters would just forget about us, and we'd have to ask 2-3 more waiters to get things to happen. We sat for almost 30 minutes waiting for picanha before we gave up for the night. The wait staff seemed confused as well. They brought special ordered food to our table we didn't order, and we saw them actually placing people's orders on empty tables and the waiters coming back 10-15 mins later and giving the food to the right person. Overall this place was horrible. Even with $50 off our $116 meal I felt like I was ripped off. If you're looking for a nice classy Brazilian all you can eat steak place, check out Via Brasil. We've been there probably 20-30 times, and it's great every time.",0,0,0

The bathrooms were the most disgusting I'd ever seen. The only difference between it and a gas station bathroom was the smell wasn't as bad. Trash all over the floor, broken bbathroom door locks, marred and leaning stall walls, and there was a nice young lady using one of the sinks to take a hoe bath.

Our waitress was courteous but inattentive. The food was mediocre. Portions were small because of the special menu but they still listed the full price of the meal on our bill...$35!!!! if you don't order a $3.50 soft drink, you'll get charged $1 per person for tap water they've brought out in a pretty bottle.

The salad and sides bar was probably nice earlier in the day but buy the time we arrived around 10pm, it was picked over, spilling over, and neglected.

I brought all of this to the managers attention and I swear I could see the words going in one ear and falling out the other.

Chicken, all cuts of beef, and a pineapple.  Meat lovers should rejoice at this location.  Should.  (more on that later) The wait was incredibly fast, but that's because we had reservations.

The atmosphere is fine. Mood lighting throughout, unless you had ""outdoor"" seating, The restaurant is nicely setup.  They had a buffet tucked in the corner with hot foods and cold salads.  Waiters walked everywhere carrying large slices of meat.

We order the two dishes, their salmon and rib eye.   I have to say their salmon sauce is amazing, it was sweet, tangy and a touch of sour. However, the salmon itself is crap. The meat itself was tasteless and dry.   Its as if their supplier picked the lowest quality fish available and gave it this restaurant.   Sure, Pampas tried (and did a fine job of) masking the tasteless fish with a wonderful sauce.   But that farmed, previously frozen salmon meat is still crap.  
 
Their Rib Eye was overcooked (and a tad crunchy)on the outside. But medium rare on the inside.  The menu may brag about their sea salt rubbed, seasoned beef.  I just taste salt.  As in, they may have overdid the salt.

The salad bar is a free-for-all. Lots of people crowded in, with all kinds of options.  I don't know where the lines started, or ended.   (Or maybe it was just our timing.)

 Their soups was fine.  Salads are, well, salads.  Spinach, pastas, artichokes, asparagus.    The salad bar offers a good number of choices.   I really can't say bad things about their selection.  But then again, I can't say good things either.

We made reservations and were promptly seated within 10 minutes. The salad bar is amazing. Theres so much selection, but just the right amount. Theres a little something for everyone ! Soup, mashed potatoes, grilled veggies, salads, breads, and even some pasta and rice. 

Onto the meats, the bbq pork was sensational. Well done, yet moist and tender, just the right amount of seasoning and glaze. It was amazing. Prime rib and scallops were also amazing. Could not get enough of the shrimp ! The chicken and ham were okay, not bad but forgetable. 

The service was great. The cooks slicing the meats were very kind and had great sense of humor. Our waitress was amazing. She came at all the right times, and came by just enough. 

As we were leaving , I asked for the bill, and to my suprise ir was $1.40 , I waved our waitress over thinking this was an error, but it wasnt ! She decided to not charge us for 2 beers and an iced tea because our table was not ready at exactly oue reservation time !

We purchased a Groupon prior to our trip to Vegas and was glad we did as this restaurant is spendy.  I am a bargain shopper, especially when we travel.  We were promptly seated and greeted by our friendly server, Jessica.  She went over how the dinner worked, as we had never been here.  I was pleasantly surprised at the selection on the salad bar; I love vegetables!  They had fresh artichokes, mozzarella, pasta salads, fruit, etc.  My husband was hit and miss on the meat; some was overcooked, but nothing to complain about. 

Having been in the restaurant industry for many years, I can see through the BS that most customers on here have complained about.  It seems as though the restaurant has coupons all over the place, which doesn't always bring in the nicest of clientele.  The more discounts and coupons offered, the more picky and complaining guests you are going to have.  The table next to us complained about something and the manager comped their ENTIRE meal!  From what I observed, nothing was that bad.  That is not how to get repeat, quality customers.  Apologize, fix the error, buy them a round, but for the sake of the server, don't give away the house.  

The best part of our dinner was our server.  Having grown up in WA, Jessica and ourselves had a lot to talk about. Seahawks, Mariners, the crappy rain in Seattle, awesome concerts at the Gorge, you name it.  It is always nice to run into someone who is where you are from when traveling.

We got a discounted rate through Tix4Tonight for $20 per person so it was reasonably priced but we got what we paid for in this case. I would be mad if I paid full price. 

At Pampas, the service was indifferent. We had water refilled once during a 90-minute meal. The reason it was so long was the meat came out so slowly. All of the meat was overcooked. I think I saw one piece of beef that had any pink to it. All the rest of the beef was grey and chewy. The pork was fatty (which I usually appreciate) but in this case even the lumps of fat was not enough to offset the scaly texture of the over cooked pork loin. The only good meat was the bacon wrapped turkey. If all of the meat was as well prepared as the turkey this would have been a much different experience despite the service. The only other skewered item I would recommend is the grilled pineapple. The salad bar was not big nor was the food there mediocre. Finding it was not terribly easy either and certainly not worth the effort.

Third, I ordered the Surf and turf. I am more a meat person than seafood. I cannot recommend the seafood selection it was a bit dry and a bit too healthy. I recommend the meat selection, the tri-tip, and chicken was great. But what really stood out was the turkey sausage, bacon wrapped turkey, pork tenderloin. These were really, really good. It was all you can eat and I was stuffed.

The salad bar, was a bit thin but i was there for meat. So i have no complaints. I am visitng again very soon. I heard during dinner then have 12 types of meat but it was very busy and you had to make reservations. Lunch was great, it was pretty empty and had no problems getting food or drinks.

I hate eating bad food, or bad service. We had no problems what so ever.",2,0,0

Servers were slow to bring quality beef, quicker with cheap sausage or pineapple slices. 

Salad bar was good , but not enough choices to be considered a Brazilian Grille.

When check arrived it was for  6 people instead of 4. I was paying with cash and the server said Thank You, I had to have them fix the bill and ask for change , I am a 15-20&% tip person, but not 40%. She look surprised and returned with the change, also stated I do not know what happened , the discount is applied automatically. Of course this is a lie as each register has to be told their is a discount or coupon and the code for a discount.

The concept is great, ""Carvers"" come out with various meats on a kabob for you to try in an all you can eat, bring it to your table buffet. A salad bar is available to fill you up*AHEM* I mean to offer vegetables and there is a cart that you can order a special drink that they will make in front of you by crushing... stuff(?) together.

Let me set the stage. Six of us joined together to dine out and this was chosen due to a coupon that one couple had. The coupon offered 50% off our dining experience!(Two for one to be exact so you need even numbers) So for $33 we could enjoy meat and shrimp or for $39 we could enjoy the full surf and turf experience. Now, I'm not a mathematician, but I do know a thing or two about math but 50% off of the menu price of $50 doesn't not work out to $39...? Wait? The SAME meal is $29 at lunch? But hey listen, this was our friends anniversary after all, let's stay in the mood... 

Salad bar - Come on, we all know the rules. Don't fill up on the salad! I read that the salad bar is mediocre in previous posts... they were right. A salad bar with no iceberg lettuce... two choices of salad dressing - Italian and something that looked like a mix of Soy sauce and Miso soup. But no worries, I am waiting for the steaks!

BRING ON THE MEAT! The rules of the game were laid out. You get a wooden thingie with red painted on one side and green on the other. Green means ""Bring on the meat!"" and Red means ""Bugger off, I'm full!"" so you rotate it to your desired position. When we started, green definitely meant GO! We were bombarded with ""carver"" after ""carver"" with shrimp, steaks, lamb, chicken with Bacon, scallops... I had to turn my little ""thingie""over to red within 5 minutes. For me, the excitement kind of ended their... The meat was hard to cut with the dull knives provided. You either got rare or overcooked depending on what side of the table the carver started on and the food was ok at best. Recognizing that people like meats cooked a different way, you would think a carver would ask what the preference was... but I suppose they are just carvers, we should count on our server to help... Uhm.. Server?

When we sat down, we hadn't decided on our drinks yet so our server said he would be back.... he forgot to mention that it could be anytime that night... We were well into our food before I could finally wave him down. After ordering and waiting another 20 or so minutes I walked to the bar and grabbed the already waiting drinks and brought them to our table of cheering lighthearted friends. We didn't see our waiter again until the end of our meal... maybe he was disguised as a carver?

Good thing for the drink table travelling around! Two polite girls asked us what we wanted for a special Brazilian drink. Not knowing what they were saying I said surprise us! They took 15 minutes to make 5 drinks. It was a good drink though, and they agreed with me, tipping their tip jar towards us so we could show our satisfaction at this concoction. Wait, we didn't get a chance to try it yet... maybe come back for the tip? No? okay... here you go... 

We were enjoying each others company when a host came up with a camera and mentioned how happy we looked(Maybe she was surprised?) and offered to take our picture for a ""complimentary"" photo. I had been in Vegas long enough to smell a rat and I wasn't shocked when our pictures came out - $30 for the group shot or $20 for the picture of us as couples. Perhaps they saw us coming a long way... they sold two pictures to our friends... My scottish roots came out as I started to clinch my wallet between one hand and my butt-cheek. 

The final bill... okay, I mentioned I wasn't a mathematician right? So I had the surf and turf, My wife had the turf and we shared three drinks between us(We would have drank more had our waiter existed) The other two couples had the same, except add one dessert each. So $39 x 6 plus desert, the added 20% gratuity, drinks maybe $8ea x 9 and two deserts for oh, we'll say $9ea = $435.... wait, what!? Our friends did some math on the other side of the table and decided it best to just pay up and enjpy our night... needless to say, I won't be back. 

Although the concept is good, turf service and mediocre food at surf prices earned this place every bit of the rating I gave.",6,4,1

I've been to a few if this style of dining in other cities and really enjoyed it however this one missed the mark. 

Salad Bar - decent good with some variety 

Meats - most were chewy and lacking flavour with the exception of the lamb. 

Surf- a seafood mixed grill plate. Salmon was mentioned but wasn't on the plate. Grey meat, limp shelled, cold grab. Ok shrimp. 

Pineapple this is what we cave for. It was not the lovely caramelized version I'm used to but charred lukewarm fruit. 

Staff - served by Andreas. (sp?) and he was attentive & courteous. The guys that brought the assorted meats were all pleasant. I am writing thus review while still at Pampa. We are seated near the bar. At the bar are some off duty staff including some that did not work today. I know this because they are drunk and speaking so loudly we can hear their entire conversation....including profanity every fourth word. There is a reason that most places don't allow staff to drink on site.

Basically this place survives because people sometimes like us don't make dinner plans early enough and end up here.

First of all, the manager Terry (or Terri) was super nice, she even told me how groupon worked from merchants' side and let use use it a day before its ""official"" valid date (so keep in mind, you'll need to wait for a day after your groupon purchase to use it per rule).  Anyway, we opted for 19.99 Brazilian bbq lunch for two.  The menu said lunch had 7 meat selection, and dinner would have 10.  Let me count the 7 for you in order of our favorite from most to least: Pork loin; spicy chicken leg, non-spicy chicken leg; beef steak (way too raw); sausage; ham; turkey breast bacon roll.  We saw grilled pineapple too.  

Now you can tell how limited the meat selections really are at least for lunch.  I've been to other Brazilian grilles before and always been amazed by how many different stuff we can try, but for this restaurant it's certainly not the case.  The pork loin was tender enough but lack of seasoning in my personal view, the majority of beef chunk should be rated as rare-medium rare at most, I got a bloody plate after having two slices. However you can certainly ask the food servers for more cooked region (very small region though), they are friendly too.  As for the chicken (they did count non-spicy and spicy as TWO selections of meat), well you normally can't go wrong with bbq chicken, and it's just too common\/ordinary to judge.

I ordered a sirloin medium and got an overcooked end cut that was about 2 oz of thinly sliced burnt meat. When I brought it to the waiter's attention the rude response I got was, ""that is the right amount and that is a medium."" The service was slow, the portions were small, the meat (whether salmon or beef) was mostly flavorless\/lacked seasoning, and in most cases, overcooked. The green beans were squishy and the mashed potatoes were as hard as a rock. The food at the bar was subpar. The Brazilian cheese biscuits were as hard as a rock.

I've never heard of it and when I do an Internet search nothing comes up about this mandatory charge except for complaints about this place charging for it.

The lunch menu and dinner menu were no different except for the price. There was a $20.00 difference, so to beat the dinner traffic and save some money we reached the restaurant hidden in Planet Hollywood right before lunch ended at 4pm. Now mind you this was on a Monday, not a day that fell on a holiday or any special discount days. Just a regular Monday. So we reached the hostess and was relieved there was only a few people there. There is inside seating and somewhat of a patio area still inside the mall area. We planned on ordering the Surf and Turf Rodizio, which is the all you can eat brazillian meats, seafood and with the salad bar. But for some reason this hostess decides to seat us all the way in the backside of the patio and is super far from the salad bar. I look and see there is no one seated at all inside near the salad bar. The last thing I wanted to do was walk 2 miles for the salad bar. So I ask nicely, ""Can we get seats near the salad bar inside""? She lies and says ""We don't have anything available"".. WTH really? This is my one pet peeve when it comes to restaurants. I hate lying employees. It may have been my hunger getting the best of me but this was not the case. They wanted the restaurant to look like it was busy but screw the facade. I was trying to get my grub on. So we wait for the meat to come around to our table and it seems like a lifetime. The waitress we had was Lizette and she was attentive and courteous. Which is not what I could say for other waitresses who look like they were hating life. The meat finally comes around and my husband gives the sirloin and tri tip the thumbs up. They had the pork which was tough and unedible. The seafood was tasty but the mussels and salmon were bland. The white fish and shrimp were better.They provide you with very small portions for a place that serves all you can eat. More like all we can try.  The salad bar didn't dazzle but it made for fillers for the meat. I recommend the cheese bread. We had no problems with our service going forward but I only made one trip to the salad bar because for me it wasn't worth going back multiple times because they sat us near state lines. I waited for the sausages but by the time they came around we were already full. But as I contemplated the tip at the end of our meal, I decided on the bare minimum of 15%. I also cashed in on our 1 year old restaurant.com certificate (never expires). It will be a while before we go back but not without my running shoes for the salad bar trips of course.",2,0,0

OK, not really, but you have be real careful not to overeat and make yourself sick. I've only been to one other Brazilian BBQ in San Diego and I thought it was definitely better (though it was also $10-$20 more expensive). 

The lunch menu has only 7 meats compared to 11 (I think) for dinner. At lunch time, the meats were pretty fresh and none were overcooked. I didn't try the seafood so I can't say if its any good. If there's insufficient turnover, I could easily see how some of the other diners experienced overcooked or dried out meats. 

The BBQ Chicken and Spicy Chicken were both great and normally, I don't really care for chicken. I could do without the bacon-wrapped turkey, but I've never been a fan of bacon-wrapped anything. Just give me the bacon. 

I will say the salad bar is a bit on the ""light"" side. I've been to a similar place in San Diego ($50\/person for dinner) and the bar was twice the size. The mozzarella and tomato ""salad"" was OK, but not great. I'd say the deli counter at Von's\/Safeway is better.

We made a 7pm reservation for two and walked up to a long line of about 50 people waiting to check in for their reservation. We finally checked in at about 7:25pm and were told we would have to wait even longer as 6:45pm reservations were still not sat.
I decided this was going to call for a drink and went to the bar to order a couple glasses of wine for my husband and I. Thank goodness two nice guys were about to be done so we ended up taking their seats at the bar so we would not have to wait even longer. 
As we sat there, we noticed every single server, bartender, manager, etc was running around like chickens with their heads cut off. There was one bartender making drinks for the entire 300+ person restaurant. They ran out of clean glasses and ended up serving in plastic cups, quite comical! 
The salad bar was subpar and not authentic Brazilian Churrascaria salad bar like Fogo De Chao. The meat was tough and not flavorful. Even the floors were slippery and felt like they hadn't been cleaned in days. 
Don't bother with this place, they need a complete redo or just to be shutdown before you would want to step foot in this place!",2,1,1

The selection at the salad bar was not really a selection at all. We paid extra to get seafood along with our dinners, but the only thing we sort-of liked was the skewered shrimps. Don't spring for the unlimited seafood and churrascaria,..the seafood is not worth the extra money at all.  Our waiter was non-attentive, we actually had to flag him down to get our check and have him take our payment.

I was hesitant about trying it but after getting to vegas my fiance and I quickly noticed that you can get awesome deal through Tix4Tonight booths located up and down the strip, since we were able to get a good coupon (pretty much by1 get1 free), the coupon cuts the price down by 1\/2 (orig-$43\/cupon $25)

Mind you when we got the tickets the people said that it was a most awesome place to eat and sundays were to do it since their volume is minimal. So we made a reservation for 5pm and promptly were seated when we arrived 15 min early. the waitress we had was such a sweetheart she told us how our coupon worked and what we were in for 11 different meats! There is a yes\/no indicator on ur desk so when the dervers come around with the meat they can see wether or not u want some or not. So we went to the salad bar, im pretty picky when it comes to some things so although there was much variety some things were intresting...to say the least althought the fried bannanas were delish! And the sauted carrotsmmm! 

After we got back to our desks the first person came around with sausage and turkey wrapped in bacon, the bacon was a little salty but good none the less. After that was lamb, i recommend it with the sauce its like a vinagrette delish! After that was tenderloin, roast beef, fliet minon(sp?) One thing I didnt like was the fact that we didnt get the chicken to the very end, they came around 2-3 times with same meat options and we would say no cause we were waiting for the chicken, so finally when we were almost to our limit here came the chicken and it was magnificent! it was like a spicy and you get a whole breast piece. So after we ate, we counted back and noticed we werent offered al the meats but oh well what are you gonna do, gotta leave some for next time i suppose. But I recommend this place just go get a discounted ticket first! Its worth it!

Normally, we go to another Brazilian steakhouse in town, but a friend encouraged us to look at Groupon and this restaurant has seafood included in their line-up of meats. My husband is a big seafood lover so we decided to try it out. We were about 20 minutes late for our reservation as we misjudged traffic on the freeway and didn't realize how much walking we'd have to do to get to the restaurant past all the shops. We were told we'd be seated in a few minutes, but it took about 35 minutes. It was busy and it looked like quite a few people were complaining about the wait. Our assumption is that even if we'd been on time for our reservation, we would not have been seated on time. 

Some seating was in the front of the restaurant so those people had to maneuver through all the people standing to get to the food bar, which contains side items and salad items. Thank goodness we were not seated in the front.  Tables were mostly pushed close together so they could pack as many as they could into the restaurant.  In other words, you got an intimate look at the wait staff's rear ends about 12 inches from your plate when ever they were waiting on tables next to you.  That is a turn-off. To go back and forth to the food bar, you have to maneuver between tables, hopefully when someone isn't coming up the aisle at the same time. Once a male waiter started at the same time I was going the other direction.  Instead of being gentlemanly and letting me go first, he shoved through first.  I found that rather rude, especially since I was also a customer.

The men carrying the meat throughout the restaurant did not stop at every table. In fact, a lot of the meat we didn't even see until we were finished.  They didn't go table to table. They'd wander around and completely zip past us, without even slowing down. Therefore, I'm sure we didn't even try some of the meats. The quality of the meat was very poor. Most of the beef was extremely chewy or gristly. A lot of it, I just left on my plate as I found it inedible.  We buy all of our steaks at Costco and let's just say that the Costco steak that we prep at home is far superior to the discount gristly meat they prepared.  For the seafood, they brought a plate and refilled as necessary. The salmon was good and had some type of teriyaki sauce. There was a white fish, maybe tilapia, that was so-so.  It tasted like something I'd prep at home and I can't cook fish.  The shrimp was disappointing as that is my favorite since I am not a seafood fan. Well, it was cooked, but not peeled. It really cut down on how much we ate as it was too big of an annoyance to peel each one.

The only value of the Groupon was that it included 2 cocktails, which my husband and I don't find necessary and 1 dessert to share, which we frequently don't get anyway  The seafood was supposed to be the added value, but it wasn't anything special and I would not return based on their seafood.

The salad \/ food bar was tasty and I have no complaints there. Our waitress was awesome and we tipped accordingly.

We will not be returning to this restaurant as it really had a discount, low budget restaurant feel. .We were packed in like sardines and the meat quality was like something from IHOP.  This is not acceptable when you're paying about $50 per plate.  On our next date night, we will be going back to our other Brazilian steakhouse which costs the same, but they do not offer discounts.  I prefer to pay full price for quality, flavorful meats with top-notch wait staff.",1,0,0

(I'm 7 months pregnant so didn't think much of it) So I tried to eat the meat they bring around and couldn't eat much. During the middle of the night I woke up to the worse abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. (As well as my poor 2 year old son). We ended up in urgent care and the doctor told us it was more than likely food poisoning. All we had that day was cereal and pb and j sandwiches to work up an appetite for Pampas.

I contacted the manger Mike at Pampas the next day and explained to him what happened. He said he would look into it and give me a call in the morning. He never returned my call, so I called him around 3 pm to see what happened. He acted like he had no idea who I was so explained everything again and made it seem like I was lying. I asked him if I took him my discharge paper work from the urgent care with the diagnosis if he could at least  refund my meal which cost $50 and he said no. So I was out $50 plus my dr visit copays and the copays for our prescriptions. I didn't even get an apology from this man! 

We loved going to Pampas and every time we were in Vegas it was a must! Now I'm so disappointed in the customer service that we will not be going back.

My boss married a Brazilian woman and lived in Brazil for four years, and I've had the good pleasure of eating at places they've recommended (and with him on several occasions).  They KNOW Brazilian churrascarias.

This place is for posers.  

Their salad bar contained smoked salmon with cucumbers, Greek olive and feta salad, and caprese salad.  I love these things, but I neither want nor expect them at a Brazilian restaurant.  I expect BRAZILIAN food.

They had 3 selections of beef.
They had roast turkey and sausage.
They had 1 pork selection.
That was it.  And it was mostly overcooked.

No chicken hearts (my fav at Brazilian BBQ joints)

Their dessert menu contained creme brulee, tiramisu, and cheesecake.  Because those were all invented in Brazil.

At least they carried Brazilian liquors and made Brazilian cocktails.  The bartender was pretty helpful and seemed like a nice guy.

The service was terrible, with the picanha coming around only once.  We specifically had to ask another waiter to have the other waiter come over.  Frustrated, we called over the manager.  She was attentive but after airing our grievances (poor service, WTF menu items, and overcooked meats) she primly said, ""Sir, we cater to mainstream tastes.""

In act I even suggested my friend use Pampas for her reception dinner after her wedding dinner coming up this spring (probably 40ppl). 
  Pampas has high quality food (wish they'd stop pre-dressing the Caesar salad though) & good quality meats. When I brought friends from MI here this past Feb we really enjoyed the fun made to order drinks that the lady makes at her cart-going table to table (fyi-2 of the ladies that work there are past Olympian's in Volleyball). 
  We always get great service & very pleasant ... not the case today... from the get go our server ""Kelly"" was rude. She spoke to me in a very condescending tone... kinda like she was annoyed with me. I am one of those people who doesn't like bloody meat. I had asked 3 different Rodizio's if I could get some cooked a little more. Typically this is no problem. I was sitting & waiting & sitting &  waiting (probably 20mins) while everyone else got their mid rare meats. I finally saw the server again & asked her I she could please check on this for me. Instead she went off on me! I saw the people at the next table look over toward our way because of the tone she had used with me. ""Well it takes more than a minute to cook it!"" spoke very sharply & LOUD. I am normally not a drinker & try to stay clear of sodas. Kelly was good at refilling our water & taking away any dirty plates, this I will give her. But she is also very good at being rude to customers. Yes, I had a coupon... I know a guy who's wife works there, she said ""everyone uses coupons there-not a big deal"" If the company didn't want people to use coupons then they wouldn't give them out. It is NOT Kelly's place to judge me for having a coupon! Actually I never mentioned the coupon. When our bill came it was for dinner price (we came while it was still lunch price but ran over into dinner) And it said Wingate on it. I tried to get her attention but couldn't. As the mgr Kate (who is awesome) came by I said ""I believe that I have someone elses  bill as it also had sodas on it"" All of the sudden Kelly emerges & snapped at me that's how it's done when it's THAT coupon... I said ""but I don't have a wingate coupon"" her reply- a sharp ""yes you do, that's what you told me!!!!"" I had never mentioned any coupon at all to Kelly. She walks away clearly irritated at me. I said to Kate that this seriously is not  my bill. It actually would have been cheaper but I'm not trying to rip anyone off. Kate took it to Kelly... Kelly redid it, again for dinner. I said to Kate, we came at lunch time. Kate said she would take care of it. This time Kelly pretty much slams it down in front of me & it now it the same dinner bill but with 3 copies. She walks away without saying a work-her attitude said a lot though. I then go to Nelly the awesome hostess who sat us with the bill. She said ""oh no, you 2 were definitely here before dinner started"" Then Kelly says to me, once again rude as can be... ""I was told by the manager to make it for dinner!!!!!"" which I know was a lie. I did get it fixed to lunch. We tipped on the total bill before the discount. We tipped on the bank card so she would be forced to give the rodezios their share & we tipped about 18%-20% on the pre-discount price. I understand that the meat rodezios might have forgot me. BUT the attitude & rudeness that I received from Kelly was uncalled for.  
  I will go again, I will continue to tell friends about Pampas, I hope that my friend does have her after wedding dinner at Pampas. I will just make certain to request NOT to have Kelly as my server & I will tell my friends to request not to have her as well. 
  I definitely recommend this place, it is yummy & actually a good price for being on the strip. They have coupons & deals online, thru out the casino, on groupon, on restaurant.com. The people who run it realize that it's cheaper to do coupons than it is to pay for commercial time. 
  So my advice to anyone reading this.. go to Pampas, enjoy it, it's great there but request to not have Kelly as your server. You want to enjoy your meal experience... a Brazilian Steak House is an experience. Just don't have Kelly  as your server or your experience will be ruined!

Our table was right outside in one of the major walkways, near the Harmon entrance so we were able to do some people-watching while we enjoyed our Caipirinha (which were made perfectly!) it's kind of like a mojito but I think it has a bit more of a kick.

Our server Nicole was very polite and we asked her for a recommendation as we had never been to this type of Brazilian Grille before. Nicole gave us a great description of the way they work and suggested we try the Surf & Turf ""Rodizio"". It's an all you can eat salad bar, with an endless supply of seafood and a variety of meats that they bring around to your table on these big skewers. The waiters actually carve off pieces for you right at your table so it's pretty entertaining too. There are a variety of skewered meats that include sirloin, pork loin, sausage and a bacon wrapped chicken that was amazing. My favorite was the skewered ham and the shaved pineapple. Really tasty.

Okay so it's a Brazilian Grille..the parade of meats is incredible but their salad bar totally rocks too! Marinated artichokes, roasted peppers, sliced portabello mushrooms, pasta salad with olives and sliced salami, lamb stew, an assortment of rices, mashed potatoes, seasoned chicken, and tons of other soups and traditional salad bar items. My only suggestion is that you have to bring your A game appetite when you go to Pampas because it is all so good.

Even after seeing the red side up, and then being told no thank you..they served  us anyway. Most of our meat was tough. I also watched other customers fighting with the steak knives trying to cut cut their own. While walking thru this cluttered dining room I had to walk without picking my feet up of the floor.

They were all amazing and obviously have become experts with ""working what they have.""

The first impression upon checking in for our reservation-utter confusion.  I'm not quite sure what was wrong with their reservation system, but it was definitely not working properly OR it just sucked.  It seemed that there was some confusion of who to seat first, the folks that were on the walk-in waiting list or the folks that had booked a reservation.  My husband and I had a reservation, but still waited 30 minutes to be sat at a table, and then waited another 15 minutes before being approached by a server.  The manager who was very visible just seemed to be busily walking back and forth but didn't appear to really do anything.

For those who have never had the pleasure of dining at a Brazilian Steakhouse, the way it usually works is there's a salad bar full of side dishes and then waiters come around and carve freshly cooked meats at your table.  When our drink orders were finally taken we approached the salad bar.  Most of the items looked extremely thirsty like it had been sitting out for a while, and this place was super busy!  The lettuce for the salad wasn't wilted but still looked extremely dry.  Mashed potatoes had that yellowish ""skin"" formed on it.  The one form of salami that they had tasted borderline bad.  The cheese plate was all poured together with no care what-so-ever.  The Brazilian cheese rolls which most Brazilian Steakhouses are famous for were dry and tasteless.

When the meat (the whole reason, in my opinion, that you pay almost $50 a person for) finally arrived to the table it was a total disappointment.  The first dish was garlic sirloin.  It was so tough I couldn't cut it into pieces small enough to eat.  My husband's piece was horribly rare and also tough.  The next dish was leg of lamb which is the whole reason I took my husband here.  It literally resembled shoe leather, and like the last dish could barely be cut with a steak knife.

I really really hate to complain while dining at a restaurant especially while on vacation, but this was just a horrible experience that I was about to pay top dollar for.  When our waiter came to check on us, we showed him the state of the meat that we received thus far.  He, of course, apologized profusely and set out to make things right for us.  He got us clean plates and called over some waiters with different cuts of meat one of which said that he saw the leg of lamb we complained about, and agreed that there was no excuse for that.  The new meats were still only fair, to be honest, but at that point, I just wanted out of there.  We paid our full bill and left.  The manager at this point was nowhere to be found, so whether or not anyone told him about our complaints is anyone's guess.

My husband and I have been to this type of restaurant several times in several states.  None of them have had meats of such poor quality, in my opinion.  The whole point of going to a Brazilian Steakhouse is because you want well-prepared meats.  Someone needs to tell whoever is in charge of purchasing the meat in this restaurant to aim a little higher.  My cats eat better food than what was served to us tonight.",5,0,0

I like my meat cooked on the rare side while my husband wants everything well-done. No problems with that for either of us. The Brazilian cut of sirloin, bacon wrapped fillet and the chicken were our favorites. I'd probably pass on the ham next time.

We purchased the Groupon dinner deal for $82 that included the Surf and Turf meal, one dessert, and one hour of unlimited beers, wines, sangrias, and caipirinhas. If it's still available, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing the deal!

LOCATION
Pampas is a restaurant off the beaten path. And what I mean by off the beaten path is that it's located in Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile but you'd have to actively search for it because you won't actually stumble upon it. It's actually hidden behind two table service restaurants whose names I can't remember, but if you know where the Panda Express is then you're near it!

RESERVATIONS \/ SEATING
You can easily make a reservation via phone or by Open Table and I'll always recommend Open Table because it's just another way to rack up rewards points for eating at great restaurants. We made reservations at the last minute (like made a reservation for 2 at 9:30 an hour before the time we requested) and despite us being late we were still accommodated. Granted, it wasn't a very busy night, but I always appreciate when a restaurant can accommodate for us. 

We wanted a more secluded dining area so instead of sitting indoors in the main room or bar area we were seated outside in the corner two top. 

DINING EXPERIENCE
Absolutely phenomenal. Our server Hallie was truly on top of her game and had continuously sent us refills on our alcoholic beverages every time she noticed they were running low\/empty. 

The meal itself was great. The surf and turf meal includes the churrascaria experience where the runners walk to your tables and offer you different cuts of meat but also includes a family style platter of seafood, which includes mussels, orange glazed tilapia, shrimp, and salmon. If you're on a budget, I'd say skip the surf and turf, but since I bought the Groupon deal it was just a wonderful perk of our meal. 

The meats are cooked to medium rare so if you have a sensitive stomach like I do, you can always ask to have the meat cooked medium well or well done and they'll cut a slice for you and cook it inside their kitchen. Keep in mind that it won't come out immediately!

One thing I also liked is that if you have a particular type of meat you're looking for, like top sirloin or filet mignon wrapped bacon, you can always ask your server and he\/she can order it for you! Unlike many churrascarias, this was definitely a great option and I like that they use iPads to place your orders. 

DRINKS
First, water is NOT free! I honestly did not appreciate having to pay $2 for a bottle of water and my server didn't actually tell us that because we assumed it was already included in the meal. Anyways, just a heads up. 

Caipirinhas: they have so many different flavors!! The sweetest is the strawberry and of course the best you'll get is lime. These are very strong in alcohol content and after the third drink, I could definitely feel it... so plan ahead and take a cab or uber here!

Sangrias: WHITE SANGRIA ALL THE WAY. I honestly could not even taste the wine in this at all. It just tasted like fruit juice, which to me is always the mark of a truly great sangria. 

DESSERT
You get to choose between four different types: chocolate mousse, tiramisu cake, flan, and one other dessert I honestly can't remember. 
We chose the tiramisu and it was a perfect finish to a very filling dinner! The cake was light, airy, and had the perfect hint of coffee. 

--
Overall, I would love to return to Pampas based on the wonderful experience my boyfriend and I had. My only gripe is that their meat is very dry and they don't exactly have sauces for them either. For a churrascaria, I find this a bit problematic as meats as your specialty and they are not cooked to well done either. So I hope in the future they can find a way to make their meats juicier so that when I do return I can confidently give them the 5 star rating they deserve.

My main problem was the server. He did an OK job, was very polite but did not do anything above and beyond. At the end of the meal, he made sure to remind us that we need to tip off of the total before our vouchers, and instead of letting me fill out the area for the tip, he asked ""so which option would you like to leave, 15% or 20%?"" In all of my years eating out, I have never encountered this. He knew exactly what he was doing, that in a packed Vegas restaurant I was not going to object and cause a scene, and that was extremely rude of him. After reading about this issue in a previous review on YELP, I see this is a reoccurring issue. I begrudgingly paid the 15% tip, although refilling water twice and taking away two plates hardly earns a 21 dollar tip. I am honestly amazed by the nerve of this waiter to do what he did, and had there not been tables surrounding us, it would've gone down differently.

Like someone else stated, the little hostess was snobby and didn't have much of a customer service mind-set. But as much as I wanted to lose my cool, there was a HUGE plus in my experience, the manager Bob. Bob is a gentleman who knows customer service. And just as he kept his word to us on our visit to Las Vegas, I'm keeping mine to him by writing this review.

Because of my encounter with Bob, who asked that we revisit the restaurant before we departed Vegas, we did. And I assure you it was a much different experience. Both visits, the food was good, but I am a stickler for customer service. Not only did Bob rectify my issues on my first visit, it was obvious that he addressed my concerned prior to visiting again. It was also surprising to see that he was at work again, so obviously he takes a hands-on approach to management and has great work ethic.  The side items were different on each visit, and we even tried some of the other menu items.

I would suggest that you do not go if you are in a rush or if you're starving, the relaxed atmosphere is designed to take your time eating so that you can savor the items as they travel through the dining area. I would recommend the Brazilian bouillabaisse. It was full of flavor and had a wonderful spice. I would go again when I travel back.",0,0,0

Good atmosphere in a group of 8, the only reason they didn't get 5 stars from me is 2 fold:  First, the group on was limited to 1 per table and our group all wanted to sit together (they have to realize most parties travel is bigger groups and if we're going out to eat, we want to sit together)... Now, they did end up letting us all sit together, but that led to the 2nd 'issue', which was they tried to give us one bill at the end of the night w\/ gratuity charged to the retail value of the meal(s) (not the group on prices), not based on our invidual meal receipts.... 

Now, after brining up the issue, they did split our bills according, but the gratuity was still being charged based off the full retail price of the Surf and Turf dinner...

Second, the main room arrangement is really uncomfortable, we were very close to the tables next to us and the servers seemed contracted and tight, made the experience tight and rushed.

Upon arrival the hostess showed us to our table.  The initial service was a little slow but we expected that from the other reviews.  Our waiter appeared and we gave him our 1\/2 price voucher.  He told us how things work, took our drink order and told us we could help ourselves to the salad bar.

I have been to Brazilian Steakhouses in Houston, San Diego, Dallas, Florida and Buenos Aires.  This one follows the typical format.  Large salad bar and then the endless parade of meats.  

Standouts at the salad bar included the salmon which was spicy.  I also liked the plaintains.  

The meat was very good.  Plenty of it.  Servers that knew rare from well done.  Lamb, steak, chicken.  A particular standout was the spicy chicken.  The serving size was very large, moist and perfectly seasoned.  Diners at the table also enjoyed the turkey wrapped in bacon.  It was different and a nice change of pace from the meat.  

The staff was attentive and even brought us additional lamb when requested.  A small complaint was that the filet mignon had a slightly gamey flavor that it shouldn't have had but the picanha was on target.

Also, this style of steakhouse typically uses a lot of salt on their meats and if you are not used to the flavor then it can sometimes get overwhelming.  

Remember.  You do not have to have a slice of every meat or item that is brought to your table.  You can and should be selective.  

The wine list had reasonable values for a restaurant in a hotel casino.  For example, a Kaiken Malbec by the bottle was $35.00. House wine was $30.

Four stars because of the 1\/2 price voucher.  (Total meal cost with two bottles of wine was $48 per person with tip).  Only three if we had to pay full price.",1,0,1

2) They seated us away from the salad bar, instead we sat near the bar area.  The bad thing is that we were away from all the action, so we had to wait to get another slice of meat.  It was literally one slice of meat at a time.

After dinner the bill comes and not only were we charged for the 2 for 1 deal but the bill included a host of other charges (a second 2 for 1 charge amongst other things) that brought the total to nearly $150. The worst part, the $50 coupon we'd given them they'd only applied $37.50 of it.  After fifteen minutes of arguing the legitimacy of the bill and with their logic that somehow $37.50 equals $50 I just paid the bill and left out of frustration.

I'd never experienced Rodizio style Brazilian grill before. They give you this carved wooden tchotzke that has red on one side and green on the other. If you put the red side up, the carvers will come deliver freshly grilled meat (lamb, bacon wrapped chicken, bacon wrapped fillet, etc) to your plate.

I loved the buffet! Highlights were cheesy popovers and fried plantain.

The waitstaff were super busy and it took probably 20 minutes to get seated when they said it would be 10. However, when the waitstaff was at your table you felt their undivided attention.

There was a woman who mixed special Brazilian cocktails at the table and that was fun too!

We got a free dessert of cheesecake for writing a Yelp review and I would not have eaten that again. It was heavy and tasted factory made. I heard the tiramisu was great however!

To start with we made a reservation for two to be seated at a booth.  The hostess was pleasant.  We arrived to a full house with only a half table half booth for two on the outer perimeter of the dinning room next to a wedding party.  We saw two other parties seated next to us assigned a waiter before us so we waived the next person down to be serviced.  The waiter we were assigned was not attentive or detail oriented and apologized for forgetting about us multiple times.  In addition, we had to waive down the meat skewer servers to get food.  By the time they serviced us our side dishes were cold.  The servers that passed us were mostly for the wedding party... I recommend requesting middle dinning area seating because the servers were more attentive there and they received the meat service first.  The meat tri tip was decent, the sirloin was overcooked, the seafood plate (salmon, muscles, shell on shrimp, and halibut was cold by the time it arrived at our table.  The sides are self serve buffet style at the rear of the dinning area.  
This didn't feel like a fine dinning experience or even a great introduction to a Brazilian steakhouse. The service was mediocre, the food quality did not reflect the price, and the ambiance was not romantic.  I constantly had my head on the swivel and had to work to flag people down to get fed.  This type if dining was not for me. I prefer a seamless dining experience.  We only saw our waiter 3 times total.  In the beginning and then after we spoke with the manager and again shortly thereafter to deliver and pickup the check.  
The majority of the meat delivered to our table was discarded due to being overcooked or cold upon arrival.  My date was sick after the meal and we had to end our date night early.  I will not be dining here again an would not recommend this place to anyone.  The best part was the banter with my date making light of a sh!tty first time Brazilian steakhouse dining experience and oh yeah the cocktails were good.",0,2,0

So with so many choices, we were a little disappointed in our choice on Saturday night. 

This was our first experience to the Brazilian steakhouse concept (think Fogo De Chao etc).  The main entree is an endless parade of skewers to your table where the meat, seafood, chicken is taken off the large skewer for you.  

At Pampas, the salad bar and sides were excellent although the area was small in size and thus crowded at times.  The salad bar is a square with no real beginning.  Thus, if it's crowded, jumping in somewhere was difficult. This was a Saturday, in Las Vegas, with a concert at the PH live venue. 

As for the main entree, the steaks were tough.  Really, really tough.  Flavorful, but very hard to chew.  The lamb was good, and the chicken also good.  However folks, the price of this meal is just under $40 pp.  In all, the food quality, although plentiful, was not good enough to warrant the price. 

Also, our waiter emphasized the value of getting a bottle of their house wine and we could take our unfinished portion anywhere in Vegas.  We are experienced travelers, restaurant goers etc and he caught us with our guard down.  We ordered the bottle half-way through our meal, in lieu of a second round of wine by the glass.  We do understand that a reasonably priced bottle is often a better value than wine by the glass, if the table is drinking the same (red v. white).   In this case, we made a mistake because we didn't finish the bottle as we were heading home the next evening.  We knew better but...still.  (It's like making that one extra bet at the casino where that tiny voice says no...but the larger, alcohol influenced part of the brain says go for it...and the result:  not so good!).",2,3,0

I guess you get what you pay for. it was $20 per person for the meat rodizio at lunch and we thought it was worth a try. I've been to about four churrascarias and only two have really left me satisfied. This one was nothing in comparison but was okay. There was not much on the selection of meats.I think the selection was five or six. The salad bar was very weak and was not very appetizing. The feijoada was very thin and runny and should have had more black beans. the meat was also very salty and did not leave a good aftertaste. The food was okay but nothing to rave about.,0,0,0

I have given them more than enough time to correct the mistakes. I was even contacted by Bill, the company's owner or the office of the owner. He apologized for my experiences, but still nothing was different.

For starters, the meats came around so slowly still. This time it was much slower. I thought I was crazy until the 2 tables next to me start complaining also. I don't know what their problem is but it's unacceptable. I ended up eating the same 4 meats over and over. We all waited 10 minutes between servings too.

I then noticed, when a table next to me started to order dessert, that not only my favorite but the only dessert I will eat from this place (the Chocolate Mousse Brownie), wasn't on the display. I asked my server about it and he said that they had taken it off of the menu. I posted a tip about it and a rude supporter of this place (the company's fake Yelp account probably) told me to get my facts straight. (I later called and inquired about the change. I was told that it was still on the menu. I'm not sure what he got out of lying but whatever.)

I walked to the hostess and asked to speak with the manager. The manager came over after about 5 minutes. I told her that it was like my 6th time eating there and the experiences and food are both getting worse. She weirdly listened for a couple minutes and then asked if I wanted a free dessert or drink. I declined both. I wanted her to understand that I wasn't complaining to start trouble or get free stuff. I was complaining because I was truly concerned. She finally offered me a BOGO for my next visit. Little does she know, I will never use it, because I will never go back.

I have officially added this place to my ""Never Again"" list.",3,4,2

We were offered alot of beef but who can a argue with that right? Now the thing about it, is that we were impressed alot more with the salad bar...the roasted vegetables were delish and these cheese biscuits they had were incredible.

If you eat here, get the discounts that you pay $3 per person at Last Minute tickets. It will save you $$$ and that way you won't be disappointed.

Every single thing from the buffet was bland. The meats that were brought to your table are mostly medium rare or rare. So if ur not into bloody meats stay away from here. The only meat that was good was the tri-tip.

They also have a very good salad bar that has yummy fried bananas. They just melt in your mouth. It's not that expensive when you compare it to the Pampas that is in Los Angeles. In LA they charge you per pound of food that you purchase. So it easily could add up to $20 per meal. At least in Vegas it's all you can eat.,3,1,2

Also, it came with small potatoes and a meager portion of eggs. I really wanted only egg whites but they wanted to upcharge me 1.99 if I did so.

Reviews on Yelp are mixed about this place but after trying them out, I now know where they stand: 2.5 stars. Although i'm leaning towards just 2 because I left unhappy.

Seating and start were a little impressive as the hostess and our waiter Philippe were awesome. The salad bar and hot side dishes are located all the way to the back of the restaurant, like all the way at the end. 
The cheese bread was dry and hard, the veggies are overcooked, the pasta was tasteless. The rest of the stuff though were good like the mashed potato, mushrooms, chicken tortilla soup, plantains, and salad bar. Our waiter brought us the surf plate with a small bowl of mussels (terrible), shrimps (the only thing I ate), salmon (with sweet sauce and over cooked) and 2 matchbox sized pieces of tilapia which are nice and tender. I had a feeling that they were pushing for the customers to eat plates of the surf so as not to consume much of the meat. 

So, we had our little ""sign"" card turn up green for like 12 minutes, but no meat was coming out of the kitchen. My hubby and I were literally looking at each other waiting for the meat cause we don't want to get filled up with the carbs. There was a very little choice of meats during lunch, I counted 5: picanha, sirloin, bacon-wrapped chicken, pork and sausage. I don't really mind the small selection as long as the quality is good. I only asked for the picanha and sausage because the steak was almost on the rare side, no part was at least medium, an ounce of blood was oozing from a piece of meat placed on the service plate, it was gross. The gaucho said he'll get me one that is more cooked but he never came back with the piece he promised. OMG, the picanha was such a big disappointment, it was so dry, tough and lacking in flavor. The sausage was the best-tasting of them all but I still won't order that in a restaurant. I tasted my hubby's chicken and it was not good either, but at least was tender. The last thing the gauchos were serving is pineapple which is a disappointment because it's supposed to be grilled, but these were not, they were just warm and looked pale and sad. 

The only saving grace was the cheesecake which was actually good. Our server still received a great tip because he was great and attentive, thus the extra star, otherwise, this business only deserves 1.",6,5,2

Last night we went for our anniversary and had a good time. They either took a lot of the cold salad bar out, or they never refilled it because a good amount of it stayed empty the whole time which I was bummed about because all the things I liked, weren't there. The meats and seafood that they walk around with are always delicious. The desserts are too. If you like sangria, the white one is my favorite drink they have. It is pretty pricey to eat here, but they always have a Groupon. That's the only way we can afford it and now they have unlimited alcohol for an hour added to the groupon, which was nice.

On the other hand, the service was awful.  I know that's a thing in tourist towns like Vegas and New Orleans in general.  But, even compared to other places in town, the service is bad.  Not so much from the guys bringing the skewers of meat.  How can you not like those guys?  They show up with a smile and food?

But the main waiter seemed completely disinterested.  He tried to sell us a bottle of wine for $30 with his strong recommendation, and once we declined I don't think I saw him again for an hour.  We had to ask the manager to get our drinks refilled.  We eventually complained about having to wait for the bill.  We were offered free dessert--and then charged for it until we complained.  

And while the manager apologized for the poor service, never once did the waiter mention it or offer an explanation.  They were kind of busy, but not slammed by any means.  I swear, he just seemed irked that we didn't buy the bottle of wine.

There are other places in town offering the same basic deal (Texas de Brazil, for one) and the service was better and the overall class was a step up.

Again, there was nothing wrong with the food--it was priced similar to the competition and very good.  It was just the attitude of the people working there.",1,0,0

We celebrated my brother in-law's birthday here last week & had a horrible time. First, our waiter was very impatient to get everybody's drink order. He had a huge attitude with several guests as they were going back & forth asking questions about cocktails. But after everyone was finished ordering (a table of about 15) we went to the salad bar to start. The salad bar had some hot items and a good variety of appetizer-esque dishes. 
Cut to about 30 minutes later when our drinks finally arrived... AWFUL! Didn't even bother drinking the nasty cocktail that was served. Good thing we didn't want anything else because our waiter NEVER RETURNED TO THE TABLE!!!!!!

While the majority of us went with the Surf & Turf a member of our party had ordered a simply medium rare fillet mignon with a potato side which took OVER AN HOUR to arrive. By which time we were ready to pack our bags so we got it boxed to go & our friend left without eating a thing.

This review has nothing to do with the food. We ended up cancelling our order and leaving this place because of the poor offensive service. 

Dear management,



I took my family of 9 this past Sunday to your restaurant for the first time. None of us have ever been to Pampas and none of us have ever gone to a Brazilian steak house. We heard about Brazilian steak houses and how they work but for our first experience at Pampas it made us never want to try Pamas or any other Brazilian restaurant.  We did not get to eat the food mainly because of the service. 



We waited 25 minutes to be seated and that's expected but then we waited another 15 to 20 minutes for anyone to even come to take out drink orders. We were served water a few minutes after being sat and that was fine but when my sister in law asked for straws, the woman that served the water answered impolitely and then brought back a handful of bar straws (after I had just watched her handling a tab) those straws had no paper or covering on them aside from us being uneasy and most of us not wanting to even drink from those straws because someone else has already touched them, the table was dirty with dried crusted food and one of the tables was loose from the top of the table where the food is placed. Usually a table gets lose from the legs. 



After this, someone finally came to take our orders. she explained the 2 big options and them proceeded to ask if we wanted the option with sea food or the option with only meat. We were all confused because we were given menus with several other options but she was only giving us 2 options. After disputing this with her and expressing our confusion she told us the reason why she 'suggested"" only those 2 options was because if we try to share we would get charged. This is understandable but she then proceeded to tell us that we were being watched by cameras and  that whom ever was watching us will have her charge for an additional meal if we are ""caught"" sharing. Mind you, One person on the table was deathly allergic to sea food and is also a vegetarian so this person was going to order from the buffet. We had 3 children on the table, one whom does not eat sea and none of these 3 kids would have to even order a 30 dollar all you can eat meal because....they are kids and kids don't eat that much and finally another person on the table does not eat red meat. 



This waitress pushed a 2 options that only 3 people on this table would have\/wanted to order and then offended the entire table by telling us we were being watched so ""no sharing"" as if we were a class of 10 year olds. After she took our orders she let us know that there was going to be a one dollar charge for the waters we received. We did not ask for water. It was served to us without her asking. 



After she left, we all looked at each other and decided to leave. I canceled the order with the waitress. She insisted she had already put in our drink orders but by this time we were all offended. I did not tell her the reason because it was just to much. We just wanted to get out of there. This was our Fathers day for our dad. He always wanted to try eating at a Churrascaria but now he feels he will never go to one because of this experience. 



Most of us know how buffets and brunches work. You pay per person. We went in knowing that this place would work the same way (from what we heard how a Brazilian steak house works). We had no intentions of ""cheating"" and only ordering one big 30 dollar all you can eat meat and sea food. We are not cheap and we are not crooks but according to your waitress and the comments she made about us being watched I guess we look like the type that would do such a thing. Better choice of words would go a long way in a case like this.",7,1,1

We arrived around 9:30p and waited briefly to be seated because they only had 2 sections that they were seating.  After about 15 minutes of waiting and no greeting from anyone, the waiter for our section greets the last table that had just been seated to take their orders.  Really??  Aware of our displeasure, the manager approaches and apologizes, introducing our server, Marcio (the same server who was just at the previously mentioned table), ""who will take good care of you.""

After giving Marcio our order for the Meat Rodizio, he tells us to start with the salad bar area.  (We wouldn't see Marcio again for a very long time.)  There is absolutely nothing notable about on the salad bar, nothing that looks tempting, or overly fresh.  Everything is just alright.  We return to our table to find the meat gaucho scene bleak.  Over the next 20 minutes we would be offered 3 things: fresh pineapple, sirloin, and ham.  Really??  I've been to Brazilian Churrascarias before and I've never seen so little action.

Enter the scene Jeremy, our savior, who immediately jumps into action.  He asks what meats we have tried and would like to try. We tell him that we have only had 3 things, to which he says, ""I'm gonna go make a note on the board for you, so we can get you guys a taste of everything.""  Thank you sweet baby Jesus!  Jeremy opens the flood gates, and just like that meat starts flowing into our room.  For the rest of the night Jeremy would be the only person keeping an eye on our glasses, making sure we got food and beverage refills.  Thank you Jeremy!

Food quality is highly inconsistent, ranging anywhere from a (-3) to 4.  The first piece of picanha we tried was more dehydrated, shriveled, and overcooked than a slice of beef jerky.  Once we asked for rare they did step it up and deliver a tasty piece that I would rate at a 4.  Their chicken legs had no flavor, pork loin was dull.  The good: bacon wrapped turkey, picanha (after adjustment), lamb (inconsistent, but had 1 good piece), and tri-tip (shocking because I normally don't care that much for it, but very flavorful & juicy).

Ok, we're donzo.  Check please.  Marcio!  There you are!  We were certain that he had gone home or something.  I really hope that they split tips there because our ""would be server"" gave us absolutely no face time.  

At most Churrascarias the gauchos are personable and communicative.  There is a total disconnect here.

Pros -
Ok price if you get groupon, restaurant.com, or other ""deals""
Very clean, great location if you're at Planet Hollywood
Decent food selection

Cons - 

Worst meat cuts of all Brazilian steakhouses I've ever experienced
Smaller selection
Dismal poor salad bar comparative to regular Brazilian buffets
Service is ""rare"".  In other steakhouses someone stops by every minute, here you might not have someone stop by for a while, and then you're full and ready to go home - maybe it's their strategy.  
Several times when I'd asked for well done I was told ""sorry we don't have it"". like what? Sorry you don't have well done meat? 

When they do stop by you might not see the same meat cut ever again and since it's not self serve, you're S-out of luck unless you ask them specifically to bring another serving of something you liked, which may take a while. 

This really isn't as much all you can eat as it is ""all we think you can eat while we have it by your table"". 

But it's not just about quantity, like i said, service, meat cuts, preparation, and quality aren't nearly what you'd expect from places like Fogo De Chau or Texas De Brazil.

We were trying to find a sports bar as it was Sunday at 1pm and we wanted wings and football.  We walked the entire Miracle Mile shopping center and the two main sports bars, Blondie's and PBR Rock Bar, were packed.  We were really hungry by this time, so we stopped at Pampas.

We were promptly seated at the very front\/patio area of the restaurant.  The salad bar is all the way in the BACK of the restaurant.  My husband is disabled and walks with crutches, so I was already planning my strategy to get his plate and my plate all the way across the restaurant.  Our server arrived, noticed the crutches, and immediately asked if we would be ordering the salad bar and, if so, would we like to be seated closer?  This scored major points with me.  They actually opened a section for us to sit in, and we had it all to ourselves.

We both ordered the surf and turf and hit the salad bar.  The only other churrascaria I have been to is Fogo de Chao, so that is where I will base my comparison.  The salad bar at Pampas is about 1\/4 of the size of the one at Fogo.  I actually found this preferable as I remember being completely overwhelmed at Fogo.  The Pampas salad bar had a nice selection - jicama and citrus salad, Brazilian coleslaw, pasta salads, potato salads, hearts of palm salad and several others.  For a more traditional salad, there was an option of romaine or spring mix.  The romaine was dark green, crisp and fresh and the spring mix was equally fresh - not soggy at all.  All of the basic salad toppings were available and several dressing options were available.  My only complaint about the salad bar would be that the fresh mozzarella balls (presented with cherry tomatoes) were very bland.

On to the main reason we were there...MEAT!  By the time I returned from the salad bar, the sirloin guy had already been by and had left a delicious slice of perfectly cooked, medium rare meat on my plate.  It was seasoned just right and very tasty.  I ended up eating A LOT of that sirloin.  There was also bacon-wrapped turkey (can't go wrong with anything wrapped in bacon!), Brazilian sausage, ham, BBQ chicken, BBQ pork and even pineapple!  All of the meat was well seasoned and well cooked.  

I had noticed one of the menu options was a skirt steak with chimichurri.  I asked our server if I could get a side of chimichurri and she was happy to oblige.  She let me know it would take a few minutes because they make it fresh for each order.  It came out a couple minutes later and was delicious!  

The ""surf"" part of the surf and turf was ok.  When you order the surf and turf they bring a platter of seafood to the table and let you know you can order more of anything.  The inital platter includes grilled shrimp, scallops, salmon and the fresh catch of the day (not sure what it was - I think it was grouper, which I don't care for).  The shrimp were small but tasty, the salmon was well cooked and made even better by the provided soy ginger glaze.  I didn't try the catch of the day.  The scallops were very small and not very good....can't quite put my finger on it, but I ate one and didn't want anymore.  Overall, I would say save a few dollars and just get the meat.

There was a woman who was around during our entire visit...I believe she was either the owner or the general manager.  She stopped by our table to make sure we were satisfied and talked to us a little about the restaurant.  I commented on the chimichurri and she stated that everything is made fresh, in house.  In fact, I had noticed a window into the kitchen while I was at the salad bar where I could see people making all of the salad bar items.  Anyway, I always appreciate when I am in a restaurant and the owner or manager is interested enough in making sure the guests are happy that they stop by and chat.

When we checked in to our hotel, the concierge gave us two $5 off coupons for Pampas.  I am sure we will be using those before we leave Vegas at the end of the week.  At $19.99 for the meat-only option, its hard to beat for lunch.  If you go for dinner, it is more than double the price ($41.95 for meat only) but they add tenderloin, tri-tip beef, and lamb.  I have to admit...I am tempted.",1,0,0

I purchased the lunch deal which included two all-you-can-eat meals of meat, seafood and salad bar, plus one alcoholic drink per person and one dessert to share. It ended up being a great deal!

We checked out the salad bar first and I was slightly disappointed by it. I was expecting more of a green salad bar and less of the pre-made pasta salads. The Caesar salad was soggy, which seemed odd considering that the restaurant had just opened less than 30 minutes before. The standouts of the salad bar for me were the garlic mashed potatoes and chicken noodle soup, which I found helped to give me a stomach a relaxing break from all the delicious meats. 

And speaking of the meats, those steaks were amazing! Both the tri-tip and the top sirloin were melt-in-your-mouth delicious! As others have mentioned, they're rather salty but I, for one, have a salty tooth so I was in heaven! I loved having the meat carved right at our table and being able to have as much as I could fit in my tiny stomach. 

Unfortunately, the other meat was mainly pig-based and I don't eat pig so I skipped the ham, pork loin  and even the bacon-wrapped chicken. I tried a chicken leg but didn't care for it. Besides, the steaks were too good to bother with anything else.
 
Thanks to Yelp, I read how amazing Pampas' grilled pineapple was and I knew to request some. I think that they usually bring it by your table but after 30 minutes, we had yet to see any. We asked our waitress and she notified the kitchen to bring it out. It was so sweet and delicious and balanced the rest of our meal perfectly. 

Our meal ended with a choice of one of four desserts. I'm probably an odd one out here but none of the four choices (cheesecake, chocolate cake, flan and tiramisu) appealed to me. I'm more of a pie or ice cream kind of girl. I would have chosen the chocolate cake, even though I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but my boyfriend wanted to try the flan so I let him have it. I was too stuffed from my meaty meal to have much room for dessert anyway. 

All in all, I'd definitely come back with another Groupon next time I'm in Vegas.",4,1,2

My party of 11 had reservations for Pampas....even so, it took them more than 45 minutes to get us our table.  Most waiters look forward to large parties - lots of potential for tips - however ours avoided us.

The menu has some good offerings on it.  However, because it had taken so long to seat us and our waiter was not being attentive, most of us ordered the salad bar because we were running short on time.  Irritated that the majority of the party was not ordering the most expensive thing on the menu (keep in mind, we were a group of well dressed, well-to-do people), the waiter began collecting up rodizio plates from the table as loud as he possibly could, as if being passive-aggressive would put more time on the clock for us.  We then pointed out that he'd failed to take the meal orders from three of the people in our party, which irritated him further.  He mistakenly collected a rodizio plate from one of the party who ordered the meat rodizio (the all you can eat meat) and when the diner informed him that he shouldn't have taken the plate away, argued with the diner for 5 minutes before checking what he himself had written down for the meal order.

The food at the salad bar was decent - good variety and mostly well done, and does a good job as light fare.  The people who were most disappointed were those who ordered the all-you-can-eat meat.  The menu said it was a ""neverending parade of meats"".  In actuality, they were not served for 20 minutes while the rest of us were eating from the bar, and neither was anybody else in the restaurant.  The manager stopped by to ask if people were getting their meats, to which we told him no, not in the past 20 minutes.  I'm guessing he chewed out the wait staff, because a slow trickle of the rotiserrie spear holding waiters slowly started making their rounds, albeit it was far from being a ""neverending parade"" and all of the servers appeared sour and grouchy that they were being made to work.  Most would come by, cut off one small slice, and walk off leaving my friends sitting there trying to flag them down for more.

As for the meat itself?  Nothing special.  Most of it was overcooked.  The bacon wrapped turkey was good, but how often is bacon-wrapped anything bad?  Overall it was very disappointing for the price tag, and the people who were most satisfied were those who just got the $19 salad bar because they were either not hungry or in a rush to leave.

Funnily enough, they have red and green markers to be put on the table, green to sign servers to bring more meat, red to tell them that you're full.  The diners in my party that ordered the all you can eat meat finished dinner hungry and turning the markers to red just so that we could collect our checks and continue with our night.

As for the rude waiter?  He was delinquent in refilling our drink orders (and 11 people on their way to a club can order a lot of drinks) to the point that on more than one occasion members of my party walked to the bar to order drinks.  When we asked him to split our checks, he became visibly irritated with us.....lets see, a group of 11 people, four couples and some single guys, why would separate checks with the mandatory gratuity added NOT make sense?  Not many 28-30 year olds pay for 10 friends to eat at an expensive restaurant like this...  The waiter then went around the table and argued with every one of us about our drink orders (which wasn't much thanks to him being AWOL).  15 minutes later, he tosses down the drink bill and basically said he made no effort to try to break it up.

In the end, the one thing our waiter did right was not add gratuity to both the food bill and the drink bill.  Everybody in my party of 11 gave him exactly what he earned and deserved for his tip: $0.00 .

If you're looking for all you can eat and quality, go to the buffet at the MGM Grand or the Aria.  If you're looking for bad service, go to Dick's Last Resort - their bad service is at least entertaining and their prices are more reasonable (and quality of food is sadly comparable).  There is no reason for anybody to ever eat at Pampas.",1,1,1

But after my recent experience there, I am compelled to write. Sorry for those of you who are only interested in the food. My only regret is we didn't have as good a time as we expected.

More than 15 friends and I all traveled to Las Vegas to celebrate a friend's birthday on May 24. One of the places the birthday girl was excited to eat at was Pampas. She made reservations and everything was set. So we all get there and they kindly accommodate our very large party (20). Everything is going well, the food is not too bad, but before the waiter leaves, the birthday girl asks if he could separate our checks. Sure, he says. Later, she asks him again. Same response. We get our check (which totaled more than $1,000), and they tell us they can't separate the check. The birthday girl asks to speak to a manager. When it came time to confront the waiter about the whole separate checks issue, he calmly says ""No, she didn't."" So, when we ask the manager to rectify the matter, she says their policy is to charge 15% extra to do so if there are more than three cards being charged. That's an extra $150 just so they could charge us separately -- AFTER we asked them more than once to separate the check. Before this, there was never any mention of any charge. The manager was quite unforgiving and rude. Once we decided to simply put the whole amount on another friend's card, she nonchalantly asks, ""Would you like dessert?"" It wasn't free, by the way.
I'd just like to say thanks, Pampas staff, for ruining what would have been an otherwise pleasurable birthday celebration.

We didn't even receive the red\/green stick indicating when we'd like our food. Not even 30 seconds passed from the time we sat down with our buffet plates to the time the meat came out. It gave us a feeling of being rushed -- before we were even given the chance to START eating.

As for the food, it was not too shabby. The filet mignon, though, was bland and dry, even though it was quite pink in the middle. Which shouts, ""I've been lying around for a while!"" It definitely wasn't terrible, but not worth traveling from four different states and $1,000 just to be treated rudely. I'd suggest any of the other thousands of other places to eat in Las Vegas that truly understand what customer service is all about. Very, VERY disappointing.

The dinner was all you can eat of 10 meats. I have to say, my favorite was the roasted herb chicken. Some of the meat was a bit dry and tough to chew through, but I was pretty satisfied with the different flavors. There are some other brazilian bbq places where the meats just all start tasting the same. Another favorite was the bacon wrapped turkey. The turkey was really moist, but I think that's because it was processed. They came out in cubes on those long sticks. If I remember correctly, there were two types of filet mignon. I remember liking the one that wasn't with parmesan .
The service here was excellent. We brought our own wine. When we called, they said the corkage fee was $15, but it turned out to be $10.

And although we have to work during our spring break, we decided, to do something completely different and fun for our Tuesday night dinner, something we can't ever do with the kids. We became tourists in our own town with dinner and a show. We scored 8:30 pm tickets to Zombie Burlesque through Vegas.com which offered dinner at either Pampas Churrascaria or the Italian restaurant across from the V theater where the show would be. I went on Yelp beforehand of course, and read the unimpressive reviews of Pampas. We briefly considered the Italian place, but because we're living dangerously and hadn't done Brazilian in a long time, we thought we would give it a try, Yelp reviews be damned. 

Well the rating lived up to its hype, or rather non-hype. For us, we believe the worst part was the pokey service. When we finally did get a server to acknowledge us, we then had to go over the fine print of what the show tickets included in terms of the dinner. We would only get a choice of an entrée: beef, chicken or fish which came with run of the mill sides. And the only alcohol included was the sangria, house beer, and their cocktail concoction, which I can't remember what it's called, but, looked completely labor intensive for the gal making it. We upgraded to the buffet for $10 more and the $20 per person alcohol ticket for an hour of well drinks. Fuck it! We're on spring break. 

The buffet was decent. It offered an array of cheese, veggies and other sides. The meat merry-go-round was just okay. The tri-tip piece that I had was dry, which made it difficult for me to cut into. My husband appeared to have received a juicer piece of tri and he still had issues cutting the meat. His contribution to this review is simply: this place needs sharper knives to cut the meat.

So yeah, I got nothing else. This place is just adequate and tailored to the tourists. If you're in Vegas as a tourist, you don't generally come for the food. You come to gamble, see the shows and drink yourself stupid. If you're looking for a really good Brazilian place, this place isn't it.

DO NOT come here unless you want to kill time and have $$ to throw away. I regret not checking the Yelp.com reviews before coming here. We came for lunch on 2\/13\/16 because of a discount voucher we bought from TIX4TONIGHT (half-price booth similar to those in NYC). Two of us both ordered the all you can eat meat ($21) lunch option.

My history: Been to Fogo de Chao in NYC, Baltimore, and San Francisco multiple times, once at Texas de Brazil in Chicago.  Very familiar and love the Brazilian steakhouses in general. 

1. Service: Arrived at 1pm on Saturday 2\/13, seated at 1:10pm, but waitress Ashley did not show up until 1:20pm. Drinks (2 glasses of water) arrived at 1:30pm. The restaurant was less than half full at this time, so I don't understand why it took this long. 
2. Meat carving service: The meat carvers (only 3 guys for 20-30 tables) are bringing out meats every 7-10 minutes, compared to every 1-2 minute at other Brazilian steakhouses. We spent 80% of the 1.5 hours meal time waiting for meats to come by. I finally spoke up and alerted the manager, who said she will send meats our way. The carvers did show up within the next 10 minutes, but with an attitude.  
3. Meat quality: The meat carvers are not educated about how to slice the steak (especially Picante, the top sirloin), and cut out 1\/2"" slices that are very chewy. Out of the 8 steak slices, 2 are blood-dripping raw (I asked for medium rare), 2 have chewy tendons (taste cheap), 2 are fibrous tri-tips (I spit them out after chewing for a while) and only 2 are edible. When I asked the carver to return with medium rare steak, he complained why I am not eating the raw piece, which has a pool of blood sitting on top of it. Please see attached photo. 
4. Meat selection: we were promised 7 meat options according to the menu, here is what we actually saw during 1.5 hours of waiting:
-chicken wrapped with bacon is overcooked and dry. Bacon is crispy though.
-pork sausage is good but on the salty side, so I couldn't eat more than 2 bites without drinking water.
-Picante, the signature Brazilian steak top-sirloin, only came to our table 2 times, after the manager got involved. One piece was amazingly tender and the other piece is surprisingly bloody raw (see my photo). Quality control is poor. 
-Pork loin is the best and most edible part of our meal. Juicy and tender. Only came to our table two times though. 
-Tri-tip steak is fibrous and chewy, so I finally spit it out after chewing on it for 2 minutes. 
-grilled pineapple is not ripe and sour.

In summary, even with the discount we had, this is NOT worth the money. I hope you read the reviews here and decide to go elsewhere. It is definitely not worth $21+tip+tax per person for lunch. Frustrating experience and will NOT return even if it is a free meal.",5,0,1

Having said that, it's not good either - it's close to the authentic Brazilian system, but the food tastes nothing like it. Food is gluten free (which may be a plus to some) but the meat variety is not enough and (more importantly) is not cooked properly enough.

Unless you have the first cut, the meat is not going to taste as good as it should. The fact that they don't have Guaraná Antartica is a big downer as well.

If you're in the strip and can't move to another place, it's not a bad place for the Brazilian steakhouse experience. But once you experience a real good Brazilian steakhouse, this place will seriously disappoint you.",1,0,0

Someone suggested that they had a pretty good variety of meats so we decided to give it a try since there was a groupon. So for 79$ you get all you can eat surf and turf( meat and seafood) the consisted everything from sirloin to lamb. Then the surf part which consist of mussels, shrimp salmon and tilapia? Comes on a separate plate. I can't rave too much on the food because some of the meats were quite dry but I did like the shrimp and sirloin. The salad bar was decent  with a variety of vegetables and hot dishes. 

So an alcoholic beverage is included in the deal, I got a chinahuia (sp?) with pineapple, lime and tequila. Not too bad; definitely my  kinda drink. The hunny had a rum runner and it was poured much heavier than my drink. 

So overall, it's an okay restaurant but for the same price I would go to texas de brasil. They have much better meat.

We had an 11:30am reservation and were the second group seated for lunch.  We were seated in a really cool private room that looked like a wine cellar with glass walls.  We discovered right away that even though the room appeared to be great, it was probably the worst place to sit in the whole restaurant.  We waited and waited for our server who never came.  One of our group stopped another server and asked them to find our server and send them over.  A manager heard the conversation and stepped in to help.  At this point we found out that the bartender was supposed to be our server - which did not work well as she was busy making the drinks for all the tables.  

Once we gave our drink orders to the manager we went to get our salads.  Upon return to the table our second issue started.  None of the 'carvers' were stopping to come into our room with any of the meats as they passed by.  We could see them walk by, but no one stopped.  When the manager returned to check on us we told her and she went to find them to send them over.  After that we got plenty of chicken and sausage, but still none of the other carved meats. 

Eventually word got out that we were not being served and they started to come by, but by that time we were all getting full.  We had had salad and a couple of meat choices and then sat for a long while - so our tummy's were done for.

You can order stand alone items off their cart, which I've never done before.  I've always tried their rodizio, specifically the meat rodizio.  If you order the meat rodizio, it's similar to an all-you-can eat, although it's not specified as one.  

Essentially, you have unlimited access to the salad bar.  The salad bar has plenty of options including every kind of  Brazilian salad under the sun, it seems.  My favorite is the artichoke heart salad.  They also have many appetizer items like cheese bread and fried bananas.  The fried bananas are definitely worth trying.  At your table, the waiters come around your table w\/ cuts of meat cooked on a skewer and slice you as many pieces as you choose.  You get to sample steaks, tri-tips, bbq pork, chicken wrapped in bacon, grilled chicken pieces, and sausages.  The bbq pork is especially well marinated and tasty.  

I also love that Pampas purposely serves the steak to you rare to medium rare depending on the cut.  In effect, you can't say how you want your steak done -- they just serve it to you how they think you should have it, how it should be eaten.  As a foodie, I believe steak should be eaten rare to medium rare anyway (so you can discern the quality of the cut of meat), so I'm fine w\/ that.  But all you ppl who do not know how to eat steak (i.e. you request it well done), don't select the steak option when it comes around.  Hahaha... sorry if I sound mean, but that's how Pampas does it. 

Regarding the price, I think it's significantly cheaper to have lunch there than dinner.  Lunch rodizio was only ~$20 per person but dinner was nearly $50 per person.  Granted, I've only had dinner at the Pampas in Palo Alto, CA and not at this one in Vegas, it is of note.

$1 well drinks, half price beer and halp price apps and sanwiches for happy hour, one of the best happy hours I have seen. Shannon is a great bartender and I would return to the place just to see her. The only negative was the local regulars who were all cheesy time-share salesmen. They made used car dealers seem classy as they shared their stories of hard selling midwest saps for hours until they gave in. If you are thinking of buying a Vegas time-share, stop by this bar first, there is no way you would buy one afterwards.

Food is ok, but it is no Texas de Brazil. The salad bar was the smallest and plainest of any Brazillian steakhouse I have been to. Nothing spectacular.

The meats were below average and all well past medium rare. The best was the garlic sirloin, the worst was the filet mignon which was way overcooked and almost well done. Pork and turkey were ok.

The coupon was 'buy one dinner get another free which the coupon says would be 31.95 instead of 60+ dollars so long as you buy 2 soft drinks. That sounded like a pretty good deal. So we schlep on over to the restaurant. 

We get seated and looking over the menu notice that  perhaps the advertised deal was not what it seems. Dinner for one is 60+ so the deal now seams to be buy 1 dinner for 51.95 plus drinks to get the other free. 
For that price, I could have gone to the Wynn or similar casino and had dinner at the name chef restuarants.... just saying.

I call the waitress over and ask her about the coupon to which she replies '""a lot of people think that it's 31.95 plus two drinks but it's actually 51.95"". Now, my command of English is pretty good if I may say so myself, and having been to Law School and all that, I think intelligent enough. So it seems to me that they deliberately mislead people as to what the price will be and hope that once you get there you'll be too embarrased or resigned to leave. So I LEFT.

Funny though, that the same restuarant also has a breakfast special of 5.95 for steak, 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes and a pastry, yet want to charge 51.95 for their dinner. Uh, OK. In the Las Vegas magazines, the place is rated $$ which seems a bit inaccurate too.",3,1,0

1. It was at Planet Hollywood, where there's free parking and the coolest casino, where we were going to play at the tables later;
2. We had a 2-for-1 coupon.
We made a reservation, but at 6:00 on Saturday night we would have been ok without it; HOWEVER, when we left at 7:30, there was a lineup of 50 people waiting. Suggestion: reserve by calling, or using OpenTable app.
We ordered the Rodizio dinner - endless meats (12 selections) plus endless shrimp plus salad bar. Normally $68 per person, but 2-for-1 made it $34 each. Not a bad price for really good food, and lots of it.
Caveat: you also have to order a beverage (didn't see that on the coupon), so we went with the one-hour open bar for $20 (per person). 
Wife hit the salad bar; I did not. Why waste tummy room on veggies and cheese. I did check it out, and it looked good; but I was there for the meats.
All of them were tasty - especially the sausage and the sirloin options.
Grilled shrimps came 8 at a time with a really tasty homemade teriyaki sauce, which was so good that I was putting it on everything I ate - including the grilled pineapple.
Our server was Amber. She was awesome. She fully explained the coupon before we ordered (a party sat after we did but weren't aware of the wording and pricing. Amber explained it, and told them to take some time to think about it, enjoy a glass of water and she'd be back to check on them. I tried to convince them to stay and eat, but they ended up leaving). She made drink suggestions, informed us on how the evening would go, and offered to get me a special plate of well done meats. She was jovial and attentive to all her tables. She kept the drinks coming and even introduced us to the manager (we were talking to her about using an iPad and app for seating tables, rather than the white board and dry erase marker the hostess was using. The manager agreed, and informed us that someone dropped the iPad a few days earlier)(for shits and giggles, on the way out, I asked the hostess if I could see the white board so I could check my email.

So, we set out to find breakfast, but since we (as most folks visiting vegas do) had woken up quite late, we ended up roaming into this Brazilian buffet. We were pretty early for lunch, so the place was pretty empty, but that didn't stop the food from making its way to our table.

The sides at the walk up buffet were pretty diverse, everything from capreze salad to falafels. The olives and feta were fantastic! If there was anything missing, it was mashed potatoes.

The meats were equally good. I wasn't a fan of the not-spicy chicken, but the ham served with pineapple was great and the big slices of beef were yummy as well. If you have never been to a Brazillian buffet, be warned, their stuff is always extremely salty. I think this is just the style they make it in. It will taste very different from the slab-o-prime-rib at the buffet down the walkway.

The deal was the Surf & Turf Rodizio Lunch for two with two specialty cocktails and one desert for $47 (lunch). 

We went shortly after the New Year and Las Vegas was still rather busy with tourists so we didn't expect to be seated right away - however - we only waited 10 to 15 minutes and we were led to our seats by a staff member (we later learned that Heather is the manager and she was just lovely to us).  We've been to restaurants similar to Pampas Churrascaria before, and I really do not know what the negative reviews are all about but our experience was nothing short of brilliant. 

The food was amazing. Our Groupon included seafood, and everything on our seafood plate was just delicious. My husband is a huge mussels fan and Heather even brought out a bowl of just that - mussels heaven! Instead of cocktails, we had a beer and a red wine. We're simple like that. The servers kept on coming with the meat, and I think my favorite was the pork while he loved everything beef (other than mussels). Our desert was Tiramisu and it was just the perfect ending to our awesome lunch. 

Heather was very apologetic for making us wait, but honestly, we were so relaxed that we didn't know why she had to apologize.  Food? Great. Service? Awesome. Customers (Us)? Happy. 

I understand that customers cannot all be 100% happy but our experience couldn't have gone any better.  Maybe we just had a better attitude coming in. We already were having a great day and Pampas Churrascaria made our day in Vegas even better.  Some customers just like to complain and I wouldn't let the bad reviews sway you.  I say go and try this place out; try everything (they even have a great salad bar) and come out fully satisfied. Also, know that Vegas gets busy at certain times of the year and so when it is the busy tourist season there - expect a wait. That's just how it is anywhere that attracts so many people each year.

my gf asked for a Arnold Palmer, but the waitress refused because they make their lemonade fresh squeezed.  so she was afraid the consistency would be off.   but i have to admit, the lemonade was pretty tasty.

the pineapple was AMAZING.  its like a burst of tropical refreshment to your mouth after mounds of meat.  

i also liked the salad bar.  the chese bread was simple, but delicious.  the antipasta was good, and the artichoke salad was fresh and juicy.  
the fried bananas, was interesting... breaded on the outside and juicy and banana-ish on the inside....(i hope that makes sense)

This place is not comparable with the quality of food, dining experience or service.... But it does cost just as much. 

The salad bar wasn't up to par because the selection isn't as wide as Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chao. The cheeses weren't as good, nor the cold meats. 

The meats brought around weren't cooked well. The selection of meats was mostly cheap pork or chicken, and I found them fatty. The sirloin, when it finally came, was tough.

Don't pay extra for the seafood. It's basically a plate of crab cakes and tilapia (decent enough) with some unshelled shrimp. Really? Unshelled shrimp?

If you're local just stay off the strip and go to one of the other places. If you're a tourist, it's worth the trip to towne square for Texas de Brazil.",6,4,0

Restaurant: in my opinion slightly hidden but it's nice because it gives you the more private not so chaotic dinning experience. We arrived early and they were able to seat us earlier than our reservation time. Very nice staff and nice restaurant. My bf selected the Meat Rodizio for an additional $10  and I selected the salmon plate which was covered with the dinner voucher.

My first experience here was dreadful and I evaluated it as such but management immediately reached out. They apologized and invited me back for second try -- complimentary of course. It took me about six months to get back to Vegas and simultaneously have enough free time to come into Pampas. 

They did a really great job this time! I want to note that I did not feel as though all attention was on me but rather the normal level of service was offered. The meats were very good though not nearly as wide a selection of them as in many other churrascarias I've been to. The buffet was adequate, not stellar. But then I never understood folks who went to town on buffet selections when they've dropped the bulk of their money on the giant skewers of meaty goodness.

The gauchos were professional, polite and they knew about the protein they were weilding. Drinks were solid. Servers and hostesses very nice. It was a good experience all around. 

I also appreciated that toward the end of meal the manager on duty came by to see how things had gone and to hear in more detail what had gone wrong the first around. We had a good productive chat without getting anyone in trouble. I've said this before, sometimes recovering from a challenging circumstance is more telling of the substance of a team than seeing that team cruise through an all-systems-are-check kind of day.

The salad bar was a big disappointment.  Not much of a selection for a higher priced restaurant. 

For two of us, our bill came to $117 which includes my 20% tip. Not worth the money to eat here. We only tried it to experience a Brazilian steakhouse.

My review is only about the Groupon we used, since we did not order anything else. Note: you have to pay for water + tax at the end, even if you didn't really drink water. Not including tip, we probably paid about $60 after water and taxes, if I remember correctly. 

Definitely come here hungry if you plan on doing this, since meat and drinks fill you up pretty quickly. 

Here's how it works: once you're seated, you can start with the salad bar and order your drink. When that's done, different staff members will come around holding different cuts of meat, and you can choose whether or not you want to take it or wait for something else to come around. If you've ever been to a dim sum restaurant, it's a little like that except with meats instead of carts of dim sum, and of course everything was already paid for. Once you're done eating meat, they bring you a dessert to share, and you pay and leave!

My least favorite thing was probably the salad bar. We pretty much had to choose from pre-made salads since they didn't have the individual salad toppings anywhere, just plain lettuce or things like cole slaw, potato salad, green bean salad, etc. However, they have a bunch of cheeses to choose from as well as some breads, chips, soups, and other miscellaneous items. Lots of options!

Get the white sangria! We tried that and the mimosas, but the white sangria was better in my opinion. 

The service here was THE BEST. Everyone was so nice and enthusiastic. 

Some of the meats were great, and some were just okay. They give you this wooden cylinder with red on one end and green on the other. Green side up = more meat, red side up = no more for now. We were gorging on meat for a little over an hour while we were there, and my favorite was the sirloin! So tender, medium-rare, and juicy. Some of the pork we got was pretty dry, so I didn't get too much of that. 
They also had bacon-wrapped chicken, sausages, tri-tip, grilled pineapple, etc. 
The seafood dish they bring you has mussels on it as well as some shrimp and salmon, and you can ask for another if you finish the plate, since they won't be bringing it around like they do the meat. 

We had the flan for dessert and it was delicious! I'll be uploading a picture later.

I made a reservation and we showed up 10 mins early. So we had to wait. Off to the bar we go, where I ordered a cocktail and watched some football. We waited about 15 more mins, then we were 'accepted' to sit on the waiting seats behind the hostess stand. Great.

Sat down and went to the salad bar, which was pretty good, but not as extensive as I've seen at other churrascarias\/ all you can eat meat buffets.  The seafood pasta in the cream sauce was my favorite.  The only sauces available here were 2 kinds of Chimmichurri, no horseradish creme sauce or regular horseradish which I typically enjoy with my steak. Only green I saw was Kale and that was actually pretty tasty. 

The guys cutting the meat did not smile. In fact, I don't think one of them cracked a smile the whole time, they definitely need to be more friendly.  They looked like they were in pain each time they came over and would rather be hanging themselves than working.

I also never saw Lamb. I looked and looked for it, but it never showed up. bah bah lamb.  I think they only have 1\/2 of the options they tell you they do.  The most memorable items were:  the bacon wrapped scallops, grilled shrimp, and the roasted crispy chicken.  The steak for me was Outback at best and again I did not see as many options as I thought there should be.  The trout and other mystery white fish should be avoided.

No dessert options either or at least a little something sweet to eat would've been nice.

As a Brazilian, used to going to this kind of restaurant my whole life, I don't think I've ever felt so uncomfortable and disappointed seating on a dining table before. We were hungry, looking forward to the yummy recipes of Brazilian cuisine and it was Vegas for Christ's sake! We made reservations for New Years Day at 10PM. Got there and were seated right away. Within minutes, the waiter comes to our table and takes our drink order. We had a voucher and were immediately told what we could and could not eat (no steaks or seafoods). He also said that we had 15 minutes to eat because the kitchen was closing soon (this was never said when we made the reservation for 10PM). 

When telling him that I'd like to upgrade and eat all that i wanted, he didn't know what to answer but stuck with ""you can't"". I found that odd. I was willing to pay whatever it took to eat what they offered (premium meats and seafood), so I felt disappointed with it. Out of the 15 minute deadline he gave us to eat, 10 minutes went by and no meat was brought to our table (waiters were walking right by with the meat skewers to another section of the restaurant). I decided to inquire about it with the manager at the time. I explained to her that we were given 15 minutes to eat but still haven't gotten any meat at our table. She was surprised of such deadline given by our waiter, and worked on getting meat on our table. She said we could eat as much as we want, no hurry. She was nice and tried to take care of everything.

When the meat finally made it to our table (chicken thighs, breast, top sirloin, etc..), the quality was pretty bad. Dry, blend, as if it had been reheated a few times. We tried a couple bites and left the rest on the plates. I went on to try all other cuts of meat, but the quality was consistent throughout. I figured I'd cancel the seafood upgrade as I expected it would be just as bad. The salad bar was good, and that was mostly what we ate (and the cheese breads, those were yummy. But I can make those at home lol). To those who don't know, the main feature of Brazilian steak houses, is the constant flow of different cuts and types of meat that are brought to the tables. Unfortunately, that night, we didn't enjoy that.

The service was regretful the entire night. Our waiter offered to take our plates several times when we were still obviously working on it. He seemed untrained and not too professional. He even took a bite (with his hands) from something in the salad bar as he was walking away from us. Probably thought no one would see it. lol Then wandered around the restaurant chewing what he ate. He also made a plate for himself in the middle of service. Haha.

We wondered if that was just a regular evening of service there, or if it was just due to us having a voucher. We will never know because we are never  going back.

Often when we can't figure out where to eat and we've exhausted our yelp lists, we go to groupon for suggestions. Unfortunately, I was less than impressed with our experience. The hostess was fine as she sat us at our table. When our server greeted us he was very nice. We informed him of our groupon and ordered our drinks. The drink cart girl was very nice but a little over the top. We started with the salad bar and there are a lot of good options. When we got back to our table, we noticed that some people had markers to let the meat servers know to come to their table but we didn't. That was a little confusing at first, but then a meat server did finally come to our table. The first few times the meat selection was either bacon wrapped or well done. I informed a few of the servers that I could not eat pork and preferred medium rare. I'm not exactly sure why a high end steak place is serving well done steak as the main cook temp. Some pink or red on some of the steaks would have been nice. We did get the surf and turf, but were disappointed that it didn't come with the lobster. I was also kinda grossed out by the shrimp. The coloring was off and it looked very limp\/weak. No thanks. However the other surf options were better, the salmon was good and the white fish was very flavorful. 

Anyway, after a few rounds of well done meat, we did get one medium sirloin and it was really good. Although I was mostly full at this point. I'm not saying the meat tasted bad, because it didn't. It was on the whole quite flavorful, but there should be a varied options for cook temps. Medium rare people don't like well done people don't like medium rare. Offer both. It makes no sense to only have well done. The service was pretty good, although the table next to us had a lot of issues. She was also irritated that all the meat was well done or pork.

Unless it's the only thing open and we're dying of hunger, maybe there's a slight chance. And if it weren't for the voucher we got, this restaurant ain't in our list to try when in Vegas, but it was a win-win, good opportunity to try since it's free dinner (with exceptions of: dessert, alcohol, tax, and gratuity)!

We were seated at a divided room where large parties were placed. Our server named Juan seemed a replacement as the main server for that area was slammed or should I say was too busy  favoring the group before us. It made it more noticeable after we've eaten as the main server took care of two other incoming groups seated in the same large party room. But what the hell, they all does the same, but to be determined to bring quality service, which I felt Juan didn't deliver well. 

I had Brazilian bouillabaisse which was a big meh! Bucca di Beppo or Bravo's, all located in Hawaii probably could have done a better version. It's pretty much a pasta with seafood medley of mussels (which the only thing I liked), shrimp, and salmon fish that's super untasty! My husband had Surf & Turf Rodizio with ""unlimited"" meat serving and my in-laws had Grilled Salmon and Skirt Steak (not part of this review) while my child had Loaded Cheese Fries (bacon, cheese, sour cream all OTS because we have a picky eater). 

Going back to my husband's food that didn't impress me at all, even if there's different meat carvers who goes to your table to serve it, due to lack of consistency. They seemed to be favoring other parties and we had to ask either our server or other bypassing staff to call the meat boys. Not a big fan of dead carcass (I'm a wannabe plant based dieter), so I can't really attest how good it was for my husband, but I can tell it didn't really pass to his liking the meat choices and service. 

To end the night, we had some confusion with our server Juan. I should have mentioned this beforehand and the server should've done the same with warning us with water charge per person. Like who does that? I guess only Pampas Brazilian Grille! Or the voucher could've printed it too with other exceptions. Plus, the way Juan applied our voucher against our orders were very out of order! Instead of simply listing all our orders and inputting the voucher at the end, he customized the receipt like they're trying to manipulate something. And call me stingy or whatever, but I didn't like the force tipping impression! That's why it's called a tip because it's up to the guest if they think it was well-deserved. At that case, he obviously didn't earn the whole 15% because I had to swallow my own saliva and drink from my husband's and child's water just so I can go on with my dinner. Plus it's not even ice cold! They charge for water back to the customers because it was placed in a fancy water bottle. There was also a lot of idle waiting for our server to get back to our table in between dinner session and the meat carvers were sparse serving and favoring table groups.

Giving it two stars only because it was ""free"" dinner and experiencing the meat serving at a lackluster manner! Go get that voucher as a VISA card instead!",1,0,0

Lol... You've been warned. Attempt only in case of dire hunger!",0,0,0

We went there and realized there were lots of small prints we didn't look into so carefully, but however it was still worth it. Then we realized lots of people were coming in with their groupon and found out that we could have even more value there so we asked to switch it midway and they had no issues. 

The salad bar was great, they had artichoke hearts, mushrooms, tortellinis, fresh mozzarella, fruit, some hot dishes and them some (I could get full just eating that).

Came with unlimited shrimp which was at times were overly cooked. In fact the first batch we had was leaving a bad first impression, but we like shrimp and it kept getting better. 

The meat and the shrimp was always making it to our table. Hardly ever had to wait around. The only thing I have to say is that it would be nice if I had a say in where they cut the meat. The outer parts are usually the more well done section and the inner parts were of course not. The moment we say yes they just go straight to cutting the area of their choosing. Thankfully my friend like the opposite so we can just switch if we needed to.

Some times some of the meats felt like it came out a way over cooked. like the chipotle chicken, I bet it would have been great had it not been so crispy. 

Drinks were strong, the dessert was delicious!! Service was good.

Overall it was a fun experience and considering we weren't paying a a crazy amount of money we felt that the food reflected its price that we paid which was discounted. Not sure if I'd actually pay full price. 

I recommend taking advantage of the groupon or the coupons that are passed out on the the strip.",3,1,0

When we ordered he brought us a pitcher of ordered drinks with no glasses, then took 10 minutes to bring us glasses and didn't pour the drinks for us. The food was pretty good, and the guys walking around the skewers were great and fast. Finally, our waiter came back to check on us when the pitcher was gone, and forgot my drink order. Finally, I asked for the bill, we had a voucher from the place we were staying and he brought me the receipt that $45 wasn't covered, and tip was optional-gave him the card back and he gave me a charge for $59 charged on the card. I couldn't find him after 10 minutes and I asked for a manager. When she came over she asked him about the bill and he said he added his 15% gratuity and when I questioned it the manager did nothing.

The other couple we were with are BIG Brazilian BBQ fans and they were really into it, I'm not as big of a fan and wouldn't have chosen it myself, but I was outnumbered as my husband likes these types of establishments as well. However, I did end up enjoying myself a lot more than I thought I would.

We went to Tix4Tonight and got a coupon that basically took off $18 a person for the all you can eat meal...so we paid $3 to get $18 off, a savings of $15 total. That made me feel better as I certainly didn't think I would eat almost $50 worth of meat, so I would definitely suggest doing this deal at Tix4Tonight.

All 4 of us got the all you can eat which includes a salad bar of various offerings like cheese bread rolls (OMG those were REALLY good!), garlic mushrooms, pasta salads, rice, mashed potatoes, etc. It was a nice showing and I enjoyed many of the things offered there. 

They also have ""drink specials"" where you can pay $20 for unlimited beer and wine, $25 for unlimited beer, wine, and sangria, or $30 for unlimited beer, wine, sangria, and caipirhinas. I opted for the $25 and the other 3 opted for the $30. The caipirhina gal pushes a cart around in circles just re-filling as many as she possibly can. She will mix and match any flavors you want using syrups. Real caipirhinas typically used muddled fruit for flavors and not syrups, but since these were all you could drink and she needed to make a lot fast, they cheated and used syrup. This didn't detract TOO much, but for a caipirhina purist, it could be an issue. The service was excellent on all levels all night. We were never without drinks (which made the extra money mostly worth it), meats, or fresh plates. 

The food itself was also good. They had a pretty big choice of different meats that they come around with on skewers cutting you off as much or little as you want. Almost everything we had was very good. Some of the meats come out more or less cooked and you can ask for the ""part"" you want. I myself like my meat well done so I asked for some of the beef well done and they actually went back and cooked me my own plate of well-done beef....nice touch.

While I wasn't thrilled to go here originally I did enjoy myself and my meal. I would not be opposed to going back if others in my group really wanted to go. I just feel like for $35 dollars (or $48 if you pay full price) you have to eat and love A LOT OF MEAT and I'm not a huge ""steak off a stick"" person LOL, but there are lots of people who are and I think if you're that kinda person, you'd love it! :-)",0,0,0

He said, ""I just want to take you girls out for a nice dinner."" Awww!

Wow, so I was stuffed from eating at the Mint CMYE earlier that morning. Lawrence said to get whatever, but I was a bit uneasy looking at the prices. It's not cheap - the salad bar alone is about $25! He said not to worry because it was on him. I ordered the taquitos ($9) but our waiter, Andreas, told me they ran out of chicken, so I ordered the salad bar. 

Jen ordered chicken satay as an appetizer ($9.) A bunch of skewers came stuck in a half a lemon with a little plastic container of peanut sauce. I could imagine Chef Gordon Ramsay throwing a fit over the presentation - I'd skip the lemon slice and just lay the skewers on the plate and put the peanut sauce in an actual (non-disposable) container. Anyway...

Lawrence ordered salmon and Jen ordered chicken, which was a huge portion and was really juicy and tasty! ($30+\/each) The waiter, Andreas, said the entrees came with ""salad bar,"" Caesar salad, or mashed potatoes. It's a bit confusing because those items are both on the salad bar - and no matter which of those three options you choose, you can still go to the salad bar. The menu needs to clear up that wording because it's confusing - just say all meals come with the salad bar. 

I have to say that the salad bar isn't really a ""salad bar"" if you're expecting something like Sweet Tomatoes. Nope, it's more like pre-made pasta and seafood salads, various soups, bread and anti-pasta. The roasted red peppers, my favorite, were so delicious, as was the hearts of palm salad. The feta was nice and briny and went well with the artichokes. I'm not one for seafood, but the calamari salad was so good and the lamb stew was divine! The money spent is worth unlimited lamb stew for sure! I wasn't a fan of the feijoada, which was 99.9% just black beans, but the marinated mushrooms were scrumptious and I went back for thirds!

There was a Groupon and I had great experiences at poorly rated restaurants in the past so I went with it. My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary along with the first time away from our kids overnight and we wanted good food.

Server: We had Constantin for our server. He was incredible. He was welcoming, friendly, comedic (appropriately), and down to earth. Where some people give a lower level of service when you have a Groupon he did NOT. He even reminded us that the Groupon includes dessert and to save room!

Ambiance: I did get the feeling that they tend to seat Groupon customers closer to the bar area so you don't get the full feeling of the ambiance of the restaurant however it was still a great table and the bar wasn't loud at all. (In fact our drinks likely came faster because we were near the bar.

Food: Where do I begin? WOW! I was beyond impressed. Perhaps I had low expectations after reading some of the poor reviews but I LOVED everything! My favorites: the bacon wrapped filet mignon, the flank steak, and the roasted chicken. These were incredible and my mouth is literally watering thinking of the flavor and juiciness of these foods. I was there only two nights ago and I am still drooling! The salad bar is wonderful- try the fried bananas! The white chocolate cheesecake- phenomenal. I was too full to finish all of it (Constantin had warned us!) but it was SO good! 

The waiters kept coming around with more and more meats. I could have sat there and ate all night however we had a show to get to and I was STUFFED!

Unfortunately, the pineapple was the highlight of their grilled goods.  The bacon wrapped chicken was moist, but nothing special.  The chicken without the bacon was flavorless, as was the sirloin and tri tip.  The chinese BBQ style pork had a nice sweet flavor with a hint of five spice, but again nothing that special.  Overall, if you are going to pay the regular price for this menu, it's better to take your money over to Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil....they have more meat options with more flavor as well.  The salad bar is also much more limited than the other brazilian churrascarias in town....the bananas are lack luster in that they are really just bananas with a crunchy coat on the outside.

Got a Groupon for this place (Lunch for 2 for $28, I think?). Was hesitant after reading some extremely mixed reviews but figured, why not?

We came for lunch on Black Friday around 1:30, without a reservation, and though the restaurant was only about half full we had to wait for 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Our server, Kelly?, introduced herself and seemed nice enough, but seemed to forget about us throughout the rest of the meal and our bill was ALL sorts of messed up! She tried to charge to charge me TWICE for a $10 drink (Honey, I had one, it was disgusting, it took 20 minutes for you to bring it to me in the first place...and I wonder how many other 'drunk' customers you tried to pull that crap on).

Additionally, there was some sort of $18 additional fee for using the Groupon...wait what?! ....so in reality, it was $28 + the $18 fee the restaurant charges...oh yeah, and water (flat OR sparkling) is $6 a bottle...so bare minimum, lunch actually came to $58 plus tax and tip...and believe me that did not in any way reflect the quality of the meal.

Yeah, it was a 'surf & turf' all you can eat kind a thing, but Eeeeeesh, gross me out! The salad bar reminded me of the kind of $10 buffet you find in one of the area discount  casino\/hotels, and I would say 9 out of 10 of the cuts of meat that were brought to the table were either grossly overcooked or raw. Plus, they brought around the bacon wrapped chicken, and some sort of sausage thing (read: the cheap stuff!) to the table at least 3-4 times each, but only ONCE, in the entire hour and half, brought around Picanha (steak)...and the slab they cut off for us was still bleeding.

Prior to asking, in our first 45 minutes there, we had been only been offered chorizo and ham. When we did finally start getting food, most of it was dry and\/or unseasoned. The only cuts either of us actually liked were the chorizo and the bacon-wrapped chicken. When my wife wanted another drink, we once again had to seek out the hostess and ask to get one. And when it was time for dessert, we ordered flan, which isn't a dessert they make on the spot (unless it's a box mix, I guess). It should have just been a matter of picking up the dish from the fridge and bringing it out, but it took so long that we gave up  and went to the hostess to ask for our check for the one drink we had that wasn't covered by our Groupon. Maybe our experience was a result of having a Groupon?

Again, we waited as the hostess consulted with two servers, neither of which were our server. I had to walk over to them again and this time asked for the manager. We waited several minutes for the manager, as the hostess asked to to ""hold on"" while she seated other guests. I got so tired of the waiting that I actually just told the hostess, ""nevermind, we're leaving"" when she turned around and said ""there's the manager"".

The manager was apologetic (nobody else was), but despite our experience and my request that she just comp us the $7 or whatever for the drink, since we didn't even have the dessert that was supposed to be included, she still insisted that I needed to pay ""the tax"". It was only $2.49, so I paid and left. But I'm not sure what was taxed. Sales tax is 8%, so to have $2.49 in sales tax would require a bill of over $30. And, again, we had a Groupon that covered everything except for one sangria, so I'm not sure what I was being taxed on.

I can't say the same for paying full price here, but to each his own I suppose. I've been to a few different brazillian steakhouses so this was by no means a unique experience, but it was a mostly pleasant one.

The interior is fairly well decorated, and the location is convenient-- right in the middle of the M shops. Great if you are planning on shopping afterwords, or if like me, you just like the atmosphere and are too cheap to shop at stores like these. The staff was accommodating and seated us without incident.

The salad items aren't bad but some are better than others. The tortellini is ok, the olives are tasty, the artichoke is a nice touch, but the garbanzo salad had a pretty weird flavor. It was just the end of happy hour so I was happy to have a Stella Artois for 3.50.

Then of course there's the actual meat. The kobe fish was different and well seasoned but a bit dry. The shrimp didn't taste much different from any shrimp I've had elsewhere-- I honestly prefer the stuff you can get at Cajun themed restaurants. 

There was some ""spicy chicken"" but it didn't seem particularly spicy to me-- although it was delicate and fell easily off the skewer. Most of the meat servers are pretty friendly and will likely give you a double portion of meat if you let them know you really like what they're serving. The lamb was delicate and cooked to a perfect medium rare. It came with a sweet and tangy balsamic sauce that complimented it well. The garlic sirloin was solid, but the seasoned sirloin came out pretty dry and appeared to have been cooked well done. The tri-tip was delectably juicy ( I happen to be a huge fan of tri-tip) but the top sirloin was rather dry. 

When the bill came and it was obvious how much we had saved with the groupon, we had no gripes. However, I don't think I would have been as pleased if we had paid full price for the food. The quality of the cuts seems up to par but too many of their offerings were overcooked, and I just wasn't that blown away by the quality here. This place is no Fogo de Chao, but if you have a groupon or other discount deal, it's not a waste of your time to try them out. You'll be stuffed and fairly satisfied with what you get.",4,1,1

None of the meats were top quality like what I've previously experienced and they have no chicken hearts!! Bleh.

The pitcher of sangria we ordered can hardly pass for sangria. With no fruits in it and no fruity taste, it fell short of being just cheap wine.

We waited to be seated for 10 mins when the restaurant was half empty, waited another 6 to 10 after being seated and then took forever to get our reciept to leave. 

 I would say that the food lacked flavoring, like salt. I had to add that to my steak just to get a little more taste. The ""fresh"" green beans were a little overcooked for my taking, but the side bar was great. They charge a 2 dollar convenience fee for water but dont tell you until your bill arrives. 

The bar environment was upbeat and the restaurant side was a nice place to relax. I only saw our server once though. Kind of felt like a free for all, they give you water on the table and leave you be. After dinner our server brought over our reciept and showed us what our bill ""would have been"" if we paid and showed us what we could tip based off the prices we could have been paying. That was a little annoying because we did pay for the food voucher and I felt she didn't deserve a tip, because we only saw her when we were sat and when she cleared our table. Sorry, not leaving a 9 dollar tip when you didn't do anything. We are good tippers when the people treat you equal and do an amazing job.

My husband and I felt that the ""voucher"" food was staged already. One, the food came out in like 10 min, the steaks seemed kind of rubbery, the green beans seemed like the sat in boiling water for too long and the mashed potatoes tasted differently from the food bar was serving.

I feel like the meat variety wasn't as big as other Brazilian buffets I've been to, but again it could be the fuzzy memory.  They sell pitchers of Sangria (for an additional cost) which are great to split with one or two friends.

The only negative part of the experience was paying the bill.  We had some kind of passes from the MGM which were supposed to bring the meal down to $23 per person.

Pros
- They actually serve seafood. Salmon and the shrimp was the best. Mahi Mahi was over cooked. 

Cons
- Portion size is too much. Like another reviewer said, it's all about quantity vs quality. If I'm going to end up paying $130+ for 2 person, I'd stick w Texas De Brazil or Fogo De Chao (it be cheaper and way better food)

- Majority of the meat I had was too well done making it hard and chewy. BBQ pork wreaked of BO aftertaste. Thank goodness it came last cause I lost my appetite. I literally thought the smell was from the waiter but I was wrong lol

- Floor is super slippery

- Bar selection is not great (food and space wise). The layout and area is so small that you have people running into each other. Most places give you certain appetizers (bread, mashed potato and fried banana) but it was served buffet style. The fried banana was gross because it just like they breaded a regular banana vs using plantain.

However, there are a lot more thumbs-down reviews of this place, and having been to many churrascarias, this is among the worst...largely due to the food, but partly due to their latest marketing strategies to pick your pocket.

The full name of this place is ""Pampas Brazilian Grille"" and you'll find it squirreled away in a remote corner of the ""Miracle Mile"" shops inside the Planet Hollywood complex adjacent to a nondescript door on Harmon Avenue.  They are prevalent with many of the online discounters, so we chose (and you should too!) to purchase a voucher on TravelZoo, dinner for FOUR ($94 - $10 code I found online) = $84.  That also includes one bottle of ""house wine,"" or they'll give you $32 against any other wine they carry. We passed once we looked at the overpriced wine listed.  Still sounds like a great deal though, huh?

Of course, the waiter is all about upselling you from your low-priced voucher the minute you sit down, so be sure to get your friendly-but-firm face on to defer his suggestions.  The salad bar here is very ordinary--in fact, not even as good as a decent Las Vegas hotel buffet--and certainly pales in comparison to other churrascarias in town.  Most of these places are known for the astounding arrays in their salad bars, and you literally have to be careful not to fill up on all that, so you'll have room for the more expensive main course: MEAT!

Their MEAT:  Regrettably, we were served uniformly poor cuts of almost everything they offer.  When's the last time you had ""filet mignon"" (if that's what it really was) that was full of gristle, hard to cut and worse to chew? So disappointing, and DISGUSTING!  The series of other beef cuts were equally awful, either due to lack of seasoning or poor cooking (either way overcooked or raw inside), with the exception of their ""house special""--a top sirloin cooked about right with an appealing outer seasoning.  The bacon-wrapped chicken breast was also edible, but so what--it's just chicken.  I ended up filling up mostly on salad and mashed potatoes when I sasw where this was going.  A member of our party had to ask a couple of times for lamb (I passed), but said it was definitely not worth the wait.  I had lamb once at Texas de Brasil (another terrible churrascaria restaurant in Vegas) that was so gamey\/nasty, I literally ran to the bathroom to vomit. I swore to myself: never again.

Anyway, at $22 per person (before the extra charges and tip), I guess we got about what we would expect, but really didn't consider it a great value (or a very good meal), and certainly glad we didn't pay more than we did.  When the waiter brought the check, it included sales tax (about $6, not included with the voucher) and a ""water conservation fee"" of $1 per person (?) = $4. No explanation on that one (seems like another BS charge to me), considering that they are just serving tap water in some weird decanter.  Is this a city\/county mandated fee that goes into conserving water there?

Our not-very-personable, mostly inattentive waiter then proceeds to point out that if we had paid full price, the bill would be ~$230, and the suggested tip would be 20% = ~$45!!  He wanted to stand right there in front of me while I filled out that tip amount to be included on my credit card charge.  Good luck with that strategy, my friend.  I told him to bring me the charge slip just for the tax and ""water conservation"" fee.  I left a $30 cash tip, concluding that was more than generous for the very minimal amount of time he and his meat-serving, deadbrained buddies spent on us (don't bother to ask those clowns for anything...they'll say no problem and that's the end of that).  

Bottom line: bad food, tourist trap...steer clear, mateys!",4,1,0

Now I actually like the concept, lots of meats, cooked well, full of flavor...And way over priced....

I love meat, beef, pork, chicken, hell give me deep fried budgie (google it Americans) in garlic and I would be happy.

So I am left conflicted, lots of good meat...for a price that's lets face it folks, in Vegas you can get a very good steak for, i'm sorry, but when these restaurants started showing up in Vegas dinner was $25 -$30, now they are $50 and up...Seriously, look long and hard at what you are getting, they just don't make sense...But I let the wife pick dinner...

So, after a quick ""no"", ""But you said I could pick"" conversation she headed of to groupon, where she came across a deal for this place....Plus she had a credit with groupon that covered the cost...

Ok meat plus a meal I had already payed for..Works for me.

Service was good, seated quickly, waiter friendly, diet coke delivered quickly, though the refill took time to come...

But it's the food you want to know about....Well frankly, the meal was ""free""...And I think we were charged to much.

The meats were dry, the fish were cooked to death, the shrimp tasteless.

The one saving grace was desert (yes we went to an all you can eat meat place and still wanted dessert, that should tell you something)...I had the tiramisu, the wife had the cheesecake, they were both very good.

In the end there are far better Brazilian steak houses in town.",5,0,1

We ordered the salad bar, meats (5-7 different meat) and seafood (only shrimp) and while ordering the 2 hours of unlimited drinks, the server said, please be patient on the drinks as we do not have a bartender and so he would also be making our drinks. We just ordered a pitcher of mimosas to make is easy on the server. The mimosas was about 3\/4 orange juice and very little champagne. The salad bar was a joke, the food was all cold (suppose to be hot). Most plates were dirty and the soup was marked wrong. There were some cheese rolls that was so hard. All of the meat that came around was either under cooked or over cooked. The shrimp was still shelled and awful. The server had to be chased down several times. My wife observed them reheating most of the food. We contacted the manager who really showed no concern. It was as though this was not the first time this had happen.

All the negative reviews are very true.  If you've been to another Brazilian restaurant, this will be a huge huge disappointment.  To boot, it is overpriced for the food quality and variety -- think about it, if over 50% of the diners have half-off certificates, it's because they're tourists and have never eaten here.

I apologize for being so negative, I usually try to find the good in establishments but there isn't much good here.  The best part of my dining experience was my server, Cynthia (she was absolutely awesome!) and the fried cod (from my seafood option).  Yes, the fried fish was the best part in a Brazilian restaurant.

My experience as a diner started out, on a 105-degree day, of the maitreD insisting on seating me as the 2-person table at the far end of the bar (farthest away from servers too!)-- facing the mall hallway and 100 feet away from the outside doors facing the heat.  When I noticed the heat and sweated immediately, she told me that it was airconditioned (as if it was my imagination).  This was early, too, around 530 p.m. with restaurant 80% empty.  Not only did the meat servers ignore me (being out of the way), but I began sweating even more (hey youre splurging for a supposedly nice meal in a nice restaurant on vacation, that aint right).  I politely asked my server if it was possible to move somewhere cooler and after much discussion with the maitreD (who acted all surprised-shocked that I didnt like my table, doh), they allowed me to move inside where it was 15 degrees cooler at least.

I wish I could say that the dining experience was tremendous free there on.  I really wish.  But other than my server's attentiveness, it was god-awful.  Honestly for what I ordered (the churrascaria with the surf and turf), I would have been better served by dining at a nice casino buffet like Planet Hollywoods for half the price (take the prime rib, carved turkey carved ham plus the middle-eastern meats and add the seafood dishes with the various salads\/desserts and it's 10x better).

Specific reasons why I am so negative:
1. Horrible Logistics -- Instead of having 3d red-yellow-green wood that a customer can place on a table to indicate whether he wants servers to bring meat, this restaurant uses plastic decals (smaller than a coaster) that lay flat on the table and cant be seen by servers -- thus they breeze right by you table because they cant see that you want food.
2. Poor Maintenance -- They did something to the floors (extra wax???) whereby people were slipping and sliding as they walked to the salad bar or restrooms, which by the way were kinda nasty.
3. Poor Quality and\/or Prepared Food -- which is the main reason
a) Iced Tea -- I asked for unsweetened regular iced tea and received a fruity version (which can cause dietary isues) as the original server (in the bar) didnt feel it necessary to tell me (I thought the tea was rotting or going bad based on the unexpected ""flavoring"").
b) Over-Seasoning to mask either the quality or preparation.  Filet mignon that was tasty if you could get by the intense seasoning...after a few bites I couldn't eat it.  Even the ham tasted like a salt shaker -- I mean, ham is the easiest meat to cook with a little seasoning (if at all) to be flavorful.  On the seafood option, the ahi tuna skewers were all over the place -- sometime cooked just right, sometimes chewey\/overcooked, and so overseasoned it wasnt edible.  Next to the ham, the next easiest (or even easier) item to not screw up is grilled pineapple -- instead, I received thin, tart, hardly grilled pineapple (the kind youd get at Country Buffet).  Even the deep-fried bananas on the salad bar-buffet were soggy and mushy.

Did I speak to management and express these concerns?  No, I figured if they work there and supervise and taste their product, they should have a clue (a manager was going through the restaurant asking patrons regarding their dining experience -- honestly I just wanted to finish and leave and be done with it).  It is what it is....a $20 meal for $50-60.  You decide...but there are so many other wonderful choices for dining in Vegas.",3,4,1

The plate consisted of shrimp, mussels, salmon, and white fish that seem to be tilapia or cod? The salmon and white fish were over cooked, so very dry. Shrimp not too much flavor.

The six meats that were offered consisted of bacon wrapped turkey, sausage, ham with pineapple, spicy chicken, BBQ chicken, pork, and sirloin. The latter were the best items. The beef was cooked to a nice medium rare and juicy. The pork was flavorful and possessed a nice spice rub. The pineapple was something my friend and I wished came around more frequently then once.

Dinner was unlimited Surf and Turf, which is great since I can't deal with just all meat. Lots of option at the salad bar, noodles, greens, fruits, you name it. The meat kept coming, said NO to chicken and pork but sampled the beef, lamb, salmon, shrimp. The grilled pineapple tasted so good, a refreshing taste after the lamb. Pitchers of regular mojito, raspberry mojito and margarita kept coming as well. I said NO to dessert, I just couldn't anymore but YES to coffee and what a strong coffee it was.  I had a great time in the company of friends, excellent food and good service at this place. I just wish I had a bigger appetite to enjoy all the meat. :)

My date and I waited 10 min for our reservation. Patiently waiting to meet or server, the $25 open bar drink package, 1st drink,
came to our table 20 min later and one was incorrect. We recurve our water which had a film of grease on the top level. Our first round of meat I asked for rare and was given well done. I waited an additional 10 min for the meat and correct temperate. We order the Surf & Turf meal option which came with small peel and eat shrimp, tilapia, as very hard piece of Mahi Mahi and muscles. I must say the muscles were good, I ordered another order which NEVER came. Due to the slow service we were only able to order 2 drinks on the package. I asked to speak to the manager and all that was offered was for me to return tomorrow night or when I'd like to for compensation. I shared that with all of this competition in Vegas and the fact I usually go to Fogo de Chao which happens to be right around the corner (even more of a reason to on top of your restaurant) I did not wish to return but since we didn't finish our meals and had to leave to catch our show it would be nice to have this meal comped for our dining experience. Corporate, working the flood that evening, explained I would have to go back to Groupon to try to get a refund. I spoke with two other tables around me and they too said they are having ""an awful"" experience. When I spoke with the woman from corporate before leaving I shared how upset I was, the fact that nothing was able to be done for me at that moment was absolutely ridiculous. I pulled two random servers aside and asked if this is how the restaurant is and they said yes. I shared my apologies to them for having to work in such an establishment and they too responded, ""yes, this place isn't the greatest"". When I asked who was about corporate that was there and that id like their info as we are now running late for our show, she said ""you'll have to wait a moment"" and rolled her eyes at me. We waited per her request until she was finished with 3 other servers at a computer. She came back with the Managing Partner's business care whom I have every intentions on calling. Being s local and having a culinary degree, family owned restaurants, many many friends in the casino host business and a food critic I would never recommend this establishment when Fogo de Chao is around the corner. 

What is advertised on Groupon and what actually shows up is false advertisement since nothing looked the way they had  advertised it. 

So at the end of the day, we had to wait after making a reservation, dirty glasses and water, over cooked meat, paid $99 for two which includes surf & turf (never came with a second round of muscles I ordered). unlimited drinks for an hour (only was brought 2 drinks - one of which i had to track down someone to have them make me a 2nd drink, and dessert (which we were never offered).

I can go on and on about this place about how unhappy I was. Not only did Pampas ruin my date night with a terrible dinner, they also robbed me of my $99 for the meal since I wasn't told nothing could be done for me and I'd have to contact Groupon. 

I have every intention of contacting the Managing Partner, Groupon, and Corporate. Furthermore, being a local and knowing individuals that can refer business I have ever intention to share my story and the photos I took of our experience.",11,0,0

We had enough money to take desserts and stuff to go. Flash forward to now. We spent the weekend in Vegas with another couple and I recommended pampas for their night alone and my boyfriend loved it so much he wanted to come back too. This time our experience was different. The salad bar seemed lacking. The meats were just passing us by. Instead of being stuffed line the first time we barely got to try each meat once. I don't think we even got to try every meat. The same sausage kept coming to our table even though we didn't like it. But the sirloin and good stuff only came around once. I also don't like how they charge you for tap water but don't say that. Apparently it was printed on the menu. I didn't get upset at the time because they didn't charge us for our beer and iced tea but now I'm thinking the meal we ordered must have included beverages or open bar or something because the menu price is $50 but with the bogo coupon I had they charged us $80. I have mixed feelings about this place. Try it if you have a coupon and know what to expect. But we will not return

We chose this place to have lunch and were pretty excited to have the ""ulitmate dining experience"".  It was pretty disappointing from the moment we walked in.  We approached the hostess upon arrival and were brought to a a table outside in the mall area.  We asked for a table inside and were told all other tables were full (the place was empty).  We assumed that the hostess had been told by management to seat everyone outside the place first to make it appear to be busy.  We then went up to another hostess and again requested a table inside.  She was very rude and reluctantly allowed us to take another table.  Needless to say the hostesses were awful.

The waitress was slow and not overly friendly.  The atmosphere was cheap and almost reminded me of a mexican chain.

The salad bar was okay.  I highly recommend NOT ordering the seafood as it was awful.  The crab cakes came directly from the freezer and the shrimp was chewy.  I was also disappointed they didn't have plantains, instead serving fried bananas in their place.

Terrible, bland meats that are cooked until inedible.  Both of us were queasy all evening after eating there.  I suppose you could just do the buffet and be okay, but the grilled meats are very poorly prepared, and very low quality.

The waiter was very good, and trying his best, but after we spoke to the manager who removed the $10 upgrade from our meal (was included in our vacation package), he whispered to us, ""I totally agree with you!""

If you haven't been to a churrascaria, it's an all you can eat affair where there's a nice salad bar and a few side dishes - but instead of a buffet, the staff bring large skewers of meat around to your table.  Most places have a signal (like a coaster) that says ""more please"" or ""I'm still chewing"".

I guess I'm spoiled by Fogo de Chao.  I have visited the DC location several times and it has become a favorite stop for me and many of my traveling buddies.  Pampas is the same concept, except executed with value in mind.  Said differently, Target and ShopKo are both variety stores, but I'm pretty sure most people would much rather go to Target if given a choice.  Pampas is the ShopKo here - a little less quality, a little cheaper, and a lower atmosphere factor.

The meat is OK - certainly comparable to the stuff served at Outback or any other chain restaurant and is a little over seasoned.  The preparation is good, but not great.  The salad bar was pretty fresh and had a reasonable variety.

We were seated quickly and reasonably well attended to by the friendly staff.  We had to wait a bit on some of the meats, but not enough to complain about it.  The convenient location is nice, as are the short waits.

I'm on the fence with the stars here.  Certainly, I could go 3 in terms of overall quality and experience, but it's the value quotient here that leaves me cold.  If you can score this for $25 - it's an easy 3-star experience.  If you get suckered in for $40, then it's a bust down to two stars.",1,0,0

The seasons are on the outside of the meat before they cut it off the skewers.  Be sure to cut bites so you get the seasoning otherwise the meats pretty normal. The grilled pineapple was something sweet to breakup all the meat.    We also liked the ""salad"" bar. Not much average salad stuff, but lots of yummy pasta salads, heart of palm, artichoke, smoked salmon. Even the ice tea was amazing! 

If you like to try new things, this is the place to go. Don't bother with the chocolate cake though... it was dry and boring. We went at about 5:30pm. We were seated right away and the service was great.",1,0,0

This was the worst experience from the word go!
We went here on time share coupons and and our waiter was completely inattentive and just didn't care to deal with us. His push was for a ""double"" on my cocktail out the door, which came immediately, and it took a good 10-15 minutes for the rest of our party to get their drinks.. That was how it started from there on timing was horrible... Meat started coming before we were ready and signaled as such. 
The shrimp was not deveined ( major
Poop vein) and the mussels were very overcooked and rubbery so they were essentially inedible. 
And then there was dessert, we ordered coffee and espresso first then the tiramisu. The tiramisu was soggy and lackluster at best. The worst part is that we completely finished out tiramisu before the coffee ever arrived. 
When we received the bill we had some questions and our waiter was bit snotty about having to answer them. 
Then came the final straw, card was used to pay bill( tip was in cash) when we received the charge slip back for signature a  "" mandatory gratuity"" had been added to the charge slip and he had kept the cash. 
We took this to the manger who looked bewildered and lost as we explained the situation. 
In the end we got our cash tip back and left unhappy and very dissatisfied.

To be perfectly honest and frank, I have been to several Brazillian grilles in the past and this falls to the bottom of the list. The meats were inconsistent in terms of quality, often under or overcooked. My girlfriend and I went for lunch on our last day in vegas, and lunch had 7 meats. We were very dissapointed in those options. We also got to try their filet mignon wrapped on bacon, and it was the cheapest quality filet I ever have had. Hailing from a place near the water, my girlfriend and I are used to quality seafood. The surf and turf option is something to avoid at all costs. Even if you were able to get it half off, still avoid it. My girlfriend and I are feeling horrible right now and we are pretty sure it is from the seafood. The bottom of one of the pieces of fish looked like a piece of moldy trash. The shrimp obviously was older and had been previously frozen. The mussels, I believe, were the cause of our current discomfort, and should be avoided as they may cause food posioning, the jury is still out on that though. Lastly, the buffet bar is small compared the other Brazillian Grilles I have been to, and does not have very many options. 

The atmosphere was odd, as the music choices varied from sad and monotomic to hard rock, with little to enhance the authenticity of the establishment and its brazillian heritage. Service was ok, but nothing spectacular. The servers of the various meats often gave poor pieces, rarely giving center cuts. They also came around sparingly at times, as only 2 were working from 3:30 to 4:45 that we could tell. Our waiter, Rigo, was nice so this review is on indicative of his job. Rather, it is indicative of the chefs and management of the establishment. 

All in all, unless you can get a discount and eat here for less than 20$ a person, don't  even bother checking this place out. And remember, AVOID THE SEAFOOD.",0,0,0

I've been to a couple different Brazilian churrascaria's before and this was probably the worst that I've had.  I expect more from Vegas.  Perhaps it was that we were having a late lunch and were in between their lunch and dinner meats, but this assumption still doesn't make up for the poor tasting food, horrible service, and price.

Atmosphere:
The restaurant itself looks great and has a nice ambiance.  The bar has several drink selections to choose from as well as you wait.  The restaurant is hidden between a couple others within the Miracle Mile shops located in Planet Hollywood, and to me can stay hidden.

Food:
We had a party of 4.  3 had the meat plates and I had the mix plate of both meat and seafood.  I was in the mood for some good surf and turf!  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.

As with most typical Brazilian churascarias an all you can eat buffet style bar was available for salads, side dishes, and appetizers.  The selection was not too bad with some pasta salad, rice, beans, and even fried banana.  This banana was probably my favorite treat of the meal.

The meat I found to be very dry.  We sampled all the meats from the filet to the sausage and none of them blew my mind or were exceptionally good.  The filet mignon was the best one by far and was not a great as most steak houses.

The seafood comes all at 1 time with 3 bacon-wrapped scallops, 3 grilled shrimps, a piece of salmon, and a piece of fried fish.  You have to specifically ask for more of the seafood from your waitress, but more on that later.  The flavors were ok for the salmon, scallops, and shrimp.  Just not phenomenal.

Service:
We were greeted upon entering with a smile and that's always a plus.  We were then offered a tour of the kitchen.  Sure why not...the tour is nothing to jump at as you take a few steps through a small corridor into the kitchen and see all the meats cooking above a vat of fatty grease.  This alone should of killed my appetite, but then again I'll pretty much eat anything at anytime.  I guess they wanted to show how cool the cooking process was???  Or maybe they want you to be grossed out so you don't eat as much?

Here is the biggest gripe the service from the waitress.  She took forever to just take our orders.  The food then took even longer to come out.  I thought that meat would come and go until we had to ""tap out"" due to over consumption.  No it came every few minutes or so as my belly filled with side dishes.  We specifically requested the filet mignon on 3 separate occasions and it seemed to come out just as the check came out...I'm on to your cost savings plan!

Price:
We were given the lunch menu as we sat a little before 3PM and the plates are slightly cheaper than the dinner menu.  But of course when the bill came we were charged the dinner prices.  We quickly mentioned it to the waitress that gave us slight attitude before changing the prices back.

Lunch price is fair.

Not too impressed with the skewered meats, most were overcooked and dry, but the bacon wrapped filet was awesome.   Even when asking the skewer servers for a med rare slice, a small piece or any request, they gave you whatever they wanted to.   The specialty meat was a grass fed sirloin, mine was very tasteless and chewy but my friend enjoyed his slice.

We told her we were not tipping on pre discounted amount. I told her it was bulls*** that my cousin was being charged $15+ on a discounted amount of $15+.

While walking up to the entrance, I noticed the greeter passing out coupons to people passing by. When we came up, she asked us if we had reservations. We did. She tried to discreetly hide the coupons and led us to the table. When I inquired about the coupons, she acted very annoyed and was hesitant to hand one over. So what? Just because we already had plans to eat here meant we weren't allowed to get a discount? I did not like her attitude at all. 

The waiter was decent, but was not especially helpful. He did what was required, explaining the menu and keeping our water glasses filled. 

We were able to go to their buffet for side dishes, and the meat dishes were brought to the table. The side dishes weren't impressive and they were very slow in bringing the meat rodizio around. There were only two guys walking around at a time, then they would disappear, and it was quite a wait in between until they came out with new meat entrees. The food was ok but nothing spectacular, also a little on the salty side. 

My boyfriend ordered the meat rodizio while I ordered the seafood rodizio. They brought out a tiny dish with 3 scallops the size of nickels!!!!!!! The salmon and cod were the size of half a deck of cards each, and 3 shrimps on a skewer. I had to order at least 3 orders. I understand that maybe the Gulf oil spill may be limiting seafood choices, but scallops as small as nickels???? For $45??? That was pathetic.

I was ok with a nice dinner in Vegas and we spent what I expected to spend. But I probably wouldn't return to this specific brazilian steakhouse. I might try ones with better ratings. If anything, maybe one that has nicer people.",0,0,0

Briana at Pampas communicated well with all the details. She gave us several options on how to reserve and pay for our private room.

The private room did not disappoint, in fact the entire comfortable vibe of the room fit our group of seventeen perfectly. Pampas served us several different types and cuts for meat. The bacon wrapped chicken was our first serving, but only our first. We enjoyed steak, lamb, and more pork. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Our VP is a little picky about his wines. So picky that he is known to send glasses back. At our dinner he liked the wine so much he ordered a total of three bottles for the entire table. Other drinks were provided for everyone as well.

Our private room allowed us to discuss company matters. It allowed us privacy. Yet still, we had some of the most attentive, and ready staff at any place we've eaten.  The next day, everyone shared e-mails together about how great our meals went.

Their salad bar is puny but that could be forgivable since it isn't the main attraction anyway. Right away, however, our waiter seemed to be on a pressure-tactic to try and upgrade us to some surf-n-turf mumbojumbo that we had no interest in. When we politely declined, he seemed to visibly dismiss us but didn't miss a beat to try and slickly pressure us into buying bottled water. I'm not a fan of tap water anyway, so it was no big deal, but he definitely came off as a used car sales rep-level slimy.

The gauchos came around once and....that was about it. We were really early for dinner, right at 5, and there weren't many other people there, so it was really puzzling to me as to why they couldn't be found. I wanted more of the steak and fatty meats, but they only ones that came by a second time were the dry chicken guys and the underwhelming sausage dudes. Since we had a show to catch at 630, we really couldn't linger anyway. 

All in all, I wouldn't come back here - the meat was too rare, the service was lacking, the cold food was bland without enough variety, and I wasn't satisfied. The one standout was the Brazilian lemonade - we couldn't get enough.

Oh yeah - they will come by and try and take a picture of you before you leave, ""Complimentary souvenir postcard.""

The couple next to us raved about the food and especially the meat skewers; they each having ordered the $55 each meat and seafood options. The menu was rather simple - the options being an unlimited meat-only dinner with salad bar for $40, or a meat and seafood option with salad bar for $55, or simply the salad bar for $19.95 each. Being a vegetarian married to a carnivore, the meat-lover in my husband was actually quite fulfilled by the abundance of fish, clams, and calamari on the salad bar, so we each ordered it. The vegetarian in me was very satisfied and surprised with what the salad bar had to offer (and its cheaper price compared to everything else on the menu!); it actually was very similar to a Whole Foods or Wild Oats salad bar - great selection of couscous', feta cheese and olives, salad, etc, in addition to fish and soups. I ate to my full and then some, as did my husband. Though we can't comment on the meat skewers, the $19.95 salad bar was actually worth it (especially with the discount coupon!). This is one of the most expensive restaurants within the Miracle Mile Mall, but one of the most delicious. 
Go to Pampas if: You are a carnivore or a vegetarian; you don't mind paying $20 for a fabulous salad bar or $50 for an entree; you enjoy a clean, classy atmosphere; you want lots of meat!
Don't go to Pampas if: You are on a budget!",3,1,1

You can stuff yourself to oblivion and no one can stop you.  The salad bar was full of unique salads and the freshest ingredients.  I could fill up on the salad bar alone.  There is a flag stand for your table that you display green which notifies the meat servers to stop by your table to slice off your next portion.  When you can't eat anymore, simply flip the stand to red, which means no more.

My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, and there are so many.  Comfortable atmosphere.  Not pretentious.  Nice lighting.  A woman from Ukraine went table to table asking if you want a photograph.  One is complimentary for your visit, but she also sells them.  

Wonderful restaurant in the Miracle Mile mall.  I would highly recommend to anyone wanting a quality all-you-can-it meal in LV.

Let me say that the food was okay...not great but good. The Buffett was stocked, fresh, and had a few tasty options. The meat was served promptly but some of it was not cooked properly. For example, undercooked bacon wrapped around a few of the steaks choices. My major issue was with the service or lack there of. I was very disappointed to find that we were supposed to squeeze 20 people into a tiny room where the chairs literally touched each other. Because it was my wedding night, my family decided to ask for a manager in hopes that perhaps they could add another table or suggest another area that can actually fit 20 people. The manager asked to speak with me (middle-aged Hispanic man) and when I told him our issue with seating he replied with ""well you only paid $150 for the room.""  Nevermind that we paid over $60 per head for everyone I guess... After I picked my jaw up off the floor from hearing this, I calmly walked away and let him know that I would contact my wedding Coordinator to pass on his response.

My party of 6 called for a dinner reservation prior to 6 pm and was told it was unnecessary.  We had a very long night prior and did not wake to have breakfast or lunch.  We were famished as our last meal was the evening before.  We arrived at 7:45 pm and was told our wait would be approximately 20 minutes.  An hour later, we were seated.  A wonderful gentleman (the food runner, I assume) assisted my party and I.  He was very attentive and amiable.  Unfortunately, he was the only one who was such.  This gentleman filled our glasses immediately as we sat.  And we sat, and we sat.  And we stared at our 6 glasses of water.  A server never came.  We thought we were lucky when the manager stated he would assist and tend to our table.  Then we saw him walk out with his backpack and we were again left with no server.  

The entire Pampas dining experience was HORRID.  We came to celebrate the birthday of a person in my party and her happiest moment was when we left.  At 10:30 pm.  This is when the party begins...

Birthday girl doesn't feel well and returns to the room to lay down.  One member of the party has bubble gut and excuses herself.  Another member utilizes liquid courage to help with her stomach pains as I sit in the casino drinking nothing but water and a can of Sugar Free Red Bull to ease the aching.  I proceeded to throw up 3 times in the restroom of the casino, 5 times on the floor of the casino, and 3 more times at the emergency room.  Though the rest of my party was also sick, my sickness was much more magnified due to my Type 1 Diabetes and the fear of any other underlying issues.  

ER Copay:  $150
Missing departure flight:  $220
Being a vegetarian at Pampas:  PRICELESS
(The 2 members who did not fall ill were vegetarians)

Two nights in the hospital, I missed my return flight home, 6.5 months later and my stomach still isn't the same.  I've travelled all over the world, eaten overseas, never had ANY issues as it relates to having a sensitive tummy.  Somehow, Pampas got us -- me, especially.  

This review is not only a reflection of the FOOD and the SERVICE, but also the lack of good MANAGEMENT.  The day I was released from the hospital, I called to speak with Pampas' management to inform them of my party's issue.  My name and number was given.  That was February 19th, 2016.  I called two separate times and to this day, have not heard from one member of management.

Our plates were cleared once, and our server had to pause and move around some dishes to place our dessert on the table. Our table had ordered one cocktail and a beer, but it was not brought until halfway through the meal.

Overall, there are so many better places to go for the cost I would not recommend this resultant at all.

If you want good Brazilian BBQ just go to Texas de Brazil. Its not that this place is bad, its just put to shame by Texas de Brazil. Atmosphere here is more like buffet, while TdB is upscale restaurant. You could impress a date at TdB not Pampas. Service was about equal, but i don't ask for much at Brazilian BBQ, just stop by with meats frequently and don't leave me waiting when I am ready to go. Both places accomplished that. 

Ultimately the meat is what really differentiates the star status for these to for me. TdB just seemed fresher and better cooked. Most of my meats were overcooked at Pampas here. At TdB the meat guys (is that what they are called? Eh I'll go with it) at least tell you if meat is cooked med. rare, med. or well done. At Pampas i was left guessing with most of them seeming well done, while I am a medium rare fan. The only thing cooked proper to me was Pampas's Sirloin. The filet, lamb and everything else was all over cooked. Also Salad bar is better at TdB.

Times Square, Hollywood Blvd, and the Las Vegas Strip. What do they all have in common? Crap food served at chain restaurants. I don't understand why people travel thousands of miles and end up eating at a restaurant that has a location around the corner from their home. While checking out some show tickets we asked one of the employees about some good lunch places that are different than any chain restaurants. It was lunch so we were looking for something cheap, but tasty. The guy told us about a Brazilian restaurant called Pampas that's inside Planet Hollywood.

It's no secret, the hotels on the Strip are massive and act like a maze in order to force you to walk past as many slots, tables, souvenir stands, and other money wasters as possible. It just so happened that Pampas is at the very end of Planet Hollywood. Nice.

We were given coupons for $5 off which includes their salad lunch buffet and the meat rodizio. Normally this is $20 which is pretty cheap, but the coupon makes it even better. Our server gave us a green and red card thing and we were told to flip it to the green side when we get back from the buffet and the meat carvers will start making their rounds to our table.

The ""salad"" buffet was amazing but it didn't have too much salad which is fine with me. There was a few different pastas, vegetables, cheeses, and a couple types of salad. I'm not going to lie though, my favorite thing at the buffet were the squares of feta cheese. I downed at least fifteen of those awesome squares of happiness. Also, they had slices of salami which were fantastic.

I'm not much of a carnivore, but every time one of the meat carvers came over I got extremely happy. The choices included smoked ham, bar-b-q chicken, spicy chicken, bacon wrapped turkey, sausage, bar-b-q pork, and sirloin. The best ones in my opinion were the sirloin and sausage. I couldn't try the bacon wrapped turkey though because of my stupid allergies. Dumb. One other option they had was grilled pineapple which was just as delicious.

This is definitely a restaurant that makes sure your tummy leaves happy. The ""all you can eat"" style usually fails miserably in regards to taste. However, Pampas seemed to excel higher than any other restaurant I've been to of its nature.

It took a while for the meat carvers to come around our way, we rarely saw our waiter, and when we did get some meat it was mediocre. The taste was bland, meat was chewy and it was not hot or even warm.

The salad bar is small than most places I am use to.  However, I must hand it to their salad with the crasins with the option of strawberry or ranch dressing.  It was delicious with strawberry dressing.  Their muffins are dry.  Their fried bananas are meh.  

During lunch, they only serve seven meats--ham and pineapple, sausage, spicy chicken, barbeque chicken, turkey wrapped in bacon, and two other meats I cannot remember.  They do not have my favorites-- filet mignon wrapped in bacon and sausage with melted cheese.   The pineapple is very juicy and delicious.  For some reason, their pineapple tasted juicier than Rei Do Gado or Texas de Brazil.

In San Diego, they serve more than seven meats with filet mignon wrapped in bacon and sausage with melted cheese during lunch.  Thank God my boyfriend and I had a lunch voucher.

The service was terrible.  It appeared to be open seating as no one said anything to us as we walked in.  No welcome, no one offering to help us find a seat even though they had the restaurant nearly pitch black for the dj lighting affects.  We had chosen to sit at a table near the dance area.  The girl that finally came to take a drink order after about 20 minutes would not even speak English, she kept trying to talk to is in Spanish... Not sure if that was because my fiancé is latin, but it was a little frustrating because the music was very loud, and hard to hear her.  Then she didn't even bring my fiancé what he had asked for :(!!! We got up to dance a little and the manager began to give our table away, when we let him know that we were sitting there he very rudely informed us that those tables were for bottle service only.  So we moved... Even our drinks because the waitress didn't inform us of that.  

The dj however was pretty good.  The only thing we didn't like was that he played several of the same genre of song in a row.  But the salsa songs, merengue songs, and bachata he played were great!  Great music.  That dj should consider playing at a place with a legitimate dance floor and better service.

I sure do love rodizzio style. there is quite the selection of meats being continually brought out. This is awesome b\/c you are continually being served hot meats (no homo lol). My favorites are the bacon wrapped turkey, the sausage and their grilled pineapple. They also have some various steak cuts, chicken, ham, etc. The one complaint we would have is all their meats are consistently 
salty. It could just be us though b\/c we tend to eat low sodium meals.

My tips would be these....
1) Don't waste your $ on the seafood upgrade. For what they offer it's definitely not worth the money. i will admit the ahi was good but that's it. The one item they offered that we were looking the most forward to were the shrimp and they came out dry as eff. Complete and utter let down. Service here is always on point unlike Texas de Brazil who consistently have the worst hostesses. 
2) Go to discount tix tonight and pick up your meal voucher for a fraction of the cost or keep your eyes peeled on Groupon for a 2 4 1 voucher that usually includes 2 drinks to boot! Lunch is until 4:30 so have a late lunch and call it an early dinner to save some $ :)

First off, we only go there for lunch, before 4pm. So I can't tell you  what the place is like for dinner. But I have been there for lunch going into dinner and the only difference we noticed was a couple of extra meats we didn't care for. 
Anyway. Even if we had to pay the full price of $20 for lunch (meat only) we would still go very week like we do. However we bought a dozen $25 off $37.50 or more coupons with our air miles from restaurant.com. This makes our bill $16.22 w\/ tax for the both of us. With a $6 tip it's $22 for an excellent all you can eat Brazilian lunch. You can't get a buffet on the strip for this amount, nor most fast food joints in the mall. 
Amazon locals is an excellent site you ought to get emails from. They often have coupons for sale for this place. They often cost $4 for the $25 coupon. Which still would make your bill only $20.22 for two of you.

I believe the restaurant is in a crap location, this is why it has to do so many promotions in many areas. It's in the mile of shops at Planet Hollywood, kind of at the back of a row of restaurants on the north side of the mall  by the rainstorm mess of a show.

Now to the food.
Salad bar is at the back of the restaurant and kinda tight, but the food is awesome. My boyfriend loved the marinated carrots. I love the large meatball sized mozzerella balls and salads.
The meats come out on skewers from the staff who are often and many. I would say there are seven or eight different things on a regular rotation; pineapple, bacon wrapped chicken & sausage, flank steak, BBQ pork, sirloin steak (my favorite) chicken legs (pretty large too) and I think there's something else that I can't remember. Any way, we have never been disappointed with the food. If the meat comes out too raw, just ask your server to get it cooked more. I hate it when I read on here that the food came out to rare. I like it that way, but my boyfriend doesn't, so we always ask for a better cooked piece of the steak and they come right back with it. Just ask people, don't wine if you can't be bothered to open your mouth and ask.

I think this place goes through a tonn of staff as we have been 10 weeks in a row and never had the same wait person twice. However, they are all good and attentive. Never had a problem with the food or the staff. Will continue to frequent this place every week until we get bored with it....which will be never.",3,2,0

We were seated at an out of the way table, and I was immediately worried that service would suffer as a result, but we were never left waiting for more meat.

The wine was great, and the owner even came by to chat with us for a little bit and tell us a joke about the little ""yes please""\/""no thank you"" button you use to signal whether or not you want more food, after which he gave us $5 off our next bottle of wine.  It's generally a great marketing trick to get you to buy more wine, but we'd already decided to have another bottle anyway, so it just felt like a nice gesture.

The salad bar was a little on the small side, but frankly I didn't care.  That wasn't what I was there for.

Adding to that was there really wasn't any in-between as far as ""done"" goes...rare or well...nothing else.  

The beefs were OK, the lamb was good, the chicken was too salty, the shrimp were disappointing, the scallops were a bit underdone...not what you expect for $40\/pp.

However, the experience was still less than stellar and of 3 Brazillian steakhouses we have been to, this is definitely in the bottom third. 

First, they don't bother to tell you they charge for water - they just put it on your bill. We ordered drinks and they still brought water, then they surreptitiously added it to the bill with no notice or explantion!  This would be consumer fraud in California, but in Nevada, where their clientele are mainly tourists, I guess they can get away with it. 

The buffet was barely warm, this just after opening and the bread old (maybe yesterday's leftovers?).  Meat service was very lacking, and they seated us at the wrong end of the restaurant (near the bar).  Meat selection was minimal with an almost complete lack of variety, and we were at the end of the carving route, so by the time the meat got to us, we only got the inside cuts near the skewers with no crust.  The meat was cold, tough, had no seasoning, and requests were ignored.  When a sausage skewer came out, I asked for 3 pieces, but was ignored - only got 2. Meat service was slow, coming by only every 10-15 minutes.

They still come by with a hard sell to take and sell a photo or two - pretty  irritating.

In short, if you live in the Bay Area, don't bother.  There is no need to go to Las Vegas to eat Brazillian Barbeque.  Fogo in the bay area is a much better value with better food, even if twice the cost.  Miracle Mile has several restaurants, and next time, we will go elsewhere.",1,1,0

Although I didn't have the full Brazilian experience, my friend did and have me her opinion. Most of the meats served were dry and flavorless, even with bacon! How does that happen? I love bacon!!!! The chicken and other non steak options will be your best bet. I got salmon with green beans and ate from the bar all for free, and I'd say it was with it, lol. However, I wouldn't see myself posting $30-$40 to come eat here. The salad bar is great. My favorite items were couscous salad, corn salad, meatballs, and the plantain.

We had also received a coupon for buy one, get one free dinner that includes the meat and shrimp.  The walk up wait was about 40 minutes on Saturday night, not bad being it is inside the Plant Hollywood shops, we just went shopping while we waited.  The service was good, the food was great, impressed with the selection of different meats that the waiters kept bringing around.  The Filet Mignon was delicious.  The drinks were fabulous and you also get an all you can eat buffet that includes salads, breads and pastas.  The only thing I really thought was odd was that in order to use the buy one, get one free coupon, you had to order two drinks, which you had to choose from their menu of outrageously expensive drinks, about 15 bucks each, so you don't really get any money off the dinner at all when you add that in.  Since I was willing to drink anyways, it wasn't that big of a deal, but some may not want drinks, which makes for kind of a letdown.

Apparently they gave our table away so I made one hell of a fuss (It was a $500 ticket for gods sake, give me some damn service, I even set a reservation to avoid this, get your freaking crap together) and they ended up redeeming themselves by placing us in a private room of sorts. Besides the getting in and getting seated which was a nightmare, the rest of the experience was amazing. The food was superb and I left satisfied.

Nearly every step of the visit was off, starting with our seating. We had 4 PM reservations, as much to enjoy the food and its unique presentation as to be able to beat any Friday night crowd. When we approached the exterior host\/hostess stand, we found no one there, which was fine as there wasn't a line, only us. We walked into the interior host\/hostess stand and waited for someone. Again, no staff member. When we were ""greeted,"" the staffer acted annoyed, as if we'd disturbed her by making reservations AND arriving for them. Despite absolutely no one else waiting to be seated and literally tens of open tables, we were told to wait. We waited for 15 minutes for no apparent reason and the person who seated us was only slightly more friendly than the first staff member. 

Our waiter was nice, which was a pleasant change, but other than bringing our drinks and clearing plates (not particularly efficiently, by the way), he really did nothing more. In the area in which I live, the two Brazilian steakhouses offer much more engaged wait staff. This is important because Pampas literally prints what you should tip on the bill. Not the usual 15%, 20%, 25% amounts, but a literal ""You're bill is X. The tip is X."" As someone who wait tables to pay off her grad school debt, I'm a damn good tipper - WHEN I GET SERVICE. Our waiter, who treated us no differently than the other tables in our section, took a drink order, refilled our water (also, don't drink water at this place - there's a ""Water Conservation Fee"" that isn't revealed until you get your bill. While I agree that the Southwest is close to water crisis mode, pulling this without informing customers is just shady) and only sometimes cleared plates from a crowded two top. When we wanted to leave, we waited 35 minutes for the bill. For this ""service,"" we had to give the guy $33. 

We had a Groupon that, according to both Groupon and Pampas websites, was the equivalent of $142 in food and beverage. The ""Surf and Turf"" option was to include eight meat selections, four seafood options and ""more than 50 hot and cold side and salad choices, "" according to the Groupon description. Um, no. As to the salad and sides, the only way anyone is getting to fifty is by making roughly 30 odd salads with various toppings or considering plain mashed potatoes one option and mashed potatoes with butter or gravy another. While I did not count every hot or cold station on the buffet\/bar, my guess is that there are less than 20 stands, but that these contain selections with multiple items, like an antipasti station with a variety of meats, cheeses and vegetables. That does not ""50+"" options make.

On to what these folks believe is worthy of paying close to $60 a head to eat: the meat (and in this case, the seafood). Have you ever been to very run-of-the-mill Asian buffet? If the answer is yes, you've had the equivalent of the salmon, Tilapia and mussels served by Pampas. Every piece tasted over-sauced and looked, tasted and smelled like it was cooked before well we arrived - exactly like a strip mall buffet. Those buffets, however, don't start at $38 per person and tend to be much more satisfying.

The meats, you ask? Only slightly better than the seafood, with the exception of the top sirloin, which was wonderfully flavored and extremely tender for that type of cut. The chicken drumstick I got was so overcooked, the leg bone actually shattered (and scattered, much to my chagrin) when I cut into it. The meat looked desiccated, which was a bad start for the meat course. In the two plus hours we were in the restaurant, only five of the selections (one of which was grilled pineapple) came to the table. Again, this wasn't any different for anyone else in our section, given the immense amount of time we had to observe other tables while we waited for the bill. 

The offer included dessert - frozen cheesecake, purchased in bulk - and two cocktails. I opted for a Caipirinha, the national cocktail of Brazil, an excellent aperitif. While well-made, it was far more boozy than I had hoped, especially since I would be driving. My companion, who had been drinking the night, opted to have a soda. While I get that the deal included two COCKTAILS, we thought it was silly that our waiter didn't switch out the cheaper soft drink for the never ordered second cocktail.

On top of all slowness, weird charges and marginal food, an attractive woman with an accent as beautiful as the rest of her, rolls a heavily stocked bar cart throug the restaurant, slinging drinks (possibly at an upcharge from the bar) tableside. While I enjoy a hustle, especially one with style, was odd at 4:45 PM, in a sparsely seated room. Additionally, while the woman - again, she was lovely and the only staffer with a personality - didn't reek of desperation, the ploy did. Once the bill arrived, we felt like it was a slow, bad tasting, scam.

Our wedding chapel screwed things up and forgot to set the reservations w\/ the restaurant, so we weren't able to get the private room. We figured for the price they were charging, it wasn't worth the money without the privacy, so we ended up going elsewhere. On our 2nd trip back to Vegas, we knew we had to try it and see what could have been.

This was my first Brazilian steakhouse, so I don't have anything else to compare it to. I notice a lot of reviews state that this isn't as good as ___insert another Brazilian steakhouse here___. My review will probably be on the higher side as a result.

The ambiance is beautiful. I really liked how it felt somewhat romantic, but I think it would have been a good spot even for a bunch of friends or family. The waiter boasted of the salad bar but I didn't think that they had a lot of great choices. It was a bit of a let down. The soups were soo good though, as was some of the cold pasta salads, so there was enough for me to eat. (Don't miss out on the cheesy bread either! It was my favorite non-meat item.)

The meats-
-Everything bacon wrapped was delicious, but then again what isn't?
-Sirloin. We had them keep bringing it back. So moist, perfectly seasoned and the definition of a good piece of meat.
-Grilled pineapple. Not really a meat but it was brought out in the same fashion. Loved it! Wish that they served it with the ham though. By the time the ham was brought out, the pineapple guy was nowhere in sight.

All in all, the deliciousness of the meat selection made up for the somewhat lacking salad bar. Now that I've experienced the Brazilian phenomenon, I'm hooked. Can't wait to try another one!",0,0,0

The meats were pretty good. My favorites were the pork, sausage and my fella really enjoyed the sirloin. I found it to be quite good as well.

The restaurant is located in that new miracle mile mall thing, kind of down a short hallway from the main circle.  Upon walking up to the entrance, there were two ladies standing in front.  One lady welcome us and the other asked if we were there because we had a coupon.  It was a little odd, but ok.  We told her that we did have a lunch coupon and she explained that the coupon was only good for a sandwich, but we could do an upgrade for $20 to have the actual Brazilian BBQ.  We opted for that.  

Once we were seated, a woman came to our table with a fancy glass bottle and poured water into a couple of glasses and asked if we wanted something else to drink.  We both ordered iced tea and the Brazilian BBQ meal, which included the buffet area in the back of hot and cold dishes.  They were ok, but nothing to write home about.  We noticed that there was quite a bit of time between ""meat"" guys coming around.  It felt like of like they were hoping you would only sample a couple things and leave.  I could totally be wrong, but that is how it felt.  
About half way through our meal, a lady with a camera approached us and asked if we wanted to have a complimentary photo postcard.  We agreed.  A few minutes later she brought us a print-out of our photo on basic photo paper and began showing us photos of us in little paper frames she was selling for $20.  We kept saying no thank you until she said she would give them both to us for $10.  It was pretty annoying to be propositioned during our meal, but I guess everyone has to have a hustle.  

Another annoyance was the fact that they were vacuuming the room with a loud vacuum while we were trying to enjoy our meal.

At the end of our meal, the bill came and they had charged us for water!  We didn't ask for water, the girl poured it without even asking if we wanted it...and we were charged for it.  My husband was very upset, not really about the $1 added to our bill, but the fact that they would sneak that into our meal.

Location is a little weird in the middle of Miracle Mile, and of course pretty dead in the middle of a weekday. We opted for one of the ""patio"" seats on the outer part of the restaurant. Service was ok, but the server kept mentioning that my date had a big coupon and he'd tack on a birthday dessert for us to meet the requirements to use it. Weird. What if I wasn't supposed to know the date was so cheap?! lol

At any rate, we got up to do the salad bar thing and I wasn't disappointed with that part at all. Pretty good options and everything looked fresh. Great olives.

Meats started coming around and a lot of the cuts looked super fatty. Skipped those and went for the top sirloin and chicken wings. Both very good.

Since the ""birthday dessert"" was a must, per our server, I got a tiramisu. Pretty good, but I'm a tiramisu snob, so don't mind me.

Not a bad big meaty lunch for 2 at $16, but not sure if I would've paid much more for it, all things considered. Stick to Fogo or Texas de Brazil for the real fancy experience.",1,1,0

Food = 3 Solid Stars
Value = 4 Stars

I ate here for lunch twice and breakfast once when staying in Vegas across the street.  I was with wife and kids and wanted quality food, nice setting, a bit away from casino smoke.

It's a very nice setting.  Upscale interior, solid furniture, nice waiting area.  Service was uniformly good if not great throughout stay.  It's a nice upscale all, right on the strip, and most importantly, it was very reasonably priced compared to other VEGAS Strip eating options.

If this was in Henderson, I might give it 1\/2 star off as Value would fall.

They have an excellent $6 Steak and Eggs breakfast.  Steak is top sirloin, served to your desired temperature (like mine medium).  Eggs were standard scrambled the way I ordered.  Potatoes were fried ""home fries"".

For Steak and Eggs of this quality, would have paid twice this and been happy.

Now on to lunch.  I had the meat ""buffet"" option both other times.  Now, most importantly you have to understand this:

* Quality of meet for $20 buffet lunch is not going to be what you would get for a $40-50 dinner buffet at other Brazillian restaurants.

It's just not going to happen.  Instead, you get very tasty sausage, rotisserie mini chicken pieces, bacon wrapped turkey chunks, and some slice top sirloin.  

No premium meats.

But the meats they give you are tasty and filling.  Plus, you get an excellent ""salad bar"" buffet.  I'm not a huge buffet person, but it's a nice one.

Cheeses, olives, salads, soups, breads, etc.  I thought the calamari salad was pretty decent, and loved the fresh mozzarella, olives, artichokes, heart of palm salad, and a few other dishes.

So say what you will about this restaurant, but I think it's a decent to very good value.  I think the setting is very nice.  The service is good.  And the food is tasty and filling and not overly expensive.  

I do think you could get very expensive for dinner or if you run up certain menu choices, but that's your choice, isn't it?

Just don't think you are going to be in a nice setting, right on the strip, and get the same meal you could get at a Fuego de Chao.",0,0,0

On the main menu itself the price was $21 dollars but then we were told no the coupon average out to be $21 per person. So why would the main menu have the discounted price listed and nowhere was the price of $42? It was just a bait and switch with less the mediocre food.

This was pretty much the only sit-down restaurant inside Planet Hollywood that didn't have too long of a wait and sounded pretty decent. Unfortunately, the lack of patronage should have been a clear indication of what was to come. 

First, the meat was just okay. They definitely don't serve as many meats as Fogo De Chao does, and the majority of them were overly salty and fatty. Second, the sides bar was beyond awful and sparse. They pretty much only had some wilted lettuce, mediocre cheese puffs, and some random salad toppings. Third, our waitress was horrible and never came by to check up on us. We had to repeatedly try to flag her down, and even then...she still wouldn't come over! So basically, service was completely non-existent.

We got to the restaurant at 7:05 checked in with the front and they told me it would be about 10 minutes. No problem we went and walked out in front entrance for there was no seating inside but stood by the entrance. We had been waiting for about 15 minutes and walked back to check if they had our table. The front desk asked me for my name again and said have a seat. About another 15 min go by and they finally called our name and the host had told me they called my name already and another guest had taken our reservation and was seated. No big deal it happens. We waited almost 10 minutes for a server to come to our table. He just took our drink order and walked away. We sat there not knowing what to do here and how it worked. He finally came back after a long time had passed with our drinks and explained what we were to do. Salad bar was very delicious but I was not too happy about the meat carvers. We only had 4 to 5 different carvers to table and 2 was the same meat. We has one serving of shrimp\/salmon and one serving of pineapple. We were there for an hour and a half from time of checking in and eating. I would never pay full price for this place for customer service is terrible. The salmon was absolutely terrible.

If you come here and pay full price you are silly...as they have 2 for 1 offerings all over town and on the internet if you search long enough...and THAT is reason enough to try it out and think, well, $20-$25 per person is somewhat reasonable as their competition in town seldom offers deals and you end up paying over $120 for two (tax +tip) but for far better quality and excellent salad bar.

Service:
The last time I was here, we sat for over 7 minutes to start out our meal before we had a ""gaucho"" come over ready to carve out some meat...and they aren't that personable like in some other places, kind of robotic.

The salad bar doesn't have much...throw a couple hearts of palm on my plate and I'm done...not going to fill up on fettuccini alfredo.

The best cut of meat for me was the leg of lamb and the balsamic vinegar mix they use to sauce it over, but of course that came around once over the course of an hour and we were sitting in the middle of the room.

The filet mignon is bacon wrapped and too salty and extremely tough for what is supposed to be the most tender cut of meat...and I hope you like it medium-well because that's all they had.

If you can find a coupon, I'd say give it a shot, but if you want quality and really good food try Fogo De Chao, Texas De Brazil and Via Brasil here in Vegas. 

The quality of meat at Pampas vs. it's local competition is like night and day.",10,3,0

Other than that, the experience was less than desired. I ordered a groupon for the seafood lunch rodizio; and let me tell you, if you have any coupons or groupon- you may risk getting crappier service. 
We got there and I showed her my paid for groupon- and let me tell you; for lunch it still costs $60 for the groupon plus tax and tip so you're still paying $75 for lunch. They brought us one small plate of seafood and that's it. The appetizers on the bar were pretty good except for their being so much cranberry in the dishes- this isn't necessary in every cold dish you prepare.
Sometimes simpler is better:)

The meats they brought out were basically the same- sirloin and chuck; which were very good but lunch doesn't offer as much variety as I felt. Also, they barely came around to your table. Our server seemed like a nice lady but I saw a change in her presence after we mentioned our groupon- i think mainly because many people who have vouchers do not tip their servers well. So, we barely saw her come around to our table- we did notice though there was a lack of servers for lunch and so I felt kinda sorry for her. 
However, that being said...she still should have had a better attitude towards us even though we were groupon customers. We still left a tip- because both of us always believe you tip your servers; unless it's outright horrible service- most of them make minimum wage. Always tip!! 

We went for dinner one time before without a coupon- we were treated very well and there was much for variety of meats and a better sides bar.

Why's that? Because that's all this place is about. All you can eat meat is all about quantity. If you want quality, you go on the other side of the strip and you eat at the steak places in the City Center places. If you want a sword's worth of meat, you come here.

It's worth the time it takes to chew through it all, though I do have some cautionary advice for you, depending on your evening's plans and how often you eat multiple pounds of red meat in a single sitting. Maybe consider this place on the night that you are not going to be bumping up against people for hours on end in a packed nightclub. The meat-burp-breath is not as popular as it used to be a few years ago. People are starting to move on to other fads, unfortunately.

Taking a lady home? I hope you brought aromatic candles with you. Your room will smell like the dumpster behind a McDonalds by the time the sun starts beating against the blackout curtains.

Five-hour flight back to the east coast? I hope the plane has a convertible roof, or you might set off the lavatory smoke detectors.

No? You've got it all under control? Okay. I won't give you the last bit of advice then.

After receiving a coupon for 10% off, I decided to try Pampas on a Friday night before ""the evening rush"". The service was pretty good as we were seated immediately and had a good server. My only complaint was the food. While the salad bar was good (for what they had) I was disappointed at the rest of my meal (surf & turf). I'll admit, maybe my issue was expecting the food to be as good as Fogo... it wasn't. Some of the steaks were salty and it didn't seem to matter if you wanted rare or well. I honestly didn't have anything I really liked as everything they brought out was mediocre at best. Hopefully this was all due to one or two guys back there not having a good day...

We ordered drinks and the waitress brought them and left didn't see her much. The meat came around very slow and wasn't impressed at all with the salad bar. I finally asked for a refill on my tea. About 5- 10 min later she finally brings me tea with melted ice... iced tea is supposed to have ice right?? Especially in vegas where it's hot as hell. So I politely ask for ice she takes the cup and seems annoyed and I never see again. I had to go find the manager and ask for tea and explain she took the cup and never returned.  All the while him and two other Co workers or management Is sitting on there butt talking. He brings me the tea with ice and I'm annoyed now politely tell him we live here we aren't tourists so if service is bad we don't return.  He doesn't seem to care and now I see why all the reviews are bad here. Lol by then my meat is cold and lunch is runied. We finish and have to ask the waitress for our check of which she didn't even have the sense to apologize or say sorry. Of which goes along ways with me. I understand we all have bad days or shit going on and not a good day. She could have redeemed herself with a simple hey I'm sorry. But she dropped the check off and walked away with nothing... apparently management doesn't care how the employees come off to customers or assume this is vegas we will get business anyways. Nor did management have the nerve to apologize and say hey sorry about the service i will speak to her and send her over.  Was the worse service I've had in along time and won't be going back.

This place isn't even worth it at what they say is 1\/2 price.

Waiter comes to table with a carafe of water and pours everyone a glass of water but doesn't tell you that they charge $1 per person for the water.  You find that out when they bring you the check.

Ordered a glass of house wine at $8 and it was served in plastic.  Yes they used plasticware to serve the wine in.  Ordered a beer, the beer was in a can, waiter places the beer can inside the glass and puts in front of you and expects you to pour your own beer in the glass.  At least the beer glass was made of glass unlike the plastic wine glass.

Waiter brings the check, not in a check folder, just plops the printed check on the table.  I look at check and the recommended tip amount is based on the overpriced $71 per person plus drinks and water.  Needless to say I didn't leave a tip that large.

Placed my credit card with the check, handed it to the waiter.  Waiter hands it back to me and says you need to add the tip.  So waiter stands there and watched as I add the tip.  Because of that tacky move I reduced the tip even further.

Service is soooo slow I came here for lunch & it wasn't very crowded and it took forever for our server to greet us and take our drink order. Even longer for them to bring us the steaks!

Salad bar wasn't fresh at all, lettuce was wilted, empty side dishes, when I went up there there were no plantines or cheese bread. How can you not have those, this is a Brazilian steak house!

I used a Groupon and the that cover the costs of the meal but they make you pay for a drink and charge you for water. What a ripoff!",2,1,0

The salad bar is generous, I highly recommend the little cheese breads as well as the mashed potatoes- they were delicious.

There is a lot of meat to review so I will note the standouts:

The bacon wrapped chicken- it was juicy and flavorful and tasty overall
.
The sirloin- you can select how rare you went it right off the sword- it was tender and the seasonings were great.

The barbequed pork- Okay, I'm am genuinely not a fan of pork (with the exception of the occasional bacon added or wrapped item or holiday ham) but this was probably the best thing there. It was DELICIOUS- savory, sweet and juicy, I couldn't believe it. Even if you do not like pork or ham you have to try it!

The service was attentive and quick, my glass was rarely empty and there was always someone ready to serve up some meat. Good place for lunch and groups.",6,0,4

My friends and I went for breakfast on a recent trip to Vegas.  I ordered the smoked salmon platter, which, according to the menu, came with cream cheese and a bagel, along with the normal toppings like capers and onion.  Pretty standard, right? When my meal arrived, however, it actually came with not a bagel, but a MINI bagel.  I'm not exaggerating, the bagel was approximately the same width as the sliced romaine tomato. Considering it was a $10 breakfast, I expected a normal-sized bagel.  Or at the very least, it would have been nice for our server to warn me in advance. Oh, and there was a 20 minute wait to be seated even though the restaurant was not busy at all, and it took us about an hour to get out of there once we were seated because the service was incredibly slow.

This was a BOMB from start to finish and a complete waste of $157.00 for 4 people.  We made reservations.  When we showed up the hostess tried to put us outside where everyone walks by you. We noticed that's whereshe tries to put everyone initially. It's obviously is an effort to gain attention of by-passers, who think ""wow, let's eat here, it's so busy"".   It's very impersonal area, so we said we will sit inside.  So now she makes us wait for like 7+ minutes.  The inside was nearly empty and we still waited.  The waitress looked ""frazzled"" that we choise to eat inside.  So she seats us next to an entry way like a thoroughfare, but this place is nearly empty.  Many nice tables available.  Then we waited nearly 10 minutes for someone to say ""hi"" I'm your waiter\/waitress.  We were just ready to leave this place when out of the blue, a waitress greets us with a really bad vibe, unhappy feeling, impersonable to say the least.  So I order the unlimited meat thing for $37.95 or close to that price.  Well to keep this short, the meat carving people DO NOT make their rounds consistently.  They leave you waiting for more than 10-15 minutes at a time before another meat arrives.  I sat there looking around thinking what the heck is going on here?  Then someone shows up.  You can feel the reluctancy to carve you any decent sized portion.  Then you wait 10-15 minutes... another person comes, you get the picture???  One of my guests had a halibut fish at $27.99.  It was sadly the size of a king-sized pack of cigarettes, with some steamed veggies and that was a bit dry.  This was a let down.  My wife's dish was a lobster bouilliabaise.  The dish was mediocre, the tiny shrimp you had to find in the soup, the mussels were so tiny that I cant believe they would serve that!  The pasta was overcooked.  They only served me 5  types of meat while there. The filet mignon was the only one I could comfortably chew.  The rest of the meat was not very tender and tasty.  We over-heard our waitress complaining to another one saying the meat service is affecting her tips.   Yes it does, and so does her crappy personality.

Let me tell all of you that read this.  This place survives, thanks to the countless tourist turn-over.  This place is so desperate, they hand-out discount coupons in front of their place to the people that walk by....if you walk in because you wanted to anyhow, no discount coupon offer for you!   Plus take in mind my earlier comment about how thay want you to sit out front so they can market you to other suckers walking by. This place is no better than an average dinner buffet for $12.95.  I should have payed attention to the other Yelper comments out there, and I got burned.  Oh yeah, our seats were badly covered in grease drippings and other spills left behind from customers.  Gross!  One last thing, when we left, we walked by a hostess or a waitress who was using a company computer moniter station area  to check her FaceBook photos.... ""class act"" here people.

The chicken wrapped in bacon is heavenly. I've tried to duplicate it to no avail.  Somehow they are able to infuse the chicken with the smokey goodness of bacon and it is amazing!!!  I love a nice crusty piece of ham. Again they somehow are able to do this and retain the juicy ham goodness.  Their side buffet of choices had scrumptious offerings too. I love the fresh mozzarella drizzled with balsamic, garlic mashed potatoes and cheesy bread. 

Nathan had his share of all the meats and said they were expertly done. Nothing bad to say about any of the cuts. 

We were waited on expertly by Dave. He was ever present with a refill and blessedly absent while we were chowing away. The wandering meat carvers were plentiful and made sure we found just the cuts we were looking for.

What a waste of money, but I guess you get what you pay for. We LOVE Brazilian steakhouse and eat it pretty regularly (Fogo in Beverly Hills, Samba in Redondo Beach, Greenfield in Long Beach\/Covina, Texas de Brazil in Dallas and Las Vegas) so we know what good Brazilian steakhouse is. 

Cons:
We waited for a long time for meat. 
There were few meat choices (beef, chicken, pork .... no lamb). 
The meat was not of a good quality (was coarse or rubbery). 
The meat was not flavored well. 
The salad bar did not have many options. 
The salad bar ran out of bananas midway through lunch service. 
The pineapple was not carmelized. 

Pros:
Our server was AMAZING (moved tables to make our large group fit, asked if we needed a high chair, was patient with the kids). 
When requested, the guachos brought meat cooked as requested. 
All servers were helpful and no one said, ""You're not my table"". 

Guachos would walk by us without offering meat and when they did offer it, they sometimes didn't say what kind of meat it was or wait to be invited to plate it. Some in our party did eat pork and some didn't. If you don't eat pork you will have few options. Even with a Groupon we didn't leave satisfied. I would not return.",0,0,0

Pamas Churrascaria is tucked into the south end of the Planet Hollywood shops.  If you go in the correct door, it is immediately on the left - otherwise you get to wander through the maze of 170 shops looking for it.
We had reservations (highly recommended) and still waited for about 10 minutes to get a table (not too bad).  The host was very good but spoke a little too fast for this novice to catch everything he was saying.
One of the managers (Michele R.) came by while we were waiting on our drinks and talked with us about Pampas and what we could expect.  From my questions, she offered us a tour of the kitchen and then took our picture in front of the grill.  This was a very nice touch and certainly helped me to understand what to expect from the overall experience.  She also made herself available to us throughout the night - checking back to make sure everything was just right for us.
Michelle (our server) is from Chicago and has the great Chicago accent.  She is friendly, knowledgeable and fun to talk with.  Service could have been a little faster for my taste but at 7:15 on a Saturday evening with a wedding party on board, it gets a little bit crazy around there.
The food is amazing - 10 different kinds of meats, all freshly carved and served at your table.  The all-you-can-eat seafood was freshly prepared and very good but I was already getting full from the all-you-can-eat meat and salad and side bar by the time it arrived.
The desert tray looked fantastic but since I cannot have sugar, I asked about some strawberries.  Michele R. came to my rescue (again).  The rest of my table enjoyed the chocolate mousse.

Chinese pork - just leave the whole skewer

This was my first trip to vegas and found a groupon to pampas for a really great price .my boyfriend' and i decided to get it.

Flash forward to today 7\/30\/13: everything at pampas was great. We really recommend this restaurant. The food was very good, except the reason for 4\/5 stars instead of 5\/5 was that some of the items were a bit to salty in my opinion. But still good! 

What really blew me away was their customer service, our waitress was awesome(i think her name is Kelly, long haired brunette)  and the guys serving the meats were super friendly. Even with an unexpected incident during our lunch that Pampas could not prevent they very kindly offered us another lunch for the next day on the house!! That truly says a lot to me about the manager and their staff. 

Now on 7\/31\/13 , we had a different server i think her name was Miranda or something like that. idk if she was new but She never checked up on us or anything it was always a different girl getting us new plates and drinks. So that felt a little weird but again we had a great experience here and definitely recommend it!!

I am brazilian and I have very high standards when it comes to Churrascarias. But this one is a JOKE!!!!!!!!!

I was very excited to find a Pampas in Vegas because Pampas is a franchise from Brazil. So i thought... Yay authentic brazilian bbq? Hell yeah! 

I went with my bf at the time and I was very excited to take him there and show him what real brazilian bbq was all about. 

BIG MISTAKE!

The service was HORRIBLE! The waiter didn't ask us what we wanted to drink at all. we sat there for about 45 mins before anyone even came to say hi. 

The green and red system obviously does not work there because we were starving and anxiously waiting for the waiters carrying juicy meet only to realize that they were serving EVERYONE around us but skipping us!  (YES THE GREEN SIDE WAS UP)

They don't have a good variety, the meat was hard to swallow and it was nothing like the franchises in Brazil!

To top it all off, I was dissappointed with the meal but i insisted on dessert because I really wanted my passionfruit mousse! ( I miss this a lot and eat lost of it when I go to Brazil)

The mousse was so sour I could not eat it without making a face! Worst mousse ever!

We had found a groupon which was $65 all you can eat surf and turf + salad bar, plus 2 cocktails and 1 dessert. First off, it says $65, but after tipping (we tipped according to how much it would have been without the deal) it cost us about $95 total. It still isn't a bad deal because I think our total would have been about $140 (not including tax or tip) anyways if we didn't have the groupon.

It was pretty busy when we got there so that was a good sign I guess. The waiter was very attentive and showed us the details of our deal and what we got. I was thinking that we get two free cocktails regardless of what they were, but actually there is a list of 4 to choose from. This includes a mojito, 2 brazilian cocktails, or a margarita. My girlfriend chose the margarita and I chose the mojito. I feel like the mojito barely had any alcohol in it, but the margarita was super strong haha.

The salad bar isn't really that big compared to Via Brasil and Texas De Brazil. Regardless, I enjoyed the roasted mushrooms, pasta salad, beets, and cheese bread (amazing, might I add). I know my girlfriend loved the mashed potatoes and the cheese bread too.

Ok, now the meat and seafood. The shrimp isn't peeled, which really bothers me for some reason. They do taste good though after you peel them and whatnot. The mahi mahi didn't taste right to me, and the salmon was OK - nothing too amazing about it. I think the best of the meats were the bacon wrapped filet mignon, bacon wrapped chicken, beef tenderloin and spicy sausage. My girlfriend really REALLY liked the bacon wrapped chicken though haha.

For dessert we had the Tiramisu which was pretty good.

Last but not least, service was great and our server was on top of everything. He kept our waters filled up and was very attentive, which is a big deal for me.

Overall I think this place was OK....nothing too spectacular or amazing about it. If it were up to me I'd probably just go to Via Brasil especially since it is only 5 min from my house. I don't think we'll come back to Pampas.",1,1,1

Aside from the name, this place has absolutely NOTHING to do with Pampas in LA. Very frustrating. The buffet is tasteless. The meat is either overly cooked or the cow is bleeding.

One is greeted by their waiter before heading over to the ""salad bar"". (Calling it a salad bar is an insult because it's so much more.) You get your ""salad"" and start to enjoy the gourmet offerings of artichoke hearts, asparagus, fresh cheese, marinated mushrooms, and sun-dried tomatoes.

When that is finished, one is given a clean plate and the red\/green card on the table is flipped to green meaning ""Bring on the meats!""

During this course, men with large skewers of roasted beef, chicken, lamb, and pork take turns delivering their goodness to your table.

After you have eaten yourself into oblivion, you flip your card to red. This is the equivalent of waving a white flag on the battlefield.

Depending on how much you want to suffer during the next six hours, you can peruse their dessert offerings.

The entire time this is happening, your waiter is being attentive to your needs.

Yeah. This is NOT how things happen at Pampas. 

First, be VERY careful when walking in this restaurant. The stone-tiled floor is greasy so it is very slippery. The table even moved when touched because the floor is so greasy.

Despite the floor, our meal started out ok enough. We went to the ""salad bar"" for that course of the meal. After it was clear that we were finished with that, our waiter took our plates.

So we sat waiting for clean plates. (Insert crickets chirping here.) Waiting, waiting, waiting...

We finally flagged down our waiter and asked for clean plates, we were told that we were supposed to use the small, oblong utensil plate for our meats. No, no, no....we want a real plate, please.

Ok, we now have real plates. Now the meat comes. This was the only decent part of the meal. The meat was cooked to our liking and we gorged like round, little piglets.


If you are a fan of the other churrascarias like Fogo, you will be HUGELY disappointed here.

What a great way to try a new place.  Well, we had terrible experience.  First of this waiter Juan was pretty cock-y.
I asked about the food, he gave sarcastic answers, his demeanor was very unpleasant.  We had our interest on the skirt steak from other posting by orhers. 
Skirt steak plate is 30.00 and came this very sad looking plate with about 6 inches very thin skirt steak with a line of rice which equals to maybe 2 spoons of rice and same amount of black beans.  To top it off, it was cold. At the end he explained the check, reflecting the discounts. He explained that 50.00 discount came from the resort, and 50.00 came from the restaurant. 
Well, that was a waste of restaurant money on this marketing effort to bring people in if they're going to compromise the quality or quantity of the food they serve because one is using the coupon given.

Perhaps my tastebuds have gotten picky as I've gotten older, but this place was a downer.  I wasn't expecting imported steak or aged meats, but for a Brazilian churrascaria, I'd like some flavor (if you meats don't cut it) please.

We came here the day prior to Ash Wednesday.  For all of you non-Catholics, you may be more familiar with other terms this day goes by, like ""Fat Tuesday and Mardi Gras"" or ""Carnival.""  So, prior to our 40-days of abstinence, we were expecting a real meal.

This place did not deliver.  Even with the 40% discount that http:\/\/www.tix4tonight.com\/ provided, $22 for all-you-can-eat (discounted from $36) plus $15 average drinks is not a deal at all.  

Nope, I'm not kidding about $15 cocktails.  And, nope, it's not in a bigger glass.  It comes in your regular, everyday lowball.  I've clubbed in Vegas, LA, NYC, London, etc., $15 is a  total rip-off.  I would have been better off sitting on a slot machine on the casino floor with my $15 (and served a free double shot of whiskey and d.coke) and had a better time.  And, to add to the hysteria, if you opt for wine, they give you this big silly, plastic wine bottle to order off of.

As we all know, every true churrascaria will pass on the chicken and all the other filler crap that they try to feed you in the beginning.  So, I could not honestly critique those items.  However, all the (should have been) good stuff (i.e. beef and lamb) was medium to done because of all the re-cooking.  This was not at all pleasing to me, as I prefer medium-rare for these meats.  The petite fillet was fair, in flavoring and in seasoning.  However, the lamb was not fresh and you could taste it.  The pork was on the dry side.  And, I could have used a little more blood on my ribeye.

With that, I couldn't begin to imagine paying full price.  But if you must experience it, check out tix4tonight.com before you go.  The closest one to the restaurant is at the Hawaiian Marketplace, in front of Polo Towers.",3,0,1

This sort of sums it up: the lousy Margherita that I ordered as soon as we sat down did not come until we were almost done with the over cooked dinner.  

Surprise! 
The salad bar has a nice selection of items. This creates a false sense of what the meal will be like. 

But reality set in when the waiters started to serve the rodizio meats on the skewers. Only one item was medium rare, the sirloin steak.  Other than that, the chicken, sausage, lamb, pork, filet mignon ( a crime to ruin a good cut on beef), ham and other unrecognizable rats were over cooked, dry and tough.  Shoe leather would be more tender. 

Wait I am almost done and my Margherita finally arrived. I really need a drink to digest this food. I take a sip and wait, when did 7-11 start making Margherita icee's?  The drink was all crushed ice very little drink. I guess it is a fitting cocktail.    

Oh no. The bill just came. They put different tip suggestions based on different percentages.  So the bill was $102 and the 20% tip is $33.40?  What type of math are they using???

So my family from Mexico is in town and they are staying at the planet Hollywood . They had show tickets that came with a dinner to Pampas and invited me to join. We were a large group of 19 and she gave us great service she was really nice and helpful even though most of my family didn't speak English. The guys serving meat were great as well. The problem started at the conclusion of our meal when Amber our server brought the check. She wrote on the receipt that we had to pay 25% gratuity? I've never heard of that and I felt like she was trying to take advantage of people who didn't know or maybe spoke another language. I told my aunt and uncle not to pay that and to ask for the manager but they didn't want to cause a scene and they simply paid it to avoid conflict. I work in the industry and know there is no such thing as 25% auto grat! I also know that you don't write the percentage down on paper it always says it in print from a computer. She is stealing from the customers point blank period! Management needs to investigate this THIEF because I'm sure we aren't the only ones who were being effected by her. I will never go back to this place and I won't recommend it and it's sad because the food and experience was good up until the end.,0,0,0

The room was way too stuffy and hot, AC should have been up a bit more. All of our utensils were dirty and\/or greasy. The water (which wasn't free) came in a filthy bottle that had built up yellow gunk on the inside....yuk. 

We got there at 11:30 for lunch and the kitchen staff was way behind in prepping the food, not even our server was made of aware of it. The all-you-can-eat salad and sides only had half of the items out, it took them over an hour to get the remainder items out, and some of the ones that were out didn't have serving utensils.  Three of the seven meats that we were part of the our meal were never available and so never made it to our table. 

With the exception of our server Steven (really great guy), everyone else acted like we were bothering them. On top of that, the Yelp Check-In offer of a ""Free bottle of wine with a Pokemon lure"" wasn't honored simply because we couldn't get internet\/data connection within that section of the mall (why even bother with the offer if guests can't use it).

I've spent at ""Pampas"" about an hour and a half, and pretty much tried all their meat's, from over cooked top sirloin to very salty pork, even the roasted pineapple they manage to spoil somehow.

Came with a friend on a Saturday afternoon.  We each had vouchers for a  lunch, just the basic meats, which was fine by me.  I love me some all you can eat anything!  And Brazilian bbq?  What's not to love?

We were pretty excited when we arrived that there were lots of tables open (pretty sure we just beat the lunch rush as it was almost 1:00 when we arrived) so we thought we'd be seated immediately, if not soon.  We were told 15 minutes to wait.  Why?  More than 75% of the place was free and there were more than enough employees walking around chit chatting.  Several were obviously servers that were standing in the corner talking, hostesses standing at the front with menus but not seating anyone.

So we wait.  Moments later, a small party comes in stating they have reservations for 1:00 for 5 people.  I overhear the hostess tell them that they had to wait 20-25 minutes for their table to be ready.  REALLY?  What was the point of making the reservation?

1:30 rolls around and they finally seat us. (30 minutes later.) The party with reservations gets seated 15 minutes after we do in the same section that hardly had anyone seated.  SUCKS SO FAR.  (For them too, I'm sure.)

As we're seated, the hostess tells us our server will be there in a moment to take our drink orders.  20 minutes later, our server walks by as he's saying ""Hi, I'll be right back to take your drink order"" as his voice fades with him walking away.  We get no chance to say anything.  All we wanted was water.  Come on.

I say screw it, let's start at the salad bar.  (Oh yeah, none of the meat has come to our table yet, 30 minutes seated with no service?) however we see the guys walking out of the kitchen and taking it to another section of the restaurant that seems to be getting much more attention than the side we were on.)  We make it back from the salad bar, and still no water.  Server arrives another 10 minutes later to take our drink order.  2 waters.  Another 10 minutes and the first meat guy comes around.  2 pieces of sirloin (one for my friend, one for me, wasn't bad at all) was all get got until the next guy came around 10 minutes later.  (It took our server another 15 minutes to bring us the waters from taking the order.)

Overall, we arrive before 1:00 and don't leave until about 3:50.  One glass of water (server never refilled) and 6 pcs. of meat for each of us.  Averaged 15-20 minutes to get a piece of meat.

To top it off?  I had a voucher which the server insisted he knew which to take as he does it all the time with these vouchers.  Now, our vouchers were attached to our bus tour vouchers.  I asked him if he was sure he had the right one.  Dude gave me a look of attitude and said ""Look, I do this all the time, don't worry about it.""  MISTAKE.

I go outside where our tour bus stop is (Thank you lord that is was right there) and as I try to get on, the guide tells me I have the wrong vouchers.  So I go back to the restaurant.  Hostess ignores me as she stands there looking at a piece of paper.  Another hostess walks up and fianlly asks if she can help me.  I let her know that the server took the wrong voucher and I couldn't get on my tour bus.  She says she'll speak with the server and check with him.  She comes back with an attitude, as if I'd accused them of something totally crazy, telling me that the server was sure he took the right one.  Our server never came out and the hostess was about to just brush it off.  I asked to speak to a supervisor who FINALLY came out.  I believe her name was HEATHER, or something close to it.  I gave her the same details, she came back with the same answer.  The server took the right voucher.  I asked to see the voucher he took, and after rolling her eyes and sighing outloud, she said hold on and walked away.  She came out this time with the actual receipt and vouchers the server took.  Low and behold!  SERVER TOOK THE WRONG VOUCHER.  I told her the one she had was the one I needed.  She insisted STILL that she had the correct one.  I had to finally take a stand and get a firm with her and said ""LOOK!"" And pointed to the print, details, etc. to prove that they took the wrong one.  When she finally realized it, she looked at me again, rolled her eyes, then still had the nerve to ask me, ""So this is the one you need?""  WTF?!?!?!  I tell her yes please, she tears off the voucher off the receipt and as I'm doing to same to give her the correct one for her records, she snatches it out of my had, doesn't say another word, and walks away.  No ""sorry for the mix up"".  No ""sorry for my attitude as well as for the attitude of my employees"".  No ""sorry you missed your tour due to our incompetence"". No ""Thanks from saving us from an issue!""

I think if I had never been to a rodizio before I'd have been somewhat impressed, as the picanha was pretty decent and the seafood that came with the surf & turf was surprisingly decent.  But, most of the meat was a bit dry, except the picanha and the bacon wrapped chicken.  The ham was VERY salty.  The sausage was actually fairly overwhelming by itself, but probably would have been fine as small slices in an italian dish.

The salad bar had a decent amount of coated salad type dishes and standards but nothing I had was really exciting.  They serve the ubiquitous rodizio cheese bread as part of the salad bar instead of fresh at your table, and fried bananas instead of cinnamon plantains are on the bar as well.  

One thing I will give them top marks for is the service - our waiter was super nice and attentive, in fact there was a slight mixup (not their fault) that they handled very graciously.  I had booked my reservation for 11 but didn't realize the rodizio didn't start until 11:30.  We ordered a couple cokes and were going to wait, but my honey wanted to just leave and come back.  So when I offered to pay for the cokes and explained we'd come back later, our waiter said not to worry about it, but just come back and see him later.  So I tipped him pretty big for the cokes and then again when we came back on the full meal.

I am giving them a 3 overall, though honestly anyone who has been to Fogo or TdB is likely to grade them far more harshly in comparison.  If you get a discount to come here via Tix4Tonight or Groupon it becomes a much better value for your money, but it's still not really the best example of rodizio by a long shot.",0,0,0

We used a groupon and they treated us like full priced customers (Other places have not been so welcoming when I flashed the G)! They never rushed us and were good about explaining everything to me and answering questions. 

The salad bar was pretty good! I wanted to fill up on all the fresh fruits and veggies! They had some stuff I've never had but tried and was delicious. I don't remember the names so check the pics! 

The drinks were great! I had the pampas specialty cocktail and my friend got the pina colada one and we both really enjoyed our drinks. Good amount of alcohol and great flavor. My boyfriend's Coke was refilled consistently. Lol he's such a goodie goody. 

The seafood was cool. I only had the salmon but it had some kind of glaze that was amazing!  I wish I could make salmon like that! 

The meats were good. Mind you, I'm not usually a meat person, so it was a chore for me to eat all the meats haha I asked for thin slices every time they came around and managed to try everything at least once. I wasn't a fan of the bacon wrapped chicken. I know, WHAT?! I love bacon everything, but just wasn't feeling this. The chicken was dry and had no flavor. I run into the same problem wrapping bacon because you want to make sure the bacon is cooked and in the process, dry out everything else, so I'm not going to ding them stars for it. The grilled pineapple was good. But then again, I love pineapple. 

Dessert was good. We got the flan and the chocolate mousse. We didn't finish because we were stuffed! And this is why I always go dessert first! *stops writing, puts down phone, shakes head at boyfriend for stopping smart girlfriend, picks up phone*

We also purchased the 1\/2 off tickets.  Ordered a pitcher of sangria which we were told was $9.  I guess the lesson here is ""If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!"".  We confirmed the price with our waitress because we thought it was much too cheap for a place that charges an arm and a leg and a thigh for everything else. 

In that case, get the party rollin!  It was my birthday so we easily polished off two pitchers of sangria during our meal.  The bill came and it was over $200 for two people! wth? After our meal at about 11:30pm, we spent over an hour with the manager who refused to refund us for the ""$9 sangria"".  The waitress even admitted her fault to the manager, but ol' cheap ass wouldn't budge.  Talk about a BUZZ KILL! 

The next morning I had to call down there again and harass the guy to give us our well deserved credit.  He offered to ""split"" the bill with me.  HELL NO! It was their fault for misrepresenting the price, I was not about to split it. Especially on my birthday!  you cheap bastard. 

After a 45 minute phone call and some choice words, he agreed to refund me the amount minus $18 (the price they claimed it was per pitcher).  

The food - was a little better than average, but nothing to ""wow"" about.  the experience was more worth the money then the food.  I love how its like a sit down buffet rotating in front of your face!  

Anyways, I would advise to try a different place than this.

The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the first time we came it was awesome all the way around. But this last time was terrible.

I purchased a lunch Groupon for 65$ for two with the unlimited surf and turf + mimosas. 

When walked in, there was a 5-10 min wait. No biggie. We were then seated in a crowded room with 2 servers. 

The busser that walked by us filled up all four glasses of water on the table when there was only 2 of us and didn't clear away the other place settings. Annoying but I brushed it off.

I asked for our drinks from the server, busser, and finally a manager. 20 mins later we got our mimosas. 

The meats that came around were very rare in the middle, unlike last time when they were more well done. That knocked more points off for us, but for others that may be a plus. 

I repeatedly asked for the ""surf"" portion of our meal and we finally got it in the end after at least an hour.

The dessert was fantastic... probably the best of everything at least.

Service
Horrible service, unwilling to cater to their customers - We asked for the store manager, and a chef who claimed to be the manager came out and explained to our party that Pampas Churrascaria does not care for their customers and their loyalty. Also, they don't really welcome Groupon users, especially the ones, he stated, that come weekly apparently. The restaurant was nearly empty at the time we went since it was a weekday, yet we were rudely dismissed by one of the passing servers after being seated. Thankfully, our designated server was welcoming and attentive... or maybe it seemed so compared to all the other employees we came across before finally being seated.

Food
Lunch meat choices are limited to dry chicken, dry&tough picanha, other dry beef choices, sausages & pork (the last two of which I did not try).
Seafood was okay. Seafood unlike the meats is ordered through the server, and surprisingly we did not have any problem at all. It included salmon, shark, scallops, and shrimp.
Salad bar had a small, but good variety of salads, pasta salads, soups, bread, etc. The pastas were dried up and looked like they had been sitting there for a good amount of time.

Ambiance
When I first stepped into the restaurant, I had a good feeling about the place. It is next to the Todai in the Miracle Mile Shops, good location, and decorated well as all or most restaurants on the strip are. The workers looked professional at first glance, and it looked like a nice dining place. My friend and I actually purchased another Groupon to come again while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. Mistake! I asked Groupon for a refund right after we left!

At such a reasonable price, we wanted to give the place a try, but what a disappointment. I would've given the place a second chance despite its horrible service; however, the food is just not worth it. You get what you paid for, maybe less with this place. Fogo de Chao all the way!",2,0,0

There were some unusual (to me at least) items of the salad bar, but good to be different.  The meats were a mixed bag, YMMV applies.  I loved the lamb, with the vinaigrette sauce (my wife asked what was in it, and they told us it was balsamic vinegar, mixed with honey).  The sirloin was wonderful, as was the grilled pineapple.  The sausage, chicken versions, were OK, but I hated the parmesan filet, couldn't finish it.  Again some of this is personal preferences.

We came in around 1pm, the middle of lunch service, with a Restaurant.com coupon. The hostess was pleasant and we were seated promptly and addressed by the waitress as to the salad bar and how a Brazilian steakhouse works. 

The salad bar has the Brazilian essentials: traditional cheese bread, soggy from the steamer, a rotating pasta surprise that tastes from a can or bottle, cheap deli cold cuts in place of the Brazilian meats and your standard salad fixings and dressings.

If you were expecting to enjoy meat at this steakhouse, prepare to be severely disappointed as the servers come along very infrequently. The meat itself seems to be either rare-blue or cooked to death. Their beef, both sirloin and tri tip, was both seared to a crisp on the outside and almost blue-raw inside. The chicken drumsticks are covered in leather-like skin and the ""house-made pork sausage with fennel and garlic"" is a gritty, dry hunk of regular American breakfast sausage that makes a McSausage look tasty. 

The only saving grace about the food at Pampas is the roasted pineapple, which was delicious and sweet.

Onto the service, the waitress ignored our table for the bulk of our 2 hour meal. She ignored our requests for more napkins and water, despite us directly addressing her. All the while, she made great conversation will the table next to ours, laughing and joking more than the next three tables combined. When she did finally bring us one refill of water to the carafe, it was clearly tainted. The water was sour and smelled like gasoline. Because of our waitress' negligence, we had to ask once of the other servers for fresh water, which as expected, never came. 

Finally, we weren't going to waste any more time with our waitress and were going out to pay at the hostess station when she scurried over to let us pay for our meal. No pleasantries, no apology for the tainted water, just swipe the card, throw the receipt at us and walk away. This was the worst meal and restaurant I have ever been to in Las Vegas. The price is high for you to just fill up on canned pasta and bread to just be ignored.",2,0,0

Usually when I go to a restaurant I care about quality and service, not price. So besides the price of the rodizio, which is fair, and the service, which is also fair for the price you are paying, this place lacks good management. The meats are served cold sometimes, dry, and the Caipirinha is overpriced. I am writing this to everyone who knows what a real Brazilian Churrascaria should be like (especially in Vegas). You will be better off going to Texas de Brazil, Fogo de Chao and Via Brazil (my favorite). Trust me, those restaurants I cited are a little bit more expansive, but a million times better. In addition, where is the manager in this place? Asking me how the service and food is doing on my table??? This place is a joke :\/ 
I am a Brazilian foodie dude from Sao Paulo - SP. I know what is good... I should had trusted the reviews on Yelp, which rated this place kind of low and then gone to Via Brazil. But my gf had a Groupon so that's why we tried...

Go to Via Brazil! That's a real Churrascaria that meets my standards of quality food\/service in Las Vegas. 

For Brazilians now: Essa Churrascaria ta de brincadeira, ja fui em churrascarias de 15 reais na zona Leste de Sao Paulo que tinham um salad bar 20 maior e melhor, Carnes frescas. Nao eh isso que vc vai encontrar aqui. 

Food from the rodizio is VERY LIMITED. Some of meats served had no salt nor flavor, some were cold, and no Garlic picanha? ??? This place is a joke, it's burning the good reputation of brazilian food. Sorry, but I hope the owned reads it and decide to put a decent manager there........

We thought that was okay but then we ate. The sides were about the same as a horrible buffet the only thing edible was the watermelon go figure. The seafood plate arrived with tasteless horribly overlook shrimp that was inedible and mussels that we were pretty convinced were food poisoning waiting to happen and salmon and tilapia that was so awful we spit it out. The meat carvers were often no where to be seen and would come around with the same things. The biggest gross was the bacon wrapped filet. He put it on my plate and I bit in and it was completely raw on the inside, not rare but raw and had a bad taste.

The seating was a little crammed for my liking, but we weren't there for the decor, we were there for the food. We got the surf and turf, and like most yelpers said, the shrimp had the shell on it still. The shrimp was properly cleaned, and cooked nicely. We decided not to eat more than one cause it wasn't worth the effort. The salad bar was impressive.  The food was fresh and delicious. They had an array of meats to choose from and all of them were delicious. Only one of the beef options was a little to salty for my taste, and I was not a fan of their crab cakes, but all in all it was tasty. To top off the amazing food was our server Constantine.

The best Brazilian grill we have been to is Texas de Brazil on South Las Vegas Blvd. in the Town Square Shopping Center. We should have gone there but we had a coupon and thought why not. Well, this is why not. The quality of the food is sub-par and the service was substandard, too. Our waitress was inexperienced, unprofessional and had quite the bad attitude.  My husband, my son and myself went for a late Father's Day dinner. My son ordered the Seafood Rodizio, my husband the Meat Rodizio and I the salad bar only. The seafood rodizio took at least 25 minutes after we ordered to be brought to the table. What a disappointment, 3 small scallops, 1 fishy-tasting salmon fillet, 1 breaded piece of cod and 4 grilled shrimp. Our waitress informed my son she had put in another order for the seafood and when it came about 30 minutes later it was the exact same thing. No choices you get what you get and not what you would expect for the prices they charge. After my husband was done the servers finally started bringing out the Fillet Mignon, a little too late.

They threw us in a corner by the bar where we got the worst service. They didn't even care it was a special event.

The food was really good! The first round at the salad\/hot bar, everything was almost gone or not fresh. I had tried almost all of the cheeses offered, the cheese bread, the fried bananas, and the mushrooms. They were all luke warm but tasted so good so I went for seconds and thirds. We ordered the sangria pitcher which was delicious and reasonably priced, but took forever to comeout (20 minutes timed) 

The meat was okay. I had a few cuts of beef, and a bacon wrapped filet mignon. They were dry and had blood dripping out of all of them. They were all really rare, or rare.. not medium rare or anything in-between. There was also no way to ask for more or less meat. The people holding the meat slabs were almost non-existent and never came by our table so I was starving and had to get up 4 times to go to the salad bar. I was still starving by the time I left....

My cousins didn't have the same promotional card as us, but they were offered a discount at the door for I think around $18.50 per person for lunch! We found it to be a very good deal.  They had around cuts of meat for lunch and kept them coming.

Be sure to be vocal about how you like meat prepared. Some of the slices offered at first were to well done for my liking.

The only thing keeping this from being 5 star for me is the pineapple offering. I'm used to the grilled pineapple covered in cinnamon and sugar.  The pineapple served here was not coated before grilling, which in our opinion paled in comparison to the other preparation.

This is a set up. In theory, it sounds amazing! Buffet with 12 different grilled meats carved at your table for a relaxed and filling eating experience. Throughout the entire strip promoters are passing out buy one get one coupons which sweetens the experience even more. The problem is, it's a tiny buffet with limited sides, I only saw 5 or 6 meats (no where close to 12), and it was a constant fight to get the few meat selections to your table which caused frustration...not relaxation. Additionally, the BOGO coupon was BOGUS! We did get it half off but you couldn't buy the basic buffet, you had to upgrade to add the grilled shrimp and a beverage which makes your total $4.50 cheaper than the price of the regular buffet. Doesn't sound like Payless BOGO sale to me. Other than the gimmicks, the few grilled meats we had were actually tastey. The ham and steak were really good! If you did not prefer rare meat, you had to request it separately which caused more waiting and frustration. There wasn't a single side that I had that was amazing. Just different cold salads. I think the buffet deserves to be $25 and needs some additional sides.  

Final advice: pay the extra dollars and eat the buffet at one of the nicer hotels. Thank me later",3,0,1

Picanha, saving grace, only reason for the 2nd star. Wasn't because of the service or the salad bar or the ambiance. Why not just call yourself a salad bar with select meat. Also, I count 21 table around me with 2-5 people per table. They keep sending out one skewer of meat, which doesn't even make it fully around the ""lunch rush."" Considering that Fogo is $35 for lunch and this was $21, I'd rather have just gone to fogo and not wasted a meal. I mean pineapple isn't a cut of meat, it's a fruit. Why would you bill that as cut of meat? I mean that is just silly. Save your money, go elsewhere.

Whether you're a ""rare"" individual, a stickler for ""well-done"" steak, or even a staunch vegetarian, this place will make sure you leave happy. And in a tourist town like Vegas where customer service is king, the importance of that quality can't be overstated. 

Plus, there are always a bunch of coupons and deals you can find online that will make your bill even cheaper!

Trust me, our original bill was over $270 but with a TravelZoo voucher, there was a discount of $209 dollars. Total paid: $73.30, tip not included. 

Check in with Yelp for a Caiparinha\/alcoholic drink. Our server, Mindy was phenomenal. She recommended white sangria (part of the voucher deal) and we readily agreed. All four of us got an alcoholic drink but when we took the first sip, our eyes bulged. Maybe we're just lightweights (probably) but the drinks were way too strong. Mindy came by later and noticed the drinks were still full, she asked what was wrong. We explained and she collected our drinks and promised they would be remade. True to her words, she came back with the new drinks and yup, us weak Asians could finally drink our Caiparinhas now. 

FOOD: 

There is an unlimited sides buffet. It was filled with cheeses, beans, salads and beets, cheese rolls and a variety of pasta. Also pulled pork (a must!) and mashed potatoes. 

With Brazilian steakhouses, you sit and wait for servers carrying meat chunks to come to your table and carve you a slice. You'll use your tongs to grab the pieces. There is a little circular paper on your table. When you want meat to continue coming to your table, keep it on the green side. When you are done, flip it to the red side. Keep it where the servers can see it. Meats that came to our table were picanha, sirloin, lamb, pork shoulder, bacon-wrapped chicken, and sausages. Pineapples were also making the rounds. Meats are salty and for the most part, tough and dry. I ended up being more satisfied with the pulled pork from the sides buffet. 

Overall, I would not pay full price for this. My main gripe was that we asked for a water refill 3 times and didn't get it until we were done with our meat selection. By then, we were really thirsty and feeling dizzy from sodium overload. But otherwise, good experience. The stars are for the side buffet, the meat servers and for Mindy.

2. Service: Slow, unfriendly, & inefficient. 

We talked to our server about the cold plates of food we had received. He didn't seem to care and didn't apologize once. He took our plates back without telling us what was going on, and we waited another 10-15 mins for the food to come back out. In the mean time, we asked to speak to the manager bc the service was so poor. But the manager was no where to be found. When the food came back out, it was cold again, and this time the steaks were over cooked. When the waiter came by and asked how it was the second time, we stated that it was not any better.

Right off the bat, if that wasn't canned soup I wouldn't want to admit I made it!  Nice salad bar, not great but no complaints there. The rolls they put out weren't worth eating  but why fill up on bread anyway, we're expecting some great meat coming around anytime now. 
First they brought some shrimp out for the table, not bad but my husband was really the only one eating it.  Then they brought the sausage around, EXCELLENT!
Roast, and the sirloin, ummm, let's say I tried a couple bites and thought I'd save room for the next dish.  Ham came around, not bad, not great. Chicken... took a look and passed.  There was a very tasty steak (the star of the show) that was actually very good, that and the sausage were really the only meats worth eating. 
$3.50 a glass for very flat soda, mandatory to use the coupon.  (along with a $1 per person ""water conservation"" charge)...  Seriously?!? When the waitress came around (she was very nice btw), we explained that the soda was completely flat and maybe they needed to change the CO2. She said they have but they've been having a lot of trouble with it.  REALLY, this $3.50 FLAT soda is mandatory?  When the bill came we had asked to split it in half and pay with 2 cards (mine and my daughters), I guess half meant something else to her. Anyway... Soda, I did explain that we felt taken being forced to order $17.50 of flat soda and they should be ashamed of themselves.  I did this while standing over my flat Diet Coke and my flat Sprite that I had barely taken a couple of sips of.  She said she would talk to the manager. She came back with $7 cash since she couldn't fix the bill. That's ok, but $7?  ""Oh you want it all back?"" Of course we do! I told her don't worry about 1 of them, our teenage grandson didn't mind... Teen boys just drink it, fair enough there!

We had a group of 12 (understandably large but considering the setting it's not bad at all)  and they were able to squeeze us in without too much of a wait (this is the one star). However once we were in and had all ordered which plates we would want, that's when things went down hill. 

Our table seemed to become invisible when it came to the meats, we had about 2 guys come and slice everyone meat and then we had nothing for a good 15 minutes. I've been to other brazillian style churrascaria's where you literally have to turn them away with all the meat they're bringing to your table. We had to inform our waitress before we got maybe 2 more guys to come by. At one point someone in our party had to call out to a guy to come by and slice meat for us and he looked pretty upset to be bothered to serve us. Our party was definitely bothered that they couldn't enjoy their meats like they hoped. 

Actual quality of the meats was ok, not great. A lot of the meats that we did have served were definitely overcooked IMO (I'm more of a medium rare kind of person), but what can you do I guess.

Finally when it came time to split the bill, things went from bad to worse. I understand that splitting the bill can be tedious and time consuming, but the process of getting our bill and paying should not 30-40 minutes. Some people got their checks first, others had to wait an additional 20 minutes before theirs came out and our waitress was no where to be found. We actually asked another employee to help us track her down for the missing checks so we could finish paying and he came back saying that it takes time to split bills for such a big group (aka OUR fault)

First of all, I was really insulted when a big, beautiful glass bottle of water was brought to our table, only for me to discover that it was most definitely tap water and the bottle had been refilled. 

My husband and I ordered sandwiches, his steak and mine veggie, each with a caesar salad. We also ordered the loaded fries to split. Our order took much longer than I would have expected a couple of sandwiches to take, and when it got to our table we were semi-disappointed. The salads were incredibly wilted (but not warm), meaning they were dressed either that morning or more likely the night before. Surprisingly, the sandwiches were pretty good. My veggie sandwich was delicious... But the menu said it would contain portobello mushroom. I've never seen portobello mushrooms that small or that similar looking to regular button mushrooms (if you catch my drift). If I can give this restaurant any tip, it would be to at least cut their fake portobello mushrooms because when they are whole, they shoot out of the sandwich and you end up eating them off of the plate with the fork. 

What really upset me was that when someone (not our server) brought us our food, we mentioned to him that we also had fries coming. He didn't understand us and therefore didn't check the kitchen, so no one knew that they never dropped our fries. Eventually the waitress came to check on us, we mentioned the fries, and she put the order in (it was apparent that she hadn't in the first place). They took another 15 minutes, in total we waited about 45 minutes just for them to bring us fries that ended up being not very good (they were crinkle cut-- I expected something more sophisticated or at least well seasoned), and instead of chives, they put parsley on them.

While the salad was the kitchen's fault entirely, I blame the rest of the frustration with the meal on our server. It was clear she wasn't very good at multi tasking or checking on her tables... Or putting an order in right in the first place.",0,0,0

It is so bad that they need to hand out coupons and advertise for people to eat here. Really? I almost equate this place to a poor man's Churrascaria lol. Service here is mediocre and the food comes out very slow compared to the competition, where food seems to flow out and is carved at tables non-stop. I've only been here a couple times in the last 4 years and it's only usually when I get a comped meal, gift card or coupon. If you don't have any of those then it's not worth it because after visiting the salad bar you'll be waiting all night for the meats to come by. And when one comes, you'll be waiting forever again for the next guy to stop by.

The food itself is ok. I'm not a big salad bar person at these types of places because everything is premade and they usually don't have any regular salads or sides. The quality of the meats are hit or miss because sometimes they are too overcooked. I guess if you like your steaks well done then you won't mind. The meats that aren't overcooked are sometimes too salty which makes them hard to eat as well. I also hate that they don't bring you any fresh sides with your meal because everything is up at the salad bar.

The good news is they have happy hour so if you like wine this may be a good spot to check out since all their glasses of wine are $5, I believe, during happy hour. Don't see myself coming back in the near future. I think I'll stick with my favorite Churrascaria, Texas de Brazil.",7,1,0

They gave us a plate of mix seafood which is too little and not appetizing at all. The best part of this deal
Is the cocktails and dessert..other than that everything else is disappointing.

Service: slow ..the server didnt even ask us if we want a anything else..we have to keep flagging him to get his attention.

Price: Over price for what they offer. 

Overall..i felt that since they have a lot of promotion goin on..they really lowered their standards ...specially on the servings of the food..dont expect anythin from this restaurant..you will be disppointed.",3,0,0

My boyfriend, son and I had dinner here on 09\/14\/2015. He made reservations but trying to find parking in the Miracle Miles garage was rough and the Hotel valet was full. So we ended up being 20 mins late. There was a long line out the doorway and even after checking in we had to wait. I don't think our reservation mattered to the hostesses though because they still went in order. A couple that was waiting when we came left without being seated because they had been waiting too long. We stayed and was patient after all we were late. After about a half hour we were seated. Our Server Renan was great, not too much personality just professional and did his job. The salad bar was very minimal and could've had a lot more sides but the Cous Cous and mushrooms were amazing! The Cous Cous had a Brazilian sauce in it that tasted so good. I've never had Cous Cous like that before. The cocktails were nice not too much liquor but great flavor. Can't remember the names but we had the ones with Acai berries and gaurana in them. Some of the medium rare meats were already cold when they got to our tables but all the meats had flavor and were juicy. We chose the cheesecake for dessert and it was creamy and soft. So good! 

We go out every week to try a new restaurant and overall in terms of food Miami's restaurants beat Las Vegas' hands down and we have been disappointed a lot when we dine out in Vegas.

I was in Las Vegas this past weekend and received a coupon from a girl in Planet Hollywood Mall, so we decided to go try it. The coupon was for $5 off Lunch. We went to the hostess and asked to see the menu first. We noticed that there was a lunch buffet on the menu. One part of the buffet was for salad bar only and the other one was for salad bar with Churrascaria (Meat). The Churrascaria was $19.95 and the Salad Bar Only was $13.95. We asked if the coupon reduced the price to $14.95 for meat or $8.95 for just salad bar only, and she said yes. My friend is a vegetarian that is why we asked about the salad bar only. We were in kind of a rush and needed to eat FAST, so we said okay we would do the salad bar only. We received confirmation that it would be $8.95 per person. 
We fixed our plates and ate our salad bar, which was okay but nothing special. In fact the fried bananas were not like I usually eat at most Brazilian places. I am used to fried plantains but these were some kind of stale fried bananas in corn meal, not even tempura batter, YUK! I actually spit it out. The black beans, rice and salad was actually good and I was enjoying it until we received the bill and they were charging us the normal price $13.95 per person. We calmly explained to the waitress that we gave the girl at the front our coupon. She came back and explained to us that the coupon was only for the Churrascaria, not on the salad bar only. WE explained to her that we had confirmed this with the hostess before being seated. We asked to speak to the manager to resolve the misunderstanding. 
The blonde hair male manager came over with a real smirk on his face and told us that there was nothing he could do. We explained again what we discussed with the hostess before being seated and he with a REAL BIG SMIRK on his face said she would never say that and called us LIARS! My mouth dropped! I was so in shock! I had never had that happen to me before. I kept my cool and tried to calmly explain but he just kept shaking his head NO and smiling really hard, kind of weird like. My friend lost it and started screaming, ""Are you calling us LIARS!"" The entire place stopped and started watching what was going on. He realized this and asked us what we expected him to do and we said nothing but honor what we were told when we arrived. He reluctantly changed the ticket and slammed it back on the table and walked off. The waitress was even embarrassed at his actions.
My friend and I paid the bill and swore we would never come back to this place as long as that manager was working there. I only wish that we could have gotten in touch with the OWNER because he should FIRE that guy.
As a business owner myself, I would never treat my customers like that or anyone for that is concerned. My only advice is that if you are offered a coupon to try it, make sure you get confirmation of the real deal and record it for proof just in case this guy does this again.

We arrived on time for a 730 reservation, and we're told to wait another 15 minutes. No problem, sat at the bar for a while. We were finally seated 30 minutes later, and waited 10 minutes for our server. Finally the floor manager took our drink order. 

The salad bar was not as good as places I've been in the past. The only item I liked were the deep fried bananas and cheese bread. Some items I usually enjoy, mashed potatoes, tempura, and Caesar salad all fell short. 

The meat came around infrequently. Initially only 4 cuts came around on a regular basis, without seeing any other meats. We eventually told those guys to stop coming, and told the manager. Slowly other cuts came around, and we became frustrated. I don't think either of us got out fill. 

The quality of the meat was poor. Nothing stood out except for bacon wrapped turkey, but then again how can you mess up bacon. 

We spoke with the manager again, and he comped us desert. I had the cheesecake which was ""okay"".

Unfortunately, the service was slow and, for a while, there was only one man going around serving.  The ""seafood"" option was simply a plate of fried seafood (that came out cold), it wasn't exactly what was advertised, as we were under the impression it would be served out similarly to the meat.  And, though the meat was above mediocre, the lack of servers definitely put a damper on the meal.  Sadly enough, I was most pleased with the salad bar.

To top it all off, our waitress was fairly rude and made comments under her breath about how our order came out wrong (as if it was our fault).  I'd suggest going elsewhere -- with the amount of money you would spend there, you could go to a lunch buffet at Bellagio!

Inch of employees huddled 10ft from our table discussing workplace drama.. we called our new server over and explained to her that we hadn't been getting meats. Then the top sirloin came again with the chicken.. we declined and waited for what felt like another eternity before we mentioned to our server that the meats hadn't arrived. She mentioned it to the manager who was also huddled in the corner discussing the drama. Needless to say this went on for a while the manager came over and heard our complaints but we never saw him again. I wouldn't recommend Pampas. Save your money or if you really wanna eat Brazilian go to towne center or anyplace else,.

The salad bar was beautiful but nothing compared to the service. The meat stewards were friendly and would bring orders to your table that were prepared to your liking.  Stephanie went over and beyond in making sure we were taken care of and stayed well satisfied.

One of the best places on the strip. In the beginning, most were on the well done side but they quickly corrected when asked for a fresh rare piece.

He offered us a great coupon if we ordered a pitcher of sangria or margherita, and said it was a great deal. So we ordered the Margherita. We ordered the all you can eat salad and meat and added the seafood ( overcooked shrimp) and went to get our stuff from the salad bar. That's where it turned bad. The person tending was cleaning the dropped food off and pushing it back into the containers with his rag, seriously disgusting!!! So we skipped eating that. Our sad plates were never taken away, and fresh plates for our meat was never given. We had to use the salad plate, and pushed what little we had on them to the side. If my feet hadn't hurt so bad we would have walked somewhere else, but I needed the break. So we gave the meats a try... the shrimp was bland and chewy. The only 2 meats that came around were extra extra extra well done and disgusting. We were ready to walk out... so upset this was my birthday trip and dinner. He said oh you're done (after he had been lost in a portal somewhere, for quite some time) I replied yes I can't eat this stuff. We expected for a manager to come over... nope, that would be good service. Instead he brought us our bill and showed us what 20 &25% tip would be. Really? A tip for no service, bad food, lack of meat selection and a recycled salad bar? Seriously avoid this place at all costs. I have never done this before but I will be handwriting a letter to the management so they know just how bad this experience was.

The cost was $38.99 for the Rodizio.  I ordered a grilled season chicken and fries for $28.99 that was good, but way too much food.  Which was the problem.

They don't keep a close eye on you here.  I was eating the extra meat from my friends extra plate the entire time waiting for my chicken.  By the time it arrived, I was full!  I should've not used the coupon and ordered an appetizer and snacked on the filet mignon coming around all night!

Doesn't make sense, I know...but I liked that the servers brought out huge cuts of meat on these giant spears and sliced it right at your table, and there wasn't too much time inbetween meats.  There was also a big selection of hot side dishes and cold salads to choose from at the salad bar buffet.  The downside  was that the hot sides weren't so hot and the cold salads were about the same temp.  I liked the beans, rice, and the yummy parmesan-crusted moist and flakey rolls (which managed to stay warm).  Those were the only memorable sides.  The memorable meats were the pork loin, moist and well-seasoned, although a bit too salty, the turkey sausage, thick and juicy, the spicy chicken, crisp on the outside, moist inside, the roast beef (deliciously tender) , and the lamb, though not that tender had great flavor.  And the grilled pineapple was the bomb.  That night we had efficient and friendly service.  

Of all the choices you have in Vegas, this is a pretty decent one if you get the discount price from the ""1\/2 price ticket booth"".  It's a great deal...you pay the ticket booth a $3pp fee, they make the reservations for you (definitely recommended) and give you a voucher for $19.99pp.  The all-u-can-eat meats and salad bar is regularly $36.99pp.  My total bill, including a glass of wine, tax & tip, was $35.

The filet mignon was dry and the parmesan crust was AWFUL.  Filet should melt in your mouth.  I knawed until my jaw hurt, and that was only after I spent several minutes cutting through it.

All of the poultry was salty.  The turkey wrapped bacon did nothing for the taste of the meat but make it too salty.  

The seafood was decent, but I've definitely had better.
My favorite thing was the ham and pineapple, but only because the pineapple was so good.

I've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, so I was really excited to try their unlimited meat rodizio and side salad bar. 

My favorite of the meat rodizio is hands down the top sirloin! It's soo delicious and I like my meat medium rare, it was perfection! All the other meat were good too, but that one stood out to me. There are so many options available, &  I really love the red\/green side of the card so the servers know when to come or not to your table. 

The side salad bar has many options as well, ranging from; salads, salad toppings, veggies, mashed potatoes, salami and cheese! I couldn't help but go at least twice to the salad bar. Although, I didn't want to fill up too much on side items as the meat rodizio was unlimited. I wanted to make sure I tried everything including the chicken hearts. You just have to order it with your server because they don't walk around with the chicken hearts, must not be very popular? 

Food is nothing short of amazing. Service was great too, our server was very attentive. We both left full and happy. Come hungry, you'll want to get your moneys worth =P",6,2,1

There's a decent variety of things available and I was able to grab a quick bite and move on. Nothing spectacular but solid enough choices all around.

Our Groupon came with two cocktails- try the Caipirinhas, they have a variety of flavors and are not too sweet, with just the right amount of booze.

Groupon also came with a side of seafood- the fish had good flavor and was well-cooked, shrimp was also very good, mussels were unfortunately a little fishy for my taste. 

We had a few cuts of chicken, but after a while, our main focus was on the tri-tip and steak...it was a little salty due to being the end pieces, but still good, especially when combined with a large scoop of horseradish. Yum. Love me some good horseradish. 

Ambiance is quaint, service is a little slower than I would have liked. If it weren't for the Groupon, I wouldn't have come here, much less even know that Pampas existed on the strip. I feel that I got my money's worth, and would recommend to others visiting Las Vegas.",3,0,0

After I was seated, my server asked if there would be one or two joining me. ""Two"". She poured my glass of water and the one across me, saw my Vegas4locals voucher unfolded, stopped pouring, let out a little growl, shook her hair directly over the water of my guest, and walked swiftly away. Maybe a bug flew in her ear. Maybe she had forgot something that she just remembered. Maybe she didn't like my voucher which was not free! I bid many times on 7 other auctions before I won(?). After the ladies arrived, she came back and asked what we wanted. I introduced the ladies as current A-list banquet food servers and me as a former one. A normal reaction is to celebrate, because it is virtually impossible to screw up a great tip. After ordering, she explained that we needed two plates; one for the salad, and the other for meat. She circled behind me, and then walked across in front several feet away. I confess that my next question was a rudeness test. ""That was two plates, right?"" She answered, ""TOooo plates"" as she looked down at her pad while shaking her head no, and moving two fingers back and forth while twisting her wrist both ways. Try doing all of that yourself. That two stupid word reply ""TOooo plates"" has kept me awake more than once, because NOBODY could be that rude in this business!! My watery drink took an hour. I heard, ""Are you finished with this?"" on my right; I looked to my right, then to the left. She had taken my salad plate, and within earshot I said' ""nooo"" to no avail. Finally, the check comes; I know that's what it was because she showed it to me from 4 feet away for a full second before closing in on the ladies. WAIT ONE F#&%ING SECOND. I understand that I'm not much to look at, and I carry a Shillelagh, but if a server wants to talk about the check, they better make sure that they are INDEED talking to the host. Besides, GODDAMMIT, ""I'm A MAN, not much of one, but A MAN.""~~Daniel Tosh. While I waved for the check to come my way, she turned left and got it closer to Tomie, one of my former shop stewards, so I leaned in to see. This little POS was telling Tomie that any gratuity should be based on this number and not this one. I leaned as far as possible, and she moved the check about 1\/8 of an inch, so that I still couldn't see anything. I got her attention loudly! ""Why won't you look at me?"" ""I thought that I was looking at all of you."" ""Well you weren't!!! At this point, I can't remember very much while being this upset, but I think that I demanded she leave. SHE WAS TAKING THE INITIATIVE OF DISCUSSING THE TIP!!!! Almost nothing gets you fired more quickly in the service industry--it is the Golden Rule. Maybe that's why I leaned so far, because her voice got soft so nobody but Tomie and Sabe would hear her. I threw two one hundred dollar bills for the $189 bill into the wallet which she picked up, began to walk away, turned around, and said kindly, ""Do you want your(?)...""  NOT AGAIN!!!!!! She was begging a tip for a SECOND time!!!! I EXPLODED!!! ""DON'T YOU...... (as I shook and pointed a finger at her)"". I calmed a little and said, ""bring me my change!"" That last one was an attempt to get 11 stupid dollars. I have NEVER EVEN SEEN OR HEARD any server being RUDE or BLATANTLY INITIALIZING DISCUSSION OF THE GRATUITY. Reviews that I read mentioned the servers were rude. I said it was BS. It took me 2+ weeks to start this review. I was so mad that I wouldn't tip; ANOTHER FIRST. My guests tipped $35. The manager smiled like she had a mask on as she listened, that's it. I held my glass as I left so that sorry excuse of a waitress would have to stop me for a final stare down alone.

Our waitress didn't come by often.  She was there to take our drink order, and returned to hand us our bill.

The staff with the meat do come by very often and for the surf, we each got a piece of scallop, shark, salmon, and shrimp.  The shark tasted...odd.  I am not a fan.

Our favorite item is the cheese bread pão de queijo.  The third time I came back to get another 4 pieces, there was none left.  I asked one of the kitchen staff to bring out more since the basket is empty and 5 minutes later, he gave me a plate of fresh hot pão de queijo...He is the awesome-est person there.

To me this is as simple of an explanation that I can give to my thoughts on Pampas Churrascaria.  To an extent, it pains me to say this because the meat was, as advertised, very good.  The rest of the experience, however, was not up to par with, to be honest, my lowest expectation.

The strategy of this business is very simple.  Get people in the door, get them fed, get them out not caring about repeat business because we are all tourists anyways.  They are the classic coupon\/gimmick facility mimicking the stores that mark their prices up merely so they can offer a discount and people feel like they are getting a deal.  You won't.  I guarantee that, even by Vegas standards, you will pay more then what it is worth despite your 2-1 coupon that somebody handed you on the strip, or your Groupon, or one of the other discounts that every single person in line seemed to have.  

I'll admit that it is tempting.  We fell for it.  After reading several varying accounts we decided to give it a chance but afterwards we were left with this feeling of good meats completely void of any type of atmosphere which is really quite sad.

Now to be fair, Pampas does receive some accolades from me and I'll explain them here.  

First, the hostess station was commendable.  Despite being extremely busy they were able to accommodate us earlier then our reservation when we asked.  They also handled a very heavy workload filled with very needy people quite well.  People were jumping the line to ask questions, hovering around them, not an easy work environment for a restaurant employee and I felt they did an excellent job.  The question remains, however, why is the structure set up in this way to allow a line with roughly 20 people in it just to check in.

Secondly, the cuts of meat were delicious and they seemed to come around often enough.  If you are in the food industry and you have good food that should account for a star.  We also had the Tiramisu for dessert which was a great portion and very tasty.

Outside of these two bright spots however, this place could not live up to even the mildest of expectations.  The buffet portion of the restaurant was incredibly lackluster and required a very treacherous journey dodging other patrons, trays and workers.  We ordered the surf and turf which was a complete waste and hardly touched given that fact.  The service was efficient but lacked any sort of outward personality whatsoever.  Actually, that is not true, our server absolutely reeked of ""I'm too good for my job"" which inevitably led to much of the bad experience.  There were no facial expressions, no changing of tone of voice, it was as if it was a very apathetic robot was asking us if we wanted to start with water and then jabbing us with a $6 bottle which is another story.  I would rather deal with a server forgetting our food, screwing up our order, etc if their is a little bit of humanism behind it then deal with some arrogant facade.  Maybe he was having a bad day, I know that happens but for some reason I really doubt that was the case.

All in all, if you are considering this place that means you are in Vegas.  And if you are in Vegas you have virtually an unlimited variety of establishments serving up amazing food.  It's not worth your time and it  is not worth your money, and when they are so many other worthy options all around you make sure you don't waster either of those things here.",2,0,0

The groupon was reasonably priced at $48.00. Good parts were the beverages - they were tasty - the margarita and caipirihina tasted like they came straight from baby Jesus' ball sack- very delicious.  The bad was that for a Brazilian steak house with unlimited meat the choices were about as vast as a vegan party, and the surf part was just horrible. the mussels looked like discarded tumors and the idea of peeling back my own shrimp and removing the poop line is absurd. I'm all for fresh but not when you're paying 50 sheckles. The the potatoes were instant, the tiramisu was as soggy and had as much flavor as my son's diaper.  This restaurant only gets 2 stars because of the drinks and waitress being friendly.  Meat servers were slow and looked like something out of a Frankenstein movie.

My parents bought my girlfriend and I, whom are both Vegas industry workers, the groupon for Pampas for her birthday; we have never been so let down.

We both had surf and turf, which was fantastic, when we didn't get a charred end piece of meat. They are authentic and cut the meat off skewers, which leads to various inconsistencies. Example, the tri-tip just came out, I got a burnt piece with almost no meat at all, while the next piece was perfect. Our meat server seemed to have noticed but as with every table, just wanted to get his round done with. 

Besides Jonathan, this is the worst staff in Vegas. They seem as if you are a burden, unwilling to be friendly or helpful about any inquiries towards their cuisine. It's in the way they won't look at you in the eye, return any manner pleasantries or even smile.

I have never been so unimpressed with a restaurant in Vegas and when $147 gets two surf and turf dinners, two drinks and dessert.. You could dine at a plethora of better eateries.

We should have realized then they were trying too hard to get clientele into the restaurant. 

However, putting that aside we were seated shortly after arriving... and waited. Our server had a dismissive attitude and was more concerned about a dirty table needing to be cleared in his section than introducing himself and taking our order. Then after having to repeat our drink order three times he still managed to bring the wrong drink ...not once but twice. Thereafter he was pretty much absent from our table-- --however, very noticeably impatient with another couple as he kept looking at his watch as they tried to decide what they wanted. Towards the end of the meal he did inquire if there was any item we'd like more of and I mentioned the tri-tip which never again came our way. 

In spite of the service I was still hoping to have an enjoyable meal. Not. The food was way over-salted and the quality of meat was very disappointing. We also had the option that included the seafood of which their ""go to"" flavor was obviously teriyaki - teriyaki  salmon, teriyaki mahi mahi...  and the shrimp was soft and soggy.

Our waiter told us we couldn't sit together while the other server pulled tables together for his customers. Strike one! Serve said he wouldn't put our bills together because we didn't sit together??? Umm ok I have been a server and it's very easy to do that unless you are lazy. It's a Brazilian steak house where we get our own food and the serve has to bring us drinks and maybe ask about desert! Well we got drinks we didn't order plus got charged for them then we waited for 45 min to see the sever to get dessert. The server wouldn't answer any questions was rude and got automatic 20 percent for doing absolutely nothing on an $800 bill!,1,0,0

The meat servers were ok, but we had to ask for Pork, and we never got any of some of the other things. Now mind you it was lunch time, so not super busy. I can't imagine how bad it would be if they were busy. servers would just walk right past you and ignore you. We had servers helping people RIGHT next to us and well as just a few tables away. Even some of them complained about the level or lack of service. After over an hour, we finally had to flag someone down and ask them about our dessert we were supposed to receive with our meal, and told them we would need it to go since they took so long.

So they started serving breakfast recently, and I got a hold of a coupon for $6.50\/person. It seemed like a really good deal at the time, so I talked the fam into going. Which I completely regret doing cos I don't talk the fam into doing many things, and this time that I did completely sucked, and now I feel guilty that I did. =\

For one, our waiter was whack. My mum and brother had never done rodizio before, so they weren't sure what was going on. But at least they had BF and myself to explain. Any other noobs would've been completely lost. Cos not only were we seated for a pretty long time before our waiter came, when he finally did make it around to us, he did a poor job of explaining everything. Keep in mind this is morning time, with just one other table occupied besides ours. I couldn't help but watch this guy do nonsense stuff while we were just left hanging. Time after time again. I'm a lot more keen on waiter-behavior now, after doing my own time waiting tables.

The meat servers were...okay. They were definitely nice enough. But they just didn't have skills. Remember when I talked about Texas de Brazil meat servers looking unhappy? Well happy or not, I didn't get to appreciate their skills at cutting meat until seeing Pampas guys cutting meat. Watching these guys was so, so awkward. They were going for thin slices but then were only able to cut so much at the width they were cutting... It just seemed like such a process, whereas at Texas, voila--big chunka meat. The tables are also kinda small, so the servers would kind of have to cram in at the corners, and we were asked to move things around for them a few times.... Awkward.

The food itself was blah. It reminded me of what you might find at a cheap hotel's complimentary breakfast. You can def find better breakfast food at any other breakfast buffet in town. And what's up with that top glass that goes so far out, you have to crouch, stick your head in, and reach for inner items? Awkward. The breakfast meats included picanha, or 'beef' as we were told, ham, breakfast sausage, and some other sausage, ranging from substandard to standard. The best thing was definitely the grilled pineapple. Although the first time it came around, it was just normal pineapple. But the second time it came around, it was fresh off the grill, and that was absolutely delicious. It was the one and only good part of this whole experience. Oh, wait. $3 mimosas aren't bad either.

But to top off the bad, I'm pretty sure they overcharged us. And it sucks cos my mum is one of those who just hands over her credit card without looking at the check. I wonder how we're so deep in debt.... I even got reprimanded for being so stingy\/skeptical when I mentioned something about the total being more than expected. Hey, I just like to know where my money's going. So I think it might've been that they didn't have a button or whatever to calculate this coupon we had, and they ended up just charging us the full price ($12.95) for three people instead of the $6.50 for four people. That's a difference of $12.85. I blame that waiter of ours. Bastard.",2,1,1

First off, we bought the surf & turf rodizio on GroupOn for 2. The photo for this GroupOn was on steak & lobster... We arrive, got seated and was told there is no lobster included in our meal... Instead we are served a plate with wilted fish, peel and eat shrimp & broken old looking mussels! We were told this was unlimited... The only thing we asked more of was the salmon & they finally delivered a piece, 25 minutes later.

We had to ask several busboys  for meat to be brought by our table because we sat for at least 10 minutes with nothing on our plates. Not quick at all on meat circulation. Finally after waiting more, the meat came out way.. 

I feel completely mislead by the description of this meal and then customer service experience was horrible! 

There was a check in option on Yelp for a bottle of wine. I was denied the bottle of wine because the waitress said we didn't buy a full price meal? Shouldn't that be stipulated on check in? Free bottle of wine with purchase of a full priced meal for checking in? Again, misled....

The utensils were absolutely dirty, which makes me really wanna get up and leave immediately. I returned the dirty utensil to my waitress, she just simply takes it and gives another one to me without any apology.

Then he refused to serve us because we decide to share.
I get up and tried to get the manager, the waitress stopped me in the middle and asked me what happen. After I explained myself, the waitress talked to the meat cutter and let the meat cutter to talk to me, that meat cutter said I didn't want the chicken drumsticks, which is a ridiculous big lie! 
I get upset and want to talk to the manager, the waitress told me to clam down and said the meat server was apologizing. I was like Are you kidding me? That's arguing, not apologizing. I wonder how those people got trained in the first place.
At the end of the night, I ask for manager, and the waitress told me he was in the middle of the meeting. When I try to fill out a comment card instead, she told me they just don't have anything like that.

This review is solely based on my own honest opinion in regards to a recent visit at said establishment and not being posted out of any malice or slander.

I have several complaints. 
First, when you are seated, the waiter poured each of us a glass of water. After we all took a drink of the water, he then told us that this restaurant belongs to some kind of water conservation program and that we were each going to be charged an additional $1.00 per person for the table water. What a scam.
Second, the service was so slow. The waiter comes to your table every so often and only gives you two slices of meat.  I had to constantly call for the waiter to come for more meat.
Third, I asked for the tarasco steak and was told there is none.
Fourth, when the girl comes to take your Free photo, say NO right away or you will regret it later. Trust me on this one.

Boy was that a mistake.  When we approached the hostess we asked if we were able to use our total rewards rewards credit towards our meal as we had accumulated a few hundred dollars worth of reward credits.  She politely said yes and say us promptly when we presented our platinum total rewards card.   

As we began service we ordered drinks as it was one of the requirements of the coupon and has waters all around.  Food options were okay as there were 12 options of meat along with unlimited shrimp skewers.  Unfortunately the meats were all dry and very bland.  When we asked for some seasoning they failed to deliver us any side seasoning for the meats.  We continued our meal and when our check came the check stated suggested gratuity with 20% calculated but the server stated that there was an auto gratuity added to our check due to our party size.  This did not sit well as the check clearly stated suggested gratuity and not auto gratuity or service charge.  On top of that they charged us for water which was tap water.

I would not recommend this place to anyone and to beware of their false advertisements of the use of total rewards reward credits and malpractice of suggested tips.

Went on a Groupon deal, and still would never go again nor recommend it to anyone. There are a billion places to eat in LV with better service and better food for the price. This place just stank all around. To start, the main dining room was completely empty at 1PM on a Friday, and yet I was told that there would be a 15-minute wait to be seated. ?  So, I opted to sit at the bar, as the initially friendly bartender told me that the Rozidio servers still made rounds through that area. Well, while that was true, they didn't come by very often at all, had to be flagged down, and the bartender acted horribly swamped, even though there were so few occupied tables. My water was never refilled either, and it took FOREVER to get drinks in the first place. So, the Groupon itself included a cocktail, dessert, and the ""surf and turf"" rodizio. When the seafood never came out, I noticed that another group at the bar had seafood. When I asked the bartender, he mentioned that I had to order that from the kitchen. It would have been nice to know that BEFORE I sat for over an hour for lunch, especially since he was well aware that I was using a Groupon for that particular meal choice. :(

I actually forewent the remainder of my meal, as the meat and sides were all mediocre at best, and the service was a complete wash.

My boyfriend and I made it a tradition to make sure we eat here every time were in Vegas. Our waiters are usually the sweetest most helpful people and the food is to die for.

We used the Groupon for this place, it was a good deal, but honestly I could care less because if the food is not good, it doesn't matter if I could have unlimited quantity of it.  Most of the meats were overcooked and lacking in flavor.  The shrimps were dry and woody.  The best thing they had were the grilled pineapples.  The grilling made the fruit sweeter and more aromatic, and the acidity helped digest all that mediocre food, so you could have more of it.

Seafood:
The tilapia was stiff and the others were plain besides the salmon. 

Salad bar:
The salad bar looked so delicious but I couldn't find myself embracing the flavors...
It tasted all from a can and not fresh.

Meat:
Favorites are the top sirloin, bacon wrapped fillet, and tri tip!

First off the people are just SO NICE! All in all Vegas is a very good customer service town, but the people here are just great. From the greeter to our server Jessica it was a pleasure to be there. Secondly, the restaurant is neat, softly lit, not a great deal of noise. Just a nice place to relax after a tough days work. 

But the best part is the food! I have a Brazilian BBQ by my home in Millbrae and I love it but this place just raises Brazilian BBQ to a new level. The selection of meats were wonderful, but i really liked the addition of seafood to the mix. By the way the grilled shrimp were great! The salad bar there was also very nice. You go for the meat, but I had the best Brazilian potato salad there along with a wonderful salad of Roma tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese. The fried bananas were not great but nobody is perfect.

I recommended this place to my out of town friend so we came a 2nd time and brought 6 people. Service was a complete 180 from our first time. We gave it another shot on Valentine's yesterday. Service was the complete worst iv experienced anywhere. Our waitress Alessandra was terrible and it's nothing personal I think that she was overwhelmed within her own capacity as when we got there the restaurant was only half full. It took the first round of meat 20 minutes to arrive and about 30 min into our dinner our server asked us if we were ready for dessert. Very frustrating because you could clearly tell our plate were near clean still. Next was the issues with the food in an hour long sink experience only 3 of the 20 plus meats came by and at one point we asked our server if she could send over the serloin guy she asked us how we wants it cooks and said she would send him over. 15 minutes later the guy came by with the last couple slices of meat and they were well done. We asked for our dessert finally and she be out us our check before our dessert. Right when we got the dessert she asked if she could take our check. Me and my girlfriend felt as though she was trying to rush is out of the place. This place needs a serious overhaul in service if they expect to keep customers.

We all decided to get they'll you can eat meat choice. This included all you can eat salad bar and such which had soup, salads, veggies.

Service: was very slow. Anytime we had to request for an item we had to ask 2-3 times . Also at times the request we put in, the item didn't come. The servers , I feel bad for, because you can see that they're busy but their service felt rushed. The check also took a long time to receive.

       - Quality - Perhaps I got a bad piece, but the meat quality of my rib eye 
       - Value - Save the Pork Ribs, the value of this place is horrendous. I paid $40 for a steak that I could easily find for $15 elsewhere. No wonder they're always having deals on Restaurant.com or Groupon.
       - Rodizio - Though I didn't get the rodizio dinner, from the looks of the meats passing by, the selection is limited compared to Via Brasil. With the same price as Via Brasil, the service and ambiance is reminiscence of your local Applebees than a fine dining establishment.
**Price**
       - $11.95 Malagueta Pork Ribs
       - $39.95 Rib Eye Steak
**Ordered**
       - Malagueta Pork Ribs - 4 succulent pork ribs over a bed of black beans and rice. It was slightly crispy on the outside  and juicy on the inside. The flavor was delightfully sweet and salty. If you're looking for a small meal, this would be the perfect choice.
       - Rib Eye Steak - The steak comes with their Buffet Bar that's priced at $24.95. The Buffet Bar is definitely not worth that much. I'd say $10 at most. I ordered the steak medium rare and it came out as so, but it wasn't tender at all. Somehow they managed to make the steak as hard as if it were cooked well done, while having a pink center.

**Recommendations**
       - I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Rodizio wise, Via Brasil is definitely a better choice. Steak wise, there are so many actual steak houses where you'd pay the same price and get way better cuts of meats cooked right.",3,0,0

It would have been nice to be given a choice. We decided to order entrees since it was late. The dinner service was poor the entire night. To begin, my family is French and have lived in the US and ordered water without ice from the server. The busser arrived with the water glasses and they were filled with ice, they asked the busser to bring water without ice and he rolled his eyes and said he would let the waiter know. He eventually returned with two glasses and we assumed he would return, with the other two, he never did. He was asked later to bring a glass with no ice. We inquired about the wines and the server could not offer any information except to try a cab. 

The server suggested adding the salad bar after we ordered. It was very disappointing, two of the trays were empty and a few other trays were almost empty. I was happy I did not order the  buffet.

We were in the middle of eating our salads and the entrees arrived. It would have been nicer to have enjoyed the salad. When the food arrived the tables were so close that we had to handle our own plates as the server could not get behind our chairs to put down the plates. The filet mignons were dry and when asked for extra sauce the server returned and said it was impossible as the sauces were cooked to order with each filet. The skirt steak was flavorful and juicy. The bouillabaisse  passed the palate test. 

Will I return? No. The  level of service was poor for the price that was paid.

After the tour, we were nothing but convinced! All you can eat meat and seafood. The salad bar was fresh and food was excellent! We went during lunch, so it wasn't to busy. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. He made sure our drinks were re-filled and plenty of food stayed on our table.

I'm glad we got lost and end up in this place because we will definitely come back with or without the coupon lol",0,0,0

I made a reservation for 7 for the two of us.
We were running a bit late because of strip traffic, and got to the hostess stand at 6:59, she said we were checked in, and had to wait 15 minutes.  
My husband then ran to the restroom, and I waited in the most crowed lobby I've ever been in.
He wasn't back by the time they sat me, so I went a lone to the smallest table in the smallest corner of OUTSIDE OF THE RESTAURANT!  You're kidding me right?  You're seriously sitting me in the hallway of the hotel\/casino?!  I was livid.  But let it go, it's supposed to be our speical night. Our waiter came over and immediately asked if we had any coupons (tacky much?) but yes, I had coupons!  (It's tacky, I know, but we thought we had a good deal).  The almost unintelligible waiter informed us that the coupon only gave us access to the salad bar.......urge to kill, rising. 
 At that point I lost it.  ""This isn't what I was expecting"", I need another table.  
He went to go talk to the hostess to get us another table, in the meantime, another almost unintelligible girl came up with a HUGE CART of ""house drinks"" gave some BS about them, and just about forced you to buy it. ""no thank you"" your sure?!! ""YES!""

+1 star for the waiter being on his game tho, and getting us another table INSIDE the restaurant, and even better right by the salad bar. 
Let me try to get something across, there is NO ROOM to move in that place whatsoever.  You bump into people everywhere, the tables and chairs are packed so tight you have to shimmy behind them.  Could you imagine carrying a tray of salad over 100ft back to your table?!  Not this girl.

Anyway, so we're inside now, got a new waiter, who was amazing, I'm ashamed I didn't get his name.  He was shorter, bald and had an Aussie or New Zealand accent, if you read this, thank you sir, you made our night.
But anyway, with new waiter, we showed him the coupons, and he let us know that yes, we get the salad bar and we get an hour of open bar (well drinks, draft beer, house red and white wine). Ohhh, ok, that's cool.  And if we would like to partake in the meat, it's $20 more a person.  Well yeah!  We're at a better table, I feel like I'm in the restaurant, we came here for that, so yeah, BRING ON THE MEAT!
So with two Blue Moons on the way, I go up to the salad bar.  I saw mozzarella balls with balsamic vinegar and just loaded up on them.  They are my favorite.  Grabbed some tomatoes, and extra vinegar.  Grabbed some of the Italian pasta salad, and a few containers of their cimichurry (sp?) sauces (for the meat I was assuming).  I love condiments.
My husband had flipped his card to green, then went up to the bar as well.  Almost immediately, they came over with the meat.  Alex (also my son's name) had some chicken wrapped in bacon, and sausage.  I didn't know how it worked with the portions, so I got one of each for me, and my husband.  I was still eating my mozzarella while the meat was piling up on my plate.  I had flipped my card to red because I wanted to take my time, relax and go at a slow pace to the onslaught of meat I knew was coming.  Not my husband, he downed his salad, then started cleaning his plate of meat while mine piled higher and higher.  Even tho I had a red card, they would still ask me if I wanted the meat.  I had my mouth full, and kept having to say no.  But wow that sausage was good.  The chicken was very dry, the pork was tasty, and the other meats faded into each other as piece after piece was dropped on my plate.  I remember lamb, tri tip, ham, even some roasted pineapple and oh yeah, the sausage!  I was stuffed...and we still had 30 mins on our open bar.  My hubby got 2 more beers, and I nursed my first one all night.  
Even after everything that went wrong, the service of the new waiter saved the night, and the food was tasty enough to make us want to go back, like today, but IT'S SO PRICEY!  We got a credit for the coupons we had, and the $40 we spent that night, the bill came to $130, but we only had to pay the $40.  We tipped the waiter on the $130, as you should, and he seemed to be appreciative of that.  So that made us happy.
It stared out horrible, and I wanted to walk out, but we had those coupons, and it was our anniversary...so I waited it out, and it tuned out great.  But there is nothing relaxing or calm about that place.  When and if you go, just remember that it's a very hectic atmosphere...maybe you'll be in a better mindset then I was.",1,1,0

This was not the case. This was the first time I went to a Brazilian steakhouse and had a poor experience.

The meat: The main reason why we went here was to get our meat fix on! It was bad...i mean BAD. The quality of the meat was equivalent of the ""T.G.I. Fridays of Brazilian Steakhouses"". The meat quality was poor and although they offered the piccanha rare or more well done,  everything else was over cooked.  The seasoning on the meat was almost non existent. We were expecting the traditional salty goodness on the outside of the meat with the crusty outside of the meat, but it wasn't there at all. Just overcooked meat with no seasoning. To be honest, the meat even tasted old I kid you not. The brazilian sausage is something I really looked forward to (at other brazilian restaurants as well) and my fiancee and I looked at each other and both thought it was hill shire farms sausage. They say it was made in house on the menu, but seriously, they shouldve saved the time and just bought the hillshire farms sausage from the grocery store right next to where they got their salad bar items. 

The salad bar: I kid you not when I say this, but I felt like I walked into a grocery store salad bar. The fried bananas shouldn't really be deep fried with breading on it, its supposed to be in a pan with I assume butter and sugar. The bananas were breaded, but not only that, they were soggy and have definitely been sitting there a LONG time.  The cheese bread are also one of the big reasons why we go there! They were stale and dried out (also have been sitting there) you would assume it would have been fresh since dinner service had just started.  The soups were a disgrace as well. Chicken noodle soup and lentil soup? Really? I don't really know about the lentil soup, but chicken noodle doesn't scream Brazilian to me. Even their competitors Texas De Brazil have lobster bisque!  They even had eggrolls at the salad bar! WTF?! If I wanted egg rolls I wold have gone to a chinese restaurant.  This was unacceptable.

The Service: We waited maybe 5 minutes to be seated, so it wasn't bad. When we did get a table (there were many other tables open) we were pretty much stuck in the corner with no server for about 15 minutes. We were literally looking around to see if they forgot about us! The manager finally realized we were looking around and desperately tried to win us over, pushing the desserts and wine when we haven't even been given any other food or water for that matter. 10 more minutes pass (now 25 minutes after being seated) and our server comes up to us and literally says ""HI my name is David, I will be your server. Please let me know if you need anything and go ahead to the salad bar"" and then quickly walked away to tend to another table. 
I suppose I could add this to service, but there was a lady with a ""drink cart"" that was really pressuring us to get the Caipirinha, the Brazilian cocktail. When we said we had them before, she asked oh, you didn't like it? why not? I don't know lady! leave us alone! They really tried pushing alot of extra stuff on us, I suppose it is their job, but damn it made things awkward. The whole drink cart idea was tacky. 

The only ""pro"" I can honestly add to this was the $10 coupon they were handing out in front of the restaurant, but even with a combined $20 dollars off  for my fiancee and i, it still wasn't worth it at all.  I would genuinely say save your time and your money and go to Texas De Brazil or Fogo De Chao because even though they are a ""chain"" they know what they are doing service wise, and especially the food (meat!).  

I usually write about places that I love, but this restaurant really made me want to go home and warn people about the quality you will be getting. I've been to many brazilian steak houses but this was by far the worst.

Thanks to my indecisiveness when it comes to choosing a dinner spot, I let him pick.  He suggested we check out a Brazilian steakhouse type joint he had seen earlier while walking through the Miracle Mile Shops.  Sure! So we we headed to what turned out to be Pampas Churrascaria.  

We were quickly seated by the hostess and began exploring the menu.  Our server came over - his name was Juan and he was awesome :-D We ordered 2 margaritas, and then he told us of a special that he could offer us that would include all the meats as well as unlimited shrimp + the salad bar because we ordered drinks...for less than just the price of unlimited meat on its own! (can't remember the exact amount, but I believe that it was either $33 or $36 - either way, a GREAT deal!).  Obviously we took it.

My strawberry margarita was ok - it was a little sweet for my taste, but I downed it nonetheless.

Off to the salad bar we went! They had a REALLY great assortment that I thoroughly enjoyed - hearts of palm, tomatoes, various pasta salads, different types of fried peppers, cheeses, salami, mozzarella, orzo, green beans, and our favorite - some kind of fried bananas! Honestly, the salad bar was excellent!
We returned to our table with our fully loaded plates.  A plate of shrimp was brought out to us with some kind of light teriyaki-like sauce - it was very good!

Then came the meats...I'm a BIG meat eater.  We were given chicken leg, chicken wrapped bacon, pork, ham, flank steak, lamb, and 2 other types of steak meat (can't remember what they were specifically).  Overall, the meat was good, but it wasn't the best I've ever had at this type of Brazilian type of restaurant.  My favorite meat was actually the chicken leg - now that was delicious!

Still, we stuffed ourselves silly! Overall, it was a good dinner and I would definitely return because of the fantastic value for your money, but it's not the most refined or flavorful meat on the planet.  I want to give another shoutout to our waiter Juan for his excellent service!",0,0,0

It felt like we were walking forever!  This place was so hard to find! My husband almost veto'd the whole thing, we asked for directions like 5 times!!!!

We get there, 40mins late for our reservation by the way. We wait about 15mins for a table . The server was pretty nice, she was serving way too many tables to truly be attentive to us. But we understood. My husband loves to eat nothing but meat (no veggies) he didn't seem impressed at all with the taste of the meat. I was looking more forward to the salad bar. I was disappointed that the only salad available was Caesar salad and romain lettuce with some vinaigrette. I wanted more green salad options. There were tons of other salad I don't eat like: Crab salad, noodle salad, etc. but I craved more fresh garden options in the salad bar area. The seafood served was just average. Thanks to Groupon we didn't regret the visit, our bill came and we were pretty happy with the $2 bill. No offense but I won't be back.

I'm still sitting here after 30mins waiting for our shrimp and salmon plate! And two couples who have came after us was given the plate of seafood within less then 10mins of being seated. 

I also didn't mention that when we were seated our waitress walked by our table twice before even saying anything to us. (10mins after being seated) finally a greeting by Ashely. 

It took 15mins to get our waters and 20mins to get our cocktails! And to believe we've only been here for the past 30mins.

The service isn't just slow but they are in need of more workers. 

They have a groupon offer that comes with 2 cocktails and no bartender making any drinks. I'm starting to wonder if my waitress even bartenders or she's just making our drinks of what she knows is in them. 

Overall this visit to this place has not gotten better. This isn't a way we wanted to spend out last lunch in Las Vegas, let alone have anyone spend their time eating at a place like this.

Just when I thought it couldn't get any worst. Ahsley comes to my table and ask if she can clear anything off. I purposely put my fork, knife and tongs on the plate to be cleared off the table....instead of her taking it with her she threw it down in front of me while my fork had ranch on it and my knife has meat and oil all over it to only splash my arm, Thank you Ashley, I wanted a oil bath at lunch.",0,3,0

we had to wait a good 15-20 minutes before the first skewer came to our table, which was pork loin. i'm more of a beef guy and would normally pass, but i was hungry. it was very juicy depite getting one of the outer slices, but the crust made it even more enjoyable. this got my hopes up which were later shot down.
the other meats that came out were, roasted ham, sirloin, spicy chicken, pheasant, and bacon wrapped turkey. the ham tasted like it came from a store. the only thing i liked about the poultry is that they are not sliced so you know you get a fresh piece, as opposed to our ham and pineapple. (it seemed like we were always the last table to be served so we got all the pieces towards the center). the sirloin really let me down. i wasn't lucky enough to get the 1st slice, but by the 3rd slice the meat was a little too rare to my liking. the following rounds of sirloin all came to our table well done. the bacon wrapped turkey was good, but i would have loved to have some bacon wrapped filet. 
we've definitely had better, but we chose this place because we were hungry, but didn't want to go to one of the usual vegas buffets. if you choose to do the same, you can save a bunch by purchasing your meals via tix 4 tonight. they have a 50% off special for lunch at pampas.",2,0,0

It was my wife's 30th birthday last Saturday and a group of my family and friends came along to celebrate at what we thought was going to be a wonderful experience.... NOT!

We purchased an Amazon special for a buy 1 for the price of 2. Not anywhere on the voucher did it say, Meat not included. The buffet is only veggies and a salad bar, and that is $45 regular price. Basically, what we got was the salad bar for half off, and free alcohol (only well drinks) for the first hour, not including the tax and gratuity.

Little did we know that the meat was not included. That ended up being an extra $20 per person, plus tax and gratuity. Don't get me wrong, the meat was amazing and the service was great! The issuse we had, especially me, was when I asked for the Manager of the restaurant and the Chef came out after we receive a bill for $360!

When I was approached by the (so called manager) he walked right up to me and said, ""What's the issue here""? Not as any professional would approach a table and introduce him\/herself and say their name and rank, also asking us the right questions and showing customer service the way I thought it would be.

He said, ""What is the issue""? As I began to tell him what the issue was and how my hole table is confussed as we had no idea and it was never indicated on the voucher, that the meat wasn't included and tax and gratuity isn't included, the hole time he had the facial expressions of, no matter what you say I will not help you, give you half off, listen to what you're saying, in fact I am going to argue with you and make this all your fault because you the customer of my restaurant that's never been here before is wrong and I am right! Let's not forget the fact that it's my wife's 30th birthday and she is pregnant, as we're having a great time and here he comes and reined the damn birthday party!

Complete douche bag, inconsiderate, false leading and no compassion or understanding of the customer or to even listen and try to work with me and understand that it's not the money, it's the fact that my friends and family didn't expect another larger bill, especially after the servers where coming around serving meat and drinks we all were tipping well over $100 plus not knowing another bill of $360 was coming.

Never!!!!! will I return to this place. I am embarrassed that I was treated with such disrespect and my wife feels bad after receiving the bill and we had to pay $40 each extra as a group per couple. I would rather have gone to Chuck e Cheese and all of us adults acted like kids again instead of being treated like a piece of trash.

Don't worry, I am not the only one who feels horrible about the service I received. There's more reviews to come from other couples of the party. : )

The other Brazilian restaurants (Texas de Brazil and Sampa), which both had higher ratings on Yelp than Pampas, had 1 1\/2 hour wait times. Pampas did not have any wait time and despite its 3 1\/2 star review, we thought, how could you go wrong with Brazilian? Well, let me count the ways...

1. They stuck us in the far back corner of the room, which I was ok with at first since  we had a 15 month old with us, but when the meat guys (not sure what they're called) systematically avoided our table, that was strike 1 for us...
2. Ok, so the meat guys finally made it to our table, but guess which one kept coming to our table again and again. The LAMB guy. I mean, really. If we wanted lamb we would have gone to a Mediterranean restaurant or something. I mean, bring on the skirt steak and top sirloin. Enough with the lamb. 
3. Except they didn't have any skirt steak. They did have something they called filet mignon, but to be honest, I've never had filet mignon that tasted like beef jerky. 
4. But the REAL deal breaker for us...I mean the one that almost made us dine and dash, was their pan de quejio, if that's even what it was. They tasted more like dry biscuits from a fried chicken shop than those delightful little bursts of warm cheesiness we were anticipating. Pampas, we can forgive you for the filet mignon. We'll even forgive you for ignoring us. But when you mess with the pan de quejio, that's when you've crossed the line. F-!!",2,2,1

Anyway, coming here on weekend during lunch hour, we only saw a few tables occupied which we didn't think it was a good sign. But we went ahead and decided to give it a try before reaching any conclusion. After we were seated, I looked around and noticed nobody was really enjoying their food, and not a smile in sight (including the staff.) 

After we got salad and soup from the salad bar, we must have waited like 10 -15 min before two staff came out with skewers of meat. We were starving but the look of the meat didn't even look that good to us. The meat were cold, under seasoned, and very rare. And that was the way it was throughout the rest of lunch. At Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chaos, they always re-roasted the meat when they brought it back to the kitchen. At Pampas, they rarely (no punt intended) do that so all you got cold, under seasoned, under cooked meat. Funny thing we noticed that for a meat joint, most of the customers (including myself) kept requesting grilled shrimp because it was the only thing considered good to eat.

Now let's talk about service. Since this place is like dead, they kinda copied that feeling into their service. Even though the place wasn't crowded at all, it took the waitress a freaking long time to refill my soda. Everything we asked for something, it took her so long to get it even though she wasn't busy. How do I know she wasn't busy???? Well, because she would go back behind the bar counter, right in front my my view, to either count tips, put on make up, check and text somebody from her phone. Our waitress didn't come by often either, so you can imagined everything took a long time for them to bring it to us. Even though she wasn't rude and got what we asked for (eventually), the lack of care, service, and depressing environment just made everything worse.

For those that visit Vegas and think this Pampas is good, you gotta spend some taxi money (about $15)  and visit Fogo de Chaos or Texas de Brazil. The food quality that you get at either place will make the taxi fare worth it. Trust me :-)",4,0,2

Not sure if it was because we were still in our wedding clothes, but hey, it's nice to receive great customer service anywhere!  

I love the concept of Brazilian BBQ, and we were always being waited on by the roving servers with the skewers of delicious and tender meats, large shrimp and the palate cleansing grilled pineapple, which was very sweet and helped with digestion of all the food...  The cold and hot food buffet was really good because it was not overwhelming and had stuff that went well with everything we were served.

I thank them for their excellent service, as well as the delicious food!  They now have a repeat customer in my wife and I, and since she doesn't have Pampas in NY, I have one close to me in Palo Alto, CA, and may head there for a taste treat!

The customer service? It was TERRIBLE. We saw our waitress 3 times in an hour and half, waited for water and drinks with empty glasses on multiple occasions, and we're treated with disrespect when asking for the kind of service one would expect when paying  $50+ for a meal. 

As for the food, by far worse than anything I would have ever expected. EVERY single meat was tough and overcooked. Even the meats that appeared to be cooked medium rare to medium were as tough as leather. The ""steamed"" shrimp were ice cold, and the oysters were undercooked, salmon was okay, and the spicy sausage was really the only thing I can recommend. Cheesecake was pretty good as well. 

We also found a massive black hair (see picture) on one of our plates that did not belong to any of our party members. We then asked 3 different servers to see a manager, and 15 minutes later, the manager said ""oh, sorry"" and walked away and was never to be seen again. 

The bathrooms were repulsive and looked as though they hadn't been cleaned in multiple days.

I bought a special Groupon to use here and even with the discount I found it overpriced, the service horrendous and the food awful. This place is a RIP OFF. If you've been to ANY other Brazilian steakhouses, then you've had better food than this place. 

Let's start with the abysmal salad bar. Other places (Fogo de Chao, Texas de Brazil) have pretty high quality goods on their bar, but not Pampas. It was filled with the cheapest salad bar ingredients possible. No asparagus, no artichoke hearts, no high quality cheeses, just a bunch of junk. Even the salad bar at Golden Corral is better! The little cheese biscuits were tasty but that's it. Sure, their gimmick is that it's ""unlimited,"" but so what when there is nothing you actually WANT to eat!?!

The rodizio food was even worse. We had a special deal to add the ""Ultimate Surf and Turf"" seafood option. This was a COMPLETE JOKE. I expected fresh shrimp on skewers but nope, we were served a teeny salad sized plate with two small pieces of salmon, a small portion of mussels and 4 (yes, FOUR!!!) pitiful looking unshelled shrimp. That's it. The seafood was pretty bad and I have never felt so ripped off. They have the gall to charge $58.00 PER PERSON for this junk! 

The service was so awful. I realize the place was inexplicably packed on a Friday night, but there were plenty of waiters around so there's really no excuse. We had to wait for water refills and even for forks! The guys bringing around the skewers weren't knowledgeable about anything they were serving. We kept asking about the sausage and he would only say ""it's sausage,"" though the menu mentions there are several different kinds being served. He had no idea what kind of meat he had either! WTF? Poor staff training! 

One of my friends skipped on the all you can eat and ordered a steak a la carte from the menu. It was obvious our waiter forgot to put in his order because we had to ask FOUR TIMES where his missing meal was. Finally it arrived with zero apologies. Some weird looking guy who looked like he was an Elvis impersonator at his second job appeared to be the manager but he was just standing around and never even came over to our table. 

You have been warned. This place sucks.",16,5,4

The salad bar had quite good selections, but it makes you wonder if most of the stuff they put there was intentional (to make you full quicker).  There's seafood options (although not very good).  Their mahi mahi and most of their meat lack flavor. Actually there was a couple of meat that was TOO salty, but it beats the hell out of bland.

Decor was okay but you are seated really close to other people and there wasn't a lot of room if you are making trips to the salad bar.

We had questions about the menu.  They do a table side sliced meat deal... they call it a ""parade of meats"".  They run between $48.95 to $54.95 including their ""50 item hot and cold salad bar"".  The rest of the menu was priced high too.  

Funny thing about the service... when the came to offer my husband his first ""slice of meat""... he didn't even have a plate... when we asked about getting a plate... they told him he had to go get one at the salad bar.  REALLY... you want to charge someone $48.95 for a meal and you have to go get your own plate.  WHAT???  (okay, so we had a $10 off coupon but still... if I am paying $$$$ for a meal..

I had the boulliabase (small over cooked split lobster tails, about 6 shrimp and a lot of mussels over pasta in a broth) which also came with the all you can eat salad bar ($39.95).  Over all... was only mediocre and I ddin't even take my unfinished pasta back to our place.

Mhusband had the ""meat parade""  which included pork tenderloin, tri tip which he like, filet (parmesean crusted), a dried out chicken thigh, ham, sirloin, and some bacon wrapped turkey I think.  My kids had the sirloin and the tenderloin (around $35 each as well).

As we waited for the meat to come around there was only one particular guy that was actually really helpful and made sure the meat we requested got to us, the others not so much and missing the entire time. 
When we got one certain meat that we were looking forward to which was lamb, it was pretty good on the first round then when we asked for it again, it was way way under cooked (too dangerous for me to ingest considering I'm pregnant)..
 The other meat that my fiance had requested ended up being too rubbery to eat and from there, we decided we were done and wanted out. 

I understand it was busy and packed but this restaurant should have been more prepared for a day like that. Won't be coming here again, I rather go to Texas de Brazil and rather spend my money there. At least it would have been worth it.


But all in all, I'm just glad I got to spend a night alone with my fiance. It's a lesson learned for us.",1,0,0

Hubby and I were just checking out the menu and the hostess out front asked if we had any deals or coupons. We said no so she offered us $33 per person all you can eat meats and shrimp with the purchase of a non-alcoholic or adult beverage (we weren't trippin because we were planning on having some drinks anyway!). 

We were sat quickly and headed to the buffet first. We made sure to only get a taste of our favorite sides since we knew we didn't want to ruin our steak and shrimp experience. 

They started bringing out the meat and everything was bomb. I must say, the best thing for me was the chicken! I mean, I wasn't expecting the chicken to be my favorite, but it was so savory and crispy on the outside and so sweet and juicy on the inside.

Romantic space and great food.",2,1,0

So our meal was basically buy one get one free as the price of 1 person is about $68 I believe, but we each paid half. So after looking at the Yelp reviews and pictures we were excited.

Due to putting the incorrect address in my GPS we ended up being 30 minutes late. Once I discovered my mistake which was after 17 minutes off setting off my friend called the restaurant to notify them. When the staff member picked up we were quickly put on hold and left on hold....for 30 minutes, the entire time it took to drive over from the incorrect location we were at.

I even called them from my phone when we were about 10 minutes away and also was put on hold.

When we arrived at the restaurant, we told them we had tried to call them to give them a heads up that we would be 30mins late for our reservation but we had been placed on a hold and still were. The waitress was shocked and marched us to the desk to show the hostess. With us standing there they didn't even bat an eyelid and somehow got it mixed up that we were part of a table already seated. After telling this waitress again what happened, she apologized which the other hostess didn't and gave us both a complimentary drink.

After being seated, we got some food from the buffet and waited for the meat with our green circle clearly visible. After 4 rounds, it seemed our table was invisible as we kept getting passed over...this happened for 20 minutes. To get their attention my friend lifted the green circle up in her hand and after 3 minutes suddenly we had 3 servers at our table.

One of the servers tried to make a joke about it & I basically said she had to go this far to get some meat service at this table & I don't see how that is funny! After that we got served as we should have but the experience was already down the toilet by then. 

I am glad I didn't pay full price as our experience was not worth the price in my opinion. If it wasn't for the waitress who apologized & gave us complimentary drinks for the awful service I wouldn't have tipped at all.

The food wasn't all that great, Fago de Chao is better in my opinion. The meat wasn't seasoned enough for my friend and I and the salad bar was  smaller than I had expected with less variation for the price. I will not be coming here again. Such a shame as I love Brazilian food.",4,2,1

That's pretty much the only reason I'd want to hit up a Brazilian steakhouse. It did include sirloin with mashed potatoes and the salad bar, so we plowed onward, but it was the most underwhelming experience our entire time in Vegas. We left glad that we didn't pay $43 + tax & tip for bad food and slow service.

Our food took an hour to come out. Half hour into the order, we were notified that the computer went down, and our order hadn't been sent back to the kitchen. Ten minutes later, the kitchen was ""working on plating it"", and yet it took another 20 minutes. What the hell were they doing back there? The meat is presumably already cooked since the servers are walking around the restaurant with it, and the plating was nothing special - just sliced meat on a plate - so why did it take 30 more minutes on top of the computer failure? Barely made our show.

The salad bar was odd. There were Caesar salar makings, but no Caesar dressing. There was sweet and sour chicken (at a Brazilian place?) and some pastas, but few enticing veggies. I piled on the potatoes and carbed it up. We grabbed some cheese bread (pao de quiejo), usually heavenly, but it was very over cooked, downright crunchy, and hard. The sirloin was good, but not wait-an-hour good...

Two gentlemen next to us at the bar had the rodizio, but it was served onto tiny plates, and they kept having to flag down servers as they went by.

Very tough, dry meat :( Every single piece of meat -- chicken wrapped in bacon, pork loin, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, tritip, pork sausage, etc -- is just plain dry. Even the chicken in the tortilla soup is somehow dry! I can't concentrate on anything else. 

The salad bar is pretty lacking, too. The hot choices are lukewarm in temperature and taste. The pasta of the day was penne with slices of squash, but I have no idea what the sauce was or if there was one. I do like the cheese bread, but they'd be so much better served hot instead of wasting away in a buffet tray.

Pampas does seem pretty tech-savvy, which is nice. I like how you can make reservations directly through Yelp. You can get a free dessert if you write a review with a picture, and Pokemon Go players can get a free bottle of wine if they check in through Yelp and put a lure module on the nearest Pokestop. I can't reach the Pokestop from where they seated us, though, so we had to skip that. 

Also, all of the Gauchos keep reaching over the table to give each of us pieces of meat, sticking their swords and knives in our faces in the process. Your arms aren't that long, dude. Walk around the table.

PS we just got our bill, and it turns out the Water Conservation charge for glasses of water wasn't a hilarious joke. It is Very Real.",6,2,1

Our cousins invited us to stay with them at their fantastic timeshare and we wanted to show our appreciation by taking them to a nice dinner. Earlier that day, I passed by Pampas and a hostess in front of the restaurant offered me a coupon. It was a buy one get one free offer. I inquired about the price difference between lunch and dinner, and asked that she explain what we should expect to get based on when what time we decide to eat. She told me that the main difference is that there would be 7 meat selections for lunch and 12 meat selections for dinner.
We were all excited and looking forward to our dinner. It was a Sunday night, and we were sat right away. This was the only good thing about this night, no wait for a table, but here's the rest of our infuriating debacle. Our server, Karen, approached us a few minutes after we were sat and brought over a couple of large bottles of water. The caps were already removed from the bottle so we assumed that they were trying to be creative in how they served water. We later found out that they CHARGED US FOR WATER! We did not request water to begin with. She should have informed us that there was a charge before placing it on our table. Also, as you'll see on the attached picture that the bottle states that sparkling water is served in the bottle, but it was NOT sparkling at all. I asked Karen why they charged for water that we did not ask for and she said ""Nevada has the worst tap water in all of United States, and I would never drink it."" Obviously, her reply did not answer my question as to why they charge for something prior to informing us of the charge. BTW, it a minimal charge, but it's the principle. 
Karen informed us that our coupon required that we buy a drink, so she goes on to suggest that we buy a pitcher of some type of alcoholic drink. I asked her if the coupon required that the drink be an alcoholic drink, and her response was ""Well this is Vegas!"" WTH!!! This girl was so irritating. I informed her that my husband did not drink alcohol, and she gave us a look of disgust. What she doesn't know is that it was only my husband who preferred non-alcoholic drinks, and the remaining 3 people would have ordered a bunch of alcoholic drinks, but the look that she gave automatically triggered us to order only the cheapest non-alcoholic drinks (with refills).
Time to eat! The salad bar was horrible. It looked as if workers do not check the area to keep it clean. Totally looked unsanitary. Karen claimed there were 40 different types of food at the salad bar, and that was a totally false statement. 
The meat options were horrible!!! I was already irritated by Karen's lies and up sales, so it triggered me to keep track of the number of meat options and again ... caught them in a lie! At the most, they only had 6-7 meat options that night for dinner. We asked Karen twice and another worker once if they can bring out lamb and they kept saying it was on its way. It NEVER came out to our table and we noted that it was not ever offered to anyone else. MORE LIES AND DECIT. They were charging us dinner prices for the same lunch options. They could have simply admitted that they did not have the lamb that we requested. 
STAY AWAY from this place but if you're brave enough to try it, make sure that your server is not Karen, so that you'll hopefully have a more pleasurable dining experience. Karen's level of unprofessionalism left such a poor impression.",7,1,0

You can ask for medium or mid rare but you will only end up with well done or very well done. For an extra fee you can add the ""unlimited seafood"" which consists of poorly prepared and obviously frozen shrimp, mussels and fish. I would honestly choose Golden Corral over this place and save $50 a plate in doing so. Don't make the same mistake my wife and I made.",0,0,0

Meat was good. It was tender and soft. My seafood platter with the shrimp was good. However the small pieces of mahi mahi was dry. The sliver of salmon was perfect. It was moist. The muscles were small and edible. I didn't care for them. The shrimp was delicious and cooked to perfection. 
I had an iced tea. My hubby had a Coke. I also got my daughter an apple juice. The waitress forgot her apple juice, so I had to ask her a second time. She apologized. She was pretty good about refilling our drinks. The guys kept coming back offering us a variety of meats such as steak, chicken, pork & bacon wrapped chicken which I thought was delicious since I love bacon! 
Service was a little lacking a first but the guys with the meats kept coming. I was stuffed with the salad bar. Had some Asian noodles (cold), cheese, melon, tomatoes & a mozzarella cheese ball. The salad bar is what filled me up. The best part was the free complementary cheesecake for my birthday! Awesome, Thanks to our nice waitress!

(See the other Yelp reviews to explain the discount.) Having arrived more than thirty minutes late due to a logistics problem* our party was concerned that we would not have enough time to eat or worse, lose our reservation completely. Upon arrival we were assured by the friendly hostesses that we could be fed and on our way in under an hour. Casting furtive glances at one another, our party of five decided to take a chance and be seated.

I'm glad we did so.

Our waitress, Michelle, did an extraordinary job of corralling a tireless squadron of saber-rattling picanha peddlers (passadores) who were all too willing to slice you off another portion of their allotted meat assignment (rodizio). Every few minutes, a wave of sizzling meat arrived tableside just begging that we claw at it with our individually administered ""meat tongs"". Those looking to capitalize on the premium offerings are advised to skip the chicken and turkey wrapped bacon and double up on the pinchana, pineapple ham and Brazilian sausage.

Also worth mentioning was the side bar that came with the Rodizio specials. Highlights include the spicy black beans and sausage, the caprese (wish it had fresh basil instead of dried) and the fried bananas.

I don't recommend going for the Surf and Turf Rodizio, however. An apparent afterthought, the strangely presented fish (platter\/tile\/metal sheet?) was ice cold, tasteless and uninviting. A shame really as I was totally looking forward to the bacon wrapped scallops. After making a mention of this to our server she was deeply apologetic and took it off our bill.

Overall the meal was of three star quality, but garners a fourth star overall because of the impeccable service we received. Thanks to hostess' ability to seat us within five minute (despite completely missing our reservation) and Michelle's vigilant watch over our table, we were not only able to enjoy a large meal in under an hour, but also had enough time to have dessert. I myself enjoyed rich cappuccino while a friend enjoyed the flan.

* Top Tip: If you're arriving here by taxi, do not tell your driver to simply drop you off at Planet Hollywood. Doing so will result in you having to traverse a near half mile length of casino floor rooms AND almost the entire stretch of Miracle Mile Shops. Instead I recommend trying to find a way to be let off closer to the end of the mall. Your lady friends in heels will most assuredly be thankful.",2,0,0

The food is horrible as well. I will start by saying that all of you should spend the extra 10-15 a plate and go to Texas de Brazil. That place is amazing. 

Today we went into pampas simply because we had a 100 dollar voucher towards lunch. We got the voucher at a discount show ticket place on the strip. And now I completely understand why they give vouchers here. Because they suck and they can't get business otherwise. 

The meats were cold. And tasted horribly. If you have ever been to a Brazilian steakhouse you'll know how they come around to the tables and ask what you want. Flip the card green to get more. The gauchos here acted like they were miserable. Oh and he asked my boyfriend if he wanted top serloin and literally cut it over me in my face. Refused to walk around to his side of the table. And anytime we would say we wanted more he acted like he was appalled.

They didn't serve you the rolls as appetizers. They put them in one of those metal catering heat warmers and had you get them across the restaurant. all of which were rock hard. The only thing good at the salad bar were the mushrooms. 

The meat was so rare it was bleeding or it was super well done. no one ever asked us how we wanted the piece to be cooked (typically one part of what they cut off is less rare and some is more so usually the people who serve ask what you want.  Nope. You just got what you got. 

The server was only attentive to our drinks. I had to ask her twice to take out plates as we had no room for anything. And to top it off their systems were down so they couldn't get our check right or run credit cards. Took 40 min for them to get it straightened out. And that was after we asked for  the check which we had to sit for 15 min before we got her attention. And then they still tried to charge the card the full amount so luckily we scrambled up enough cash and just left that. Not a single offer or apology from management about this. The least they could have done is tried to rectify the situation the best they could. But they didn't.

You walk into a dark alley, and a well dressed, clean shaven, nice looking man, his face partly obscured by the poor lighting approaches.  You take a deep breath, and start taking larger and quicker steps.  He leans over, and whispers in your ear: ""how about a great Brazilian dinner at half price, my friend?"".


You make your best uninterested gesture, but your face screams: ""tell me more"".  So he does.


$34.99 includes all you can eat grilled Brazilian meats, perhaps twenty kinds of them.  That's 50% off!  You're hungry, it's hot, you almost surrender.  But the nice man goes on: ""free access to the buffet, which has forty kinds of side dishes, fruits and vegetables, and even more meat"".


""One minute"" you say, and turn to consult with the family.  Where's the family?  They're gone.  Instead I see three full size lions, their teeth sharp, their tongues hanging out, drooling all over the place.  ""Yes"", I say to the nice man.  ""Yes!!!"".


We go in, and we sit down, and our waitress, sorry, our server, comes by for introductions and instructions.


""In order to use your half price deal, you must order an alcoholic drink from the drink menu"", she opens.  ""Wait"", I say, ""the nice man never mentioned that"".  The server says calmly: ""nonetheless, this is the deal"".  We pretend to consider, but everyone knows there is no way back now.  We surrender.  We order a beer, a Lemon Drop, and whatever for the kids who aren't allowed alcohol anyway.


Then we visit the buffet, and bring the loot to the table.  Then a marching band of meat carrying young men walk by us, at the rate of one per minute with the most delicious meats we had in a very long time.  Garlic Sirloin, coated chicken, lamb, Filet Mignon, Sausage, and many more mouthwatering meats are dropped into our plates and devoured in no time.


Wow, it's really amazing.  The excellent meats and the alcohol, make us forget the nice man in the dark alley.  We almost forgive him.  Until we see the check.


The check puts you in a very compromising position.  It actually registers the amount without the discount (we would never set foot in this restaurant without the discount), and with the discount, but with the drinks that we were forced to order, and then makes a very silly proposition: you can choose a tip amount of 30% on the amount before discount, or 30% of the amount after discount.


At this point, despite the excellent meal and the alcohol, we realize: we've been cleverly lured into a very flavorful trap, and the only way out is to pay the ransom and move on.


So here's my review.  If you want a great meal, at a good restaurant, on the strip in the heart of Las Vegas, and you are prepared to pay about $60.00 per person, go for it.  Dinner was quite good indeed.  But if you think that a promise of a man in the alley will get you a great dinner at half price, you got another thing coming my friend.


In other words, when visiting Pampas of Las Vegas, expect what you'd expect in the original Pampas: lowlands, filled with shifting sands, hungry predators, traps, and really good meat!",5,6,1

An $86 meal became $43.  After reading some of the reviews on Yelp, I was not looking forward to this dinner.  Prior to purchasing the voucher, I had read some pretty favorable reviews. That was 2 months ago.  I checked Yelp this afternoon before we went to dinner, and I found some reviews that trashed the place. 

Even though I am giving this place 3 stars,  I started out wanting to give 5 stars.  The food, in a word, was SPECTACULAR.  I don't know what restaurant some of these people were eating at, but both my wife and I found this place great. The salad bar was fantastic.  Lots of vegetables such as Chinese broccoli and pickled veggies.   Caesar salad was surprisingly good.  

If you are a meat eater, you can eat yourself silly.  I especially liked the spicy chicken and a top sirloin that was a special of the night.  

Before I get to my downgrades, some advice.   Don't bother purchasing a 2 for 1 voucher ahead of time from Travelzoo or any other site. We could not walk more than 50 yards without someone offering a 2 for 1 coupon on the strip.  Heck, there was some dude wearing some Brazilian bird outfit not more  than 50 yards from the restaurant inside the Miracle Mile mall adjacent to the Planet Hollywood hotel that was offering a 2 for 1 discount coupon.  

Again, this would have been a 5 star review if not for a couple of things that our waiter did that were, let's say, disappointing.  When we sat down, he asked us if we wanted any drinks.  We said ""no;"" however, we wanted water.  He asked if we wanted flat or sparkling and we said flat.  Not too long after came a couple of bottles of Pelligrino.  About a half hour into the meal, my wife asked me "" are we being charged for this water?""   I brought the waiter over and I asked him this question, and he said ""yes.""  I said ""not a chance.""  He got defensive and I said that nothing was mentioned about charging for the water, and our waiter, to his credit, told us that he would take the water off the bill. By the way, the cost of these two LARGE bottles of Pelligrino was $30.  One could conclude that this is how this place makes its money. 

The second thing that the waiter did was bring our final bill and it totaled almost $20.  Mind you, we had not purchased any extra sides and no drinks.  Our expectation was that we would receive a bill for the sales tax which should have been between $6.80 and $8.60.  I explained this to the waiter. He left to take care of it, and came back w\/o any changes.  Instead, a 5 min explanation as to why the bill was correct. I was very calm and explained that he was incorrect and why.  He then realized that he got our voucher mixed up with another promotion involving the purchase of show tix.  He brought the check back  and everything was corrected. 

One more thing. Another reviewer trashed the place because he was part of a large party and was annoyed that the restaurant added a tip for everyone based upon the full cost of the meal BEFORE the Groupon discount.  He felt that the tip should be based upon the discounted Groupon price. This is incorrect as the waiter is being penalized.   ALWAYS tip based upon the full value of the meal before discounts.",12,0,0

Our server was fantastic. He was very friendly and explained all aspects of the restaurant from salad bar to Drinks to Dessert and to the meats and how they would be brought to the table.

I have to say the salad bar was just OK, nothing special. But who comes to an all you can eat meat place for the salad.  The meats were good, especially if you got the edge cuts (they had the seasonings on then). Though there was salt and pepper on the table if needed.  

I had the Pina Colada, not blended though.  It was very enjoyable. 

Desserts were brought to the table and offered.  After all the meats, who had anymore room. There were only 4 to chose from so if you wanted one didn't have to think very hard.

Would I go back?  Only if I was with someone who had never been, otherwise I'll look for a real 'Steakhouse'.",3,0,0

Service was attentive, although the hostess was not very friendly and I noticed other diners having issues with certain servers. Once the meats started coming, they continued at a good pace, with a emphasis on the chicken (often times paired with other meats such as bacon or sausage).

Will start with the scam, have been to Pampas a couple of years ago, it was great.  So recently a groupon came up for sale and I figured I'd buy it.  $100 for $50 in food, how could I go wrong?  Well I found out.  Pampas artificially inflates their retail prices and then offers discounts through various venues (Ticket for tonight, groupon, people handing out flyers in the mall) to make people think they are getting a good deal.  So in the end you just end up paying about what you'd pay at any other restaurant....as long as you use your coupon (I feel for the poor people that don't utilize some sort of coupon at Pampas). 

For example:
Seafood buffet - $48
Meat buffet - $44

In Vegas you can find far better values for much less than that, or even splurge and eat somewhere higher end for about the same price.

So I guess with Groupon I expect to get some sort of bargain or deal, and I felt like i didn't here.  So I feel like I've been taken advantage of.  Thus I must rate this place as two stars.

The food is really quite good.  The meat tastes delicious and the salad bar is quite good.  The service is OK, the waiter was actually the same guy for both visits.  He has a very thick accent and is somewhat difficult to understand, but he's very good at his job.  They didn't seem to have much of a clue when it came to helping us with our baby, so if you have a little one you may want to steer clear.",1,0,0

The service was great, the waitress that we had was very attentive and made sure that we had what we needed to be comfortable. 

There were a couple of things I didn't like about Pampas; first, someone from the restaurant offered to take a ""complimentary"" picture of us. We agreed and ten minutes later she came back out and gave us a small picture with a 10% off our next meal discount. That wasn't the bad part - she also brought out two larger pictures, one with a Vegas themed border and one without for a price...what is this!? I just wanted to eat at your restaurant, I didn't want to be sucked into a sales ploy...


Second, I ordered the salmon sandwich with ceasar salad and it was TERRIBLE. There was NO flavor, the bun was dripping with grease and the cheese was so thick I almost chocked on it. The ceasar salad did not taste like a ceasar salad at all! In fact the only thing I could taste was lettuce and the fake parmesan cheese that it was doused in. Not only that but an hour later I was feeling sick wondering if I was going to vomit or not. My husband had the steak sandwich and the steak was tough, there was NO flavor and again the cheese was incredibly thick. 

Would I go back? No. There's too many options that are 100 times better than this for half the price in a five mile radius alone.",5,3,1

Before even sitting down we sent our glasses back because the glasses were very dirty in which Waseem (our waiter) replied ""is this not clean enough for you""? I laughed it off and kindly requested new glasses again. Secondly I wanted meat well done and well let's just say it was done very well smh. Fast forwarding past the first 30 minutes the same 4 meats kept coming around before we asked for the other selection of meats and the seafood to be brought to our table. Soon thereafter a plate of seafood came out and you can just look at the pictures yourself. Also we were charged $1 per person for water which is fine but it was just a refill of a bottle which was weird because again I've never experienced that.

Cheese options on the salad bar were cubes of cheddar or pepper jack. The rest of the salad bar was equally disappointing. 

The Feijouda was black beans in extra water. Zero seasoning or meat was evident. They also did not have any faroafa to accompany the Feijouda.

The caprinias were meh and the meat was surprisingly bad. Poor cuts of meat with little care given to their preparation. The selection was also meager as I only saw tri tip, sirloin, lamb and chicken wings. 

Service was relatively poor, I was able to run out of meat several times. The frequency or the servers circulating was spotty at best, and they tended to skip tables.

 I recommend looking for the showgirl handing out the coupons not too far from the restaurant entrance in Planet Hollywood.  The coupon saves you almost 50% per adult and it is good for your whole party.

The ""main event"" for the breakfast is the meat which was sirloin, ham, two types of sausage and grilled pineapple.

The place was pretty empty when we got there around 10 and the service was good. The meat guys came around frequently and the waitress asked if there was anything meat we'd like them to bring out again right before we left.

I've heard that the Rodizzio (sp?) is the most recommended.  It's about $46 for all you can eat meats + a fesh bar\/buffet with lots of greens, veggies and a few sides such as potatoes and rice.

I decided to order the chicken dinner entree. I paid $38 for this plate. It came with a LOT of chicken which was SO DRY. I couldn't eat it all.  It also came with squash and zucchini which I ate and was tasty and a side of mashed potatoes which was also fine.  

My boyfriend got the Rodezzio(sp) which was all you can eat meat.  The servers came around a lot with the meats but I think it was because they were trying to get rid of it all before closing.

We also got our picture taken by a lady who snaps your photo.  You get your picture on a free post card and she also comes out with your photos in a paper frame in case you want to purchase them for $15. 

Anyway, for 2 people, 2 soft drinks, a dry chicken plate and all you can eat meat, + tip came out to give or take $90.
The meats were very very flavorful and so juicy! I loved it!

There was only one type of beef coming around. I am used to several types at my local churrascaria. Peppered, Garlic, this cut, that cut...
Sausages were just ok.
Turkey wrapped in Bacon was probably the best thing they offered me.

The sides\/salad bar was pretty small and not a great variety. Which really doesn't matter so much to me because I just get some rice and the powder stuff for dipping the meat in.

Servers were either all robots, or all hungover... no life to them.
And they sure took their sweet time coming out from the back... Don't they know to not keep food from me like that? Maybe that is why the knives were duller than a party at Joe Biden's.
They didn't want me shankin them for the whole skewer of meat.

I didn't even know of this location until I entered the Miracle Mile shops inside Planet Hollywood.  I was primed and ready to go on the meat-fest extravaganza.  $39 for the meat only and $50 for the meat and seafood, both of which included cold salad bar visits.  Feeling adventurous, I super-sized to include the seafood, just out of curiosity.

The salad bar was OK, they had some cold and hot vegetable dishes as well as smoked salmon and salad stuff.  Once the food started arriving, I made sure only to try one piece of each meat and no more.  Unfortunately, when eating that much meat, I realized that it was hard to appreciate and taste them individually flavor wise.  In the interest of saving your stomach, I recommend you avoid the brazilian sausage which came out dry, the lamb which tasted a little too game-ish, and the turkey wrapped in bacon, wasn't too impressive.  The seafood consisted of scallops wrapped in bacon, grilled salmon, tempura battered cod, and shrimps with a butter sauce.  The salamon was dry and the cod's flavor was masked by the deep frying.  I'd only recommend the shrimp out of all the four and better to order them as a skewer than doing the rodizio.

Make sure not to order the coconaut mojito on their cocktail menu.  Coconaut and mint don't go together despite what our server enthusiastic words.  I had the red wine sangria which was okay...it wasn't as fruity as I have had before in Spanish tapas restaurants.

Average cost per diner for dinner is $70.  I'm glad I got to try this once and this place is worth at least a try but I can't imagine coming here regularly.  But if you want to avoid not feeling nine months pregnant afterwards, I highly suggest restraint and small bites throughout the meal.",2,0,1

I did not like that this restaurant was overpriced. I am the last person to complain about pricing as money is not an issue, but this place was too expensive for its own good.

[they don't have them, so don't tell me about the ""7 tradition chrruascaria meats""] What should one expect from a restaurant named for a region more associated with a different country than what it purports to be.). It was adequate, but would not have been worth the price if we'd paid full price. Like many of our fellow diners, we had a voucher for one entree and (one trip to?) the salad bar, so we took the $8 up-sell to the full meats. That wasn't bad. (What is a normal tip on a meal with an artificially high price, and half self-service?)

 The salad bar wasn't overwhelming, but had a few particularly good items (grilled mushrooms, hearts of palm, tortellini.)

 There is an open-bar option: unlimited beer, wine, sangria or caiparinha for $20. That's probably a good deal if you were going to order drinks anyway and drink heavily. At their prices a 3rd drink would probably cost more.

 Loss of a star (and should have been a loss of tip) when our waiter asked we wanted to drink we said 'Just water.' He asked 'Still or sparkling?"" I found out that is a trick question, as he brought a liter bottle of water.

 When the bill came (after a long wait trying to get the waiter's attention) there was about an $8 charge for the water. The waiter was at that point holding a pitcher of water. I asked about the charge and he said ""I asked you still or sparkling and you said 'still'""  I pointed to the pitcher of ice water he was holding and said ""What do you call that?"" and he said ""Tap water.""  I said ""When we said '_just_ water' that's what we wanted, it's not sparkling."" He said he would find the manager and have it taken off.

 I'm sure the time share that gave us the voucher compensates the restaurant. We accepted the up-sell for more meat. (The limited menu, and a big plate from the salad bar, would have been sufficient.) There is no need to nickel-and-dime the tourists. (Some of us argue the charge, the rest probably pay the $8 for what is indistinguishable from tap water. [I grew up on NY Catskills water, and there is nothing funky about the Las Vegas tap water.]) I cannot recommend a restaurant that tried to rip me off.",3,1,0

The meat dishes were mediocre.  It may have been our first time at a Brazilian steakhouse but definitely not our first time eating meat. Everything we sampled was dry, the beef tough.  The bacon wrapped items tasted like nothing but bacon, the chicken drum was waaaay too salty, the other meats didn't have any flavor. 

For what this place charges, we expected better service.  We believe that tip is given based on the service received and not a required amount based on the total bill. So in this case, we tipped accordingly.  It's unfortunate since we tip well for ""normal"" service.  DEFINITELY not returning here.",0,0,0

The food was good, the service was fast and they accommodates our large group well (15).  My only gripe was there was no dessert included. I've been to a few other Brazilian BBQ places and their selection was a larger. But it doesn't discount this place any either. I wasn't able to use the groupon as our group was quite large but they honored the yelp coupon and saved everyone quite a bit.  A few of us took advantage if their all you can drink special and it was nice to see them hand make your drink.

A special shout out to my man, Marcelo, the real MVP for continuing to bring me food even when I forgot to flip my card and taking my requests. (They'll bring you whatever you ask for and will cook it to order). Also major props to Robert! He took special care of us, drinks were never empty and he thoroughly explained everything!

The girls and I were looking for a quick take out dinner when we stumbled upon Pampas. Although we were offered $5 off for a Saturday night, we had to pass on a buffet out of fear we would not be able to squeeze into our dresses that night. On our last day, however, we returned here for our traditional buffet final vacation meal. At $15, this was significantly cheaper (albeit slightly smaller) than any of the hotel buffets. This was my first Brazilian experience so I have no comparison to others but the meat was delicious though a bit on the salty side. Other delicious items included the cheese biscuits, potato salad, and beef soup. We topped off the meal with a few slices of watermelon to cleanse the palate and went on our merry way.

I was expecting it to be crowded since it's on the Strip\/ we didn't make reservations and its a Saturday, but it wasn't too busy. We walked right in and were seated on the patio promptly (it's not outdoors but still a patio if that makes sense). Our server Felipe took care of the Groupon bit and got us started with drinks. I highly recommend the white sangria! I personally am not big on wine since I get wine headaches very easily and generally do not like the way it tastes. This white wine sangria however, was the best I've ever had! Light, sweet and chilled absolutely perfect! The salad bar had good options and was clean. Our server as well as the meat runners were VERY attentive! The meats were tender and tasty! I wasn't a fan of the chicken but the grilled pineapple was delightful! The seafood part of the lunch was delicious! Very nice sized shrimps! The muscles and salmon were tasty too, I think cod was served as well on the plate but I didn't try it. Now let me tell you about the dessert, cuz hot damn it was mind blowing. You get to choose from 4 dessert to split with your Groupon. They have a chocolate mousse, white chocolate cheesecake, and 2 other desserts to chose from ( I cant remember the other 2, I was really focused on the other 2). We chose the white cheesecake and I could easily eat it for the rest of my life! It was so soft and smooth without being overtly sweet like cheap white chocolate can be. All we ended up paying for was water, tax and gratuity.

I asked Valeria for ketchup and she told me I have to get that myself and that it's located in the back where the salad bar is at. Later as she was passing our table I waved her down. I told her I thought it was very unusual to go to a restaurant and ask for something so simple as ketchup and was told no and to get it yourself. I had told her my family and friends own restaurants before and there are requests made by customers and the employee are more than happy to accommodate or get whatever the customer is asking for. You can't be petty or have a bad attitude about it like Valeria. After telling her how I felt she was angry and said in a very rude tone ""You want me to go get the ketchup for you.""

I have had tried the brazilian steak house in NY until their service went bust.  So the girl told us about this place. Give yourself more time to get over here if you are seeing a show. Traffic was hell on a busy Saturday night 9\/21\/13. We walked from the Mirage to Planet Hollywood where this restaurant is. It took so much time. Our reservations were for 9:30 but they give you a window of 15 minutes either way. By the time we finally got there with all the people walking the strip to the construction it was 9:50pm. We were seated with no problem. I took one look at the menu. The voucher was for the meat rodizio they come and bring around. Instead of paying $43 dollars the voucher would give it to us for $24.95. The menu tells you what kind of meat. Being the only thing I had seen from what they bring is the steak it made no sense to pay that price for just bringing me steak and taking a little bit of rice and pasta from the buffet bar. So I declined eating that. I went and picked the Grilled Peito De frango $27. The waiter talks to me like I am a little kid and tells me that this isn't part of the voucher. I obviously can read my voucher and I tell him I know this, you don't have to tell me twice but I am not paying to eat a round of meat that the will come around and the only thing that catches my eyes are the steak.. Nope.. So I finally get my chicken. While my boyfriend gets his buffet bar fill and waits for the meat. My chicken is so tough to cut through. The mashed potatoes were cold. They obviously just sit out there. We tell them my potatoes are cold. They don't take my plate but give me another wallop of potatoes that are only a tiny bit warmer. Ugh my stomach hurts at this point. Where was the vegetables that the menu states with this. I saw something underneath my chicken. It was not edible. I tried to make the most of the meal so that I could go back to my hotel without being upset. The waiter was ok after that for the most part. He asked if I wanted to take it with me.

We actually bought our coupon through the v theater, only to find out they have a special menu for those coupons (that does NOT include the rodizio).

Salty vegetables, and a sad looking piece of meat (I can't call it a steak, it just wouldn't be right).

Other people did have the rodizio, which seemed ok. We don't eat pork, which meant that we had about 4 options, with no chicken options (because the only one they had was wrapped in bacon.

For the first 20 minutes no meat showed up either. We were just waiting around. We were not impressed with the meats, the best one was the top sirloin, the other were not very good.

We came around 4:30pm on a Tuesday and it wasn't crowded and we were seated immediately. The waiter was nice and attentive and helped us with our orders. The menu was very expensive but because of the gift card we decided not to worry about the cost. I got the skirt steak which was $29, my mom got the salmon which was $27 and my grandma got the dinner buffet which was $25. My steak was really good I had no complaints with the taste of the food. My mom however thought the salmon was plain and dry as well as the wine she got. Both me and my mom decided to substitute one of the sides of our entrees with the garlic mashed potatoes. When the food was brought out however, the cooks forgot that we substituted our sides for garlic mashed potatoes so we still got our original sides but the waiter was fast in bringing out little sides of the garlic mashed potatoes instead. My grandma wasn't too happy with the soup selection of the buffet but she liked it overall. They did charge for water which was pretty dumb especially since our waiter brought out a second water that we didn't ask for and didn't drink.

What most annoyed me was how people would come around with cameras asking to take a complimentary picture (which was not complimentary they give you a tiny wallet sized picture and try to upswell you a bigger one for $20) would pester us while we were eating twice! Right when we got our food this lady comes up and rudely interrupts our eating and almost demands that we take a picture because it was ""free"". It was just aggravating that while you're eating a nice dinner with your family you're being badgered by people. People were also walking by constantly through the tables trying to advertise their meat on the sticks which was also mildly annoying.

I get annoyed pretty easily and just want to eat in peace so I give this restaurant 3 stars since my food was good and the waiter was nice. Otherwise, it's overpriced for the quality of the food overall as well as the constant badgering from random people.",1,1,0

Well typically the meal is $50 for like 50 different meats served on skewers and cut for you at table side. But with our coupon we ended up paying only $32 and you could upgrade to seafood option for $7 and get like 5-6 seafood items. Salad\/soup and pasta bar included in teh price. We were full after trying like 5 meats. The grilled pineapple and filet mignon is to die for!

Some Brazilian music would be a nice addition as it was a little quiet. 

The food was very tasty and abundant. We had an 11 year old with us and he still qualified for the child's price which was nice because he's not a big eater and the all you can eat rodizios are expensive.

I'll start with the few positives:
-The cocktails were good. I got the sangria and my friend got a mojito. Both were nice and strong and tasted good. 
-the rolls were light and fluffy and delicious (we ate a lot of these to get our money's worth)
-the dessert, a chocolate mousse pie was yummy!
Now for the negatives:
-the service was slow. We had to ask for them to send over the meat carvers more than once.
-the surf part of our meal included a few dry mussels, several shrimp that were not deveined properly (seriously gross!), some fairly tasty salmon, and some mushy white fish.
-the meat was not tasty at all. The beef was fatty and hard to cut, and the pork and chicken were dry. The only good meat that I had was the sausage. 
-the side dish buffet was sparse and many dishes were empty. My friend never got any potatoes, as they were never replenished. Server failed to take away our dirty dishes and they began to stack up. 
-at the end of the meal, the server came over and made sure to tell us that the value of our meal was $94, and to make sure we tipped on that amount! We are good tippers normally and as local Las Vegans, we know how to tip. We didn't need the lesson.
-there was $1 charge each for warm tap water that they bring in an opened water bottle. We took bets that it was just normal Las Vegas tap water. 
-the womens' restroom was filthy and unusable. 

Overall, the experience wasn't worth the gas we used to get to Planet Hollywood. If we had actually paid $94 for this meal, I wouldn't thrown a fit. I am not normally a picky eater. I would suggest that if you want good Brazilian food, your best bet is to go to Texas de Brazil.",0,0,0

We signed up for the New Years Eve dinner that is almost twice as expensive as the regular meal, but was supposed to include all the lobster tail we could eat.(Not to mention a 20% service fee thrown onto all meals)  When the overcooked langoustines (called rock lobsters by the management, but looking and tasting like prawns) arrived, we asked for the lobster tails.  More langoustines, more requests for lobster, more langoustines.  More complaints and finally two lobster tails arrived -- 75 minutes after we sat down.  The inedible ahi tuna (overcooked), scallops wrapped in almost uncooked bacon and a dish of muscles where half were unopened was also included. The manager, Bill took the time to speak with us as he remembered us from previous year's, he truly felt that there was no deception involved with the the lobster tails not being true ""lobster"" as had been served the previous 2 New Year's Eves.

The meat was salty, and they only brought the filet around once in a while; while trying to load you up on sausages and chicken.  While both good, I wanted steak.  Of the steak pieces, the sirloin was probably the best cooked, very flavorful.  I would say the same about the filet, but I had it only once.

My first impression of Pampas was style over substance; in that regard I was very much mistaken. Yes, it is a fancy restaurant with a matching feel, however it is also warm, welcoming and infused with an overall pleasant feel. Our waiter Dave was a consummate professional. Our drinks were never empty and were strong and crisp. Despite the fact we had only an hour open bar we were met with no delays and were given precisely as much as we could drink in that time. His service was beyond reproach. What's more the servers and managers were also very on the ball, asking us consistently how we were enjoying our meal and if everything was to our satisfaction. The service here really was five star quality.

As for the food: superb! The salad bar was fully stocked with more pasta, vegetables and sides than you could ask for. You could very easily and happily indulge only in the sides and still have a very satisfying, delicious meal without fault. However, to do so would be to miss out on the main event of truly sensational, high quality meats brought and served at your table. My particularly favourite was the perfectly cooked Sirloin and yummy spicy chicken. But all the meats were divine and well worth the extra money, if only for the variety and unlimited quantity you receive. My only fear is that this place was somewhat wasted on me due to my small appetite. But if you're a big eaten then I can promise this place will not dissapoint.
 
Fair warning though: Pampas (as you might expect considering the unlimited nature and remarkable quantity) does come with a hefty price tag. It cost us $130 for the two of us (and that was including the discount). Expect to pay big.

Overall, a truly sumptuous night out that I'll definitely repeat next time I'm in Vegas. Well worth the money.

Typically, This is not an inexpensive meal your paying for the variety of meats and the presentation. There are always add-ons to up charge and increase your bill. Expect to pay $50 per person not including drinks. At this price point my expectations are higher than fast food so I hold them to a higher, refined standard to earn more stars, sadly they did not live up to the price.

I came in a lone without a reservation but was quickly seated, that was great since the dinning room was nearly full. I read the menu, people watched, started pyscho-analizing the sales technic of the wine lady, the photo girl and the way staff as they try to get people to take on the up-charge items. Why am I pointing this out because after all that I start fidgeting and realize I'd been sitting there 18 minutes without anyone approaching my table, now water or drink order, not wait staff visit, nothing. I had to wave down a waitress to get started, strike one.

The waitress makes not apologies and asked I fI know what I want surprised because as I mentioned the format is to offer you a bunch of other add ons and up-charging or upgrading your order. Most of the waiters I observed were working the crowd and doing just that, not mine, just what did I want. I placed my order.

If you have not been to one of these you choose which meat program you want and if you want seafood and other upgrades then head off to a mini buffet for your vegetables salad and other starters to fill you up before the more expensive meats start coming out.

Now here they really shine! Everything was great, interesting tasty salads, marinated vegetables, several soup choices that all smelled great, cheeses and some better quality deli and more. They want you to fill up on this so you don't eat as much of the higher cost meats to come.

The format in this places is to have a token on the table, often red on one side green on the other to let the roving staff with the giant skewers of meat when you want them to approach or let you rest. There are about a dozen meat choices that are supposed to be part of your meal. Here comes strike two.

Of the dozen meats I was only ever offered four. This was a failure of the management team, it was clear the staff had not pattern to follow or choreographed direction. They sort of wandered aimlessly offering meat to some people then disappearing to the back leaving many guests looking around in wonder. There seemed to be no reason or purpose, this is easily fixed and sloppy management of the dining room staff. This truly disappointed the most, meat is why you come to a Brazilian stake house, the format is variety of small portions that keep coming until you ask them to stop. They failed to execute the basic format correctly. I did receive tri-tip twice, garlic steak twice and both times they pushed more than a normal amount, bacon wrapped tenderloin, and roasted pork. I only got the pork because I finally asked for it and though I also asked for the lamb it never came to my table along with the rest of the selections.

Now for a few minor things which added to the overall negative experience. The tile floors were thick with grease and slippery, I saw and older fellow slip and fall near the rest rooms and I almost fell twice myself, this is unelectable in a higher priced establishment. Next the up charging water ($1) which was not a lot but thy try and say its a required surcharge from the city (its not). There were a number of other missed items not worth listing that all fall back to a poorly executed management team, poor coaching and poor monitoring to the dining room. 

Food was good, what I was able to sample but at $50 a plate and up I expect better service and professionalism. I cannot recommend this location as it's surrounded by better restaurants just feet away. This location is located in the Miracle Mile near a number of other mid-grade and better restaurants.",5,1,4

It seems like everyone only goes to this place cause they have coupons, which a lot of people agreed was a false advertisement and wasn't worth it. If you dont want to read my long dragged out story about my experience at this restaurant, I'll tell it to you straight. This place is a joke. Money hungry jerks wanting to rip you off, and the food and service is terrible. Definitely not worth the money. I have lived in Las Vegas my whole life and have ate at some very prestigious and fantastic restaurants. This was definitely not one, even if it was much cheaper than it is. Point plank, AVOID AT ALL COSTS. 

Ok, let my story of this miserable meal begin. I admit I have never eaten at a restaurant with this type of menu or set up. Sort of a buffet, but much more complicated. I was with my good friend, we decided to go to miracle mile to do a bit of shopping. Once we found what we wanted, we decided we wanted to eat. He had eaten at a Brazilian grill similar to this in rio, brazil. He said he liked it when he had it, and all I really wanted was a lobster tail. We went in, got a table, and our waiter came over, I think I recall his name being Eric. 
He started explaining the menu to us. I didn't completely comprehend because all I really wanted was lobster with was $17 all la cart. pretty much you can get the unlimited salad bar for $25\/person and add meat for an extra amount. Neither of us added the meat, so I don't know what it would have came out to. I just got the lobster, I wasn't that hungry and thought I would have been fine. My friend just did the salad bar for $25, no meat included. So no one came around to us with the skewers of food, so I can't comment on the quality of the meat. So first with the salad bar, it's about the size of kitchen island counter. Nothing really great, some lettuce, veggies, antipasti, and soup. Definitely not worth the $25. 
So we ordered, and my friend got right up and went to get some food. I stayed at the table, hoping my lobster would show up soon. My friend came back with a plate full of very low quality food. Right then I remembered my medication, that I need to take with food. No big deal, I picked up my fork and grabbed two small fork fulls of Caesar salad off his plate. Right as I took the second bite, which was all I planned on taking just to get my medication in me, the waiter came over and very rudely said, ""mam, you can't eat off his plate, I have to charge you the $25."" FOR TWO BITES??!! Ok, first, I am a 5' 3"", 100lbs, 21 year old woman, it wasn't like I mauled his plate, or got up and grabbed my own plate. I freaked. I understand people try to pull stuff like that all the time, but he literally watched me pick up my fork, take two bites, and put my fork back down. What he should have said was ""mam, if you want food from the var, I have to charge you $25. If not you can please put your fork down."" Nope. He just said charging you $25 and walked away. I was very angry, mumbling cuss words under my breath. My friend was going to pay, and I wasn't going to allow him to pay for it when I didn't need or use the bar.
 Then my lobster came, just the tail, a cup of butter, and a lemon wedge. I cut it up, and looked at my plate. I couldn't believe it, I literally took three bites and the food was gone. The taste was good, but the portion was ridiculous, especially for $17. When I was done, I was heated. My friend flagged down the waiter and asked him if he was seriously going to charge me for the two bites and why he couldnt have pretended he didnt see it. The waiter went off, ""sir, this is my job. I could loose my job over that."" Blah blah blah. While I was thinking, who are you? Why the hell should I care about your job? I care about getting ripped off, not your problems. That's when we told him to bring over the manager. He said ok and went to go get him. He came back and simply said, ""he took the $25 off your bill"", and stormed away. Even the manger knew the whole thing was ridiculous. Needless to say Eric didn't get a tip.
Moral of the story? This place is a joke. Food portion and salad bar quality is a joke. Ridiculous prices for not so great food or service. I am very angry with this resurant and I will definitely never go back, let alone acknowledge that it even exists. Avoid this place unless you want to be broke and left hungry and dissatisfied.",1,0,0

Service: we constantly got skipped with the meat, I had to keep flagging down waiters and asking them to send the meat over.  I got maybe 4 or 5 different cuts of meat the entire time, so less than half of what you would expect.  My drink was refilled one time the entire meal, and to get that I had to flag down different server than my own.

The meat was bland, way below the quality of what I've had at other rodizos.  The salad bar was unimpressive, and the cheesebread was extremely dry.  No appetizers or snack items were brought to the table.

All around, extremely disappointing, felt like I wasted $100.",1,0,0

You get seated in the table. We had a large group, so we got the side dishes they had. I got some rice, mashed potatoes, etc. I suggest not grabbing too many things, because the main course are the meats that are personally served to you.

**Make sure the little card is facing correctly on your table is for service meat servers to serve you**

The servers go around with various meats, such as, pork loins, tri-tips, turkey bacon, sausages, etc. The servers will tell you what kind of me he is serving. You can say ""Yeah I'll try"" or ""No thanks"". They would carve out a section of meat and tell you to grab it with your tongs. You can always ask for extra meat if you like it. They'll cut 1 or 2 more upon request. I really liked the pork loins. It was really good. I had to ask for other servers when the pork loin person is coming again, because I would like some more. Some meats are pretty salty for my liking, esp the sausages.

When were were about to pay, it took 15 minutes of waiting in frustration. No one was able to take our card.

Another issue was that the waitress barely served us. She brought water only one time and at the end she wrote down on the check that she wants $20 tip in a very creative way taking into account some ramped up prices from the sky that I would never consider to pay for this kind of food.

I paid half price, and was still mad when I left.

The salad bar is uninspired and bland. 

I went for surf & turf lunch. They have one beef based meat to choose from, then lots of cheaper cuts filling in the rest of the rotation. I felt sorry for the ""roasted ham"" guy, going from table to table, begging people to take a slice of ham from him.  The chicken was tasteless, the bacon wrapped turkey had soggy bacon.  The actual steak tasted ok, but the fat in the cut had not been rendered down, resulting in a really chewy mess.

The ""surf"" part of the meal was a disaster.  The salmon was old and fishy. The tilapia was not cooked through.  The shrimp was rubbery.  I do have to say the bacon wrapped scallops weren't terrible. The plate went almost entirely untouched.

It was difficult to get my water refilled.  For lunch, they had us sit in a section of the restaurant as far away from the salad bar as possible, resulting in many pilgrimages across the empty restaurant for the deep fried bananas (the best thing on the salad bar).

There is a small buffet bar at the back where they have some fruits, salads, rice, and pasta (included in the price). They also have some entrees available instead of the buffet. 

Unlike a regular buffet, servers will come around with the meat and cut you a piece from the skewers. For seafood, you are given a seafood platter with shrimp, mussels, salmon, and tilapia. You can ask your server for refills for seafood.

Some meat that came around included sirloin steak, pork chops, bacon chicken, pineapple and ham, and chicken legs.

My favourite was the pineapple and ham. The salty ham and sour pineapple were perfect when eaten together. I didn't eat much of beef, but my family said it was very juicy and tender. The spices used for the pork was good, but there was a strong ""pig"" taste in it. It would've been better if they used more spices to cover up the taste. The chicken was extremely dry, rough, and overcooked.

The shrimp from the seafood platter was probably the best out of the platter. They were fresh and not too salty. The mussels were very salty and didn't taste very fresh. The salmon was very dry and thin (I prefer thick cuts). The tilapia doesn't even taste like fish.

             $38.99 for all you can meat  and salad bar
             $54.99 for all you can eat meat, seafood and salad bar

Food : Filet mignon .yum, salty as always
             Sirlion. Bland and salty
             Pineapple and Ham. sweet and tasty on both
             Pork. very flavorful and salty
             
To sum it up,, they have this little wood cylinder that is color coded on both end. Red means to stop all incoming food and Green is for all you can eat meat at the slowest pace on the planet. 
If you want all you can eat, than hit up the Wynn. Atleast you can eat the main course whenever you want.

Bad Meat all around. Too dry or not flavorful enough. We ordered the 10 course (iirc) meat dinner and maybe 1 or 2 were actually good.

For the quality of food, this place is a little pricy even for Vegas (at least the dinners are). 


I can understand if the negatives are small things like ambiance or maybe the service. But when the food itself isn't that good then you've got a problem. I'm by no means an expert when it comes to Brazilian food, but I've had much much better.

The food here was really good.  Out table, including myself, ordered a combination style dinner that included meat and seafood.  I was under the impression places like this only specialized in meat, so the seafood was a delightful surprise and a nice contrast to red, bloody and savory meat.  My favorite items on the menu: Picanha (served nearly rare), Louisiana sausage, Herb Chicken, Scallops wrapped in bacon, fried cod, and grilled pineapple.  Surprisingly, they didn't have any chicken hearts (a popular item among my friends).  Our waiter explained that it was a menu item they used to carry, but scared a lot of people so it was taken off the menu.  The salad bar options were larger than expected, they had a good variety of veggies and pastas to choose from.  I particularly liked the fried mashed potatoes and fried bread.  The sea food plate was awesome. It's delivered to the table as it's cooked, that way you don't get seafood that's been sitting under a hot lamp.

We were seated promptly from our reservation time. The place is setup nicely, with quasi private areas for large parties.  The area we sat in could easily host a party of more than 20 people.  Our waiter was very friendly and personable.

Once we were seated, a barrage of waiters came out to deliver our food, one just as quick as the other.  As we got halfway through our dinner, things began to slow down, the waiters approached us more infrequently.  But by this time, I was already full out of my mind so I didn't care much.  I think it was apparent my stomach was waving the white flag of defeat.

The only thing I didn't like was the lack of selection when it came to their BBQ options.  There was still plenty to choose from, but not as much as I expected having gone to other Brazilian BBQ's restaurants.  As far as price goes, be sure to have a wallet to match your appetite.  This place is not for penny pincher's.  Overall, I really enjoyed this place.  I would definitely revisit Pampas the next time I'm in town.",1,0,1

As a vendor who advertise themselves as a restaurant with extensive experience doing special events, that was very unprofessional,  and almost without comment sense!

Which would be the typical buffet price so it was definitely A LOT more reasonable than what they charge. 

Service I would give 4 stars, my girlfriend and I were 10 minutes late due to the marathon street closures and the lady was very accommodating, but just didn't get a very welcoming vibe from her. Our waiter was great, very attentive and funny. We asked for a refill on the mimosas, he forgot, but later apologized and fixed his mistake. 

Food-wise, eh, it's okay, we arrived around 3:40pm, just before dinner started so we were lucky enough to pay the lunch price but also get the dinner meats. I would say there were about 6 different types of meat that came by, nothing grand, but definitely a jaw workout, it was either dry\/tough or bland. You also get a plate of unlimited seafood (salmon, bass, mussels, shrimp), which I thought out of everything was better than the meat itself. 

The dessert at end though, we got tiramisu and it was DELICIOUS!! It even looks beautiful, probably the best tasting thing there if I have to be honest hahah

Overall, the place is okay, if you are going to come here, I wouldn't recommend coming here without a Groupon, unless you're a big baller LOL. Even with the Groupon it really isn't worth the price for what you get. 

**Note: if you do come here, there will be a person coming around taking pictures which she says is ""complimentary"" but what she means is that she's TAKING the picture for free (which you can do yourself with your phone lol), but she'll be back with printed versions of the picture to sell to you for like $35\/2 pics. It makes it kind of awkward so if I were you just say no to the picture from the start and just take your own or ask the waiter to help you take one.",5,0,0

My boyfriend got the all you can eat meat instead. This was clearly the better choice. There was an assortment of lamb, sirloin, chicken etc. My favorite was the lamb with balsamic reduction, very tender and flavorful. My boyfriend loved the spicy chicken. Succulent, delicious meat.

The mojito was really good.  We tried another rum based drink but ended up getting a second round of mojitos because they were delicious.

All of the meat was flavorful and the portions cut by the servers were generous as you wanted them to be.

The seafood was also good- salmon, mussels, peel and eat shrimp, and another kind of white fish which was delicious and melted in my mouth.  Even with the discounts the meal was pricey, but it was great!  We enjoyed it so much.  And the serving folks-- they were all so very nice.

Food: The food was definitely good. The servers were able to serve us fast. The meat quality is really good but some of the meats lacked flavor. I believe that some of the meats that we received were either good or really hard and dry. Keeping consistency is definitely the key.

Service: When I first came, my group and I were seated fairly fast. Most of the servers were kind but there was a server who definitely gave me a bad impression. When UNLV came for a field trip here, I was one of the students. The servers were very nice to all of us and catered to our needs often. At the end, I just really wanted some water or a refill on my soda so I ended up asking this lady server for a refill. The next thing you know, I get denied. She stated that she had to tend to the bill and won't be able to refill any drinks. In the end, I just left the restaurant with a bad taste in my mouth because of this lady. She was very rude. I understand she's busy and all but she has other servers she can ask to give me my refill.This person really needs to control her attitude when she's under stress as it was fairly busy.

What I wasn't pleased with and it's very small was the fact that there is a water conservation charge if you drink water...... water that they give to you without you asking for it and without telling you there will be a charge.

My girlfriend and I went because of restaurant.com, and I realize that a restaurant.com offer should be a red flag to begin with, but I work across the street from Planet Hollywood and my girlfriend is a Brazilian steakhouse aficionado. So we went.

It was a huge mistake. The service was great. Our server Marco was friendly and attentive, burdened by poor management and a sub par kitchen. But even his excellent service couldn't make up for all the problems with our meal. It started off poorly; we sat down and ordered Hendricks martinis and a bottle of Pinot - yes we are drinkers - and they were out of both. We nixed the cocktails and picked another bottle, and to Pampas' credit they adjusted the price to match the 86'ed bottle. We were optimistic, glad they went out of their way to accommodate us.

There are essentially 3 options on the menu: meat, seafood, and both. I believe the meat was 43, the seafood 48, and the combo 54. I got the seafood and my girl got the meat. Yes it's ok that sentence was funny. 

I am a Brazilian steakhouse neophyte, so I was a little surprised that the first thing we do after ordering was go to a salad bar. This was disgusting. Wilted salad, stale bread, and a stab at Asian cuisine that makes PF Chiang's look like Nobu. I grabbed a little Caesar salad and cafeteria pasta salad and braced for the worst.

And worse it got. First of all, as soon as we sat down from the salad bar they immediately started piling my girlfriend's plate with food, but my seafood took 25 minutes, so that was slightly awkward. However, it did give me a chance to sample the meat. 

The meat sucked. We had pork tenderloin first, which was woefully overcooked. This was followed by beef that had some kind of cheese crust that was disgusting. The procession that followed was all mediocre at best, and it was all overcooked! We went in late, like 930, so maybe that was why everything was dry and well done. But for the price I don't think it's too much to
ask for properly cooked meat. The lone exception was the lamb, which was delicious.

Eventually my seafood came. It came with baked salmon, cod, shrimp, and mussels. The menu claimed bacon-wrapped scallops were included as well, but we didn't receive those until we requested them. It was essentially buffet quality seafood. The mussels were cold. Only half the shrimp were actually peeled. The fried cod was hard and hot on the outside and cold on the inside. When the scallops finally showed up, they were also cold.

We skipped dessert. The whole experience was dismal, and the modicum of savings we got from restaurant.com didn't really make up for the waste of 2 hours. Planet Hollywood is simply a black
hole for food, I would avoid the whole hotel.",0,0,0

The salad bar was average. Their corn chowder was a little bland. I didn't try any of their cold pastas. I just filled up on their lettuce and tomato with oil and balsamic vinegar. 

We also went with the 7 meats deal. I believe it came with ham, bacon wrapped chicken, tritip, sausage, shrimp, pork tenderloin, and top sirloin. This deal is $32 at lunch. 

We thought we had a deal wth our coupon for buy one get one free, but the deal required everyone to order a drink, and we realized we ended up payoff very close to the regular price anyways. Our bill came out to $420 including our 20% tip.

Our server did his best and this review is not because of his service. But the meats came around very slowly and only one at a time. This was a big reason for this bad review. 

Not the best experience here, but it wasn't the worst. It's the amount you are paying for compared to the service and food. Not worth it.

Maybe I have been spoiled with Fogo de Chao and Gaucho's Village in LA. But i have also been to smaller brazilian steakhouses and experienced much better. 

We came in with a reservation late on a saturday night. We were seated right away. We went with the Rodizio which is the all you can eat churrasco with the salad bar. I don't know if it was because it was late at during the night but it wasn't like the place was empty and people were continuing to come in through out our stay. The 'gaucho's' took FOREVER to come out. I mean, they were nowhere in sight.

They finally came by with some filet mignon with parmesan cheese. It was good but nothing special. Interesting flavor but nothing to rave about. They then brought some ham which the bf said was good. I had some brazilian sausage that was good. They kept bringing out the filet mignon and i wanted some picanha, some lamb.... something they did not bring until 45 minutes- 1 hour that we had been there. By that time, appetite was gone. Still tried some of the picanha but it was meh. They also did not ask how we wanted it (medium- medium rare, etc) which is not a requirement but I have always been asked that at churrascarias. Pan de queijo was pretty good, and since the meat took so long, we filled up on that. Good, but not worth a 40+ dollar meal for cheese bread!

Service by our waiter was decent and we came in with a restaurant.com coupon which always helps. Still, with so many good options in vegas, I am not coming back.",1,0,0

Most of our party ordered the meat rodizio, or the meat and seafood rodizio! They reported the meats were hit or miss with some meats being really good and other meats being so overcooked they were inedible!!!

Two ordered the grilled chicken, one ordered the bisque and one ordered chicken and French fries! These orders took soooo long to get to the table that most of us didn't want the food when it arrived!!! Both of the chicken breast were so overcooked that you couldn't cut through it with a serrated knife!!! My friend described her grilled chicken as chicken jerky!!!!

Prices at Pamapas are comparable to other Brazilian churrascaria's.  To our disappointment, they didn't come close to the competition.  Pampas lacks in the areas of cleanliness, service, food, and atmosphere.  I would compare it to a buffet that primarily focus on serving proteins.  Don't get me wrong, they do have a decent salad bar.  But the experience and value that you receive in return for the price you pay is just poor. 

This is the only churrascaria (to my knowledge) that has both surf and turf option.  However, if you choose to go opt for the meat only.  The seafood here consisted of salmon, scallops, shrimp, and a fish that I can't recall.  None were impressive and the unnamed fish was terrible.

The highlight of our mean was the Picanha.  This is the ""C"" shaped meat that Brazilian churrascaria's are known for.  Then again, if you can't get this right... then you don't deserve to call yourself a Brazilian steakhouse.

The service here is average at best.  Expect your table to pile up with plates you haven't finished.  The servers don't exchange and clean off plates \/ tables often so you'll be showing off the carnage of items you didn't finish to other patrons.

So would I ever return?  Only if every other Brazilian churrascaria goes out of business and shuts down.  In a city that is overwhelmed with AYCE buffets and Brazilian steakhouse options, you would be better off spending your money and time elsewhere.",2,1,1

My mashed potatoes were cold and bland.  I feel like there could be more variety in the buffet part.  It seems as though several of the selections up there don't get chosen often, so maybe they should consider adding new items or rotating items.

We used a Groupon, so I guess I can't complain too much that my sister and I got our dinners for only $65.  However, the regular prices are ridiculous.  What we had would have cost over $150 without a Groupon. 

Also, BE CAREFUL: If you ask for water, some waiters will automatically bring you bottled spring water and then make you pay for it.  If you want FREE water, make sure you specify.

This remark actually made me giggle.

The buffet selection was decent, although I wished they had more salad greens.

The manager, was quite attentive, and he was quick to remedy the situation with the seafood by providing us with a freshly, properly cooked skewer. He even comped us dessert (this policy must be standard in the manager 101 handbook) We had the white chocolate cheesecake, which was decidedly more cheesecake than white chocolate. it was beautifully presented on the plate with a raspberry culee and mint garnish.

Overall, I would recommend this place. Just make sure that the seafood is cooked to order.

Overall our experience was reasonably pleasant. The staff was quite attentive (even when our ""go meat!"" Indicators were turned to red they still came sound to make sure we didn't want what they were offering).

Being a vegetarian there isn't anything for me at the ones back home so I've never been or been able to attend with my carnivorous sweetie. 

The nice part of Pampas is they have a large buffet salad bar with tons of options that are veggie and will do a vegetarian rodizio up if requested so I figured it would be a nice place to take my carnivore while not starving myself.

Carnivore man ordered the surf and turf and I ordered up the veggie skewer.  Honestly my veggie skewer was boring and the part I enjoyed was a few dishes from the buffet which was acceptable and I didn't leave hungry to say the least.  

MY fiance was in heaven at least until the seafood skewer appeared and they put shark on his plate.   He was very upset to learn they serve shark as he's morally opposed to the shark fishing industry.  For this reason I'm not sure he'd ever make a return trip to Pampas.  I wouldn't ever choose pampas on my own accord but would still attend with someone who'd get the full experience out of it. 

If you can swing it,  visit at lunch because the food seems the same but it's double the price at dinner time.   Lunch is kind of expensive for a vegetarian like myself but it's reasonable for the surf and turf or just the turf in my estimation.

      We were very very happy to have a waiter named Jimmy who was very friendly, and very attentive. Last time I came here, 
 We had a terrible waiter . I was fearing for the worst. But, this time we got lucky. I had the most delicious grilled sirloin that was cooked to perfection. The pork tenderloin was also very moist and delicious. The grilled pineapple was also very sweet & yummy. 
       The problem I had was going to the ladies room. They only have three stalls and two was taken. I went to the last one which is the handicapped one. There was no toilet paper and there were no towel paper in the stall! I came out the restroom and reported to one of the gentleman that was working there and he said he would report it to the manager. I followed him to the back thinking that the manager would come out with some toilet paper. I stood there waiting for a good six minutes and decided to give up. I saw two ladies coming out of the ladies room and decided to go use a different stall. This is so unacceptable for them to run out of toilet paper and towel paper in the handicapped stall!!
      At the end of this lunch we were very happy with the food and the service. Until we got our bill, 3X Vero-water per person!! We were charged $3.00 for water!! What?? Jimmy explained to us that they have to charged one dollar per person for the filter water that we were drinking!! Give me a break!!! The owner does not know how to do business! I know he's got bills to pay like everyone else, but I thought this was a very sneaky way to charge people!! If you're not too thirsty, and you don't want to pay a dollar for filter water, I would order something else.

Definitely wouldn't go back",1,0,0

I came here with a group from school and they gave us deal..  I came a little late, but it is all you can eat so I wouldn't miss much.  The selection of meats they had were pretty limited compared to the other places I have been to.  I stayed away from the chicken, only because most of the party said that it was ""dry"".  Of course I load up on the bacon wrap chicken and sausages.  That was probably one of the alright item to eat.  I am sadden to say that the signature meat was over cooked and also dry.  Then I gave it another try when the gentlemen came out with a new batch, much better.  I would probably say that the grill master in the back needs to be more attentive to the meat they are cooking.  The salad bar was impressive with a huge selection of things to go along with the meat.  I like the fried bananas; probably the one thing I grabbed a plate of. The group seem to enjoyed the pineapple they had, but I had one and passed after.  They just grilled the pineapple up and there wasn't anything special about it.  The other place I have been to had a pineapple grilled with cinnimon and sugar which made it sweet.  Here it was sour.

The service was wonderful up until when we started to slow down and they all vanished.  My cup was empty and was wondering if any other meats were going to make their way back out.  My group was done so I didn't want to be the only one left sitting and eating so I decided to leave as well. 

Overrall, I don't think I will come back.  For the price, I rather hit up a buffet.",0,0,0

We came here because of a Groupon for 2. I made a reservation, and upon checking in to the restaurant, my party and I were seated within a few minutes. 

Salad\/side bar is decent, though I'd recommend staying away from the rice and mashed potatoes trying to steal stomach space from the steaks and meats. 

Meats includes tri tip roast, pork loin, pork tenderloin, bacon wrapped filet mignon, lamb, bacon wrapped chicken breast, salmon, smoked ham, mussels, shrimp, grilled pineapple, and grilled chicken thighs. Our favorites were definitely the pork dishes, all seasoned and cooked very well. The beef and chicken dishes fell a bit flat: beef tended to be under seasoned, chicken was dry. Aside from the mussels that were extremely overcooked, the seafood was very good. The one annoying thing was the frequency of the dishes offered to us. We probably were offered smoked ham 4 times, whereas the lamb only came around once, and portions were tiny (though the lamb was also an underseasoned, overcooked disappointment). 

The service was excellent and very attentive, but at $50 a person, I expected a lot more out of the food. You would do better to go to any of the other buffets in Vegas.",0,0,0

Pretty decent Brazilian all-you-can-eat buffet with unlimited meats brought to your table ($36.99 pp for dinner) but don't expect as wide of a buffet selection as one of the more established Brazilian BBQ places like Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil in other cities. 

Overall the meats brought to the table were pretty good:
- Pork loin - excellent, perfectly cooked, delicious seasoning
- Lamb - very tasty. I HATE LAMB, but loved this one because it tasted great and wasn't gamey. That says a lot.
- Chicken - regular and spicy - very moist and tasty
- Beef ribs - good but a bit fatty. Ribless.
- Sirloin steak - good but wished it had a bit more flavor.
- Flank steak - only one I didn't like. Overcooked and lacked any flavor
- Filet mignon chunk wrapped in bacon - good flavor w\/the bacon but the filet was overcooked
- Turkey sausage - was alright
- Ham and pineapple - didn't try

Examples of the non-meat buffet offerings:
- smoked salmon
- some beef stew thing
- roasted potatoes
- some veggie
- salads (caesar and regular)
- bread rolls
- rice
- variety of other sides

The place is very nice and elegant inside with very friendly wait staff who came by to asked us how we were doing different times. It wasn't that crowded so service was overall attentive altho spotty at certain times. Simple but effective system: you have a card that is green on one side and red on the other. When you want meat to come to your table, flip to green. When you are full or want a break, turn it to red.

Apparently you can get a discounted rate for this place by getting ~50% off price tickets (check out Tix4Tonight for $19.99 for the usual $36.99 dinner meat buffet) or free by attending one of those timeshare presentations. Also there are signs in the Planet Hollywood casino that say mention the sign and you'll get $5 off or something like that.

Bottom line: If you love meat, this place should make you pretty happy.  Best deal is finding some of those discounts mentioned. Don't expect this to be as good as one of the other fancy Brazilian churrascaria chains you may have tried in other cities and you'll be fine.",2,0,0

Since we knew this is a meat buffet kind of thing, we came very hungry. We arrived and got seated fast. 2 servers came for drinks or whatnot before our real server even got there. We already had our salad\/appetizers in place when the real server came and took our orders: 2 seafood for the girls and 2 meat for the boys. Simple, right? Let's see...

One meat came after another serving the boys. Looks good, smells good, tastes good...the boys had it good for about one hour while the girls sat down nibbling on some salad...waiting for some seafood. We were waiting for half an hour when we asked one of the girls who brought us meat if we can have some -- she said, ""you ordered seafood, you can't have meat."" Okay then...

We waited another half an hour for our seafood to arrive (mind you: our real server didn't bother coming during our total 1-hour waiting) to no avail. Thank goodness for the salad bar and conversations that kept us sane. 

Finally, the real server came and we asked how long it usually takes to prepare the seafood. She scrambled her notepad and from her verbal responses and facial reactions, it seemed to have forgotten that the girls ordered seafood. But she tried to cover it up by saying: ""Let me check the kitchen."" So she left. Shortly, she came back and said, ""Oh I'm sorry, they threw away the paper that I gave them. They're cooking it now. Do you still want it?"" We said yes, and she gave us meat plates (to indicate to the others that we are now ok to receive meat). Then our server said: ""I will tell my manager to remove the seafood off your tab."" We said thank you. 

4 types of meat came but we were already full from the salad. By the time the seafood came, not only we were stuffed but they were fishy and oily. So we stopped eating after one bite. 

Then we recieved our tab. ALL regular prices. I was confused. Our server said that she will remove the seafood off our tab. What she ended up doing is 'replace' seafood with 'meat' instead. Replace? That's not the word I remember her say.

I confronted (calmly) our server and told her how I understood her when she said ""remove the seafood"" from our tab and when she gave us meat plates. I said: ""I thought that was your gesture of saying sorry for letting us wait an hour and 10 minutes for our right food to arrive."" Then I added, ""I didn't ask for meat plates -- you put it on our tables so that was to imply you're giving it to us so we'll have something to eat while waiting."" And when the server answered me: ""Oh, you mean give you $40 worth of free food? No, we don't do that."" At this point, I was irritated. 

So bottom line, we were ripped off. We paid full meat price when we only had time for 4 rounds and a bite of their fishy seafood items. This doesn't even include when the boys had to ask the servers to bring them the rest of the meat mentioned on the menu to make sure they get what they were promised, plus we had to ask for drink refills, and we had to ask for soup bowls in the bar. 

If there was a negative star on this rating, I would give it. Only two of the meat that we ate were better than what we make at home -- the rest, mediocre -- not worth for the money. 

The food and the service -- two thumbs down. very, very down.",1,1,1

I'm all for endless meat!! Yes, it even makes me do a little dance when it's crazy delicious. Though Pampas does not come close to my favorite Churrascaria it sure did hit the spot for our first Vegas dinner of our poppin' weekend! 

Highlights & Low-lights:

*The service was a little spotty yet descent 
*The ""gauchos"" don't come around as much as I'd  like. I guess its because not everyone does the all you can eat. 
*Side\/Salad bar was fair with a variety of different meat accompaniments
*YAYs: Filet Mignon (to die for), Top Sirloin, Pineapple, & fried plantains!
*For whatever reason I got a lot of fatty pieces of meat :(
*Their meat needs more seasoning, damnit (and I despise salt)
*Seafood options!!

This place is alright. I wouldn't mind coming back here if someone suggests it. A-OK for you Pampas!",12,7,7

All three taste better and cost a fraction of the price. It is more than double the next closest price. I would NEVER come here if it weren't for a coupon we found. Even then it was more expensive than Tucanos. The coupon was also misleading. So for price I give it a 1.

The meat wasn't nearly as good as the three above mentioned places. It was dry and mostly flavorless. Not the worst I've had but far from the best. The salad bar was ho-hum and messy.  The soda was watery. For food quality I give it a 2.

The staff were friendly enough even though a meat server spilled water all over my wife. We got an apology but that was it. They were quick to bring food and refills. For the staff I will give a 3.

It seemed like they offered me the ham or some type of chicken more frequently than the higher quality meats though. Some tables in the restaurant are in a better location than others. Overall, a decent dinner choice at Planet Hollywood. I would go back again. I didn't have room for dessert.
