First, if it all possible only take carry on luggage when flying into LAS.  It often takes 30 or more minutes for your bags to start arriving on the belt.  This is a huge pain for me, as I generally prefer to check everything.

Short term parking is metered.  I do not carry change, so I have to plan for this when picking others up.

Now I am sure you are asking why would you have to park to pick someone up.  That is because it can be nearly impossible to drop off or pick up people curb side.  Traffic clogs up easily and often.

There is no Sky Club or partner equivalent.  This is actually more of a Delta issue, but I can not blame them for not wanting to invest much in this airport.

The taxi line can be rediculously long at times.  Apparently flights come only in bunches to LAS.  On that note for those of you without a lot of experience using taxis, be careful, Las Vegas cabbies love to rip you off with the scenic route that they claim will take the same amount of time because it avoids traffic.  I have had several friends that do not travel much get ripped off by this tactic.

Security here is rediculous.  The line is often gigantic.  Planning is clearly optional for the TSA here.

My last complaint is one of the biggest for me.  The only major airline that considers this airport a hub is Southwest.  I know Southwest refuses to label hubs, but lets be honest with ourselves.  LAS is a Southwest hub.

The one upside is that the airport is very close to the south end of the strip.",0,0,0

You can also smoke in designated places, usually a room near the slots. The baggage claim area is huge, with perhaps 18 carousels, and large video screens and full color signs showing you all the entertainment options in town. Its quite a show right there. The taxi stand has a long line and marked pick-up stalls of at least 30. The newest major change in the past couple of years is the new off-site rental car center, where all the main companies are located about a 10 - 15 minute ride south of  the airport. The other thing about this airport is that it is right near the main Strip, so you can see the gleaming gold buildings as you land. However, it can take you 30 minutes or more to go the 3 to 5 miles to get to your hotel due to traffic congestion. 

This airport has expanded many times. However, with close to 50 million passengers per year through here, it is still bursting at the seems. Beware that lines can be very long, especially through security and especially on big getaway days like Sunday and Monday. Plan to get here early then. It can take you 15 minutes past the airport to drop off your rental car, another 15 minutes for the ride to ther terminal, another 15 minutes to find your counter and check in, another 15 -20 minutes to get to security, another 5 - 10 minutes to take the train to your gates (if you are out on C or D concourse) and another 5  mintues to find your gate.

It wouldn't be Vegas if they didn't have slot machines in the airport which they do. As hot as it is I do appreciate that the A\/C is going strong. There are  some food options that are pretty good for an airport. Each terminal has different food spots which is good because you could just go to different gate areas for food and like most airports everything is expensive.

Eight check-ins at McCarran International Airport and I haven't reviewed this place yet... hmm, well, I like that the airport is conveniently located near the Strip, only 1 mile. It is the primary commercial airport serving the Las Vegas Valley. Passengers who fly into the city at night are greeted by a parade of lights and a fabulous view of Las Vegas. Once you see the flashy lights below as your plane begins to descend you know you're in Las Vegas and if you're just visiting this would be the start of your Vegas adventure. For the record we've only travelled here during weekends so the airport is busy. As soon as we are able to deplane we head straight to the baggage claim area. It is quite a long walk but those moving walkway (flat escalators) help. The baggage claim area is huge with plenty of carousels to claim your bags. Make sure you're at the correct carousel when waiting for your luggage(s) to arrive. This place takes you right out to the shuttle area that will take you to the rental car center (if you are renting a car for the weekend).

While I have a great time each visit to Vegas it's going home that sucks. I realize that TSA has a job to do to for all of our safety but I've had my share of pat downs going through security checks here. Now I don't travel much by plane but our last travel was the second time I got patted down in this airport. Ugh! It was a 3-digit weather weekend, I was wearing shorts and a sleeveless shirt. Maybe next time I should just go through the metal detectors naked.

One year ago we happened to leave simultaneously with Iron Maiden's plane while on their ""The Book of Souls World Tour"". You can gamble in the airport. Rows and rows of slot machines are available to try your luck. As a matter of fact it happened just less than a month ago where there was a winner! A California woman's $5 bet won her a $1.6 million jackpot at Las Vegas' airport. Talk about lucky!

The shopping (non-food) in the airport is great and if you have a layover here there are always lots of slot machines to help the time pass.

There is ample seating in the airport, pretty spacious restrooms (though cleanliness can be an issue at times), and lots of places to plug in your cell phone charger, etc. The only things I don't particularly care for are the food options, particularly at night.

If you rented a car the location of most of the car rental places aren't actually in the airport.  Its about a 1-2 mile drive from the airport but most rental places offer a shuttle.

They get your money the moment you enter the state and they try to take your money as you leave the state.

It's a little dirty and the interior is a badly colored grungy sleepy color -- but I guess it's a quaint reminder of what the lower-end casinos are like. But as an airport -- fully functional, not many qualms. On a weekday, there were mostly older people and businessmen.

McCarran is old, ugly, and hassle-ridden, and fails miserably as the gateway to its city.

The terminal is dark and dated, looking much like that old ghetto mall in your town that everyone used to go to in the 1980s, but is now just a collection of empty storefronts and payday-loan stores. The old and inefficient design of the terminal means it's constantly crowded, from the gate seating to the trams to the restaurants and bars.

And speaking of McCarran's restaurants and bars, they mostly suck too. All airports are known for expensive retail, but most modern airports at least give you a good product for your dollar - lots of restaurant options, sports bars, maybe even a brew pub or wine bar, or a food court with some local flavor - places geared toward helping people relax and kill time while they empty their wallets. By contrast, McCarran gives you a few uninviting bars, some crappy fast food, and a couple very overcrowded restaurants - but don't worry, they've still managed to preserve the high prices you're accustomed to.

McCarran should have an inherent advantage because of its closeness to central Vegas, but this benefit is pretty much canceled out by poor logistics that make it a hassle to get in and out easily. When arriving, baggage claim is notoriously long. If you're picking up a rental car, get ready for a nice long bus trip to the rental-car mall, which is strategically located in the middle of nowhere (granted, having a centralized rental facility is a good idea, but not when it's this far offsite).

Then when you're bringing your car back, please enjoy the lack of signs directing you to the rental-car facility, which means you have to drive through the entire airport loop (past your terminal where you're eventually going) in order to see the first sign, which then directs you back out on the highway to the rental-car place several miles away. Now experience deja vu as you take the bus back into the airport loop, where there's only one dropoff spot per terminal... so if you're flying Southwest (like most Vegas patrons) you'll get deposited with your bags on the exact opposite end of the terminal from the check-in counter.

Also, most of the staff seem to have a permanent case of the Mondays.

Vegas is in desperate need of a new airport - one that's shiny and nice and much more efficient, an appropriate facility for the city it represents. It's too bad that the city couldn't get its shit together during its last 20 years as a boomtown and make this necessary capital investment. Now that the economy is tanking, and the housing crisis is hitting Vegas especially hard, it might be a long time before they have the cash for a significant upgrade.",1,1,1

Maybe the bright lights got to them, or they are trying to figure out how to pay their mortgage after loosing big, but they are space cadets. No clue how to get through security.

I had a problem when I was taking a flight to LAX. I'm really not sure if this is LAX's problem (which it is) but if it is also partially McCarran's problem. My flight was supposed to take off at 6:30 and ended up not taking off until past 7. With the pilot and the crew members, we had already been 20 minutes late. After that, they reported over the intercom that LAX had scheduled too many planes to fly in and that we would have to wait an additional time slot before we could leave. Don't know if this was also why we waited the additional 20 minutes at first but like I said, I'm not sure if this is LAX's problem or McCarran's.

Whatever it is..I hope I don't run into the same problem the next time I fly out of this airport.

On the bright side, this airport taxi's extremely quickly after landing and can get me off the plane within 5 minutes of landing.

Plenty of seating space for passengers - LAS has packed terminals flooded with passengers in various stages of drunkenness. Good people watching (shout out to the lady flying in her bikini) but also annoying (shout out to all the drunken bachelorette parties).

If you are taking an Uber\/Lyft, there is a designated area that you have to take an elevator and walk across a ramp to reach, but these are generally cheaper than taking a taxi.
If you are renting a car, there is a shuttle that will take you to the Car Rental Center that is almost like a terminal in itself. The shuttle is free and an attendant can help you with your bags!

Slot machines every where you turn.
The Big marquee signs in the baggage claim area adds to the fun ""I'm in Vegas!"" atmosphere.
Short wait times for luggage
Nice shops for souvenirs, candy, snacks, drinks.
Quick and efficient security line (for us anyway because we had a baby in stroller with us--it seemed everyone else had a pretty damn long line)

The Bad:
Traffic in the airport circle.  Now I always thought O'hare was bad, but at least ORD has traffic ""cops"" directing motorists. McCarran was so difficult to navigate with people swerving, stopping and unloading where they weren't supposed to.  Ugh.
Cramped concourses.  The last thing I want to do is smell someone else's hangover.  Turn up the air, build wider concourses, do something please! I might as well been at a street fest it was so crowded everywhere.
Less than helpful directions in baggage claim. There are at least 4 different exits--one for taxi, one for limo, one for buses and one for the common folk like me getting picked up by a family member.

The airport is a pain in the behind if you are running on a tight schedule and have a car to drop off.  LAS security lines can be horrendously long so plan ahead.  It's crowded, full of amateur travelers and has cramped gates.

But, it's also a cool place to hang out if you are early and have time to kill.  Shopping and dining options abound, especially before security.  And of course, the gaming machines!!!!  As a recent convert to video poker, I delight in the ability to lose another $100 just before I board my flight.  Vegas, you have perfected the art of yanking every loose dollar from our pockets and I salute you!

The bars at McCarran ID everybody.  Period.  No exceptions.  A few months ago, they asked for ID from someone in a wheelchair, with a ventilator and a colostomy bag who turned out to be 100 years old (which wasn't bad because the bartender bought free drinks for all to celebrate the century!!!)

But really, you had to ID that dude before giving him his Jack and coke?  What. EVAR.

One of the less mentioned facts about McCarran is its absolutely incredible ability to handle logistics - baggage claim and taxi lines - during the giant conventions that plague Las Vegas.  I have never seen such efficiency elsewhere - this would do Toyota proud in terms of cycle time measurements!!!  Amazing!

Lounges are ""meh"" but there are plenty of ways to keep yourself entertained.  LAS is the best place in the world for people watching because you will see every weird nuance of humanity represented her.  Promise you that!  

Anyway, back to video poker before I close... last time, I won $40.  Next time, I clean house.  I will get you McCarran airport... just you wait!!!!

~ 3 stars overall for giving me yet another love-hate relationship in my life.  I need these like I need to step on a cactus with bare feet but hey, they're free :\  But go to Vegas people, McCarran is just a way-point on your journey to insane wealth in the Sin City :D

Stopping over at the airport in Vegas is a welcome relief just because of this. Also, they have decent food throughout the airport, and the bathrooms are spaced at reasonable intervals (even though I do think they're a bit small. Ugh bathroom lines.) 

Ground transportation at McCarran is probably the most efficient and cheapest that I've seen. Also, they've moved all the rental car companies to one building off-site, and there's a frequent shuttle bus that will take you there for free.

If flying out of the C gates, ignore the signs and what you are told. Proceed instead to follow the A, B, and D gates signs. Next to the D gates, there's a little entrance to the C gates. There's never a line and I always breeze through in record time.

Quirks: 

C and D gates are at a remote terminal. If you're going to make your flight, arrive a little bit early so you can clear security and hop on the tram.

If you fly American Airlines, which attach to the D gates, this means baggage claim is 1.5 - 2 miles from where you land. Therefore....don't check bags if you can help it. Takes a while.

Bonuses:

Free wifi. A little slow but it's free.

Crowd handling - Obviously this place gets slammed every weekend. So they're capable of handling a bunch of people.

The ability to gamble while you wait. I made $300 doing this recently.


Downsides:

A lack of healthy food options....it can be done, it's just not easy for you.

Being a Las Vegas local, I am very familiar with our airport. I find if convenient to pick people up (though it can be confusing before you know the layout). 

Flying out of Macarran is always a breeze. I have rarely experienced a huge line at security and generally the lines move very quickly. There are tons of places to eat and shop once you get through security. 

This is an airport for people watchers. First of all people come to Las Vegas from all over the world so there are so many different types of people to look at. Secondly, in Las Vegas, people visiting tend to wear the most gaudy, tiny, see through, sequin covered, outfit. Words like age and weather appropriate go out the window. They then pair said outfit with the craziest and often highest heels they own which makes for an excellent show. Lastly, inhibitions are abandoned and, most likely, they've been drinking since they boarded their plane to Vegas. Therefore you are left with people of every color of the rainbow, running around drunk looking like they got dressed in a cross between Liberace and Cher's closet. All of this equates to the best people watching experience you will ever have. 

Finally, this airport has something that I've never seen in any other airport, slot machines.  So if the shopping and people watching isn't keeping you entertained, and you haven't already lost your life savings, you can pull up a seat and try your luck at some last minute winnings. 

If you are flying into Las Vegas, our baggage claim area is huge and very efficient. You won't have to wait long for a bag. Ground Transportation is also pretty simple. The taxi line may look forever long but it's lightening quick.  Most importantly, our airport sits right next to the fabulous Las Vegas strip so the ride to your hotel should be short.

Each time the place was closing down and nothing to eat.

Seriously, 9 o'clock... why would a whole airport close down food service with that many passengers stuck in the place...

Baggage: this is important! After you get to the tram area, there are two separate trams for two separate terminals. Make sure you pick the one that has your airline listed. 

If you messed up, totally okay. Just a pain in the ass, but you can exit baggage and take the terminal bus to the other one. 

Taxi ride is about $30 to the strip. 
Limo is about 65, I believe, so rally yo' friends and arrive like a baller.

Not awesome:
- No sky train connecting terminals, so your snack options are incredibly limited to your vicinity.
- outlets are limited and a precious commodity here. Anyone bring the power strip??

Gambling is illegal in Hawaii, haven't you heard that Las Vegas is our 9th island?  I love traveling internationally but my husband definitely likes to gamble, so we have no choice but to come into contact with the people here.
TSA's are the worst.  Yelling at foreigners who don't speak English, very unfriendly, no customer service, they all have an attitude that says ""I'm better than you"" and I say ""who's paying your wages?"" 
Skycaps - 2 thumbs down. We've only came across one out of all the times we have been there who made us extremely happy but it was a couple of years back.  I like to shop but don't like rolling around the extremely heavy suitcases because of that.  Now there are those that just stand around, talk story and enjoy getting paid low wages because their personalities are not wonderful enough to tip.  In December we had a ton of luggage because we went skiing and bought our own stuff, we hired a skycap to take care of it and to get our boarding passes for us. When asked how we wanted to pay for our luggage we told him credit card...the response we got ""it's easier for me if you pay cash so I don't have to go all the way over there.."" yeah buddy you need the exercise, it was only literally 20 feet away and he ended up going there anyway. 
Airline agents located at the airport SUCK.
If you haven't traveled outside of the United States you seriously need to. We went to Japan a couple of months ago and they are ALL about customer service. If you think Hawaii is full of friendly people, Japan makes us look like the workers at LAS.

Well McCarran certainly isn't as glitzy as its large and imposing neighbors, but it makes up for that with a functional and clean space that will house you for the few hours that you might await your next flight.

The airport features both the good and the bad when it comes to their terminals.

The complex is large and you should be prepared to walk a bit. The moving walkways are a help, however the distance between terminals can be its biggest detriment. The monorails that run between the terminals are fairly quick, however hang on tight to the bars or you could quickly lose your balance.

The security line is centralized and while may seem long, generally does move at a reasonable rate. Still plan to arrive at least an hour before your flight departure time since you'll need every second to get through security and to your terminal.

I followed the sign to transportation,  and took a fast moving tram full of stinky people to the area I needed to be at.

Ground transportation requires you to line up and wait for someone to direct you to a cab. There must if been 100 people in front of me. Taxi cabs are expensive and they add a $2.00 extra charge on for leaving the airport.

There are multiple terminals so don't get lost. Trams are mainly one stop connectors to each terminal, which means you can't ride the tram in a loop hoping to get to another terminal. You have to get off. 

Coffee. Don't go to the first Starbucks you see! That one is always packed. There's another down the walkway and if you don't care for Starbucks, there's also a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf ...or bars. 

Baggage claim is massive, but there are plenty of screens and signage that point you to the correct baggage carousel. Your flight number and departure city is shown on the screen and flashes when that flight's baggage is loaded into the carousel.

And I get that it's Vegas, but does there really need to be THAT many slot machines in one airport?  Seriously, folks... can you not wait until you get to your hotel?  They take up too much room and it makes it impossible to hear yourself think.

Parts are recently renovated it seems, which were nice.  But, overall, I've definitely experienced better.  

Also, uber-expensive.  A bagel sandwich from Einstein Bros. should not cost more than $9.  And it's across the board, every single merchant in there is overpriced by a LOT.  And because the flight is cheap (generally), and the hotels are cheap, and if you're from the east coast (like I am) and you know you're not going to last a five hour flight without a bottle of water or soda or snack or something, you're GOING to have to pay it.  It doesn't make me feel better about it, though.

Anyway, rant over.  Place is decent, but needs an update.  Definitely been to better airports.  And much quieter and cleaner ones, too.",1,1,0

The location is at the end of the Vegas strip so if you are staying on or near the strip it isn't too bad of a cab ride.  That is, unless you get a shady cab driver who takes you out to the highway and back on the strip which puts more $$ in their pockets.  Unless something is going on that is unusual there is no need why your cab driver cannot take you from the airport directly on to the strip so FYI.  Exceptions would be if you are staying on the end of the strip near the Wynn.  The best advice is to evaluate which casino you are at in relation to which end of the strip so you can avoid your cab driver taking the highway route.  

Getting from the airport to your destination via cab is usually a sort of nightmare (especially in the warm months) as the cab lines are looooooooooooong.  Be prepared to wait.

Of course most people are tickled that this airport has over 1200 slot machines including at the terminals so you can gamble up until the last minute before getting on your plane.  

Baggage claim takes FOREVER at McCarran since most people who come through this airport carry a lot of bags.  Baggage claim is also massive with tons of turnstiles so be aware.",1,1,0

- the cleanest airport I've even been in (I have been around the world). Even the airplane sculptures along the escalators were free of dust. Not a speck of rubbish on the ground, anywhere. 

- tons of toilets, everywhere! Toilets were all clean, modern, well lit with lots of room so you don't smash yourself in the stalls. You can even roll your carry-on into the stall with you and still have enough room to maneuver your butt up to the toilet.

- lots of security lines to keep traffic moving. 

- TSA guy actually confiscated my corkscrew I forgot to pack into my suitcase, but he did so without attitude and even managed to smile and strike up a conversation with me. He said if I wanted my item back, I'd have to go back to the check-in but I declined. That was nice of him to ask, though.

- great signage, intuitive. 

- a KIDS STORE in this airport of all places! YAY. Las Vegas is not a kid-friendly place and I had nothing to bring home for my 6-yr old until I found the store, too bad I can't remember the name of it. They had a nice selection of uglydolls.

- Tram moves really fast, and its clean!

- Shuttle service easy to find, right outside the baggage claim areas. Cheap shuttles too. Forget the cabs (bad news in Vegas, if you ask me).

They had a couple of food choices in Gate B. I opted for an appetizer\/drink combo at the Chilli's located near the waiting area. However, airport food\/drinks will always be a tad pricier in the airport once you've gone past security.

Nonetheless, wouldn't mind going back anytime soon!",0,0,0

a. TSA Pre - If you travel enough, sign up for the TSA Pre system. The office is located near the entrance to Gate C.  If you qualify, it will save you tons of money in the long run.

b.  Dropping off - If you have friends and family that are either arriving or departing from D\/C gates in Terminal 1, always drop them off or pick them up from Passenger Pick up, if they have only HANDCARRY.  If they have check in, you don't have choice but to drop them off at the departure areas of the airlines.

c.  Picking up - If you are picking people up, just be careful and park it at the short term or go around. The traffic nazis are in force and will make you move!

d.  The terminals - I think all the terminals are fine. Terminal 1 is a bit older but really the shopping, food choices and waiting areas are decent. Terminal 3 is very new and modern and very pleasant.

e.  Getting Around - Them little shuttle trains work out well. Baggage comes very quick whereas before, it took forever.

There is a TSA pre office here, there is the GOES inspectors if you want a GOES permit and there are a lot of services here that make this a world class airport.  Shopping is not world class and the food choices are a bit benign yet adequate!",3,3,3

That said, I have been into or through McCarren International a few times.  Once to actually visit Vegas! 

I like arriving at this airport.  I find it well laid out, easy to follow signs and luggage actually arrives fairly quickly.  There was some confusion and the belts for luggage changed for my flight, but it was small and easily overcome.  

Finding the cab was not an issue, but I had been prepared for a ""scenic route"" type of ride, and was given exact directions by others on how to avoid that.  So I think my cabbie took the most direct route to the hotel.  

I returned to the airport the following day to pick up a rental car, which I also found easy.  The airport shuttle was on time to the hotel; and the ride back was easy, but it was very early in the am.  The tough part was, he did not know where the car rental pickup was, and so dropped me off at the wrong terminal\/area of McCarren.  I had to get onto another shuttle to get to the right place.  So all the time saved by taking an early shuttle was lost waiting for the next one.  But OK.

When I was leaving Vegas some 10 days later, the car drop off was easy.  The check-in was easy.  In fact, it was all pretty easy.  Then I had to get to the gate.  That was a long walk.  I had plenty of time, but it was a long walk.  And I will say, people are much sadder leaving Vegas than they were arriving in it, so the vibe in the airport was very different.

Overall, this is a fine airport, I found it fairly easy to navigate and the lines etc were not too long and well managed.  I'd fly into and through here again without hesitation.

This airport is exactly what the three stars mean: A-OK. When you get there and you are going to the strip, the best thing I can suggest is taking the shuttle right off the bat (round trip). It takes you straight to the hotel, though it may stop at other hotels first, and they load and unload your luggage. If you do get the round trip, they give you a number to call at least 24 hours in advance to reserve a spot on the way back. The shuttle usually picks you up at least 2 to 2.5 hours before your flight, though the airport is only 10 min or so away. It's def cheaper than the cabbies - they rip you off soooo badly in Vegas! 

Unfortunately, we flew spirit (I have another review for that alone), and instead of departing at 5:20 pm, we left at 10:04 pm. I had a good 5 hours to really get to know the airport... and I have nothing good to report. There are barely any food options around and the ones that are worth mentioning (Starbucks, Einstein Bagels) were already closed. There was only one airport shop which really sucks because I didn't have a chance to buy any souvenirs during my 3 day stay, so I thought the airport would give me some good choices to pick from. I would also say that the prices are pretty high considering that we had a $7 per person voucher for a meal from Spirit (how very generous of them) and it still wasn't enough for two hot pretzels and two drinks. 

The obviously cool part of this airport are the slot machines since you won't see that any where else, but I don't gamble, so it made no difference to me. This airport is perfect for those who have planes that leave on time, otherwise, it's a pretty lame time if you ask me!",0,0,0

I was traveling with my elderly grandparents and my grandmother required a wheelchair to get around. When I got them checked in at the desk, they pointed me to where the wheelchairs were and a group of airport employees. I was going to push the wheelchair but one of the employees said I wasn't allowed to and proceeded to wheel my grandmother towards the security checkpoint. I highly doubt there is a rule that says only airport employees can assist people in wheelchairs.

The guy was walking too fast and my grandfather was having a hard time keeping pace. I asked the guy to slow down but he stopped for a brief second before continuing with the same speed. 

The security checkpoint was awful. At the airport we came from at the beginning of our trip, we were allowed to go through a separate security line with lighter security measures (we didn't have to take our shoes off, empty our bags of electronics, etc) because my grandmother was in a wheelchair and required an alternative security screening. At McCarran, we were pushed into the same line as everyone else because there was no separate line for wheelchair-bound people (or TSA approved people, for that matter). After going through the full-body scanner, the TSA agent searched everyone's pockets instead of just letting us move on.

We had to wait almost 10 minutes after we got through the scanner because there wasn't a female TSA agent available to wheel my grandmother past the scanner and give her a alternative security screening. They just left her there in line until someone finally noticed and wheeled her across. They didn't even give her a pat-down; they just checked her for explosive residue with that chemical pad. 

The airport employee was still with us and insisted on wheeling my grandmother to the gate. Once again, he was walking too fast and my grandfather couldn't keep up. 

After waiting at the gate for around 30 minutes, an announcement came over the speakers about our flight but the volume was too low and the guy was speaking too fast so we couldn't understand what he said. Some of the other people waiting said that a different flight at our gate was delayed and apparently both planes were on their way here. We were told that we (as in, our flight) might be moved to a different gate. Our plane arrived first (and on time) but the gate people said the other flight's passengers were going to take this one and we had to go to a different gate on the other side of the terminal. So we walked over 15 gates down to where we were suppose to go. What pissed me off was that their plane was delayed and they got to swipe ours instead. Then they got to take off and we were delayed too. 

When we were boarding the plane the gate employees wouldn't let me board with my grandparents because I wasn't on the pre-board list. I expected as much, but they were really nasty about how they said ""no"". Usually, airports let a small number of people board with the person who is in pre-boarding (wheelchair-bound people, infants, people with disabilities, etc) but I guess McCarran employees treat you like a jackass for ""trying to get on the plane early and cut in line"".

It gets the job done. You fly in, you grab your Uber or Lyft, you come back, you go home. There are some slots, some eats, but overall a rather drab look to the airport.

What's unique about this airport is the slot machines. But if you're coming back from Vegas, I'm sure you're already all played out.

One thing I will note is that there are some more ""modern"" accommodations here (and it's kind of sad that this is considered modern rather than expected) like USB ports to charge your devices, though I guess those will soon be out of date thanks to Apple.

My biggest gripe is the layout of the airport. You never really think about the layout of the airport too much, but as a ""frequent flyer"" it does impact me. The Centurion Lounge and the Club are at Concourse D, and Southwest doesn't fly into Concourse D. It's accessible from Concourse C, but there's a shuttle that doesn't come all too frequently. To sum it up - it's a pain to get from lounge to gate. Not SFO painful, but up there.

I'm not a gambler. The only thing I really notice is the color coordination that they have in their interior.

The security there were surprisingly happy. Instead of demanding, they ask you politely if we can stand in the tube-like thing to get screened. And they say it with a smile. (How weird. I've been in San Jose for way too long)

The staff are always smiling and they seem very approachable.

I wouldn't mind sitting waiting for a flight there. It's quite a scenery. Especially for me because I like to people watch. And people from all over the world travels to Las Vegas for many reasons. Which means you are exposed to very diversified human behavior.

I had to walk through the Las Vegas airport by myself for the first time and it was quite easy to locate where I needed to be.

My airport experiences are pretty good. It may be because I haven't had the need to check a bag in. Just carry two carry-ons and you're set to go!

The only issue I have is with the security line. I have a preferred AA flight that leaves at 5:15am so we normally get to the airport around 3-330am. At that time, there is only one agent checking boarding passes at the C and D security line. Same person does the TSA precheck as well. Thus the line is super long (sometimes up to 70-80 deep) until someone else shows up, usually around 4am, sometimes later.  Can't we get just a few more people working that security check? It's hard enough getting to the airport at 3am, but waiting in a line for an hour is almost unbearable.

Getting to the strip is quite simple with plenty of options: taxi's, shuttles, and car services.

I was regular at this airport for a while then the trips became less frequent but I somehow still manage to come here every once in a while.
Terminal 2 is the one I used quite a bit as Air Canada flies here directly. Not a good place to be if you ask me the place is just rotting with old and uncomfortable chair and carpet everywhere. Not much in term of food options or stuff to do to kill time but I guess most direct international flight arrive here. Its also hard to find a shuttle from here though getting a cab or limo is easier as there isn't much of a line up as there aren't many passengers in terms of volume.
Terminal 1 fares better as it is much larger. It is starting to show its age though as garish colors and decor makes you want to spend little time here. The bars here push a lot to up sell you a shot or get a bigger glass.

I have never used the automobile parking lot or restaurants at this airport so I ami able to comment.  One thing I do recommend is that passengers check in their luggage at curbside instead of taking it inside the airport. That way you do not have to wait in the long lines.",0,0,0

My most recent trip to Las Vegas was definitely different compared to the past 50 times.  We arrived on Aug. 24th around 2 PM and we got our luggages pretty quickly.

I was even more impressed when we were leaving on Aug. 26th at around 6:30 PM because there was hardly any line at TSA.

The guys who were working that day were all very sweet, friendly, and helpful.  My niece and I had a lot of stuff to get through check-in, but they made the process so smooth and effortless.  They didn't give us any problems at all even though I had to be reminded to remove my heels & my jacket.  I even had to be reminded to take my phone out of my back pocket because I had so much to carry.  And even then, the gentleman who was helping us still didn't give me an attitude.

I guess I just need to figure out to fly out of Vegas when all these really awesome guys are working so I don't have to be stressed out during the TSA check in process.",12,6,15

This is a busy airport, and people are always coming and going.  Security is quite thorough, and it takes a while to get through.

At first, I wasn't too impressed with this airport.  For such a big city, I expected a fancier airport.  However, in time, I have grown to appreciate this airport.  I mean who needs stuff at the airport when you can have the world at your fingertips 15 minutes away on the Strip.

I like this airport because it's quick and easy, in-and-out.  There are 6 shuttle companies located right outside the exit.  You can get to the strip for about $6-$7 in 15-30 minutes.  I have used CSL and Executive.  Both are good.  CLS hands you a Las Vegas funbook with some great coupons.  Executive is a bit slower than CLS, You'll get there soonish, and for $7 you can't really complain.

For incoming flights, I think it's cheaper and faster to use the shuttle.  I feel like every time I take a cab in Vegas, they always try to swindle you, by taking the long route or complaining that you didn't tip them enough for their ""hard work"".   Correct me if I'm wrong, but 20% is standard, and some would consider it generous.  In any case, if you end up in a cab, it's usually between $20 - $30 between the airport and the Strip.  This is comparatively cheap compared to other major cities (New York JFK is $45, plus fees and tip; San Francisco $50 plus fees and tip).  That makes $20-$30 look like a steal.

Added bonus: there is a post office inside the airport, and it's really close to the security gate.  Another benefit of having a small airport is that things are close together.  This is good for two things: (1) if you have inadvertently left something in your bag - liquid that is more than 3 ounces, a knife or sharp object, you can just mail it yourself.  I didn't take a close inspection to see what kind of services they had after hours, but at least the full ranger of services are available when they are open.  I noticed that they had a envelope drop open after-hours.  I suppose if you had a pre-paid priority envelope handy, you could mail it.  (2) I love to mail my postcards from the destination, but sometimes it can be so hard to find a mailbox.  This is it!

Second bonus: they have lockers.",2,1,1

This is going to be one of my favorites if I keep having the same experiences.  Being a local who travels back and forth quite a bit, it's nice to have things convenient.

Easy to navigate to and from, signage every where surrounding the airport area, so it's pretty hard to get lost if you know how to read.  Parking isn't too bad, there was plenty at Terminal 3 economy when I was last there.

Once inside, it's nice to know that unlike some airports (St. Louis) the wifi actually works and is free!  It's not hard to get logged in, some airports are a real pain with that stuff.  If you have gambling fever, there's plenty of slot machines located throughout the terminal, as well as no shortage of food stands & restaurants if you need a pre or post flight meal.

Now this being one of the busier airports in the USA and the world for that matter, lines at security can be on the longer side, depending on when and what time you fly.  I had a longer wait (15-20 minutes last time) but it wasn't too bad.  Terminal 3 takes all international and some smaller domestic airlines, so its not as busy as terminal 1.

With resources available, they make very poor use of the money and seems to be extremely poorly managed.   Do not expect to get in and out of the aiport quickly if you have a rental car and check bags.   Here is how it went today.....and this applies to Terminal 1
1.  Rental cars:   It is at a separate facility for all companies about 5 minutes away from the airport.    They seem to have this part right.   With the huge crowds it moved pretty well with buses lined up to shuttle passengers.  With this extra logistics add another 15 min to your normal schdule
2.   Ticketing:   This is more under control of the airlines.   This part went ok.
3.  Security checkin:   This is where it went down hill fast.   With thousands of people in line on this mid November Saturday afternoon.  Securitiy is yelling at people to get into four lines, four abreast.   There were no markings or aisle lanes or roped lanes.   It was a free for all making a tangled mess of hundreds of people squishing against each other.   This was the first bottleneck   When you reached the ID checkpoint....it then necked down to ONE lane for security checkin.   This caused a huge bottleneck and everyone had to go through the line serially.  After they put both me and my carryon through the microwave oven, nearly an hour passed.
3.  Train to the terminals.   Don't think you are at the gates yet.  You still need to take a train to the airplane gates.  This adds another 10 min
4.  Restrooms.   One of the worst I have ever seen at any major city.   It was just plain FiLTHY.   The seat liners were the cheapest quality I have ever encountered, tearing no matter how carefully you pulled it out.   Wads of torn liners littered the back of the latrine because other frustrated ""users"" just had it with this nonsense.  They were also out of paper towels.

It's a bit strange because you do get the Las Vegas newbies or kiddos who will watch you play from a distance as they've just gotten off of the plane. 

I played about two or three dollars in slots, ate a piece of Sbarro pizza at about 10am and looked out the window. While the airport is severely outdated compared to my town's airport, McCarran has the beautiful view out the window, and I usually stare out the window until I have to get on the plane, then  I'll usually resume my  staring trance, wishing I could stay in the desert mountains forever. 
So... McCarran has that for it, naturally.

So, really, all it needs is windows.

It seemed to take forever to get to teh baggage claim area, but that might have been because my shoulder bag was SO heavy. There were a couple of those moving walkways, though, so that made it a bit easier\/quicker. 

The baggage claim area was filled with lights and posters and looked about the same as it did 20 years ago, if I remember correctly.

Now that I frequently fly there (usually Terminal 3) I need to tell you that McCarran Intl Airport L&F staff is just a cut above other airports (only Honolulu is on par with them which is another story to tell).  The first time, 3 months back I left my driver's license at the airline gate for my trip back to SFO.  Someone either turned the license in or their cleaning crew found it.  Regardless, when I email them through their website, I got a response and next thing I know, they have mailed it back to me within the week!  Such great service and follow through.
Just two weeks ago, I landed in LAS but my phone rang and I had to sit down in front of the women's room to take the 15 minutes call.  After the call, I got up and exited the terminal to discovered that some how I dropped my prescription sunglasses and the case.  At that point, I was not sure if I left it on the plane from Long Beach or upon arrival.  I contacted the airline as well as walked to the Lost and Found.  They didn't have it that day and I left the next day for SFO.  Before leaving I called the Lost and Found again and left a message about the sunglasses.  I also email them on their website to be thorough.  Then I departed, sadly depressed about losing the sunglasses.  A day later, I got a call from a nice rep who thought they had found the sunglasses which got delivered to Terminal 1 where their main office is!  I described it and she confirmed it. OMG!  Saved me $400 to replace them and now I didn't have to go without them while driving so I can see.  Cannot believe how efficient they are and so helpful. I gave them a shipping account for FedEx and she was so nice about getting it shipped out same day.  I cannot say enough about the service at LAS Lost and Found.  They are as good as it gets!",2,1,0

I have seen it grow in leaps and bounds over the years. Again, I look at airports differently than most people. This airport has been the start of many adventures for me, amazing memories and tons of fun. Las Vegas is my favorite destination in the World. Everyone of these wonderful adventures started here a McCarren International Airport. 

I have been to Las Vegas a million times but my last visit was the best ever, We did New Years 2016\/2017 here. I didn't know I was even going until Christmas Day when I opened a gift from my wife and there were to tickets to Las Vegas and a room at the Bellagio. We have only been married a little over a year and she heard all my Las Vegas stories and wanted to surprise me. It was her first visit and us going together made it very special. 

The location of this airport is worth the 5 stars alone even if the place was a dump. It literally takes about five minutes to get the the intersection of Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd. where the MGM Grand, New York New York and the Excalibur Hotels and Casinos are. When you get in the airport and your waiting for you luggage there are all kinds of advertisements you can look at to see all the different things going on in Vegas and that's kool. 

The way the car rental section is great, they even load your luggage in the bus for you to get you there, everyone we came in contact with was nice.

I don't find anything wrong with the slot machines in the airport. PEOPLE ITS LAS VEGAS THERE ARE SLOT MACHINES EVERYWHERE EVEN IN GAS STATIONS AND 7\/11's WHY NOT THE AIRPORT? 

Here is what most most people do at airports, they get there early of course, get their boarding pass then maybe grab a bite to eat and rush to the gate to sit there and do nothing for an hour or more, then get bummed out because they are bored. Even the plane boards you got a half hour before they close the doors. Everyone will wait in line and they have to get up when their section is called and wait forever as people fight with the overhead bins and stuff. I prefer to just wait until everyone has boarded and then get in the plane just before they shut the doors. It gives me more time to explore the airport. You'd be surprised at some of the things you can discover. 

There a kool 1957 Thunderbird here with a history at the airport. There are other things about Vegas and stuff scattered about. Lots to see and do, lots of food choices and plenty of beer and booze. There is a really neat giant horned toad you can pose with. 

So, the couple hours you may spend in this airport coming or going is well worth it. There is no other place in the world like Las Vegas and for most the adventures begins at McCarren. I'll take it thank you.",7,4,12

One would think for a city like Las Vegas which heavily relies on tourism, it would have  a great airport. Well,  the airport is dated and dingy. It is poorly laid out and confusing. I've never seen an airport where when you leave your gate, you have to leave security to go to another gate or to go to shops or eateries between the gates. In every other airport, once you clear security, you can move freely between gates or the shops between them. Some of the TSA agents are also rude. One TSA agent misinformed me and  then another rudely accused me of lying when I said what the first one had said, which was  that I didn't need to go through security a second time. I snapped back angrily that  that was what I was told by the first one. I don't mind going through security again but do mind rudeness. Some of the other TSA agents I noticed have an ""attitude"" also. I also noticed a major lack of shopping, souvenir places or food places.  I'm from Texas and our aiports are so far superior that it's not even funny. The airports in Texas are clean, modern, efficient, attractively decorated and have a lot of shops and food choices.

This is one of my favorite airports, just because it has that vibe of Sin City all over it.  There are plenty of billboards for the casinos and plenty of slot machines even in the baggage claim to take your money even before you leave the airport terminal! It's probably the only airport I have been in that has casinos in the airport. There are multiple levels to this airport, so it's not just a 2 floors, but up to 4 levels, if I am not mistaken. Considering how much people spend in Las Vegas, I am surprised that the City of Las Vegas does not upgrade the airport infrastructure to meet today's demand for the every day tourist.

The only thing about this airport was the crazy TSA security lines. There are plenty of people getting out of LAS at any given time. Waiting for a taxi wasn't bad, but there can be congestion when you arrive at peak times. Taxi fare isn't too bad, ranging up to $30 for anywhere along the Strip. Over the years, I have flown into LAS because of the lure of Sin City. Lately, it was due to the lure of the marathon. Yep, the marathon. I was here to run the ET Midnight Marathon in Rachael, NV. Never mind about the glitz and glamour of the Strip, when a marathon is ready to be conquered. Had a fun time and wished I can come back. But for now, it was a fun weekend affair.

There is free wifi and the food options were plentyful. I'm glad that there was a Starbucks in the terminal I was in, or else I would just freak out. The airport bathrooms was as clean as they come, so that wasn't bad. I basically people watched while waiting for my flight back home. I did see this elderly lady scream, since she won a small fortune at one of the slot machines nearby. Thought that was pretty cool. Too bad it wasn't me though.

BUT, with that said, this can be one of the busiest airports I've been to, and it's mostly because I come in on the weekends, when everyone else is pretty much coming and going to vegas.

But as far as the airport design is concerned, you have to take a tram from certain terminals, depending on your flight...I believe AA, US Airways(now american), and Southwest are definites for tramming it to baggage, but not sure which other airlines.

ARRIVING - be prepared to get into a long line for taxi service.  The line moves incredibly fast as the taxi cab system setup here is second-to-none as far as efficiency is concerned, but the line IS long.

DEPARTING - arrive early, a TON of flights take off around the same time, so security lines can get quite long, but once you're past security, it's pretty much smooth sailing.

McCarran has evolved quite a bit in the many years it has been here in Vegas providing tourists and locals flights to and fro.

Currently I work at McCarran. My job to be undisclosed. I work at the new terminal ""T3"". The new terminal is completely different from the old. It is marble, expansive, long, sterile. It's what a lot of airports look like. But once you understand the layout it makes sense. T3 also offers gambling (although in smaller capacity than T1) and it has numerous restaurants - a chop house, quite a few fast food options, a Starbucks and a Coffee Bean. It is also just a tram ride to D gates which houses many more options for dining and shopping.

Since T3 replaced T2 there is no T2, so there is just T1 and T3. One day, I suppose, T2 will be referred to as some strange place that really never existed *waves hands in an eerie way*. Who knows why they didn't just make T3 the new T2? We'll never know...

As for T1 - it is in dire need of renovation, except for C-Annex and C-Gates, which houses the entire Southwest flights for the airport. A\/B gates are exceptionally old, as is the security checkpoint. The whole thing should be busted up and re-created to look newer and nicer. D-Gates checkpoint is also poorly lit and stinky. The place needs a serious renovation. The actual D-Gates (which is separate from the checkpoint) is a very nice, new cosmopolitan looking establishment.

Parking isn't terrible, but you do have to pay the meters. It's easiest just to time it right so when you pick people up you only have to pay a few bucks. Sometimes passenger pick-up can be a hassle because those cops out there really don't like you to sit around and make you drive around and around if the people you are picking up aren't there yet.

So there you have it - the run down of McCarran.",4,2,2

For starters, we got there at 7AM in our very large RV. My parents were dropping myself and my brothers off near bus parking since we could not go through regular traffic drop off. We had unloaded our bags already and were starting to say our goodbyes when a lady came over to tell us we couldn't park there. We told her we didn't know we were just saying goodbye and then we'd leave. She said okay and walked away. Then 3 guys came up and started yelling and cussing at us right away saying we needed to f*cking move and get out of the way. We tried to tell them that we already knew and that we were just saying goodbye but the guys just got right up in our faces still yelling at us and threatened to give us a ticket. They all ganged up on my one brother and were ready to start fighting him. They weren't even airport security and all 3 of these 40 + year old guys start ganging up on my 20 year old brother. How pathetic is that??

We finally got away and went to check in our bags at American Airlines. My brothers and I were upset already because it was early in the morning and we didn't get to say goodbye to our family because of that incident. My brother and I were already checked into our flight but my other brother still needed to so we waited in line with him while he used the check in machine. We finally got to the front of line to check in our bags and the lady at the front said she couldn't check in one of the bags because it didn't have a bag tag. We told her that my brother had checked in the night before and we only needed the bag tag. She said she was unable to help us and we needed to get back in line and check in again. 
So we got back in line and my brother checked in again and tried to pay for the bag. It printed out a receipt saying to see a cashier. We then got back in line and got to the front again and showed her the receipt. Once again she said she could not help and said for us to get back in line. We asked her what the problem was (ie. did he not accept his credit card or what) and she said ""I don't know get back in line""

Once again we got back in line and then another attendant came over to help. He started checking in my brother again and I asked him if it mattered what checked in ticket he use since he's been checked in 3 times. He told me to choose whatever one I felt like using. We then got the bag tag and were in line to check in his bag. The attendant then told us to get out of line so we could be put in another. At this point we were all very frustrated and asked him why he was moving us out of line. He said it was so we could be in a faster line(which it wasn't at all)

I asked him for his manager or a corporate number because I wasn't pleased at all with how we were being treated. He left and came back 2 minutes later saying his manager was in baggage claim and that they did not having a company number and he told me to go to their website. I had already done that and told him it only gave me an email and I wanted a direct line. He chose to ignore my request. My brother tried explaining his frustration and was asking for help because we hadn't got any and that we needed to catch our flight. The attendant gave a lot of attitude and asked when our flight was. I told him we leave at 9:30am. He gave me a smirk and with attitude said ""It's only 7:50am, you're not in a hurry""
I was appalled at his response and it only infuriated me even more.

We finally got out of there at 8:15am and went to TSE where we were there for another 40 minutes because a lady didn't call someone over for a bag check so she wasn't running the Xray belt and the whole line got backed up. I was waiting near her and another TSE agent asked her why she wasn't running the belt because it was holding the line and her response was ""I don't care, that's not my problem""

Everyone I encountered here was extremely rude and unhelpful. I have yet to call the manager of the American Airline employees and the people outside directing traffic.",2,1,0

After the first worker walked away, my bf found another guy (another 10 or 15 minutes wait) and this one told us to stand in the shorter line because we didn't check in properly. We were finally relieved that someone knew what they were doing. Yea right... Mind you, that short line or the line I was in had no sign of what each line was for. 

We moved to the shorter line which only had two couples. OHH MUH GAWD! We stood in line for 45 minutes. Everyone who came after us on the other line had bypassed us.

It is a very very busy airport and it is full of the ""Clueless"" flier ilk, which can slow down the process of getting through the airport.  Fortunately I am armed with a priority screening pass.

Anyway, everytime I see the line at security my heart sinks.  Yet they seem to never take more than 15-20 minutes.  Contrasted with the efficiency of, say, John Wayne in Orange County where you can expect 45 minutes on a normal day, I would say this is pretty painless.

On the other end, I did a head count of the heads in the cab line on a recent trip.  I stopped at 1000.  Yes ONE THOUSAND.  Got my cab in 30 minutes.  It's a long time to wait, I know, but 1,000 people served in 30 minutes.  Let's see McDonald's match that.

The Southwest terminal, where I hang, is crowded and has few amenities (one restaurant) unless you count the prezels and fast food places as amenities.  Sbarro, echh.  If you have money left over, spend it here on oxygen, penny slots, tacky jewelry and other trinkets and trash.

 There is also a bit of confusion on the gates, where to line up and such particularly around the gates at the end of the terminal

(Note that the majority of my experiences that I can easily recollect have been with Southwest here - Terminal 1.)

+I think the staff is much nicer than a lot of other airports along with overall decor\/presentation. 
+The terminals can be pretty big so be prepared to walk a bit. There are a few ways to get around though including trams and escalators a-plenty just as a heads-up.  
+There are a few charging stations around as well as plentiful restrooms. Everything is also relatively clean. WiFi is available too (although from my recollection, it's a bit hit-or-miss like most airports).
+Have to love the baggage claim area and how big\/spacious it is plus plenty of signage\/screens\/fun people watching to keep you interested.
+After a long time waiting, they finally have ride-sharing apps in Vegas including the airports. Which is great...but...

+\/- (cont'd from the above point) ...do expect it to be a hassle to get to it because of the fights between the taxi cabs and ride-sharing companies. Make sure to ask and be mindful of the signs of where the Ubers\/Lyfts will be. Lots of other options available to get around when you're there though including taxis and shuttles (for specific hotels...again, make sure to contact your hotel to see if they have one first.)
+\/- The restaurant\/eatery list isn't too bad with a mix of the fast food staples (Popeye's) to juice bars\/coffee shops (Jamba Juice) to a few sit-down restaurants. You're not going to find perhaps the best cuisine in the world here but a good variety for what you're looking for. Seating is usually not too bad as well. 
+\/- I'm personally ambivalent to the slot machines all over the airport. Just signifies you're in Vegas. If I'm not mistaken, they have separate\/sectioned off areas if you want to smoke\/play slots too. 
+\/- Lines are a little hit-or-miss depending on when you get here. Super busy on Sunday early\/mid-afternoon but the lines for TSA Pre-Check are solid personally.

It does what an airport is supposed to do. Fly people in, fly people out. Feed you, encourage shopping, slots etc. 
I don't know why people expect stellar food coming from the airport? 
Didn't you just spend a few days go a week in Vegas eating great food? So don't come to the airport expecting the same. 
The process is very easy in comparison to Jfk airport. Smooth security check in. Easy to follow gates, terminals in where you need to go.

I've had the joy of coming through McCarran plenty of times, especially since I've decided it is not worth it to drive to Vegas anymore... and for an airport it isn't that bad. 

When you're departing, I find that security is fairly quick. I've never spent more than 20min in line, without TSA pre-check. The terminal can get pretty long so be prepared to hustle if you've got a gate at the end and running a bit short on time. They've got free wifi, without downloading an app or watching a video, which is really nice. They've got a good variety of shops that seem to be open at all odds of hours and they've upped the number of charging stations available.

And if you didn't have enough of throwing your money away, they have slots available throughout... I'm more a table game sort of guy myself, but I think it's more for the novelty of being in Vegas than anything else. If you've got time to play slots in the airport... refer to my quick summary.

When you're arriving, things seem to flow pretty quickly, though to be honest, I don't ever check a bag going to Vegas so I can't speak to that aspect.  One BIG NOTE: if you're taking a taxi onto the strip. Anywhere on the strip from the Mandalay Bay to the Wynn, DO NOT agree to take the freeway\/highway.  They're gouging you. The airport authorities have taken notice of this gouging and have started to post signs and what not... but they still try. Take Paradise \/ surface streets. It's much faster and cheaper. You shouldn't have to pay more than $20 for anywhere on the strip.

All in all, it's a decent airport... no real thrills or frills... aside from the slots... I would have expected some more lights... some glitz... maybe a little glamour to welcome you to Sin City... but then again... why are you hanging out in the airport in VEGAS?!",3,1,0

They have all the shops and restaurants, all the slot machines making sounds and all the posters of the latest shows. I even like the weird looking giant lizard stone decorations that you pass by before getting into the tram.

As a frequent flier (and what an understatement THAT is) there are MUCH worse airports than this one. And, what it lacks in style, it makes up for in ease of use. 

All the ticket counters are in one place (well, not now that they added T3, but you get what I mean), it's super easy to use the tram, getting to your gate is relatively easy because it's just not that big of an airport. Getting luggage is simple, catching a cab, getting to the parking lot, everything is simple because it's a small airport. 

Now, having said that, it at least functions like a major one. It has a super easy system to get through security. I can get my bag checked, through security, on the tram and to my gate generally in about 30 minutes. That's pretty good. Have you been to Houston? Seriously, you'll love McCarran if you know what I mean.

I can also get my bags super quick depending on the efficiency of the airline which is usually really good. 

I love this airport, I wish all airports were like this one. The only reason I didn't rate it higher is because they have no shopping to speak of, their restaurants aren't traveler friendly and there aren't many of them, and I hate seeing Vegas slots inside the airport when I don't see them in the place I live; only on the strip. Which I never go to. So I can avoid seeing slot machines.

I didn't hear a response but I stood in line and before boarding I asked him again, and his reply was ""you asked me 5 times, I only deal with adults, not kids"" and pointed to the T3 sign. I can take insults but he should do a favor to all the good people of Vegas who work hard to provide great experiences, and quit his job if he does not enjoy helping visitors to his city (i.e. don't undo the goodness of those who choose to do their job!)

When I came back to the airport to get home, it took me nearly 30 minutes to find the car rental return place, had to wait for a shuttle, had to get to security, had to take a shuttle to the gate, then wait. I thought an hour was enough time, but i nearly missed boarding, SMH.

I like the way everything is set up here, especially since they made the ""special southwest only"" security check thru area to go to terminal C. Not once have I taken more than 15 minutes to get through security flying southwest airlines, and most times I walk right to the front of the line (maybe that's cause I'm a smart traveler and book days that aren't holidays or busy weekends, just so I can avoid high volume hassles traveling)

The airport is very centrally located in Vegas, as we all know, it's just south and east of the strip. It's easy to get into off the 215 or from Tropicana if you come from that part of town. They have been going through some expansion issues, and have changed the way people drive into the departures and arrivals area and I think that has made the congestion go way down.

One of the things I love about this airport, is actually not about the airport at all.  One of the reasons I decided to live in Vegas is because I travel a lot and there are always millions of flights in and out that I can choose from and the price is pretty low compared to other airports where I could've chosen to live. Any time I decide to travel I always have lots of options (mostly Southwest and United airlines).

Another thing I like about this airport is that international travel flies out of Terminal 2, which is completely separate but uses the same runways. That keeps the traveler congestion down in the main terminal, which is huge, because this is always one of the top 5 busiest airports in the US every year. 
A quick tip: you have to check in 50 minutes prior to your departure time. I have heard stories of people running late and checking in 45 minutes prior to departure, and the ticketing agent wouldn't let them check in and have made them change their schedule to a later flight to avoid missing the flight. 

The WIFI is free here. The restaurants are all here, whether you want a sandwich, quick lunch, sit down at a restaurant and have a nice meal, sit at the bar, have a drink and watch the game, or just grab a banana or muffin and a bottle of water, this airport seems to have all the choices.

Short term parking is so close to where you need to enter into the terminal. Once through the doors, you are right there by the baggage claim, and right down the way from the TSA checkpoint. I always enter off of Russell, and that makes it super easy.

This last time I had to go into Terminal 1. I took Russell to Paradise, and then followed the signs south to the terminal for American Airlines short term parking to pick up family. I took the walkway across at level 2 (parked at 2M), and was quickly inside with the baggage claim. 

This time, my in-laws used wheelchairs to board and exit their plane. They were wheeled to baggage claim, where I was waiting. The attendants then got their luggage and wheeled them all the way to my car in the parking garage. Once they signed off that they had indeed been picked up by the attendants, we were on our own. I had paid for my parking right when I came out of the elevator, so we were ready to leave. 

I was worried about leaving the lot in the dark, as I was not very sure which direction to go to get back to Russell. There were plenty of signs to guide the way, and everyone else driving throughout the airport property was busy looking for the signs that they needed. It may look confusing, but it really was not. And I am sure that if I had made a wrong turn, I would have been able to get right back to where I needed to be. I stressed all day about getting in and out of the airport at night.

In succinct summation, this place is a zoo. Upon arrival, I expected nothing less than an impeccably clean, glamorous, sprawling entity, much in the same vein as the opulent places that inhabit the Strip. What I found instead was a loud, chaotic, undersized mess of an airport. Sure, there are slot machines (who wants to gamble in an airport?) but all they added was noise and disruption. I can't even begin to imagine the narrow-mindedness of under-building such a linchpin to the Vegas tourism and travel agency and then watching as the road construction, traffic patterns and under-manned ticket counters compounded the problem infinitely. They are making progress by building at new ""E"" gate, which looks to be a monstrosity of epic proportions. However, the current airport reeks of an aged-Vegas. The only bright side was that they managed to put thousands of Monday morning through 15+ metal detectors in a pretty quick time period - the only saving grace that stopped me from bashing this place every way to Sunday. What makes it even worse is that the airport will be completely outgrown by 2011 and now the city is faced with the challenge of continually expanding on the current site or building a brand new mega-port near Primm, nearly a 30 minute ride to downtown. Either way, the present and the future look pretty bleak for Vegas travelers.

It takes a long time to get your bags. It's a long walk to get anywhere. Plus there are slot machines everywhere which annoy me to no end. 

One personal experience led this review to be bad rather than just mediocre. I was on a layover and trying to catch a couple minutes of my illustrious university's football game. I stopped by a small bar and asked if they could switch the channel, mostly because it was basically empty and nobody was watching the televisions at all. The bartender acted all put upon that I--a customer--wanted a game that I wanted to watch on the tv! Imagine that! He was all snippy and acted like I was being super demanding about it. To add insult to injury, one of his coworkers made a derogatory comment about my school which, if you know me, is just about the worst thing you can do to me. So maybe it's small or unfair of me, but that experience made me decide not to give this airport the benefit of the doubt. If that bartender hadn't been a turd, I would've given a higher rating. Go ahead and hate me if you want.

Also, tip from the big sis who lives here: A taxi to the strip should be about $15 and should not involve a freeway. If it does, you're being ""long-hauled"" and you need to call the taxi commission (the number will be inside the cab) and it's a massive fine for your cheating cab driver. So watch out.",2,0,0

To their credit, the employee manning the taxi hub was an absolute pro. He must've gotten 500 people cabs in the time it took us to get through the line. It isn't a pretty job, but he did it with grace, efficiency, and courtesy. For this, I salute you, McCarran Cab Stand Man.

McCarran had the absolute quickest TSA scanning process I've ever been through. I waited for a total of 5 minutes from standing in line to have my id checked to getting my luggage from the machine. I'm sure this was not the norm, but it shocked me.

Luggage pick-up was quick and easy. This is DEFINITELY a pro.

Con: try to avoid any medical emergencies in the airport. A lady went into anaphylactic shock while I was waiting for my return flight. It took almost 10 minutes for EMTs to arrive, which pretty much would've been a day for this lady had the manager of the Pizza Hut-Burger King-Cinnabon not been so proactive and on point with giving this lady assistance. 

The Delta check-in line is kinda ass-backwards in it's quick c\/i to luggage line. You have to walk through the c\/i machines to get to the line. I'm sure this was supposed to work in theory, but they need to move the roping. It's a bad idea.

One would think that the glamor and glitz of Vegas would be matched by the airport, but to be honest, this airport is nothing that what awaits the eye on the strip. Old airport, old feel, old fashioned. The only new in the airport would be the banners you'll find advertising the hottest show on the strip and\/or the hottest technology company's conferencing on the strip relative to whatever Tech Convention is happening during any given moment.

The airport is relatively easy to navigate. At times the airport can get packed, so for all those with 6 AM flights after a long night of debauchery, you might want to just head to the airport straight from the club and pull off an all nighter.

Catching a taxi out to the strip? No problem. The taxis are easy to locate (just outside the terminal) and the long lines go by fast. Be prepared to fork over a good $20-$30 depending on where your hotel is located.

Free Wi-Fi is a big plus, especially when you want to upload all the pictures taken from the trip...but alas...remember that you can always default to ""What happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas...""of course use with caution as word can travel fast.

I am definitely not a fan of this airport for the following reasons:

1) The construction they were doing at the time made it really inconvenient. Wings closed down. Restrooms closed down. Narrow hallways.
2) The airport itself looks pretty run down. That probably why they were doing the construction. To be honest, the places they weren't doing the construction on looks like it needed a face lift badly. I hate to imagine what the sections they were renovating looked like.
3) Not enough seating for the amount of traffic they have at this airport.

* Spacious and very clean
* Free WiFi and great connection

* Ask drivers to not use Freeway when traveling to the Strip: $35 versus $15-20 on the Tropicana route.

I wasn't mean or condescending at all but something immediately set off inside her and she started shouting at me in the cab and saying that it's faster and cheaper on the Freeway route. When I didn't succumb to her bullying tactics she started glaring at me and cursing ""BULLS***, F*** this and F*** that"" She said how I was a cheap New Yorker who had no idea what I'm talking about and had no right to tell locals like her what to do. ""I am glad this is a free country because I can say what the F*** I want!"" She was clearly mentally unstable and I didn't want to be rude back because I was convinced that she could have turned violent on me. 
She also was pulled over by a roadside cop because she ran over cones during her intense road rage. The cop had to remind her to stop the meter, and by this point it's my biggest regret I didn't jump out and tell the cop how insane and rude this woman was! After the cop let her go, she immediately started cursing at him then at me.

While the first thing that you see upon entering the airport after deplaning are slot machines (no surprise), you'll also notice that there are a few eateries, yet not exceptional. In fact, I'm not sure why folks get upset about the slot machines. This is Las Vegas- get over it. I'd be more upset that there aren't enough eateries around, should you be flying a longer distance away to reach here. 

The baggage claim area is a bit of a hike, so I would recommend talking the walking escalator (prevalent in much larger airports). In reaching the ground floor, get ready for that loud noise of the casino advertisements on a huge jumbotron (and it is loud, believe me). Be on the lookout for the outdoor shuttle kiosk on the ground floor, where one-way shuttles are $20, yet $30 round-trip. 

The airline check-in and security terminals run pretty quick. The latter of which seems to be very laid back (unlike Philadelphia's personnel, by comparison). The airport's location is about 10 minutes from the strip with reasonable traffic, so that is hard to beat. 

All the while, flying into here sure beats traveling to Vegas on I-15. Can't really hate this airport, yet I wish that they would add a few more restaurant venues + a larger gate (particularly B gate) to accommodate the increasing amount of international and domestic travelers.",5,4,7

This year I've been in and out of this airport. so I  figure it's time to drop a review on Yelp.  So why is it that every time I have to go through security check, I get called to the side and receive a ""random"" check.  The last 5 out of 6 times, I've been randomly chosen to get an extra extensive security check.  Who said the odds suck in Vegas?  I guess dreadlocks increase your odds, haha.

Pros:
  This place is pretty easy to navigate.  Did I mention I hate the LAX airport?
  Super fast check in.  I've never had a problem
  Lots of places to eat at while waiting for your flight
  Free Wi-Fi that actually works.  Yes !!
  
Cons:
  Seriously, security checkpoint is a joke.  The lines are insane !!
  I'm not a fan of riding the monorail.  It's always crowded and stuffy.
  Okay there are lots of places to eat, but way overpriced.  It's expected.

Verdict:
  Well you don't have much choice now do you?  It's the only airport we've got unless you have your own private plane.  McCarran isn't bad at all though, especially previously having to deal with Ontario and LAX in California.  I don't mind it.  Why 3 stars?  Because of that random security check that I seem to always be a victim of.  They are so profiling!  Dreads and a bag full of camera equipment equals extra time needed. 

Tips:
  Make sure to keep those liquids in a separate container
  Keep the laptops in an easy access area.. you need to pull it out!
  If possible, travel without a belt and flip flops instead of shoes.

The layout of the airport is a little haphazard as the terminals have grown over the years. Fortunately they have connected them all with access available behind the security clearance. Southwest uses the older terminal while international flights arrive in the newest area.

You can gamble at the airport. Many people connect to other flights here allowing them a brief opportunity to lose all their cash. I was one of the few to win money on my last visit.

The food and drink options are average for most airports. There is a Pei Wei and Popeye's in the Southwest area and a decent steakhouse in the international terminal complete with plastic knives. Plenty of Vegas souvenirs though.

Access to ride share apps is though the parking garage requiring a wait in the desert heat. The taxi line suffers from the same fate though. TSA is a bit strict here with the recent marijuana legalization so don't risk it.

You don't really have a choice when visiting Las Vegas, but McCarran does help ensure that you start and end your trip the Vegas way.",14,3,8

Security seems to run well, but waits can still be long--definitely important to get to the airport early.  One thing I like is that they play some funny video while you are waiting--although the video is getting dated.

They have decent selection of restaurants and you can definitely do your souvenir shopping if needed.  You can also gamble--plenty of slot machines so Vegas can squeeze the last penny from you.

when you arrive in the baggage claim hall you find the firsts of the 500000 slot machines you will see in the city!

Full of souvenirs' shops and also full of bar, it's near the strip so if you have a room in one of the casinos on the las vegas boulevard you can go there by taxi for about 20 dollars.
But don't forgot to ask to the driver to avoid the freeway... he can ty to trick you! I've paid from the airport to the Riviera about 40 dollars. TOO MUCH.

The staff here aside from the tsa are, for the most part are friendly and are willing to help out with whatever questions you may have about anything you may have such as where the taxis and busses are. There are also many signs that can point you in the right direction. 

Many people come here from different countries as well. There is a stand for currency exchange. Another neat feature that this airport has and that is a gym. If you need to work out they have a gym that allows you get your swoll on. 

There are many forms of entertainment as well. I have been stuck waiting for my friends and family and have not been bored. There are many ads shown on many super big screen tvs which is great to watch. Also if you are older than 21 then there are rows of slot machines as well that you can play. 

There are plenty of food courts as well that have a bunch of your more common fast food joints such as Wendy's and popeye's. This review gets half a star off because of the price of the food is stupidly excessive but what can you do when that's the only food you can reach. There are also convenience kiosks that can help you which are not as expensive. 

Now the other reason for the next half star is due to getting to the airport. The roadways to get to the airport are so very confusing. If I did not work there I would have gotten lost. The roads all twist and turn on each other. I have gotten lost a couple of times before I started working there and have learned from my mistakes and yet they keep adding more and more roads leading to this wondrous airport. 

They have also finished building t3 which is a new addition to this airport for certain Airlines. I have had the privilege of working there for a while before leaving their employ. T3 is very clean and the decorations are very modern. If you can try to leave out of this terminal. 

Now for the tsa. People always bash on them and I understand why. Passengers tend to group all of them together and I must say that not all of us are mean and messed up. Also you should not believe all that you see in the media. 

To make your passage through the tsa as Smooth as possible please listen to what they say. There should be an officer that tells people what to do before entering the check point. Listen to that person they are telling you how to get through with no problems such as removing everything from your pockets. Do that and all should be good. Also there are tvs with directions as well.  Remember there are no bottles of water so drink them outside the check point. 

If you have any questions you can go ahead and just message me if you need any me questions answered and I will help out with what I can. There is also a lost and found if you happen to have lost something.",5,1,1

Why couldn't they have designed this airport so that you can travel between terminals without having to leave the secure area and go through security again? Security was easy, but this inconvenience results in the loss of a star. Getting to A from D was easy though, as a smooth, modern monorail connected D to the other three terminals.

Yes, when you land here, you are reminded you are in Sin City with all the slot machines to play with and everything!!! So cool, huh? No not really if you lose:(((

Anyway down to specifics, when we got off the plane it seemed like a forever walk to find the car rental place. It was like we were lost walking back & forth if you look at the signs. When we finally got to the bus shuttle lane outside we were on the right track at least.

The car rental place is another story which you can catch on one of my reviews. Make sure you check Yelp reviews before deciding which rental car company you want to go with.  We returned the car pretty early in the morning and had to catch the shuttle back to the main airport.  it wasn't very long wait at all & security checkpoint was so quick bc no one was there!!!

We got to our Southwest gate no problem with all the slot machines all around but we weren't at all tempted to play as we aren't gamblers really. Our flight was on time and got us there on time back to Sacramento.

Would we come back?  Probably so.  I do remember Southwest airlines got us to Vegas in record time like a half hour early but we ended up at the car rental place waiting for 30 minutes so it all balances out...",10,9,9

* Pretty easy going security. I've traveled to Vegas more than I can count and have probably only had to wait more than 15 minutes a handful of times. Somehow...it just runs really smoothly for only having a few lines open.
* Lots of food and retail options. 
* Pretty clean bathrooms. 
* You might have to wait a bit for a cab, but that's only because of the amount of traffic going through this airport. Just take the extra time to relax...since you probably won't sleep for your entire stay.

You can't beat the location of the Vegas airport - it's a quick cab ride away from the strip, and there are many different shuttle companies operating if you want a cheaper ride. The monorail to get from security to your terminal and back again is quick and easy, and baggage takes a reasonable amount of time to retrieve (note: I did not say quick, just reasonable).

The airport in general has a dinginess to it much like walking into Bills or Imperial Palace... Just old and dirty...  It's that type of clean feeling you get from staying in a roach coach: you know it was technically cleaned, but there's still a grimy feel to the entire place.

I guess if you come to Vegas you aren't that worried about the airport experience as you might drunk when you get here and hung over when you leave, but if you do either sober, be ready to be let down because this airport is complete crap.",0,0,0

I have seen it go through endless changes, and I am pleased with the progress. It has become very efficient, and appealing to the masses.
I have been to many airports, and this airport like others can become crowded at peak hours. Most of the time, the crowd moves quickly and it is tolerable. Picking up passengers is alot easier than dropping off. The trouble lies with taxi\/limo\/everyday drivers will just stop their car in the middle lane causing a bottle neck. One change I appreciate is level 2M in terminal one garage is reserved for ride sharing (uber\/lyft) pickup. The airport itself is usually under construction regularly to increase efficiency. However, the airport remains pretty clean. Also, I love that there are so many outlets everywhere. Food can be scarce at times.

It's one of our favorite places to go for vacation. We've flown into McCarran at least 5 times now, and have usually had a good experience until this last trip. 

The issues that occurred happened on our departure trip back to Milwaukee. After checking our bags, we went to go find a restroom. The nearest ladies room was closed for cleaning. However, I figured that it wouldn't hurt to ask the cleaning lady if the bathroom was going to be open again soon. I was hoping to hit the restroom before going thru security. Before I could even ask her my question, she rudely barked ""It's closed!"". Then a half hearted ""Sorry"". Not wanting to lose my cool, I just said ""Whatever!"" and walked away.

The next issue occurred with the TSA and the way they  handled the screening process. We got into one line and proceeded to take off our shoes and place them, our carry on bag, my purse, and other items in the bins. Just as we get to the front of the line, we are directed to go into the line that leads you thru the body scanner. It would have been nice to be told what line to get into from the get go. Now, we are in a separate line from where our belongings are. I am starting to feel anxious, thinking about how easy it would be for someone to grab our stuff and walk off with it. When my husband told one of the agents that things were incredibly disorganized, this guy had the audacity to tell him, ""Well, when you start paying for it, things will be more organized"". It's a good thing that I didn't hear this at the time, because I would have given this agent a verbal what-for. Who does he think pays the TSA salaries, the tooth fairy?! The last time I checked, the TSA is a government agency. Therefore the taxpayers pay for it. People like my husband and I. There was no excuse for the disorganization that occurred, and for the rudeness of the TSA. 

After all of that, we decided that we needed a bite to eat. I saw that there was an Asian restaurant that happened to have sushi. We got in line, and I grabbed two packages of spicy Tuna rolls. Neither pack had a price tag on it. That should have been a clue right there that things were probably going to be pricey. But  doggone it, I was hungry. And I love sushi. After seeing the price for the water, my husband opted to go and see if he could find it for cheaper elsewhere in the airport. Meanwhile, I made it up to the cashier to pay for my sushi. The cashier was very pleasant (a nice change from the TSA agents). She even gave me extra chopsticks and packs of soy sauce. The the moment of truth comes: $22. I knew hubby wasn't going to be thrilled. The first thing he asked when we met back up was how much everything cost. When I told him, he was like ""Are you serious?!"". Fortunately, the sushi was amazing. 

Bottom line: when at the airport, be prepared to pay more for things that you can get for a lot cheaper almost anywhere else. 

We plan on coming back to Vegas again, and hopefully things will improve for future trips.",0,2,0

The problem? The airport is ridiculously huge and spread out.  The car rental center is 15 -20 minutes away from the actual airport and you may need to wait for the shuttle bus to arrive.  Then, if you have to check a bag, it will be another good wait since there are the bare minimum # of people working (at least at Delta).  Next comes the security gates, which if you are going to ""D"", be prepared to walk for awhile.  And they are not in a hurry either.

The restrooms you pass as you enter the TSA line are the last for the next 20 miles.

Also annoying was that my Gate was WAY on the other side of the airport when I flew in from Indianapolis to transfer here and on my way to San Francisco, and I had to drag my tired self & my carry-on there.  Not too fun when your flight's been delayed and you are traveling solo.

Anything smaller and easier to navigate than O'hare is a plus. Anything about the size of Midway with a decent distance to main attractions is a plus. 

I have been to this airport several times now. It's not that big and it is about a $20 cab ride depending on where on the strip you're coming from. 

I have done the shuttle, been picked up at arrivals, and taken a cab. The shuttle sucks. It can take an hour to get where you are going depending on how many other hotels it stops at. Cab and pick up\/drop off are easy to navigate. 

Also, I agree the tram is a bit of a pain, but compared to O'Hare, it's a breeze, so I'll let it go. 

Now the food options are terrible. Note to self - eat elsewhere before take-off. Had to settle for a Burger King sandwich (no shock it's seriously overpriced). Boo to that. 

There are slots in the airport, which is funny and dangerous. If you happen to arrive a bit drunk and are making an attempt to stay awake long enough to get on your plane, they are tempting. I turned to writing this review to keep me awake. I wonder how many spell check problems there will be.

As for the airport, TSA here always seem to have an attitude problem. I always have pre-check, and alot of times they direct me to the wrong line, and when I confront them about it, they either shrug their shoulders, or tell me to start at the end of the right line, which would mean more wasted time.

I have been through this airport quite a few times now and with the help of an awesome VH escort, I have yet to get lost in the airport because of that. I must say there was a time I stayed on the strip and the taxi line around midnight was more than an hours wait! Yuck!

This last experience coming back home left a bad taste in my mouth. I dread going through TSA checkpoints so I always try to prepare myself and belongings to make sure the process is as smooth as possible. I empty my pockets, have my liquids in a quart size ziploc, do not wear jewelry to the airport and have it in my purse, I wear sandals\/slippers that can be easily removed, etc. Simple right? Well not everyone are as prepared and gets reprimanded by TSA. This time for me was sort of like that, except I was in the right.

Ever since I got my Fujifilm instax camera (which is like a modern version of the Polaroid), I have been extra careful with the film and always make sure I have a TSA officer inspect it rather than run it through the x-ray machine so that it does not get damaged. I took my camera and extra pack of film out and handed it over while I politely asked to have it inspected.  The officer tells me that I can run it through and it won't damage. Nuh-uhh, stop right there Mr. Officer! Don't even tell me that after I looked up the guidelines on the TSA website, PLUS have the TSA app on my iPhone that you will deny having my film inspected!

The TSA website states, ""You should remove all film from your checked baggage and place it in your carry-on baggage.  The X-ray machine that screens your carry-on baggage at the passenger security checkpoint will not affect undeveloped film under ASA\/ISO 800.""   

Well guess what buddy, my film is 800ISO. I continue to say it is 800ISO and he tells me that it has to be at least a 1000ISO to be inspected. At this point, I'm thinking in my head ""Brah, don't even let the Waipahu in me come out!"" I don't spend all that money on film to have it ruined because some TSA officer did not want to have my film hand inspected. Then he looks at the box of fim and asks where does it say 800? After searching through all the Japanese writing, I finally find the 800 and he has it inspected by another officer. Does this guy know that my Hello Kitty film cost at least $1 each? I told him I have always asked to have my film and camera inspected and never had a problem. 

This fool should not have gotten certified to become a TSA officer if he does not even know the rules himself. After I finally got him to have someone hand inspect my film, I realized that all of them are rude. This other TSA officer comes out of nowhere and starts yelling, ""You gotta move! You gotta move!"" Jeez, why don't you get more people working at the checkpoint so people won't go in restricted areas when the conveyor belt gets backed up!

After passing the dreadful checkpoint, I wanted to kill time by walking around to the stores and look for some souvenirs. There was limited selection; a few keychains, shot glasses, etc. but they were overpriced and not all that nice. There were a few food choices as well: Pizza Hut, Burger King, and a few bars.

They have one body scanner for both lines and one walk through metal detector.

Tourists trying to find the shuttles that go to the hotels have an easier time getting around (shuttles are convenient if you stay near Mandalay Bay but just get a one way, then take a taxi back to the airport to make sure you get to your flight on time).

There are tons of taxi's, shuttles, and limos outside to take you to The Strip or whichever hotel you are staying at. Taxi's are pretty expensive though - at $17 to The Strip, you're better off taking a shuttle bus at $7 one way, $13 round-trip.

The taxis and buses and shuttles are all on the first floor, with huge over head signs that lead the way. If you get confused, all the floor staff member are extremely helpful, telling you exactly where and how to reach your destination. (Don't go outside to wait around and ask because it's a health hazard out there with all that smoke!)

The taxis are organized and there are lines for everything. I appreciate that quickness and connivence of this airport, knowing that people want to get in and out.

When we arrived, it took 45 minutes for the baggage claim to start delivering bags from our flight.  Everyone was starting to wonder if they lost all of our bags...

However, the real fun started when we tried to fly home.  The TSA at this airport is so bad that it defies all reason. When we reached to conveyor belt for the bag scanning, the moron (and that word does not even come close to describing what an idiot he was) had to have second verification on EVERY SINGLE BAG scanned. Each bag required someone to come over and verify that it was ok to let it through, and each time took several minutes for someone to come over and hold his hand to assure him that not everyone was a terrorist.  As people started to grumble (me included), he would scowl and go slower! Either he was in training (and a weekend in Vegas is the perfect time for that) or he was one of those people that keep the median IQ in this country under 100. 

All the other lines moved at a SLIGHTLY quicker pace, but it took us 40 minutes to get from the start of the conveyer belt to the end. We did however get to listen to the snarky remarks from the other TSA agents about 'liquids' and 'laptops'. 

Then came the came the best part. As I exited the personal cancer-giving body scanner, I was accused of having something in my pockets. After a molestation pat down, it was determined that in fact, I had nothing in my pockets after all. 

So, we got through security (barely) and started looking for the Alaska Board Room so that I could start my emotional recovery from the TSA-man's bad touch only to find out that there is no Board Room in this terminal.  He got to freely cup my junk, and I can't ease my trauma with a cocktail in the lounge that I pay a yearly membership.

Just off the strip, where you can see but not touch the glitz and glamour is McCarron International Airport. Like a shunned cousin it resides on the seedier side of Vegas. 
But when you're coming in, excited for the possibilities that lay ahead, it's easy to overlook the aspects of McCarron that make it easily described as a 'pit'. 
But on the way out, it feels all too familiar. 
Long walks for such a small airport, with a ton of energy expended for no real pay off. It's expensive..everywhere. You know you're hemorrhaging money, but what other options are there? It's shiny, and sparkly, and fun...no, wait, that's not right. That's the airport slots, scattered about to cleverly distract you from the truth. That this place is dirty. Filthy. Existing with a physical and spiritual layer of scum. Why don't they clean it? Wouldn't that make it moderately more tolerable? And finally, for all your wandering through the grimy terminal you're rewarded with nothing more than a plane. This airport has nothing else to offer.  No food worth mentioning. No shops worth wasting time in. Just the opportunity to wander in hopes of something better, something fulfilling, and come up empty handed and broken at the other end.

McCarran is making some upgrades!

Massive check-in area looks fresh and I noticed. 

McCarran is not the best airport out there (I am just being honest), but it appears that they are making some well overdue improvements.

1) parking ...passenger pick up is always a nightmare.  In order to avoid a headache of clueless people I recommend to park in short term parking.  You can wait there and if it's less than 15 minutes it's free!  If more people did this it would actually free up space by the curb for those who's passenger is waiting for their ride rather than the ride waiting for their passenger. When flying I always park in long term parking and pay the extra few bucks to have the convince of getting off the plane and walking straight to my car rather than waiting for a shuttle to take me to a lot 10 or so minutes away.  If you end up tipping the shuttle driver the price is only a few dollars difference.  Completely worth it to park in long term parking. Compared to California LA airport parking prices in Vegas are cheap! So this is a plus but now to the bad.

2) terminals.  Love love love the new terminal.  Hate hate hate the old. The great thing is for us healthy people you get to do a lot of walking.  It seems from parking to ticketing to gate its back and forth and retracting steps. Old terminal very dark. Carpets are old and dirty. Why people think it's ok to allow their kids to crawl all over the floor is beyond me.  The new terminal is much brighter and feels more open.  No carpet there.  This statement is for b and c gates...get more outlets!!!! Charging stations by the bathroom away for the gate is annoying.  Other airports have power outlets in the seats by their gate.  Amazing concept. 

3) food selection.  Guess this depends on the gate so I'm referencing this review for b and c gates.  It's terrible!!! So sick of fast food greasy selections.  I look at the people in line for these places and think ...wow.  Here's a news flash... You will get fat if you eat fatty foods. I did manage to get a yogurt and a banana today at one of the side carts. A good banana too!  First time I saw good quality fruit. See my picture. 

Overall this airport needs to remodel and update.  Hotels on the strip are constantly improving, the airport needs to follow their lead.  The only reason I even gave two stars is for the new terminal.",2,3,1

First thing you notice when you arrived at McCarran International Airport are the rows of slots machine. If you have any doubt about what Vegas is about, that image would put it to rest. Yes, Las Vegas is all about indoor smoking. Then you'll realize that you need to take a train, not to get out of the airport, but merely to another part of the airport. As a preview of your long lines into the buffets later that night, you will be packed with hundreds of travelers not know why they are packed in the same carriage with you. Enjoy the exotic cologne from the equally exotic man standing next to you, my friend, because that's not really his cologne you are smelling. Once you find your way to the exit, you will find service to the strip from taxi, shuttle or hotel limos, because public transportation is highly discouraged by the Vegas authority. It will also give you a taste of getting ripped off before you get actually get ripped off at the casinos. 
On your way out, you will have to maze through an equally confusing airport security line. You may or may not be in the right line, people around you are walking by while you spend what seems like a life time stationary.  But once you got inside you feel a sense of accomplishment, like you've made it, one of the few chosen people who get to fly that day.

Given that it's an international Airport it's safe to say that its bustling almost all year round. Expect long lines, long walks to your gate (that's if you're one of lucky ones) and the occasional rude people trying to get from point A to point B but hating life and affecting everybody else in their path. Although I must say SWA has done a pretty good job at narrowing down the long lines by opening more TSA stands and body scanners.

Because it's the dessert you can almost always count on delays due to bad weather. It's fairly clean for being so busy, many restaurant and fast food options and drink bars to choose from such as Jamba juice, Starbucks, coffee bean, ect., 

You would think that with the amount of traffic that goes through this place  they would be more accommodating  by having more electrical outlet stations but for now you'll have to keep an eye open and race your way towards one when you spot it.

The sounds of people and slot machines are more than loud. None of it is enjoyable. When returning to the airport, make sure you give yourself plenty of time. I have never seen a security line so long. It is bad because of both the amount of people and the inexperience level of these travelers. No one seems to know how to handle the security line.

Flying in to McCarran has always been convenient, but as expected, trying to get a cab can sometimes take upwards to an hour just to get through the line.  This sucks especially much when it's blazing hot in the summer.  My suggestion is to either get a bus\/shuttle that you can prepay, or have a friend pick you up.  

The other option is renting a car which I had to learn the hard way.  There are a bunch of car rental places, offsite, that a shuttle can take you to.  It's easy, and only about a 10 minute bus ride.  Follow the signs.  HOWEVER, beware, there are some car rental places even FURTHER away.  To get to them you have to take the car rental shuttle to the car rental building, and then hop off and on a DIFFERENT shuttle to the other car rental places.  If you're in any type of rush (going in or returning the car), factor this in and check where your car rental place actually is.  Typically the lower budget ones are the ones that require two shuttles.

Leaving McCarran is pretty simple as long as you know which terminal your airlines is at.  There are two and they have different entrances.  Your taxi driver should know, but if not, you should check ahead of time. 

I've generally not had any issues flying out of McCarran.  There were a few times that the security line was ridiculously long, usually on Sundays, and it can take 45 minutes to get through.

So, they move a bit slower and they get confused because they are unfamiliar.   But the airport does a great job of moving them in and out of where they want to be.    The flights tend to be on time, but a small hiccup can take a long time to clear out due to the huge volume of people coming in and out of Las Vegas.   
Like most airports, there are plenty of places to grab something to eat or drink.   They even have an oxygen bar to help you recover enough for your flight home.   The security lines actually move at a decent speed, so that's good.   I am bummed they moved the car rental lots away from the airport to a central rental center a few miles from the airport.   It adds a little time to process of travel, but it reduces the overall traffic.   Also, on the positive side, they do offer free wifi, but I find the wifi to be hit and miss.

No wonder it took a good ten minutes for the plane to park at the terminal after landing (LOL). Upon my arrival from PDX to LAS and stepping into the new terminal, I didn't recognize where I was.

+ New facility
+ Helpful staff (will give you directions if you're lost)
+ Easy to get through TSA
+ Ample room for seats (some handicapped seats)
+ Some slot machines if you want to gamble
+ Bathrooms are equipped for you to place your luggage in the stalls

DIRTS
- Driving around can be confusing for the ""passenger pick up"" - make sure you read the signs if you're going to pick someone up from Terminal 1 or 3. In addition, you may have to pass through Terminal 1's passenger pick up to get to Terminal 3's passenger pick up. 

Terminal 3 is quite modern and I'm glad LAS got an upgrade for this area. It's a tad of a further drive from the usual Terminal 1 (which I think needs an upgrade), but nonetheless for any domestic flights, you'll be passing through Terminal 3.

It was a flashy airport, which fits into Vegas quite well. Flying in, the view of the desert and the strip is actually quite pretty. I think that was my favorite part. 

There are slot machines in the terminal, and they actually paid off for me. I enjoyed it, and it was a nice way to pass the time. If I traveled more, I'd actually like to see them in more airports. I could see that as being a really good way to make money for the airport. 

Going through the TSA screening is actually easier than when we left Eugene. I found that interesting. Not all airports have the same technology, apparently. So they look at different things. My mother's wheelchair and iPad had to be triple checked leaving this airport. Nothing else set off alarm bells for whatever reason. But those were the two things they were interested in for us. 

There was an employee there, I don't know her name or even her title, but she was amazing. My brother dropped my mom and I off at the airport, and drove to San Diego. He didn't go back to Eugene with us. So when we were unloading the car at the airport, he went to ask someone for help, as I had my mother in a wheelchair and two bags to contend with. I needed about three extra hands and I would have been OK on my own. Lol. 

This woman comes and helps me get everything situated, and walks us through the entire airport, until she parks my mother and her wheelchair at the terminal gate. She even had to go through the TSA process with us. This was THE most amazing thing I could have ever asked for in terms of assistance. Basically one of us pushed mom in her wheelchair and the other dealt with the bags. She was more than happy to stop with us, as mom had commented that she wanted a bottle of water. Never impatient. It literally felt like she had the entire day to get us through to where we needed to be and was perfectly happy to spend that time with us helping. 

I have no complaints about this airport. The employees are incredibly helpful, TSA screening was pretty painless, and I thought it was all great.

Well, leave it to the fine people of Las Vegas to bring those very same design principles to McCarran International Airport. 

Yes, this place is disorienting, noisy, dank, and run-through with a mild seediness that reminds you of the city it serves. The hallways are dark and carpeted in a pattern reminiscent of Superfly's tie or Edith Bunker's chair. The airport is now smoke-free, but the air (somehow) isn't yet so. And, of course, the noise of slot machines fills the hallways, even if half of them seem to be out of order. 

But the high rolling unpleasantness of the airport was to be found in the ""Directory"", which was just as disorienting as the ambiance. I tried to find a place to get a beer and pass the time. But a few of the bars and restaurants listed in the directory were no where to be found, neither on the map associated with the directory or in the airport itself. And then there were at least a few venues that actually did exist, but that didn't appear in the directory. (See my two photos, one of which shows a sports bar (""Home Team Sports"") with the directory in the foreground, and the other of which shows the listing on that very same directory, where the bar is nowhere to be found.)

We were flying Southwest from Las Vegas to Milwaukee, and had the worst airport experience of our lives. We arrived over two hours early, to be met with what looked like a reasonably sized line at check-in. In a few moments, we realized that the line abruptly broke off and wrapped around the back of the building. We made our way to the end of the line, but, 45 minutes later, when we reached the point where the line split to make way for people entering the building, a shuffling mishap by a security guard caused us to get turned around on the way to the next part of the line. 

When we tried to explain what happened to another security guard, he thought we were trying to jump ahead in the line and sent us to the back. We tried to explain what had happened, along with the ten people with us who had also gotten turned around, and he refused to listen. We wound up back at the end of the line.

We missed our flight, and when we explained what was happening to the check-in attendant, she told us that we could fly stand-by, but that it was unlikely we would get a flight today, because they were overbooked as it was. She said that for an additional two hundred dollars a piece, we could guarantee a spot on another flight, and in the future, we should get to the airport more than an hour in advance. When we told her when we arrived, she said that it was impossible that we had been there for two hours, because the line was only 45 minutes long. We showed her our taxi receipt, and she got on the phone with her manager, saying that we had ALLEGEDLY gotten here two hours earlier and had been to the back of the line multiple times due to an ALLEGED mishap. 

A manager finally came out, looked at our receipts, and okay-ed the sale of the tickets at no additional cost, but the attendant rolled her eyes and used the world ALLEGEDLY about seventeen times. Taking a half hour to resolve our issue no doubt held up the line even further, and caused other people delays in their travel. 

Meanwhile, as we were waiting, the disorganization of the line allowed multiple people to jump to the front. Overall, an incredibly frustrating experience - and not one I will be repeating again. In the future, I will be flying out of Vegas carry-on only, or on another airline.",0,0,0

1) Slots right there in the terminal. Actually, I find this hilarious. You can't wait until you get to the Strip? You have to start plunking your money away as soon as your plane lands? Jeez.

Ok on the plus side there are a lot of food and shopping options inside the Las Vegas airport. You can find something to eat and drink and they even have oxygen bars. 

My issue though is the overall layout is a little too crammed and there needs to be more seating. The slot machines are awesome, but they take up a lot of space. During busy times all of the regular seating gets taken up and you can't sit in any of the tons of empty slot machine seats unless you're playing one. 

I encourage you to take a look at a map and the signs if you are catching a connecting flight. When I flew through last week I started running to catch my next flight at a gate that was a much higher number than the one I came in on. Little did I know the other gate was just around the corner from where I was at due to the funky layout.

Those who know me, know that I love to travel.  Hell, that's why I have a job that entails 90% travel.  Because of my job, McCarran is as familiar as the back of my hand.  Bad example, as I haven't seen the back of my hand in quite a while.  Until now.

This airport presents quite a quandary for my ratings system, as it's really 3 airports in one.  First, there's the Check in Counters\/Baggage ClaimA\/B\/C gates.  Then there's the D gates, Lastly, there's Terminal 2, which houses international flights, which I will not review because I've never used it.

Check in Counters\/Baggage ClaimA\/B\/C gates:  Dated.  Classic Vegas surrounds you, with reflective ceilings and dark purple colors.  Slot machines EVERYWHERE to line Michael Gaughan's pockets.  Food options are bleak.  Baggage takes a while to reach the carousel, partially because of union workers and partially because of the size of this place.  At least they pay attention to priority stickers and get them on the belt first.

D gates: brand spankin' new.  Love it.  Food options are better here, as well.  It takes a tram ride to get here.  Also houses the only airline club in McCarran; a Continental President's Club.  Try to fly American, Delta, Continental\/United, Frontier, and Allegiant to get your ass in this terminal instead.

Overall, McCarran was once at the forefront of airport technology. First, they introduced a universal system that allows for check in on any airline.  Then, they were the first to offer Wi-Fi throughout, a marvel for its time.  In it's heyday, it was the place to be.

Now I pine for newer technology and a renovation of style.  I hope for US Airways to resume their night hub operations here and build a new airline club in the A\/B gate areas.  I wish for phone scanners at all security checkpoints for mobile boarding passes.

One of the things that bothers me is how early you have to make your way to the airport if you want to be on time. Especially if you have a rental car to return. I find the time needed to get from your hotel\/home in Vegas to through security and at your gate, is much more time than at other similar airports in other cities.

Gates can be somewhat far from check-in, or take a long time to get to after security. The rental car complex is FAR from the airport and adds at least 30-45 minutes to your trip to the airport. I can only imagine how many hungover tourists have missed their flights due to not factoring in the car rental return time. This is a pretty serious miscalculation on the part of an airport that is so especially focused on the tourist ""what happens in Vegas..."" crowd.

On my last visit, I put $5 in the slot machine at the gate for my departure (I don't usually gamble at all, but I was headed back to Canada and thought it would be as good a chance as any to get rid of my small US dollar bills...and hey luck is luck right?)..

I almost, if not always have flown in at night into Vegas, which always guarantees you awesome views of the Las Vegas strip all lit up in millions of neon lights as your plane descends into Vegas.

As soon as you step foot off your plane, you know you have arrived when you hear your first sounds of slot machines just steps away. Don't stop here, this is not the Vegas you have come for.

From your plane, depending on which airline is either a quick people mover ride or if your lucky, just a ride down an escalator to baggage claim and steps away from the taxi lines\/shuttle busses ready to wisk you off to your hotel.

If your flying in solo and not in a big rush to get to the hotel, your best bet to save some $ on cab fare is to take one of the many shuttle buses outside of baggage claim. You'll pay somewhere in the range of $6-$7 per person each way taking a shuttle. Be ready to make a few stops at other hotels before reaching your own.

Arriving to LAS is very easy because it's designed to get you out to the casinos as soon as possible. Departing from LAS is another thing. Yuck! This is one of those airports where you will spend an ungodly amount of time waiting from line to line to get to your gate. Mind you, this is on a typical weekend in Las Vegas, where it's generally crowded. 

Las Vegas is getting pretty big. I see that they're improving their airport by expanding it, but we will see if that will actually help with the fact that their TSA workers are slow and their food options suck.

I have had heard true stories of cabbies ripping people off when arriving in LAS. DO NOT HAVE THEM TAKE YOU ON THE 215 to take you onto the strip. Tell them to take you straight to Tropicana, which is in the front of the airport about a mile away. Going on 215 adds about 4-5 miles to your trip and about $10-15 away from your gambling money. 

Yeah this place sucks! There are going to be people sitting on the floor (maybe because they drank too much somewhere in vegas). There weren't even enough spaces for people to sit!

Security was pretty lax. I forgot to take off my belt but I went through just fine.  

Airport food options were plentiful though probably questionably healthy. I saw Popeye's Chicken on my way to my terminal. There were also a gazillion newspaper stands. I did appreciate the charging zone where they had a strip of power outlets for you to charge up your phone or plug in your laptop.

1.   This has got to be one of the BEST places to indulge in my secret pastime of people watching. It doesn't matter what time of day or night, there are always INTERESTING folk either coming or going into Vegas. There is also an over abundance of celebrities (A-list through D-list) and in January, the airport is overrun with porn stars in town for the annual AVN Awards.  
2.   McCarran has continually evolved; adding amenities not found at other  airports (hello, there is a 24 Hour Fitness center on site), some pretty decent cuisine (Blue Burrito Grill, Gordon Biersch, Uno Pizzeria, Wolfgang Puck Express),  and a plethora of places to get loaded while you wait to catch your flight back home. The Jose Cuervo Tequileria is a favorite.
3.   The airport is surprising neat and clean (relative term) compared to other places such as O'Hare, LAX, Hartsfield, DFW or Denver.
4.   If you are in a gambling mood and want either one last shot at the big money, or are just arriving and can't wait until you get to a casino, McCarran has slot machines EVERYWHERE. For some reason I found the ongoing chant of ""Wheel of Fortune"" strangely comforting when waiting for my flights. 

NOTE:  Just a hint for those out of towners, though.....I lived there for 5 years and never heard of anyone hitting the jackpot at the airport.

One downside can be the long waits in the security lines, but then again, this IS an airport in one of the most visited destinations in the world.

When buying the ticket I also made sure to put that mother would need special assistance getting to her gate. Jan 5th 2016, approximately 8:30am I receive an email saying that my mothers flight got cancelled, and the next available flight would be for the following day same time.  When I spoke with representative I again told the guy to be sure to annotate that my mom would need special assistance because she has early ONSET Alzheimers and would get confused where the gates were.


Jan 6th I we checked our bags in with Francesca, who I would describe to be  medium size possibly Caribbean or African descendant. She told me that I can walk my mother to her gate; however, I told her I needed to get my ID out of the car and was going to be right back. When I returned Fran was not there, another lady gave me my boarding pass. My mother had a ticket in her hand as well. 

Once we got passed security point we went to the gate number that was on my mothers boarding pass. A lady that I didn't get the name of rudely told us we were at the wrong gate and that we needed to go to gate 14. Once we arrived at gate 14 I saw Francesca and explain that I there was a mistake because my mother I had the wrong gate number and asked if our planed left already. Fran immediately cut me off and said obnoxiously ""DON'T YOUR REMEMBER MY FACE (using her hands as she speaks) IM THE ONE THE CHECKED YOUR MOTHERS BAGS IN AND I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG . YOUR MOTHER WAS GIVEN OTHER TICKETS ......  So I asked my mother........  my mother finally pulls some tickets out of her purse, and said im sorry I forgot I had these tickets in my purse. Little did Fran know that my mother has alzheimers and that's why I put special assistance when I bought the ticket. Fran should have explain everything to me and not my mother when I left to get my ID.  

After being fussed at in front of everyone at the airport I pulled the lady aside next to Fran and explain that my mothers has Alzheimer and although she looks young and perfectly fine she doesn't remember many things and it takes a long time to comprehend what people say to her. Keep an eye on my mom because if the plane changes departing time or gate number my mother would get lost and not know what to do or how to get there.

Liking the fact that picking up passenger arrivals veers the driver toward the parking structures; again separate from the departure traffic and taxis etc.  Makes sense too if you've left your car in long term parking.  Basically it's strictly compartmented as far as the flow of the masses.

An ultra sleek, ultra modern airport that is a true destination for all travelers and tourists alike. There are slot machines all over the airport, so if you fancy getting lucky right when you arrive or right before you leave, you have to option to do so. You wanna get your shopping on? No problem, some high end shops to your variety gift shops can satisfy even the avid shopaholic. There's restaurants and massage shops, those don't really go hand in hand, but I just wanna mention it. 

Just like any other airports, the TSA is there to keep the airport secure, not to annoy the living crap out of you. Come prepared, remove all metallic objects from your pockets and make sure your shoes go on the belt. The TSA is not annoying for making to go back and have you remove whatever metallic that set off the machine. They're annoyed at you and so is the people behind you waiting their turn to go through those metal detectors. They came prepared, so why are you such a noob? Don't like it? Your other alternative is to get in your CAR and DRIVE or take the BUS.

The airline employees are there to get you from Point a to b. Not to ruin your day because you decided to fly that day. Something happens, gate change, mechanicals and security sweeps doesn't happen because captain YOU PLANET showed up. It's a necessary thing for you to get to your destination SAFELY.

This airport is a real treat. It's a Vegas in its current state, even when you come back sometime in the new future.

The concession stands in the middle of the walkway were mostly eateries or snack vendors. I do appreciate the many charging stations, which can be found near the gates, but also in the waiting areas near the check-in counters.

Unlike others, I found the TSA checkpoint for Terminal C straightforward and the officers friendly. If you signed up for TSA Pre-Check, line up on the far right line; you will see the pre-check sign. If you did not sign up for the program, go through the regular line. You need to remove ALL items from your pocket, take off your shoes and belt, and remove your laptop from its bag (it must be in its own tray). Moreover, you are responsible for pushing your belongings towards the conveyor belt; you cannot go through until your belongings do. If you have unopened drinks or snacks, please consider donating them to the USO instead of throwing them away. There are bins where you can drop them off near the check-in line!

To reach baggage claim after arriving, follow the 'Red Line' signs, which leads you to the Red Line waiting area where you take a 30 second ride on the tram\/people mover. The attendants on your flight should tell you which baggage claim area to go to, but if you forget or they don't tell you, just remember which flight you came from. There are screens on top of each baggage area displaying recent arrivals. If you arrive late and your baggage is not on the carousel, check the area right outside the information office. There will be labeled suitcases sitting outside which all unclaimed baggage from an arrival right behind it. 

If you have a ride waiting for you, good for you. If not, listen up--you have a few transportation options. You could either take public transportation (buses) to your destination by following the signs near baggage claim, or you could take a taxi, shuttle, or limousine. Stretch limo drivers may either be parked or driving slowly with a piece of paper hanging from the passenger side door listing the fee the company charges. For taxis, you have to get in line, which tends to be very long. However, the line moves rather quickly depending on how many people you are with and how many are in front of you. There are also shuttles. One way is $9 while a ""round trip"" is $15. Keep in mind that these *do not* go directly to your destination; it has multiple stops as if you just rode a bus.

Hotels on The Strip *do not* have their own shuttle to pick you up from the airport. I know, it sucks--but that's how it works here. If you opt for a taxi, expect to pay around $28 to $40 from the airport to whichever hotel you're going to.",1,0,0

The biggest section seems to be baggage claim, and it's the only place where you'll find a large collection of people wandering around in confusion.

Piece of cake!  And the strip is very close to the airport if that's your thing.  There are tons of people ready to whisk you over there for a small fee (or a large fee if you want to go there in style).  It couldn't be easier.

I'm confuzzled!! I went to the airport bright and early on Monday morning. I had a feeling that it would be rather crowded. This was very much the case. I checked my bag in through sky cap with SWA.  That was the easiest part.  i went into the main airport building, as directed and went to my left. not only was i directed back outside but i was also herded with the rest of the cattle through some strange maze to get upstairs to the 2nd floor where I still had to go through the madhouse of people in the security check point lines.  while trying to make it upstairs, i was separated from my travel buddy. I waved bye to them and then rude as ever, the airport staff member said in a very rude tone, ""Are you with them? Why didn't you say anything?"" I explained to them that I wasn't sure what was going on and that I didn't think it would matter much to him if I was with my buddy or not. I was only trying to play by his rules. He scoffed at me, pushed me through and told me that I should have spoken up. Oh well. While I was upstairs on the 2nd floor awaiting my turn to make it through bag inspection and what not, all of a sudden the lines were halted and a drug sniffing dog was sent through the line. that took a while.  Some people made it through the check point with only 7 minutes before their flights took off, because of this ""new security measure implementation"" that just HAD to take place when we were the next in line. Ugh!! I feel like a lot of what they were doing was just so ill planned and it almost caused several people to miss their flights.

Although I avoided the line of TSA, Pre-check had something else for me. My carry on bag had to be checked.

The one problem with this airport is, unlike JFK or LAX, you have no idea where you're going. When you pull in, ur directed into either terminal 1 or terminal 3. Most of the main flight usually arrive to terminal 1 but I would check because quite a few do arrive to the 3. Once you get to the proper terminal, it gets divided into short term, long term, and pick up. Pick up is manned so no way you'll get to hang out until whoever you're picking up comes out. They'll brush u off in a second. Easiest way to pick up someone is to go to the short term parking. Rates are not too bad. $2 per hour. Take your ticket with u to pay when you leave. Once inside, it's also confusing as you have to find the flight arriving by destination it left from, then find the proper terminal for the company. Which again isn't lined up by name or anything but by a letter and a number that you have to go find. 

We got to the terminal and the furthest u can go is TSA and their metal detector.

Now my issues.  The tram is ok in the one terminal, but to get to the other gates it's a bit of a hike.

The moment the head of the flight crew announced, ""Welcome to Las Vegas,"" a bunch of people starting hooting and yodeling for joy, and camera flashes went off like there was a paparazzi stalking a celebrity on the plane. Thank goodness it was not Britney Spears because there were no leather seats. In fact, I did not see a first class section. Point is, everyone was drunk and in good spirits around 10:30PM.

How drunk? By the time the flight attendants were half way through beverage service, they were out of orange juice and vodka. I did see a stash of Jack Daniels bottles left on the cart. Gross.

Continuing on... The good spirits translated to passengers' eagerness to deplane and get their game on. There was no time to pause and look for signs for the shuttle towards the baggage area. Otherwise one would be trampled by the moving herd of people. The entire airport was crowded and noisy, and I could only follow the herd to my destination. It was nice not to think and just follow the veteran Vegas mob.

While going down the escalators, a middle aged guy saw a large poster ad for Celine Dion's concert and shrieked, ""Celine Dion!"" And since everyone was in good spirits, the crowd chuckled at him.

Then we arrived to the baggage claim area. I thought I was going to pass out. The place was packed like sardines. There were several rows of people backed up from the edge of each baggage claim carousel. How the heck was I going to be able to see if my luggage came out? Miraculously, I picked out my luggage within 10 minutes.

Then came the taxi stand. There were well over 20 taxi stalls, and the line was like a line for an amusement park ride, snaking around at least 5 times, with a half hour wait. It was a good wait to scope out the meat market. And even with this long wait, no one got belligerent or obnoxious. People were really in good spirits.

Overall, I felt like I passed by 10,000+ people in that hour time span I spent from arrival to the taxi. I am impressed with the efficiency and organization of McCarran International Airport. The staff really has the place under control. Granted these Vegas mob scenes only come a few times a year, the airport and staff were able to control the crowd and get them out to their money hemorrhaging destination in a jiffy. This efficient well-oiled operations machine is why everyone was able to maintain their positive spirits. I heard no complaint and saw no pouty faces from anyone. Other airports should model themselves after McCarran. In addition to a worthy Yelp review, there should be operations case studies written on this airport.",0,1,1

1. There's a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf near the C gates. 
2. It's close to the Strip, but not as close as you think. There are a ton of stop lights that will come between you and and the hotel casino driveway. 

What I don't like: 

1. When you get dropped off at the airport, it's a total free for all in the departures area and you need to pay extra attention that you don't get hit. I watched, over the course of a week, several near collisions between man vs. car, and it wasn't pretty. 

2. For an airport that small, I wish things were built a little closer in. There are only 2 terminals, and one is used WAY more than the other. The gates that serve Terminal 1 are so spread out that you have to take the tram. Ugh. 

3. There are *maybe* two de-icers on site, so when it snows (like it did during the week we were there), the airport cannot function and will close. Bummer if you're scheduled to fly. I was not, but two days later, an interesting thing happened. First flight of the day, and the aircraft had been sitting overnight. As a result, there was ice on the wings. We had to park in the sun to melt some ice, and when there wasn't enough sun on one of the wings, what did we do? We repositioned the aircraft to the sunnier side, of course. You can't make this up. We killed an hour and twenty minutes waiting for mother nature to do her thing and melt the ice. Hell, I'da climbed onto the wing and scraped it off with a credit card if I were allowed to. 

All in all, ticket lines seem to move quickly when you're checking in, but those screening checkpoints are another thing. The lines were awfully lonnnnnng for those. 

4. I also don't like that the majority (a huge majority) of the hotels don't provide a shuttle service to the hotel. You have to take a taxi, which can run you about 15 to 20, depending on where you go.

Not because it was fancy or nice (cuz it's mostly not), but because they have slot machines by the gates!  Certainly beats just sitting around (though it's potentially quite a bit more expensive...).  I even remember telling myself that ""if I were to ever have a long delay, I would want it to be here"".  

Fast forward years later and I realized...I wanted to kick my own ass for jinxing myself.  A nine hour delay and a terrible hangover will do that to you.  The food vouchers we were given helped, but there weren't a lot of appetizing options near our gate to spend them on.  A sub shop and Starbucks were just about it.

Fast forward another few years and I was pleasantly surprised to see Virgin America had been moved into the newly built Terminal 3.  Needless to say, it's a huge improvement and much more appealing to fly in and out of - better dining options, spacious and clean, and a ton of outlets for charging devices.

Since it was built detached from the main\/older airport terminals though, splitting cabs isn't as convenient as it used to be if you're not going to the same terminal.  There's no direct access by foot between the two and the cab fare going from one to the other runs about $5-10 (though there's a shuttle between the two).  Seems pretty crazy to me!

Once your past the checkpoint there are many stores, bars, and restaurants to choose from. All the employees working at the stores always seem to be super friendly and in great moods!

One reviewer asked why the cab drivers take you out to the freeway to go to the strip, and seemed to suggest that they were doing it to increase the fare. Just FYI, it's because Las Vegas Boulevard (aka The Strip) is frequently backed up, so going out to the freeway is actually faster, especially if you're going to the end of the strip farthest from the airport.

Now you have to take a ticket and get in and get out in less than 20 minutes to avoid having to pay.

Regardless, I am still a fan because it is an incredibly hassle free airport that can get you pretty much anywhere in the world on a direct flight. It's clean. I rarely have to wait in security for longer than 30 minutes; weather rarely delays flights, and the stalls in the bathrooms are just the right size to accommodate your carry on without having to accidentally swipe the edge of the toilet with your Samsonite. I absolutely despise when that happens! And besides the super short term (waiting to pick someone up), there are plenty of reasonable parking options. We often use economy parking when we go on longer trips. Yes, you can play a slot machine here, but I never have. 

However, it is definitely not fancy, and the food options are pretty much the pits in every terminal. If you can avoid it, do not arrive at McCarran hungry, as more than likely you won't be happy with the available solutions.

- No free recharging! The wall sockets are limited to those that are ""pay per charge"" and are very expensive.

- The rental car area is offsite, you need to catch a bus to another building. IMPORTANT: Not all rental companies are open 24\/7! The last two rental cars were from Sixt & Fox and both are offsite.. Sixt is only 400m away, but closes at 24:00!

My biggest gripe is the passenger pick-up area Nazis who won't allow us to stop for even one minute to wait for our guests. Yeah, I guess it's their job, but I wish the airport would put some effort into making this easier for us instead of forcing us to drive in circles around the airport until our passengers arrive. If there's a designated waiting spot for cars I've never seen it.  Short term parking can be a mess & it's  hassle to pay at the kiosks.

Taxi lines are ridiculous sometimes, but thank you Uber! It's a breeze to call you & meet you there.

Security lines are also sometimes long & frantic.

Now checking in, my dumb taxi driver dropped me of at arrivals, so that he wouldn't be stuck in the Sunday afternoon departure line.

I called him telling him I was scared there were thugs that were lined up to ride with me on my way home to NYC. It was right after 911, one of the first flights. He said just think of them as hero's.  He said they are not going to let the plane go down. It helped a lot.

The airport itself is rather large and confusing because there are multi levels and signage isn't that great.

Pro Tip: The Uber and Lyft pick up spot is in the Parking Garage. You have to leave the airport and get picked up on the ""Gold Level"" of the parking garage.

Pro Tip Two: There are two security checkpoints. One for Gates A, B and C and one for Gates D and E. You can't go to one checkpoint if your gate is in the other and they aren't accessible from each other. Luckily there is a Port of Subs Sandwich location in both Gates B and D so I didn't have to have a meltdown.

Security is OK. Baggage claim is OK. Restaurant selection is OK to poor because there isn't many! I was disappointed to see when I flew in at 10:20pm that everything was closed already and the only food available was in the snack shop. Lame!

+1 more star for the fat dreaded dude with braces who asked me who my new wife was, and when told, proceeded to ogle her like a piece of meat before gurgling a monosyllabic note of approval... What the hell, I'm feeling generous!

+4 stars for making us wait in a crowded terminal with hordes of coughing, hung over zombies for three hours while every conceivable flight from anywhere to everywhere was canceled due to mechanical failure.

+2 stars for actually letting us get on to an airplane before sending us back out to rot under the tender glow of a billion gently pinging slot machines.

The bars are plentiful a few of them are very good and they serve decent food.  You can also smoke in the bar and that is so great I can't tell you how great it is. God Love Las Vegas!!

The tram makes it easy to get around, the signs are clearly marked and there are always enough screeners to move the line along. I have been so exceptionally hungover that I thought waiting in the line would kill me...but Las Vegas understands that...they know you...they know that you are a degenerate...they know that you have lost a part of your soul and what you need is a drink or a smoke and maybe a few pulls of a slot machine.

What are the detractors?  Let's start with the security line.  Even thought there are three terminals the design of the airport creates long security lines. I have had to weave back and forth though the que many times.  You definitely need to leave enough time to get through security here.

Second is the taxi que.  While I am impressed with the efficiency of the loading process the taxi line is another exercise in turn style madness.  The line can be very long winding you back and forth through the madness while luging your bags.  This last time i did an Uber instead, but they have made it very hard to find the pickup location to deter people from avoiding the taxi line.  Still doing uber the next time I go, it is so much better.

On the plus side:

The videos at the security check points are great.  TSA or the airport actually took advantage of the creativity and talent of Las Vegas and made some great videos about going through the security, which you have plenty of time to watch and you wait in line.

It was a Tuesday evening at 8:40 PM, but the airport was quiet, calm, and navigating to baggage claim was a simple escalator ride down. Perhaps this is a fairly small airport? I'm so used to larger airports and having to go down and around, and down again, just to get to baggage claim or ground transportation. After sitting on a fairly long plane ride, it's nice to have things smooth for a change. 

Found it funny that there were plentiful slot machines at the baggage claim area -- to gamble while you wait, Lol. It is Vegas after all. 

Another highlight is that there was plenty of seating everywhere in baggage claim. In all airports, there's seating, but I've noticed it's far away, and you can't really sit and watch for your luggage as it comes down. Over here there was up close seating and it was so easy to watch your carry-on stuff while keeping an eye on the moving baggage wheel. 

Grabbing a taxi was also fast and streamlined. We saw the trusty shuttle box office, but we wanted to get to our hotel faster and make the most of our evening. Taxis were all lined up and waiting for people to arrive. Cost $22 \/ 10-15 minutes later we were rolling up the Bellagio entrance. 

As for departing from this airport: Late night fight at 12:20 AM, so the place was super quiet, lots of places were closed, which was unfortunate if you were hoping to grab a meal there. It was also technically Christmas evening, so things might close a bit earlier in general. Burger King was open at the Jet Blue terminal, until 11 (normally close at midnight). In the gate seating area, there were, of course, slot machines. Had tables\/seats with a lot of outlets, so if you get there early you can  easily waste time on the laptop\/phone, or charge electronics. Free wifi made the waiting even better. Staff was friendly as we checked in our bags, but the TSA agents, or one in particular, was awful. Rude, and flat out made fun of people who asked questions or were confused. 

Overall, this airport has been one of my more positive experiences with flying\/waiting at the airport. While it is a lot smaller than bigger, more popular, international airports, I feel like it was never crowded or chaotic (other than some security lines, but that's always the case) I didn't have to fight anyone for outlets, wait on long bathroom lines, or weave around masses of people\/little kids\/strollers.

Flying in:
Flight delay got us there late. We were surprised to see the rows of slot machines all over the airport. The restroom was clean. The walk to baggage claim was a bit long. When we got to baggage claim, we had to wait for an hour for our luggage due to a malfunction on the carousel. After we got our bags, we headed out to find a taxi. I did not expect to find over 100 people in line for a taxi, but the staff kept the line moving well. After 20 minutes we got a taxi to our hotel (Luxor, about $24 bucks trip).

Flying out:
We found out we could take a bus to the airport (from in front of Tropicana hotel). We flew Southwest, so we stopped at the Terminal 1 stop. I was surprised by how large the check-in area was. It took us a little less than 10 minutes to walk from the bus stop to the Southwest airlines check-in. There was no one in line, so checking our bags was very quick. I had my boarding pass on my phone and the scanners at check in were having a hard time reading it. One of the Southwest airline reps came over to help me scan it and after about 20 attempts it went through. I would say that this experience was the fastest bag check I've encountered. During security, we got routed through the pre-screen line, so security was a breeze. Once we got into the terminal, I was surprised to see how many people were there. It was difficult finding seating, so we sat in a couple empty chairs in a nearby area. There were tons of restaurants and fast food places and various little shops. Every space was taken up by a shop, restaurant, slot machines, or a charging station. This has to be the most dog friendly airport because I saw almost 10 dogs being led on leashes inside the terminal. There were no comfy chairs...at all, so we were terribly uncomfortable. A lot of people were sitting on the floor, and some were even laying on the floor (which looked disgustingly dirty). There were only a couple of power outlets in the airport and they were all full with people sitting on the floor next to them to use them. I found it odd that they didn't place any outlets near the seating areas. We got moved at the last minute with a gate change, but the staff seemed efficient and kept us updated every step of the way. During our waiting, we did play some slots - there weren't really any good ones and they weren't very loose, but it was fun to sit and play while we waited.",0,0,0

Yes, there are slot machines if you are waiting for your flight and\/or want to win some money outside of the Vegas Strip. In terms of food, no, I am generally not a fan of airport cafes and restaurants only because of their high prices and that doesn't translate to quality food either.

The layout of the airport itself can be confusing at times and traffic in general can also be a nightmare at times, especially with all the cars, busses and taxis passing through. Also, you have to take one of the shuttle busses to get to their consolidated car rental center, which is about a 10 minute ride. On the other hand, if you're going from the rental car center back to the airport, you have to make sure you catch the right numbered bus, since one of them goes to the international terminal and the other to the domestic terminal and obviously you don't want to delay your travel time by like 30 minutes or so.

When wrapping up my second time doing sightseeing in and around Las Vegas, my early afternoon flight got cancelled due to mechanical issues with a plane, so that forced me to stay an extra two hours until the next available flight back to home. I would like to see more seating at all the gates and overall more room to manuever, and again it's because of the high volume of foot-traffic that passes through on a regular basis. There are a few charging stations throughout the airport, but I think they need to add them at all the waiting areas and gates since the existing stations are always busy and there are a limited number of outlets and seats. Better yet, after spending quite some time in Vegas (and not even gambling, partying or drinking), I think I just wanted to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible, but as mentioned above, that wouldn't happen right there and then. The free wifi was rather inconsistent, at least while I was waiting (unless it was my laptop that kept freezing and having technical issues).

If you're a gambler; this will be the best airport you've ever been to. Hehe If you need to park you car at the airport it is 16\/day OR 8\/day in the economy lot. The Economy lot is located outside of the airport but they have a shuttle that will take you to terminal one ONLY. If you need another terminal (let's say terminal 3) then you will need to grab yet another shuttle to the next terminal. The economy parking is outside but looks safe.

Here's the reason for my review:
PLEASE try your very best to NOT have a medical emergency at the airport. 
Your help will not arrive in time.

I was sitting across from an elderly lady as we were about 45 minutes before boarding our flight.
I got up to use the rest room, and all of a sudden the people around her (and the lady's daughter) started panicking.

It appears the elderly lady began having what appeared to be a stroke.
Her eyes rolled back, they could not ""wake"" her, and she was in a catatonic state.

One of the Allegiant personnel called for help.
I am not certain that she actually called 911 or just for airport security.

Then she walked around casually and slowly asking if anyone had medical training.
I understand not panicking as to cause mass hysteria in the airport....
However, the rate of snail speed everyone was going was enough to cause the anxiety.
No one seemed to care that this woman was hanging on by a thread.

FINALLY....
20 MINUTES LATER, This ladies help finally arrived.
And yet again, NO RUSH, They basically crawled to her.

As with any medical emergency, time is critical.... these airport firefighters seemed to have all the time in the world and had zero cares for this lady or her life.
Being witness to this was very nerve racking, and I have been a witness to many emergencies in my life.

When I think about this trip, I really pray that she made it, that she had no long term affects from her emergency. 
And sweet Georgia Brown, I pray that I never ever ever have to rely on the LAS airport security OR emergency services for anything in my life.",3,1,0

There's a ton of construction going on at Departures near American Airlines - or there was three weeks ago when I last flew out - but things change quickly in Las Vegas. 

Anyway, my last experience was great until arriving at TSA Pre Check, which is usually easy-breezy. One particular female agent had a real stick up her a$s and made a big production of waving me to a different line even though I was literally the only person there at the moment. Ok, whatever. Then, at the scanner, a guy was causing some kind of ruckus asking for a Supervisor. Seriously, for what? Anyway, I was hand carrying a poop emoji donut from Pink Box for Scott, and asked them not to smoosh the canvas bag down, which they promptly did, even though ""Get Me a Supervisor"" Guy had held up any movement. We all survived, sadly, the donut was indeed smooshed. 

D Gate, where I'm usually flying out is well appointed, houses the Centurion Lounge, has a cute Vegas themed gift shop (but check others for Las Vegas only items, I noticed Alex and Ani has exclusive bracelets), a Starbucks, Rachel's Kitchen, and a variety of bars, restos and shops. There's hand sanitizer outside the restrooms , and I was pleased to see signs in the ladies room stalls offering help to Human Trafficking victims, a huge problem in Sin City. There's good wifi, sufficient plug in space (I think, I'm in Centurion Lounge as long as possible before a flight) weird for a 24 hour town, if you ever fly in at night, most everything is closed. 

*** note: the lines for TSA can be crazy long, and usually those leaving LV are not as ""festive"" as the reverse. If you don't have Pre Check or aren't flying first class, allow extra time. Seriously. ***

I'm sorry I lied. I am always late but today I was here at 7am for my 9 am flight. Since I was early I decided to sip my coffee and  people watch for about 30 min. 

Then I went to security to go to my gate in Terminal C. Usually when I come to McCarran Airport  the security are rude and yell and have no patience with anyone. This time around though they were so pleasant! They greeted me with a smile and  told me there names referred me to some pubs and restaurants in Indianapolis. We all became nice quick friends. As I waved and thanked them for their lovely hospitality I began to search for my phone...

IT WAS GONE

Trying to be mature about the situation... I freaked out.  I ran back to my new friends and asked them if they had seen my purple iPhone. No one had seen it. One of my new security friends Clara helped me by calling the operator. Not two seconds later the intercom came on saying 

'ATTENITION ALL PASSENGERS IF YOU ARE MISSING AN IPHONE CALL THE OPERATOR!"" 

Clara contacted the operator and told her I was coming to get my phone. What excellent customer service! 

After receiving my phone back I had a few minutes before my flight began to board
To see what was in Terminal B. 

There's plenty...from the 1980s. The terminal is extremely outdated with about 5 places to eat. It smells funny and everything is extremely cramped. It was uncomfortable to say the least. 

In conclusion...Terminal B security is great ...Terminal B is not.

Tip

1. Hope you get to fly out of terminal D! That is the latest and greatest in airport luxury
2. Don't forget your iPhone unless you become good friends with the nice lady named Clara.",0,0,1

This is the place that begins and ends the majority of people that show up at Vegas - and like the town, it is designed to take your money.

Firstly, and I find this interesting - why is it located right down the street from Las Vegas?  To me, it seems they could have put it further away but on the other hand, it makes the time between getting your bags and getting out and gambling amazingly short.

Banks of slot machines everywhere - sort of has to be that way I guess - but they even put the damn things where you drop your rental cars just in case you had some spare change you didn't want to fly home with.

Big airport befitting a town that relies on chumps from all over - and in that respect, it gets the job done of moving hoardes of people in and out of town in a hurry.

Terminals were clean enough as were bathrooms - so at least that is a bonus.

I find McCarran to be a pretty clean airport overall. It doesn't look worn out like some of the other airports I've been to and it's quite spacious.  (If anything, I see a lot of wasted space.)  Their tram running from the terminals to the baggage claim is efficient and pretty easy to follow.  It's a pretty easy airport to navigate.  You really can't get too lost here.  

Parking at the airport is metered parking, which can be a good or bad thing.  You're in a shit if you have to run out and feed the meter because your bags haven't arrived yet.  

All in all, arriving at this airport is exciting.  Shute, waiting in the gate area before you board the plane with other Vegas-bound passengers is exciting enough.  The sad part is when you're leaving Las Vegas.

Word has it that they're extending the monorail to McCarran, and it can't happen fast enough. 

Speaking of trains, the best argument by far for building the bullet train from Anaheim is undoubtedly McCarran International Airport.

The security checkpoint on Sunday afternoon is not an improvement over the taxi line. You're crammed in with several thousand other hungover visitors, winding around nearly every corner of the airport.

Also, the cab line on a Friday night used to be a nightmare; this time, instead of waiting thirty minutes, we got a taxi right away.

This place has been a thorn in my side for a long time, though.  One year they had a blackout.  A blackout in an airport!  Who ever heard of such a thing?  Another time it rained and flooded the runways; about 90% of the flights were delayed or cancelled.  I was forced to spend an extra night in Vegas (and not the fun way).

This year, one of the two trams was broken, so we had to wait a few minutes.  My friends who arrived earlier in the day said that there were huge crowds waiting for the tram.

I told the operator what had happened and if she could see if anyone that worked there was in that area and could check for the phone. She told me they didn't have the personnel for that and proceeded to say all she could do was do an announcement over the intercom for whoever found it to dial the extension I was at. After about 10 minutes of waiting by the phone that never rang I tried the operator again and ended up giving up on getting any help from the airport staff.

I wanted to undo my impulsive act of stupidity after realizing I wasted my money gambling, of all places, in an airport!  Who truly wins in an airport?

   Airports are very important. Besides their primary purpose of serving air travelers, they are a gateway to the city. Airports give travelers their first and last impression of the city. They are a reflection of the city.

  McCarran is a first- rate gateway to Las Vegas. Going back to the 90s, when I flew between McCarran and New York airports, it left me with a positive first and last impression of Las Vegas. It is a reflection of the good things about Las Vegas. It is upbeat. Coming off a long flight, there is nothing more cheerful than hearing the bells of the one-arm bandits. To this day it is a welcoming sound after ending a vacation. Like Las Vegas, McCarran is modern. The monorail between terminals is one of the first to be used at an airport. Recently McCarran replaced the international terminal with a brand new state-of-the-art facility. Like Las Vegas, McCarran features plenty of fast food restaurants and Starbuck's. The list of fast food restaurants keep growing. As far as Starbuck's, they are at the majority of the terminals and even outside security at baggage claim.

Coming into McCarran is fairly easy, but the taxi time is usually substantial and the walk to the baggage area can be long. Signage is mediocre and sometimes hard to follow...especially when trying to find the taxi stand.

Speaking of the taxi stand, it is massively long, but well-run and quick for the amount of people being shuffled through. There are little-to-no smoking restrictions outside of the airport, so persons waiting for a taxi are often subjected to second hand smoke. The people watching is amusing, though, so maybe it's worth it. Watch out for cabbies that take you the long way to the Strip, though. Vegas needs to get control of that.

The food offered at McCarran is chain-based and underwhelming. Bathrooms are surprising large and relatively clean. There are charging stations in a few places, so that's nice, but the chairs are uncomfortable. The chairs are fine, but you are subjected to the noise from the many slot machines in just about all areas of the airport. I have never liked this.

The day that I could be magically transported into my seat inside the plane and avoid check in, luggage handling and security in any airport or the ""Hey, haha look slot machines"" from tourists at the Vegas airport, I may five star an airport.

There are two terminals you can fly out of T1 and T3. T2 I am not sure if it even exists because I have never seen signs for it. I am almost positive it hides in another dimension. T1 is the older terminal and just driving through drop off can cause temporary Tourette's even with the sweetest of people. T3 is the newer terminal and drop off is like a pleasant Sunday drive in comparison with T1.

Depending on your airline, you may have to take an air tram to your gates so give yourself enough time. Other than that, this airport is pretty simple to navigate and has the typical restaurants, last minute shops and slot machines for those who just could not get enough Vegas. 

The people who work here really are a hit or miss.

The slots at the airport do have the best odds compared to casinos because they want you to stay in Vegas but don't spew to hard.

Traveling through McCarran Airport is like the warm-up lap for the tourists. Miles of slots machines, bars every five feet, and stale recirculated air. 

PROS:
- Moves fast. I've flown Southwest, Virgin, and Delta out of here and the airport does a pretty job at keeping everything moving. 
- Tons of Kiosks for ticket check-in
- Space! This place is huge and you never feel cramped. 
- Drinks. Feeling sad or getting ready to party. There's booze everywhere! 
- Taxis. There's at least fifty here at all times. 
- The new terminal is gorgeous and easy to access. 
- Great views of Strip as you fly away or fly in. 
- Slot Machines. Thanks for paying my taxes all you non-locals. 

CONS: 
- Traffic. This airport is near the Strip so traffic can be crazy. Get here early!
- If you're late the lines can be staggering. 
- Dealing over eager drunk tourists. 
- Dealing with hung-over and broke tourists.
- Drinks. Like I said before bars ever five feet. I have definitely missed a flight or two because of cheap drinks at the bar. 
- Not a 24 airport. I think flights stop at 11pm. 
- Slot machines. The loud ""woohoos"" and ringing of those ridiculous money making machines.

It's the airport. I favor Terminal 3 because we use it the most. We travel at least every other month Virgin out of T3 but I fly back towards the East using Southwest in their Terminal. 

I eat before I come and never eat here coming back. I have purchased things at Hudson News like organic dried fruit and snacks. Other than a bland salad I highly doubt they have any vegan food options. 

I love how the Terminals have slot machines. Hey in a city that has slot machines in gas stations...why not dump some money in these slots too?

Flying into this airport at different times it is always clean, well staffed and there is plenty of room on the tram you have to take to baggage claim.  The baggage claim is always quick to pop out bags, even if there is a line for car service or cabs it moves quickly and everyone is pretty helpful in lending information for you to find your way to where you need to go.

Flying out of this airport is a breeze compared to other places I have flown out of.  The security checkpoint has everything down to a science and the lines move quickly.  There are plenty of shops to grab your last minute souvenirs and even restaurants or grab and go options open late; there was even a healthy place still open that I was able to grab a salad, banana and juice smoothie at 10:30 p.m. before my flight.

On my flight out I noticed there was a gambling spot with slot machines, walled in by glass, and allowed smoking in it.  Well Viva Las Vegas for all those peeps who need to get in some last minute gambling or take a few drags before their flight home.

The only problem flying out was that when I was in the waiting area there weren't any phone charging\/laptop charging outlet stations like you see everywhere else.  There was some outlets on the floor but, they were pretty sparse.  Luckily I arrived early enough to charge my phone so I could listen to music on my midnight flight home.  We also had the security alarms go off while I was there and a person come over the loud speaker saying an alarm had been tripped and to remain calm while they found the reason the alarm was sounded.  Um we all kind of looked at each other with the should we be scared and run face?!?!  Then a minute later they came across the speaker telling us everything is fine and to go about our business it was an accidental alarm.  Way to give me a heart attack at 11:00 p.m.

In terms of arrivals, the baggage claim area is huge and it's easy to get to your ground transportation needs.  There's also always a lot of taxis around, which helps a lot.  The buses to the rental cars also come fairly regularly so that's another bonus.

SITREP

These days, an airport is MORE than just an ""airport"" (ie. a hub for arriving & departing flights):  they are small, self-contained cities that - ideally - provide all the necessities and amenities for the traveler forced to spend considerable downtime at the airport in between connected flights.

It's gotten to the point where McCarran is more about itself, and what money it can pump into it's own coffers, rather than considering the comfort and business needs of those travelers.

THE SETUP

First off, let me say right here I am NOT a fan of the slot machines.  Not because I think they are a waste of time AND a waste of money, but primarily because every time I come back through McCarran, the ""acreage"" of slot machines seems to be taking over the airport's floor space, growing like ill-kept WEEDS.  

It seems the terminal space is diminishing, more dense crowds you're having to walk through because those dam slot machines are encroaching over into every space.

ASKEW PRIORITIES - TOO FEW AMENITIES FOR BUSINESS TRAVELERS

What's really disappointing about this turn of events is the fact that the priority is not placed on the business traveler at all:

* Too few phone charging stations
* Too few computer stations
* Too few outlets, PERIOD

The reality is, some of us don't have a choice on how long we are forced to wait at an airport.  So we see value in those airports that understand the metrics of those of us who need to keep business connected.

RATING

I'd love to downgrade this rating to one (1) star, but I am forced to concede that this airport has Free WiFi at least.  So they get another star for that.

THE LOWDOWN

 So it would seem with respect to us - a rather large segment traveling patrons who are the bread & butter of airports like Atlanta, Phoenix and this one - McCarran is one of those airports that has it's priorities askew.",26,20,18

Finding my way around is not difficult.   Finding a happy airline attendant is.  It is a very difficult quest to find a happy employee at this airport.

If you are parking here, I'd suggest the express lots.   They are cheaper and have a shuttle to take you to the airport and back to your car.   Tipping the driver can bump their mood up and they might even talk to you on the way.... sometimes.  Either way, tipping them to load and unload your baggage is a nice gesture and expected.

It's quick and easy to check-in with the airline, not as much with security.   They always have a very long line and look at everyone as if they are criminals.   I'm happy with strict security, as this keeps me safer .. but the random pat downs (I get chosen every stinking time) get pretty personal.   If you are a woman, expect to have your bra line brushed, any underwires double checked as a hand moves across your entire breast area.   Your crotch will be subject to the same exploratory examination by the TSA hands.  They have those controversial x-ray machines that all but makes you nude on their screen .. I've been randomly chosen for that as well.   Just know your privacy will be invaded and try to see the positive side that you aren't the only one and it just might keep you safe.

Once you are past security, there are slot machines, plenty of eating establishments, souvenir shops, clothing and even book stores.  You can dine in a sit down restaurant, or be herded through a line that assigns you a number to listen for.   They have charging stations for phones, but plenty of outlets if you look for them and have the charging cord.

Shuttles are used to transport to gates and from one terminal to another.   There are also people movers (or moving walk-ways) and escalators.   Elevators and stairs are also available.

The food choices here are average. They've done some renovation to try to make the airport better but there really is not anything memorable about this place at all other than the slot machines that (seriously!) take your money.

It's about a $20-25 taxi ride to get to the strip, so if you're on a tight schedule beware, as traffic may fluctuated depending on what time you're getting in.

I guess if you're intoxicated this might be an okay airport but if I had to be here for longer than an hour for a layover, I think I would cry myself to gamble at the slot machines scattered throughout the airport.",1,0,1

The baggage claim GRINDS MY GEARS every time. It's insanely slow. Be prepared to wait awhile for your luggage to come around. I've been to numerous airports, even third-world ones abroad and never dealt with a delay such as McCarran's.

The airport is clean and modern, I'll give them that. Especially the new terminal they added on but there's little to do there since every place closes quite early considering it being Vegas, where places are open 24\/7.

And the staff? Very slow paced as if I'm on lortabs or something. There's no energy throughout the airport making people uneasy to wait for their flight to get the F out of the airport.

-Clean
-TSA efficient and quick
-Airline Ticketing:  efficient and quick
-Plenty restaurants, but usually quick stuff.

-Easy airport.  Really hard to get lost here.

-The Celebs.

-Parking is expensive after 3 days.  But the same everywhere else.

-On the way in, the ""Vegas Baby"" crowd

The signage is really bad, so you gotta know where you're going when you're driving there, I will say that.  They don't tell you which terminal you want to go to for your flight, and you have to cut across a lot of lanes to get to the right area.  I'm a local, though, so I know where I'm going.

I also really like that when I pick people up, I can park in the short-term area of the garage where they're metered.

To be honest, I can't even assess whether this is a small or medium sized airport. It could even be large. I can't tell because there is lots of stuff to do. If you have a layover but you're someone who likes to press his or her luck there are slot machines throughout the airport. No Whammies!!!

Why am I not rating this five stars? If you have to switch between terminals you must enter security again. If you don't have TSA Clear or a similar service this is not much fun during busy days. If Vegas is not your destination you can find this rather aggravating. There are trams but it will lull you into a false sense of calm.

When deciding on an airport the things you should consider are:
#1 Do you have a choice in airports, in most cases, unless you own your own plane the answer is no.
#2 How is the parking? At Mccarren, it's easy breezy. $14 a day for long term, and the garage is only a walkway away from the terminal.
#3 How is passenger pick up? At Mccarren, it's pretty easy. Traffic is rarely backed up to the point that cars can't get through, and even though they say no waiting, everyone does and it doesn't seem to cause a huge problem.
#4 How is the drop-off? At Mccarren it's like playing frogger with the taxis. You have to have a little patience and it's best to keep to the far left lane until you're close to your airline.
#5 How is the Check-in service? If you're carrying on it's great. There are kiosks all over with every airline in that terminal all in one. Print your boarding pass and go. If you need to check your luggage you may want to consider skycap - there are a couple of counters for each airline and the lines there seem to move fast.
#6 How is baggage claim? At Mccarren, you have to check the monitors frequently. They will often change up which carousel your bags arrive on - I think they do this to see who started their drinking on their flight in.
#7 How is security? At Mccarren it really depends on the time of day but it's usually not too bad. If you are flying 1st or business class they have a fly-by lane. But there are several security lanes and the line seems to move fast.
#8 How are the restaurants and shops? Mccarren, really has a little of everything. If you're craving it, they have it. Starbucks, Pretzels, Pizza, Nachos, cigars, chocolates, flavored air, etc.

What else should you know about Mccaren? Terminal 3 is all international flights plus Alaska, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Sun Country, Virgin and United. It can be a bit confusing if you haven't flown in or out of it before. Both terminal 1 and 3 have trams that can take you to the gates, but you have to pay attention to the signs when leaving terminal 3 or you'll end up at the wrong baggage claim.

LAS Airport has plenty of eateries and places to spend money, gamble, or waste time waiting for your flight. If you have extra money after leaving Las Vegas, keep it in your pocket! These slot machines don't tend to be winners. :(

Rental Cars are offsite and about a 7 minute drive. To get there, you go outside of the Arrival Zone and stand in the shuttle line. It's always very very long, but don't be intimidated - it moves fast! I hope you reserved your car ahead of time, because you will pay sky high premiums if you don't and good luck getting a car.

Why add fuel to the fire? Because I can....**

What does that have to do with the review though?

I am one of those guys that love airports, and to have to give such a bad review based on what I experienced the other day, my god. Maybe there is something wrong with me lately, everything has been annoying me half to death... but then that's a personal problem.

Anyways to why I despise picking someone up from this airport. See most of the time there are signs to direct you to terminal X for said airlines to pick up your person, and yes it exists... for Terminal 3. Now I know its easy to assume if it doesn't show up on the sign you go to the other terminal, but as I checked the flight my relatives was on, it said Terminal 2.

Now this is one of the things that really irked me. No sign for airline Southwest at the passenger pick up, and no Terminal 2 sign... what the f....

Where the hell do I go then? Turns out they do come out of the passenger pick up area, Thanks McCarran Airport for telling me where they are going to be.

Also you have to pay very careful attention on where to go for passenger pickup. I swear I wasn't drunk, and I still ended up near the roof of the parking lot because I missed one of the exits for the passenger pick up...just great. Least I didn't have to pay for short-term parking.

Maybe I'll fly into the airport and give it a better review then, but for now if your going to pick someone up, if the airline isn't Terminal 3, it's the passenger pick up area... and follow the signage carefully, or else you'll end up in ... China and have to find your way back.

Some notes on what to expect 
1) Outlets are very sparse on the concourse - don't expect to be able to charge your devices.
2) There are plenty of outlets available to provide power to the hundreds of slot machines in the center of the concourse.  Do not unplug a slot machine to charge your phone - I don't think the slot attendants would be understanding of your power needs.
3) McCarran is one of those airports that have a train that takes you from the gates to the terminal.  Leave extra time to get to and from the gates.
4) Casinos do not have free shuttles from the airport - ya gotta cab it.
5) The cab line looks daunting, but moves very quickly
6) Even though you can see the strip from the airport, it is probably going to be about a $20 cab ride. (With tip)
7) There are few - if any - airline lounges in this aiport.  However they do have a lounge - Club  Las - that is open to the public for day passes.

First off a big thumps up to whoever thought about putting up free Wi-Fi throughout the airport. For me this is a HUGE plus as you don't have to pay some ridiculous fee for an hour or two of Netflix while on a lay-over. The recharge zones are a necessity and save me the effort of hunting down outlets or unplugging vending machines so I can charge my laptop. The wait for security has never been more than 30 minutes for myself and the staff is pretty friendly. Food options are average at most of the terminals, so bring a snack or eat beforehand.

Whether that is true or not is up to what you read, I guess, but it makes sense for this story. After contacting the airline and the police, we were told that we could make it through security, but it would be tricky, and to arrive two hours early.

So, we showed up three hours early. Being Las Vegas, it's both very hot, and very booze-soaked. I had been nauseous throughout a lot of the trip, why, I still do not know. Something to do with the heat, the eat, and the alcohol turning everything sideways.

VIVA LAS VEGAS!!!!!  Ok, now that I have THAT out of the way, let me tell you how my time here went....

For starters, I few southwest, so I came in and out of the same terminal both times. The second time I was here, I noticed that they are building (or have built) another terminal.  Interesting.

On first impressions, I thought ""wow, this place is kind of small compared to other places I have been"" and totally not what I was expecting for Las Vegas. Phoenix's airport is 10 times bigger, cleaner and has a ton more restaurants' then this!  Even Detroit's new airport is bigger!  pfft.

There were some places to shop at, but the airport seemed to be overloaded with slot machines.  I've heard about this before, but still thought it was kind of cool to actually see in person.  I could even see them from the airplane once we pulled into the gate!  The downside?  Lack of seating while waiting for your gate!  I would have rather had a few more seats if you ask me, and for as busy at this place is, I would have liked some additional chairs!  So many people here!

They had a few places to eat in here, but again, I didn't see many places to sit. The terminal was long and skinny, and I didn't have enough time to wander and study the whole thing.  I love that I was able to get off and go right into the smoking lounge without having to buy a drink. It's literally right between gates C6 and C8.  Awesome!  Slot machines in there too!

The staff I interacted with were friendly, outgoing and what I would expect for Las Vegas. Not uptight, but not overly laid back either.  Definitely fun, that's for sure!  

This airport isn't bad, and serves it's purpose. Hey, I've seen some smaller crazier airports in my day, but really I wish they would step up their game a little bit. How about if instead of 900 commercials everyday about visiting Las Vegas, you pump it up at the airport? 

If I come here again I might rate it higher, but for now, a solid three stars.",3,1,1

Security is not much of a hassle. During the weekends, more lines are open to accommodate the weekend flyers. Don't expect any more than one or two security lines to be open during weekdays!

The walk to the gates is not too horrible. I usually think of it as a scenic walk if my gate is at the end of the terminal. The flashing lights coming from the slot machines make it a little better as long as you don't waste your money on them!

There are a huge number of place to get a bite to eat. However, don't expect any stores to be open after midnight. Despite this, there are plenty of vending machines to satisfy whatever your needs may be while you wait for your flight.

There are also a bunch of charging stations that come in a variety of forms. Some are on tables, some are in booths, and some are on the sides of couches so you can charge and have a comfortable seat at the same time!

The family decided to go to Vegas for a bit over the winter holiday. I arrived in T3 on VX and had to meet my family flying AA in T1. My arrival was great--T3 is gorgeous and there are plenty of things to do (slots), eat, and even see (Welcome to Las Vegas signs all over). The facility is new and everything makes sense. Luggage was slow but not inexcusably slow.

Then I tried to get to T1. It's a long walk down a hallway and then into a white bus that just says McCarran Airport. Could they get a sign that says ""Terminal Shuttle"" so they didn't have people asking the driver every 10 seconds? I got to T1, though which was a joke. After getting off the shuttle, I walked into the ground floor of the airport and took an escalator up. Naturally that escalator didn't serve baggage claim, so I walked around and took a second escalator back down one floor. It made no sense. In addition, T1 is dated and plain ugly. Again, luggage was slow but not absurdly so.

Getting to the rental car was a joke. We ended up in a line of 100+ people waiting for a bus. Finally they figured it out and sent extra buses. I have never waited in such a long line for a bus to a rental car facility. The facility itself is very nice and everything flows well.

Departing via T3 was fine--security took all of 10 minutes and I was out after a short delay. Really, T3 is 5 stars, T1 is 2 or 3, and the ground transportation is a 2 or 3.",1,0,0

It does weird me out that there are slot machines, and I'm a Vegas native, but hey tourists need their fix! It gives a whole new definition to ""elbow grease"".

Depending on the airline you might have issues with your baggage claim, so check the reviews on the baggage claim in conjunction with the airline before you book your flight.
I prefer getting dropped of rather than parking, it's much more convenient.

I've only had one tram experience, which was odd, so I made sure never to take that airline again. Otherwise, I get dropped off at my airline, if I'm checking a bag I can do it curbside and be on my way. McCarran was one of the first airports to have curbside baggage check, the other airports are just now catching up. Normally, to avoid any frustration I just carry on unless I'm traveling for a show. 
The walk to the terminals on departure are quick. 

When landing, you might be a little confused about the baggage claim area, but like I said, use your eyes and read. Reading and following signs help. If you cannot handle looking up and reading a sign, you can always use Google since it has an airport map that you can zoom in on and even find a water fountain.

The lost and found are very friendly, and never had an issue with TSA which is usually only about a 5 minute wait unless you're an idiot and fly during peak times, or wear\/ bring something you know they will stop you for.

I love how almost everything is automated. The view of the Vegas skyline when landing makes me always happy to be home again. 

If people complain about the McCarran Airport probably has never been to Guadalajara, LAX, or an airport in India. The San Diego Airport finally got a face-lift, thank goodness! Now if they can only make more clearly defined departure and entering signs for the roads they would be up to the McCarran Airport status.

Still, the drive-in isn't as pretty because they don't have the art that McCarran has.
Especially love all of the statues supporting the art scene in Las Vegas that most people don't know about. 

I love looking at all the city\/state\/country flags proudly flown with a bronking cowboy statue before I leave my hometown.

While the signage to bring you to where the shuttle is is clear, the actual frequency of shuttles is a nightmare.

Bear in mind that my unit of measure for airports is far different than I would use for, say, a restaurant. Airport suck, even under the best of circumstances, so it's more about degrees of bad than anything which could be construed as good. 

McCarran is always busy no matter what time of day you happen to be arriving or leaving, which should not come as a major shock since it is Las Vegas after-all.  Vegas naturally always has it's huge flock of the typical drones who show up to blow their money and brain cells, but there is also nearly always several conventions going on at any given time taking advatage of the vast amount of facilities for this purpose. Everything from some mundane business conference (like mine), to the united transsexual Satan worshipers of America will be duly represented and sporting ID badges. So yeah, this airport is always packed. 

The airport is also VERY spread out. So depending on which airline you happen to be on, be prepared to walk a country mile to get to where you are going. I would get used to this if I were you, as chances are high you are going to be walking a ton anyway while you are in Vegas. Some of the hotels require a damn near half mile trek just to get from the cab stand to your room. 

Security and TSA has always been a nightmare for me flying out of McCarran. An hour wait is about the norm on a good day. So make sure you show up good and early and that your phone is decently charged so you can waste time while waiting to make it through the line that snakes around about 50 times before you will see the light of day. 

If you end up stuck here for awhile, there is not as much to do to kill time as you would think for an airport in Vegas. There are slot machines of course, but non-fast food restaurants are in short supply, and the few they do have are fairly sub-par, even by airport standards. This makes little sense when you consider some of the finest dining available anywhere is only a few miles over on the strip. 

The positive aspect of McCarran is that on arrival you are likely excited to the point that many of these minor inconveniences are not very significant to your positive vibe. The flip side of the coin is that when you are leaving McCarran you are probably hung over, pissed off and sitting a few G's lighter in your checking account than when you arrived.

Also, once landing in Las Vegas, the place is tidy, uncrowded, and mellow.  Signage is clear, bathrooms are clean and lines move quickly.  The only downside: a very long (albeit fast-moving) curbside line to grab a cab.

Passenger Pick-up- If you're in Terminal 1 then you are about to hate life. This is the busier terminal and they are crazy about not letting people stop (even if the person you are picking up is standing right there ready to get in the car). Terminal 3 is much more tame and will be easy.

A good first impression for visitors and fairly easy to come and go for locals.  Long lines can be a problem if you are traveling during the holidays.  But this is typical for large airports.  I like that it is very near the city and easy to catch a cab even when it is busy.  Lots of fast food options on both sides of security.  In the age of no food service on the plane you can pick something up to take with you if you want.  Parking is pretty good with a big garage that is costly and distant parking on the cheap.  The main thing that makes it popular here is that it is the only one unless you fly on a private plane.

I would have given this airport 2 stars, but I like this airport because of the slot machines and people watching experience.

With that said, there's a good amount of inexperienced travelers that will hold up the TSA security line. I wish they would add more lines to accommodate the crowd. Taxi lines are horrendous and could take up to an hour of waiting. The tram can get crowded to and for some reason, when you are running late, you will always ""just missed it"".

The tale of flying a nice classy legacy carrier into terminal D and flying Southwest and US Air into terminal C.  Its Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde if you will...

My first of many experiences with this airport was flying Southwest (theres my first problem) and landing in the C terminal.  It was a like a horrible invasion of early 90's southwestern colors combined with lots of dinging of slots and general old airport layout confusion.  And since it was connecting I had to go way across the airport navigating the horrific layout of terminals built onto terminals to find my gate.  In between the two gates I managed to eat a 9 dollar BK Whopper.  So if you've gathered from my description, Terminal C is a like a chaotic 3rd world airport with slot machines and grossly overpriced fast food.

The flip side of the coin is stepping off of your United\/AA\/Delta flight into the shiny new terminal D.  Its clean, its new, the concourse is wide and easy to navigate.  If you want to see one the best views of the Vegas strip go hang out and grab a drink and snack in the Continental (now United?) Presidents Club.  Its on top of the terminal.  It has a great view and it's an incredibly comfortable place to hang out.  Maybe one day Delta will reopen their LAS club and give a similar place to lounge away from the unwashed masses.  I think terminal D is a great airport experience, one of the best you'll have for a large airport.

The way they level out the two different experiences is by funneling you on a tram to the chaotic baggage claim area where you can be shuttled off to the casinos or rental car garage.  If you were crazy enough to check a bag you'll wait a extraordinarily long time for your bag since baggage claim is no where near either terminal.  

Other than that, have a great time you're in Vegas after all.  Just make sure you ask your cabbie where to pickup Booze, Women & Guns (in no particular order), you're sure to get an interesting and candid response.

It is apparent that morale is low amongst your employees. This is what I am telling myself to rationalize for all of the not smiling, irritated, and unhelpful airport employees.

I could highlight your condesending and abusive TSA staff, but why bother? They're famous for their attitudes and bitter scarasm. What stood out to me this trip was that they appear to be understaffed. I'm not making excuses for them; they know where they work. However, morale and customer service might improve if you put a few extra people on staff. Just a thought...

My second observation was your employees, because they are short handed, appear to be overwhelmed.  Some employees did appear to be attempting to help customers and perform to the best of their abilities. Nevertheless, I observed too many employees say ""I don't work for the airlines"" and have a general- Do not talk to me attitude. Really?! Ew.

I've also flown into Vegas from Los Angeles (which is always a weird trip, you go up and you go down, you half expect to leave the plane and realize you are still at LAX).  Ground transportation is pretty easy to get to, and the Strip is very close (which is a plus).

Las Vegas has a few negatives though.  Not enough places to eat if you have a wait (there's always Ruby's though if you want a burger and a shake).  Plus, with so many conventions going on in Las Vegas, the security gate can be unpredictable, and you can have very long lines, which may require you to leave for the airport earlier than you would like.

But the biggest negative--the slot machines.  If you have time to kill before a flight, it is hard not to try your luck on these things.  But no one ever wins at the airport.  They know you only have 10 minutes or so before your flight boards, so they don't even bother teasing you with even a little payout.

So eat before you get there, avoid the slot machines, pull out your laptop to enjoy the free Wi-Fi, and you will be fine.

A long shuttle bus ride halfway across Nevada to the rental car center adds insult to injury.

On the way back, good luck making it through check-in and security quickly if you don't have access to your airline's elite lanes, and good luck finding something to eat that's not junk food.

Undoubtedly, you will land at McCarran International Airport. It all depends on what airline you go with that will determine what terminal you will be in.

Having previously worked for Hawaiian Airlines for years in Las Vegas, I am very familiar with McCarran.

Use your phone for your boarding pass, breeze through security, take a tram to T3 if needed, and then use the free WiFi for the remaining half hour til you board. Outlet availability varies by terminal and gate but the WiFi is consistent and there are ample dining and shopping options.

Bonus points for their parking situation. I've used long term in both terminals for vacations up to a week.  A couple of times, I returned to a car that wouldn't start.

Unfortunately, ever since I turned twenty one, I end up at this airport a lot since I travel to Vegas quite a bit. The free wi-fi is definitely a huge plus, though the slot machines in the terminals are very tacky and take up a lot of floor space. I also discovered that there was a serious lack of power outlets, and my phone almost died before my flight. 

I do enjoy the tram that runs between terminals, even though the people who use it seem to not understand how to embark\/disembark the vehicles.

I've had to shove people aside who don't seem to understand public transportation etiquette. Sorry, pet peeve rant over.

Flight coming here from LAX was full of excited, wide-eyed and hopeful pilgrims.  Reverse flight after Labor Day weekend wasn't so cheery as people looked beaten down, almost somber. 

LAS even has slots at the gates so you can try your luck or run it further in the hole.  Pick your poison.  Only drawback was the transport vans being outside.  In summer heat, it's crazy hot!  Insane heat vapors rising everywhere.  Once 'This would be a shity place to die', crossed my mind, my van pulled up.  Ah, thank you Jesus!

McCarran is your standard run-of-the-mill airport. It's a bit dated and has seen better days but it's an airport: ticket kiosks, security checkpoints with super slow and long lines, standard airport food, et cetera.  One novelty that might be uncommon that McCarran offers that no other airport offers are slot machines.  Lots and lots of slots!  Feel the gentle shaking of your chair?  You're not getting lucky nor did you accidentally drop $0.25 into a machine to have your chair vibrate for your pleasure.  It's the tram!  They have moving walkways in certain areas to help get you where you're going faster [mainly to get you from your plane to luggage claim].  Need a ride?  They have taxi, shuttle, and limo accommodations just right outside.  This city is on the ball with their transportation so even if there's a line, it moves pretty fast.  Free WiFi is offered so enjoy!

Like most airports, car rental companies are conveniently nearby and The Strip is ridiculously close --- $20ish by taxi and like $7 by shuttle.  All in all, McCarran International ain't too shabby although their bathrooms need a revamp.

A tip to tourists heading from the airport to The Strip [and vice versa] by taxi:  Tell them not to take the freeway.  It's the difference of an $18 trip vs $30!",50,37,46

Beyond this there was the added annoyance of having to deal with rude security personnel.

When it comes to the Southwest terminal, it's very old and outdated. It's noisy because of the slot machines and a voice recorded gate change announcement every five seconds. The layout is very long and there's no options for those who don't want to walk 20 miles to get from one gate to the other.

Concourse C is the long, big Concourse of the terminal. It had several food and shopping options. The gates, however, are small and even though there are several charging stations throughout the concourse, those stations can't handle the amount of people coming through that terminal. The bathrooms on this Concourse aren't very nice to say the least, not clean. Loud, but definitely quiets down after 8.

Concourse B is set off way to the side. Southwest has several of these gates and I had the pleasure of arriving into B and having to walk all the way to C. This is a LONG walk. There aren't many options for food and shopping on  Concourse B and also some construction going on, so it's pretty lackluster. There are some good views of the airfield.

Concourse A is very desolate. I walked over here just exploring and there was no flights going out of the concourse. Allegiant uses this terminal and there were tons of Allegiant planes parked across from the terminal. Concourse A only had a few people sitting around in it, probably to get away from the noise hell known as Concourse C. 

I trekked over to Concourse D to go to a store and it's very nice and open, from what I saw of it. Seems much nicer than the Southwest terminal.

While I love Vegas, Terminal 1 of McCarran represents Las Vegas' ""tacky"" stereotype quite well. It would benefit from new carpeting, some noise reduction, outlets being put in and more bathrooms. Overall, I might make a connection here again- but I'll make sure it's a short one.",0,0,0

For one, it's sort of a pain trying to maneuver through all of the tourists that arrive and are in la la land because of all the lights and noises coming from the slot machines. Yeah, they're everyone, I mean, that want you to gamble, even if you're there for a quick layover.

The gates are pretty crowded and you'll encounter quite a few people with mean hangovers. I wouldn't take rude behavior personal. I'd probably react the same way if I was full of sugary alcoholic drinks and up for over 36-hours straight. Who knows, maybe they just lost their house on the roulette table? You really never know what the person's story may be.

One of my biggest complaints is the walk from the terminals to ground transportation. They have a little tram that will take you from one terminal to another, which is nice, but just to get to the pick up area can be quite a hike. If I had a bad hip, I'd probably give up half way through.

What I did like was that they had a designated pick up area for arrivals. My friends were able to pull right up and I was able to jump in without being harassed by airport security for being there more than two-minutes (ahem LAX). There were also plenty of cabs if you needed one as well as other touristy buses if you wanted to go sightseeing straight from the airport.

There are a ton of slot machines, but very few people playing them.  This is vastly different from 2003 or 2006.  I guess it is being affected by the economy.

The Pros:
- Well marked for where you need to go.  Some airports really suck at telling you where things are (hear me, Newark?).  This doesn't lack in signage.
- Large baggage claim, which allows for plenty of space to get your bags.
- Decent movement in security.
- Close to the strip.  You aren't going to have to drive far to the Airport if you are in Paradise.
- You are in Vegas, baby!

The Cons:
- Baggage is SLOOOOWWWW.  Another reviewer remarked on this, and it isn't related to a specific airline.
- Crappy food options.  There is either large chains or really bad local restaurants, such as Ruby's.  All of it is more expensive than other airports.
- Shuttle service to rental cars.  Some airports have fixed this issue (San Jose), but Vegas still has it.  Really a pain.  I like being able to simply walk to the rental counter and get my car.

After arriving to LAS, we headed for the bathrooms before making our way to the baggage claim. Bathrooms have plenty of stalls. Washing area could have more sinks and towel stations to accommodate the busiest of travel days. 

Bathrooms, restaurants and retail are well organized along the main path of the terminal walkways. There appears to be enough room for passengers to navigate the terminal with ease.

Away from the gates is the baggage claim area. Travelers can take an automated tram or walk through the terminal to get to the bag claim area. High vaulted ceilings and lots of Vegas signage makes this area feel larger than life.

New for this trip, the taxi cabs are separate from the Uber and Lyft service providers. Taxi cab pickup is located on the first level just off from the bag claim area. All other pickups for car services are located on the second level of the parking garage. Travelers must climb one flight in the terminal then climb one more flight in the parking garage to find the waiting area.

The area for pickups on car services is a little cramped. The area is funneled into one major opening, but there's really not enough room. Uber and Lyft drivers make their way through a maze of cones, and park in stalls to wait for their fare.

This airport is a few minutes drive from the Las Vegas Strip. Urge travelers to avoid taking the interstate as this is a longer route to get to the Strip. Instead, take Paradise Road to take the back entrance.

Upon returning to the airport, cab and car service drivers arrive to designated airline ticketing areas for drop off.

The Southwest ticketing counter offers self-ticketing to expedite service.

Pros: lots of good food options and fairly easy to navigate
-love the ride share level of the parking garage, great to have a separate spot for pickup! 
-lots of parking options (short term, economy, etc)

Cons: For one thing - they NEED charging stations at the chairs, like most other international airports. If Indianapolis and San Jose has them, but not Las Vegas - something is wrong. That would probably solve a lot of their crowding issues because people have to awkwardly huddle where the outlets are. 
-It usually feels very crowded at the gates, no matter what flight I'm getting on. Not sure the reason for that because Vegas is one of the only places it feels that way when I travel.

McCarran is a number of different airports, depending on what airline you fly.  Overall, I think they do a great job for the amount of people (especially amateur fliers) that they handle. 

Some basic tips to get out easier and better ... 

-  TSA lines - Arrive above 2 hours before.  The crowds get worse as you get closer.  Too, get watch for weekends like ""Pro Rodeo"" week, because those cowboys can't remember or see their huge belt buckles (over their huge bellies) that they have on.  And typically require twice as much time to get thru (and with a whole huge crowd ... do the math)

-  Take an MP3 player - Drown out the slots with music, and helps made the time go faster.  Simple solution.

-  Get out your notebook - There is FREE internet access in the terminals.  Can kill a lot of time surfing the internet ... 

-  Bring snack foods with you - Give shops are slim pickings.  But there are Subways to be somewhat healthy.  

-  Hungover?  - Sit in one of the many bars ... now without smoking, you can sit and enjoy your drink and not smell like an ashtray on your flight.",0,0,0

Nice, clean, and I never have to wait really at security.  I've flown into and out of this airport like 25 times and never has anybody working there been rude or unfriendly.  

At terminal three, I can get through security in like 17 seconds.   If I was sleepwalking, I could get through security in about 22 seconds still.   It's insane!!!    But for reals, there is nothing bad to say about this airport.   If memory serves me, terminal 1 has smoking areas still but terminal 3 is non-smoking.  Just saying.   

If you wanna play the slots, they have those for you.  You're like 99% gonna lose but that's on you.   Decent amount of food choices if you wanna fill that belly before your flight.   The reason it doesn't get 5 stars...  I know there are some insane airports out there that I need to save my extra star for.   It's probably in like Tokyo or somewhere like that.",3,2,2

Aside from the slot machines stuck in about every location they could find, LAS is a pretty typical big-city airport, meaning:
-rental car counter is offsite and requires a 10 minute shuttle bus ride
-TSA security lines can back up during peak times. I've been told Tuesday and Saturday are the lowest volume days, although during the morning and afternoon bank, you're screwed either way. Get to the airport early. 
-TSA Pre-Check lines are at all of the gates and terminals. I flew USAirways out of a Terminal 1 D Concourse, and I had to look really hard for it. If you're enrolled in it, you understand the reason you look. #keepyourshoeson #keepyourbagpacked #totsllyworthit
-Unless you're flying on Southwest, prepare to take a monorail to your gate. Don't quote me on this, but I seem to think the last time I was here on Southwest, I didn't have to ride the rail. 
-There are multiple food locations scattered through the airport. They do a good Jon of making sure there's a Starbucks in sight throughout your entire visit.",1,1,0

I simply ran over and assisted them, because common elderly and they were lost too! F'D up! 

Once at terminal 1 we asked the driver where Delta was at. He pointed in a  direction and said keep going that way. Really point in one direction and the direction was filled with construction and a crowd of people. Once we began walking in that direction it was wrong and we found another employee who gave us somewhat positive directions, in the end I found the damn airline Delta by asking a random person who just, so luckily flew allot and actually walked us over. 

The TSA were the only professional types to acknowledge myself and my wife and understand the confusion and assisted her the entire way to her gate. I was not allowed to go due to Delta refusing to acknowledge my Law Enforcement Badge and I.D and TSA was shocked and allowed me to escort her only to the security line where she walked in and began the check. 

McCarran needs more information and needs more professional people, seriously ridiculous to see many confused visitors, tourists, and Nevadan's lost and seeking help especially with a shuttle who sat his rear in the seat and watched a elderly couple struggle. I had no problem helping, but to know my mom, dad, and or family would be dealing with this kind of crap was not sitting well with me!",1,0,0

The airport itself is not too bad, most lines are created by the airline companies and not by the airport personnel or design. 

Located close to UNLV and near Las Vegas Strip.
On arrival is also easy to locate your luggage, carrousel are well organized and flight numbers clearly marked. 
There are a number of car rental companies accessible via Shuttle bus, and even a free shuttle service for off terminal  rentals. 

Check in at most airlines is fast, I've seldom stood in line for more than a few minutes and most airline agents have been courteous and efficient.
Despite the large crowds, they manage to move people pretty quickly through TSA, and their extremely efficient automated people movers, can get you to your terminal in no time.

There are several things that take away from the whole experience, one, the airport terminals are is bit messy, specially around the many restaurants and stores, and the slot machines located near gates, the other is TSA, on T1, if you are TSA PreCheck you often end up spending more time getting through than on the regular TSA lines, mainly because is completely separate and you have to go through what I call a ""cattle tunnel"", if they are slow, you are pretty much stuck.

One last pet peeve of mine is airport lounges, though not the fault of the airport per se, the best lounge is Amex's Centurion, complimentary if you have an Amex black or platinum, day passes are no longer available, the Club at T1 is basically a little room with chairs, and United's lounge is nothing to brag about, The 2 largest US airlines have no lounge in McCarran, that's a huge oversight, of there is an airport that passengers could use Delta's SkyClub and American Admiral Lounge has to be this one.",24,16,17

Pro: 
--Convenient location. Not like Denver where you feel like you're flying into a neighboring state. When you land, you're pretty sure you're coming down on the road until the runway appears right there.
--Food. It's packed in there. Not always what or where you want, but there are options.
--Flights. It's busy, and pretty big, and flights are usually cheap and the come in at all hours of the day and night.

Con:
--Not nice, or new, and with the addition of slot machines it just sorta feels like a dated casino.
--Layout. Ugh. Long, skinny terminals with big bulbous pods on the end where they cram people in. Someone's always in your way if you're in a hurry, and it's an airport; you're always in a hurry.
--Signage. Not really clear on inter-terminal transportation and routing, and for crying out lout can you please have more signs for the bathroom? We almost had a catastrophe on our hands

Indifferent:
--Baggage claim. (Although I've only had lost luggage twice and both times it was from Southwest at LV)
--Security. So-so in line time.
--Parking.
--Seating. Not too many plugs, actually, but usually enough seating.

The baggage claim is a large open area, with tons of ads for shows and casinos.  I think that the open atmosphere, coupled with slot machines everywhere create a cool Vegas vibe when you're waiting for your bag.  Then if you are being picked up, its $2 to park across from the baggage claim,its easy to get parking there if you need someone to wait for you after you've arrived.  In addition, the airport is very close to the strip.

Overall my experience at McCarran has been decent, I've never been late to a flight and security lines have never been an issue.  For departures, the D gates are definitely the nicest, when I flew Southwest I had another gate area and it was very dated with low ceilings and not a lot of space.

Baggage claim is reasonably speedy and it's not a big walk back to long-term parking which is a plus.  I really wish the baggage area would get an upgrade as this is where many of our visitors get their first look at Vegas.  In some ways this area is stuck in a time warp around the mid-90s.

The rental car counters are way off premises, and it takes a while to be shuttled there.  Then, it's kind of a mess, too!  Further, the local government won't allow the hotels to have their own shuttles because, I heard this from a taxi driver, if visitors are forced to take cabs, it creates an entire pool of jobs and increased taxes for the county.  So, count on $15-$20 cab ride anywhere near the strip, or other resort destinations.  Your reward for contributing to the local economy is LONG lines to wait for your cab.

If you want to take public buses to get to the Strip at Terminal 3, then you will have to walk up to the departure level and follow the ""Public Transit"" sign until you see a bus stop for Westcliff Airport Express (WAX). Heck, WAX will only take you to the MGM Grand (Tropicana & Las Vegas) and THEY ONLY COME ONCE AN HOUR!

My friend and I got tired of waiting and took taxi instead ... $25 for two people.

Okay another option is taking the free shuttle to the McCarran Rent-A-Car Center and walk to the South Strip Transfer Terminal. From the terminal you can pay $6 (2-hour pass) and take SDX (express version of the Deuce) or Deuce (stop at most hotels along the Strip). In reality, it is too much of a hassle to use public transportation and you are in Vegas to have fun - not to make your life miserable.

Well, what can you say about an airport really? This one is relatively easy to get around in - signage is easy to follow, baggage carousels are laid out well and spread out so there is not an issue getting your things and getting to a taxi, shuttle, limo, whatnot.  And obviously, slot machines galore!

So here is the issue - the taxi stand line is INSANE.  Now, it moves relatively well - well managed, lots of slots for people to get cabs - but the snaking line it 6 rows deep! It was filled to the max when I visited recently since it was NASCAR weekend. It only ended up taking 15 minutes or so for it to be my turn.  Not too bad.

Leaving the airport was super simple - the cab dropped us off and the Delta counter was easy to find and check in. Their directions to security (and a post office\/mail box) were spot on.  Security went very fast and walking to the terminal and to the gate was probably the most painless of most airports (especially not being my home airport) ever.  Again, more slot machines.

I was pleasantly how smooth the line in the security check flow, especially with all the holiday crowds are going to mess things up by being the usual knuckleheads. You get the dumb lass that tried to go through the metal detectors with a gold chain around their neck, but the security alerted him before the bonehead get his chance to stall everyone behind him.

The wait was actually less painless than I originally envisioned here. My terminal is for the Delta Airlines and the terminal there was festive with slot machines popping at every available chance you can get before you go home. I love it!

There is one catch about time issues at this airport. Make you come in early enough. It's not the security check or the check in that is a factor (even though it is), it is the indoor monorail ride from the front of the location of the airport to the other side of the terminal where you board your flights. 

It was very unexpected for me because when I got off the plane, I noticed that in order to get from the boarding gates to the front of the terminal (baggage area\/security check in), you have to board this monorail. This could be a time issue if you came in late thinking you have the small window of time to board your flight. If you missed the monorail, you'll wait until the monorail come back and pick you up and take you there.

The monorail does have a set time and it does take a few minutes between location each way. So it might take at least 5 minutes to come back, then you have to wait until enough people come on board for this monorail to move. That could take an undetermined time before that happens.

It's not really a big deal if you set enough time ahead of your flight. If not, then that could be a deterrent.

Overall, I like the airport for its smooth check in and security check in time (without compromising). The restaurants, coffee shops, and bars are plenty. The slots reminds people you still have that last chance to blow all of your money here in Vegas, but it's the monorail you have to be aware of.",2,1,4

I will say they have a variety of cheese ball shops here. Stupid foo foo shops, and sometimes I'll go to the candy store or donut shop to get a little sugar in me because you have to be fired up when you're in Vegas.

In addition I also have a lot of layovers in Las Vegas so getting from one gate to the next it's not a challenge. They also have a tram that will get you to your destination much quicker if you don't feel like walking. However I prefer to walk. The airport is not that big and you get to walk through a lot of shops and people watch and of course the slot machines. I've never actually played them but I do find it funny that people are always on the slot machines getting that last opportunity to spend their money. All in all I really like This airport. TSA Precheck is usually not that busy and bags are fast to pick up. Also Uber is fast and the shuttle to pick up your rental car is very fast so no complaints there.,2,1,1

Checking in is a breeze if you must do so. All the airlines are all lined up with awesome LED screens indicating each airline's specific counter. 

The security now has two separate lines - one for regular screens and individuals who have TSA Pre-Check. The TSA Pre-Check line moved pretty quickly even if it looks pretty long. Just remember folks, put all your stuff in your bag and don't have any metal like belts, coin change, etc. on your or in your pockets. It'll make the line move much more quickly!

After getting through security, there are plenty of screen to inform you of you arriving and departing flights. The terminal is pretty big with huge windows that let in plenty of light. In true Vegas style, there are slot machines around every corner in case you have extra time before your flight.

There are plenty of food options such as Pei Wei, Burger King, Carl's Jr., and Coffee Bean. I think there are a couple more options, but I noticed these just from looking for food. They also had your basic stores in case you wanted some snacks, reading material, Las Vegas memorabilia, etc. The bathrooms are also modern and clean, which is always a plus.

The terminal is very accommodating to tech savvy folks. There is free wi-fi for your use and there's also a dedicated charging station. It would've been better if there were chargers are each seat, but that's just me being picky.

Walked out to the Taxi area - informed the guy I needed a cab that accepted plastic - and he got me into the right cab immediately!

I'm not saying you don't have to have any slots just that you should have some consideration for you customers and their comfort. What about just having them outside the freaking gates, like the hallways? Lord knows there are enough LONG hallways between Concourses. 

What's with the air conditioning? I'm literally baking in the sun because you have windows everywhere and NOTHING on them to help shield the desert sun from directly baking your customers. Perhaps you have not realized that your airport is located in the middle of the desert! Airports like the one in Indianapolis Indiana have large windows for your viewing comfort but they have also placed decorative clings that have unique designs to help shield their customers from the bright heat. 

How have you determined where you place your eating establishments? Seems they are mostly places in the C concourse. Hum.... What about the people in A & B? Maybe move some freaking gambling machines and slap in some food establishments! Guess what!? Either way you still make money.

Once you are in the baggage claim area and you go outside you will see dozens of shuttle services that will take you to your hotel. The prices vary from $8 a shuttle to $20. I noticed the longer I walk down the sidewalk the prices for the shuttles kept increasing.

The McCarran Rent-A-Car Center is located at 7135 Gilespie Street and there are rental car shuttles that will take you there or bring you back to the airport. The line for that on a Wednesday morning was super long. I am not sure about other rental companies, but Enterprise will not pick you up (from the hotel) or drop you off. You must ride the free shuttle at the airport to get there.

I attempted to get a taxi instead of having to stand in a long line for a shuttle. Just be sure to go to the correct terminal to get a taxi. It is Terminal 1 or 3. It's not the same area you see taxis dropping people off at. I made the mistake of getting into one. According to the taxi driver, he said they will give taxi cabs a $300 fine if they try to pick up passengers from areas not designated for taxis. Oopsy! He still allowed us to get in.

I would recommend that you get a ride with Lyft from the airport. For me, the ride was cheaper than the taxi to the hotel. Lyft and Uber also picks up from Terminal 1 or 3.",16,4,8

Although it's a relatively heavy international airport, you don't really sense it throughout the domestic terminal. I consider it a shame because the excitement and sophistication that international air travel brings is non existent through the plain and dimly lit halls of Terminal C.

For airplane spotters like me, LAS is a wonderful airport. Easy access to the top level of the parking lot presents magnificent views of the runway facing the strip. There's really no comparison to any other airport views like this. While walking to your gate, you are also faced with a plethora of non obstructed windows, which give you great views as well.

I had a great encounter with the personnel working here as well. From the Southwest check-in agents to the TSA crew (big surprise), everyone was very cheery for some odd reason. I even had a good 5 min conversation with the lady checking my ID at security.

The airport makes a good effort to maintain their proud aviation history with the use of educational exhibits throughout the airport. A model display of airplanes that have passed through LAS, an exhibit on the operational history of the airport, and a well preserved Hacienda Airlines Cessna 172 are just some of the few things that make this airport great for an aviation buff like me.

When you get to the gate area, however, it's a completely different story. This is a common occurence with Southwest at most airports, but I could definitely feel it here a lot more than at OAK or ONT for example. Southwest gate areas are always heavily overcrowded.

Depending on how you look at the slots, they might be good for passing the time, but they do take up a lot of floor space that could be used for passenger seating.  Of course, passenger seating does not make money.  Whether you go in the A, B, or C Concourses, you will probably see a lot of people standing or sitting on the floor because every seat is taken.  This is one of the nation's busiest airports, so I always ask myself when I get back home, ""Why don't they ever get more seating?""  Of course, that question comes with a billion dollar budget.  McCarran has nice modern conveniences, and it is kept fairly clean for the amount of passengers that pass through and square footage.  Free Wi-Fit is great!!  I was shocked to see they offered the WiFi for free.  Pack a snack if you know you'll be hungry...food costs more at this airport (around $10+ for a meal at Burger King).  Prices might be comparable to LAX.  You might find it confusing to find the C-Concourse Tram, and when I last passed through it was only labled to go to baggage claim.  They should re-do the signs to also include transportation to A\/B Gates also because if you are at the tip of the C-Gates and need to go to the A-Gates, that's a VERY long walk, especially the portion between the B & C Gates (no moving walkways).  McCarran is a nice airport with modern conveniences, but the waiting areas are small.  They really need to put more moving walkways or some kind of tram that goes to all the gates\/terminals in a circle since everything is spread out; I know someone with asthma and they had an asthma attack from the very end of the B-Gates to the very end of the C-Gates.

Again going with my theory of airports reflecting the city they are in I find the terminal and baggage claim areas look like the floor of a casino complete with slots machines and blingy ads for the various shows currently playing around the city. Pretty easy to get in and out of, however the baggage claim isn't always right - we were waiting at one carousel for our baggage (as it was showing our flight on that screen) only to find it circling the carousel next door.  Right next to the strip though, even if it does end up taking about 15 minutes to get there because there is no straight angle to it, you have to go around the airport to get there (great for taxis I am sure)",1,2,1

Just to check my email it took minutes instead of seconds. I ended up just using my data because aint nobody got time for that slow bandwidth. 

Restaurants and concessions here are highly marked up which just might be worse than getting it off the strip itself. How do these people sleep at night when a basic burger, fries, and a drink is 15 bucks? I say boycott all of them but then again, are you gonna be able to wait the 2 or 3 plus hours to board your flight and get food at your destination which could be more hours added? So I guess if you dont want to pass out, you are forced to get something to eat here. You are at the mercy of the greed that is the high prices of the airport concessions.

There are some things to be thankful for though. At some gates there are plenty of outlets for you to charge your phone or laptop. That is if you are lucky enough to be at a gate that has that. Otherwise, you are fighting over one single outlet and more often than not, you have to sit on the floor for that particular outlet is nowhere near any chairs.

Lastly, I cant end this without talking about the TSA. For me, its hit or miss. You will either get an anal security person or one that is pleasant. You almost have to strip down to your underwear just to walk through the metal detector or the one machine that they make you hold your arms above your head like you're under arrest. Thanks to that one idiot that had plans to blow up the plane by allegedly putting some kind of explosives in his shoes. Because of that, you have people with some seriously stanky feet when they take their shoes off. What, did you guys decide to play a full court game of basketball before taking off for somewhere? 

So there you have it. This review can be applied to just about any airport in the country. I dont think there is such a thing as a perfect airport. Sure there are some that are better than others but there will always be something to complain about.

There are slot machines (but no blackjack tables, boo!) which is pretty fun at the airport, although I didn't play. I was in the Southwest terminal the entire time. I recommend Jersey Mike's subs for dinner or Pei Wei. Probably your two best options.

I remember the Las Vegas airport being a nightmare, but I was treated to quite a surprise when I landed in Las Vegas on a JetBlue flight into terminal 3. Everything about it was opposite of the Southwest terminal. It was bright, it was spacious, the ceilings were high and I damn near literally stumbled onto the street thinking I had to take that devil's device they call a tram. On my way out of Vegas I was pleased to find how easy it was to get to the terminal and then through the check-in counters and security.

One of my favorite touches is that all of the gate markers (for the E gates at least) are equiped with LCD screens. In addition to showing the gate number, airline, flight number, and departure time, the background is a landmark of the desitnation city. For New York it was the Statue of Liberty. For Long Beach it was the Queen Mary. When it got to be nighttime, I noticed that the background for the Long Beach gate changed from a daytime shot of the Queen Mary to a night time shot of Downtown Long Beach. That is a really cool touch. It seems the restaurant and shopping selection behind security is much better than the old terminals as well.

I like to complain about the lack of facilities (there aren't a lot of decent dining options in Terminal 1), but then when I travel to other airports I realize how good we have it here.

This is a pretty easy airport to navigate, even with the opening of Terminal 3 (which I've not really experienced yet).

Parking is pretty much a breeze.  The economy lot is decently priced - I think it's $9 per day, which is a steal compared to other cities.

I've never actually gambled at the airport, but I can imagine that there is not a better place in the US to be delayed\/stranded....You have the slot machines to keep you busy while you wait.  It's also very close to the Strip, so if you have a long layover, you could just take a detour to a casino for some 5 star cuisine and booze.

Security is generally pretty easy to get through.  Although I always seem to get stuck by someone who it seems has never left their cave before.  Once the guy in front of me had a socket wrench in his carry on (and I was running late).  People - have your shoes\/jackets off and in a bin and remove everything from your pockets.  Let's try and speed this process along!

Anyhow, overall it's a great airport.  There are direct International flights to a few destinations and you can basically fly Southwest everywhere else (although I prefer Virgin America).  I am just wondering when they are going to step it up a bit and put in some airline clubs?  I kind of feel like that's what may be missing.",1,1,3

Because I am a frequent business traveller, I was able to take advantage of the first class\/ premier security check-in lines going to the D gates. As always, I do my best to be friendly to the environment so instead of printing out my boarding pass, I have it electronically downloaded to my iPhone. 

After waiting in this ungodly long line for 20 minutes (there were only 2 TSA agents dedicated to us to check our IDs and boarding passes and there must have been 50 of us in line), we were told that there was only 1 functioning electronic boarding pass reader and it was at the first position all the way at the other end (our line is at the opposite end). When I asked them what I need to do to get through, they said that I would have to walk out and over to the other line. There were well over 400 people in the regular line. 4 of us came up and had electronic boarding passes. I said that this was unacceptable and that a supervisor would need to take care of us. The TSA agent called for a supervisor and we waited another 5 minutes for one to show up. When she arrived, it seemed like she was more interested in cleaning up trash than attending to our issue. When we explained what happened, she said to just walk over to the other side and go to the TSA agent. I told her that someone should escort us over there so that the other passengers don't think that we are cutting in line. She was uninterested, told us that we should have a paper boarding pass, and walked away. At this point, I was fuming as well as the 3 other passengers. Finally, I took the intiative and flagged down a non-supervisory TSA employee and he graciously escorted us over to the scanner and personally checked our ID and let us pass. 

I have to tell you, there were at least 10 positions open to check IDs and boarding passes and having just one functioning electronic boarding pass scanner is unacceptable. I don't have this problem at other airports. I have learned my lesson as well as should you. From my experience, please do yourself a favor and have a paper boarding pass printed out just in case the system fails as it did horribly in this case. 

McCarran Airport, you have made this a bad experience for me today and hopefully this is one of those rare instances. Ignorant TSA supervisor, please go back and get some training because your behavior resulted in an EPIC FAIL today.

At least it will be nice to get back home and enjoy the weekend. TGIF!!!",1,0,0

Flying out, a whole different experience.

Naw, that is all part of the experience you love to expect. (as long as they aren't sitting next to you).

I dreaded leaving the airport because the walk to security was long, the lines were never-ending, everyone seems to walk a little slower and four abreast (seemingly unaware of the other 10,000 people scurrying to their gates).

And then, just after passing through security, the need to take a tram to the gate. THe tram which is usually standing room only and having to witness that one passenger who can't squeeze themselves or their luggage into the already full shuttle tram, keeping the tram doors from closing or departing. 

Yes, you. Miss, ""I smell like cotton candy and squeezed my size 24 body into a size 4 leopard body suit.""

Well why wouldn't I? The perks to killing a few hours in LAS:

-The people watching. Those getting off the plane are drunk, excited, and still have a little of that innocence behind their eyes. Those boarding their planes are... still drunk,  though from a 48-hour binge involving some form of grain alcohol, they're typically missing at least one crucial item of clothing, and it's obvious they've seen things. Unmentionable things. 

-SLOT MACHINES. Scrap together the seventy-five cents you have left in the corner of your purse and hit the penny slots. If you win, hey maybe you can replenish a little of that savings account you somehow depleted miraculously in a blink of an eye. And if you lose, well seventy-five cents isn't gonna buy you much else.

I've never been to Vegas.  Just the airport.  I don't think I need to see anymore.

When you're excited to be making your first or rare visit to Vegas, what is cooler than stepping off the plane and seeing\/hearing slot machines going crazy? You are looking dead-on at the strip from the windows of the airport, and immediately upon slots as you walk out of the air tram.

McCarran is super hectic on weekends and holidays, and no different in that regard than most big airports.  After years of flying here several times a year, I've come to the conclusion they're a 3-star airport,  They generally aren't awful, and overall not great:

The good:

1. There are places to hang out before you check in.  It lets parents linger a while before sending off their kids to college, grandma, or camp.
2. Picking up someone isn't too bad except at busiest holidays.  They really seem very obsessed with keeping the traffic flowing. These traffic cops are don't put up with BS and will ticket those who make it tougher on everyone else driving in.
3, There are usually enough chairs for people to sit in except when there is a weather delay and flights get backed up.
4. There are decent food options no matter what gate, The slot machines give bored passengers something to do. They have some places for people to recharge their computers and cell phones.  
5. There is a good variety of discount airlines including Jet Blue, Southwest, and Virgin America for CALI people. 
6. Security lines for the number of people they put through are faster than you'd expect.
7. Free Wi-Fi.
8. Nice amount of flight info boards and passengers to get answers to questions
9. Decent short term parking that uses quarters with change machines.
9. This is one of the best people watching airports ever.

The bad:

1, Dropping someone off can be a nightmare. Taxis, buses, cars, and foot passengers all jam along the drop off curb with an occasional darting of passengers between vehicles. John Wayne, Long Beach, and even LAX are easier and safer in this regard. 
2. Several poorly connected terminals - the International terminal where my uncle landed from Montreal was a bit inconvenient. Airlines do change gates, but mine went from a C to B gate once and it was esp. bad for the seniors to make that change.
3. Renting a car is  sometimes difficult because taking a shuttle from the airport  to the rental place and back again can take a long while. And the rental companies do an awful job explaining their so called insurance options - they are a no fault state.
4. It's Las Vegas, and is a terrorist target in the same way LAX, O'Hare, and other high profile airports are.
5. During the summer, it can be hell if you're waiting for someone when it's 110 degrees outside, meaning the pavement is probably about 130 deg. 
6. Food costs too much, like any airport.  I also hate the instant coffee that Sbarro and Burger Kink sells at Southwest gates.  I know there's Starbucks, but a lot of people don't know and don't like Starbucks.
9. The TSA people vary widely in their skill level and training.  Today, one woman at the C gate gave my laptop back with my several alpha numeric keys unattached after inspecint it.  Once a TSA guy told me he had to get my fruit salad checked out because it was a liquid.His supervisor red face said ""Hey it's obviously food it's fine"". And the last time, someone double checked\/scanned my New Balance shoes - did it stink that bad? Maybe Mr, TSA actually likes the smell of a 3-4 times a week tennis player? 
10. The sometimes very windy weather, not their fault, but I've been in three flight delays in the last year because of winds and rain or ice though it's rare. It backs all the flights up. and screws up connections for a lot of people.

So all in all, it's not a terrible experience, but it's needed if you have to go to Sin City. They've talked some about creating another terminal near the State line, but that won't happen for awhile, if at all.",7,6,6

However, this airport isn't BAD, either. Security is generally amiable. Flights are generally on-time no matter which airline you fly. I guess there really aren't many weather issues here (vs. fog in SFO or snow in Denver). If you check your bag, it's pretty easy to find the carousel that you need. And if someone is picking you up, parking in the garage is cheap ($2\/hour) and the drive-by pickup is easy too.

TRANSPORTATION: there's a shuttle bus that's right outside of the terminal after baggage claim. A round-trip ticket costs I think $13.50 and they give you a booklet of coupons and one of those pages is your return ticket, so don't lose it! They take you directly to your hotel\/casino and you can call them the day before to have them come pick you up from the hotel to take you back to the airport. Very convenient. If there's more than one of you, there are lots of taxis too. 

WI-FI: Free wi-fi! You just have to accept the terms\/agreement thing that pops up. Sometimes you lose the connection and have to accept the terms\/agreement thing again. But it's free!

POWER POINTS: there are these ""recharge zones"" sprinkled throughout the terminal. There are plenty of power outlets and USB plug ports for your smartphone or laptop. 

F&B CONCESSIONAIRES: There are lots of food options here - burgers, sandwiches, pizza, Starbucks. Nothing spectacular that I've found as of yet. I've tried Burke in the Box and had the reuben sandwich and it was just okay. I've also tried Port of Subs, which is like a Subway or Quiznos - they have made-to-order sammies and they also sell Mrs. Fields cookies. I like that there's a lot of variety. Just be prepared to pay airport prices for the food (not cheap). 

RETAIL CONCESSIONAIRES: If you forgot to get some souvenirs with Las Vegas plastered all over it, there are so many stores that sell Vegas themed shirts, mugs, bags, keychains, etc.  The Duty Free stores at the E gates has Victoria Secret stuff for sale. When did that start happening? I guess there's a demand for Victoria's Secret stuff overseas. I went there to sample some lotions. Another thing that I thought was cool was that I saw these vending machines that sell Benefit cosmetics. Perfect for if you forgot some makeup to make you look fabulous for partying on the strip! 

PUBLIC ART: In Terminal 3, at the D gates, there are these big sand animals - a rabbit, a turtle, and what might be like a chameleon or some other kind of reptile. You may recognize the turtle from that video where that guy was stuck overnight at the vegas airport and lip synced to celine dion - the guy was serenading it in the video. At the E gates, there's a really pretty art piece made of hundreds of monarch butterflies. 

OTHER: There are Wells Fargo ATMS. And slot machines everywhere. If you didn't get enough gambling in while you were on the strip, you can continue playing the Wheel of Fortune slots while waiting for your flight to depart. These must be a huge moneymaker for the airport. And if it's your first time, don't forget to take a picture with the signs that say ""Welcome to Las Vegas."" Oh, and if you fly in at night, the strip is pretty close to the airport, so if you look out the plane window, you can see the strip all lit up and it's quite a pretty sight to see. Getting between D gates and E gates (in case you have a connecting flight) requires taking this tram thing.

I stood there, with my backpack in the xray scanner giving it a nice radiation bath for over 15 minutes while they meticulously went through a sorority chicks lacey panties and grampa joes dentures and woodworking mags.

The thing that is frustrating is the additional security screening at this airport. Every connection or flight I've had here requires that they do ADDITIONAL TSA screening randomly of baggage before people (who have obviously already been screened) have their bags searched again.  Their criteria for who they search is baffeling, and on my last flight they had searched a girl who looked Persian in descent but was carrying a bag the size of a greeting card and they spent a while going through it.

The shops have the traditional tacky souveneirs found in any Las Vegas casino, but don't get me wrong, I've picked up a shot glass and the playing chip inspired chocolates are awesome - if not overpriced.

My gateway into this magical theme Park is McMcarran International Airport. Upon arriving, the single most important goal is to leave the airport terminal without spending a dime. This challenge alone can prove to be a difficult one with all of the shops, MGM Grand check-in area where you can purchase Cirque du Soleil tickets, the gambling machines, or the liquor store in the Terminal 1 baggage claim.

After mastering this task, what could be one of the most difficult tasks depending on how hard you pregame on the flight to Vega is getting a taxi. I have witnessed many a times others fail what I like to call the walk of sobriety test and fall and knock out a good portion of the line ropes for the taxi line. Depending on your flight, the line can be long, but Vegas knows how to keep things moving and they get people into waiting taxis  like it is no one's business. If taxis aren't your cup of tea, there is a shared vans that can take you your hotel for a flat rate, but be prepared to make multiple stops depending on what hotel you are staying at and you could lose some time. If you are a high roller or want to spend over $50 or have a large group of friends, just hire a limo. **Word to the out of not so wise when taking a taxi, make sure they don't take you on the highway when going down the strip, this can increase your bill** 

Once your visit has concluded, LAS has some of the fastest security if you are able to access the Pre-Check or Priority line.

Sucks.

They should actually add that word to their name, it suits them so well. Then their initials would be MIAS (my ass).

I'll keep this as short as I can. My first time there, we stopped into Jose Cuervo Cantina near the Southwest gates. 2 margaritas and one nachos = $40.

On a different occasion, we ate at Sbarro's. The lady slinging the pizza in the boxes (not exaggerating, she was slinging some pizza) was in a pretty foul mood. There was a lady in line in front of us, she was there when we got in line. When it was her time to order, Ms. Pizza Slinger yelled at her accusing her of cutting in line. The lady looked pretty surprised and confused. I spoke up and said that she didn't cut in front of us, but that was ignored.

My turn to order, I asked for two slices of pizza. She slung one in a box, slid it to me and moved to the next customer. I very politely (because I was a little scared of her) asked for my second slice. I got a wicked stank eye glare, then my second slice slung into a separate box.

A different occasion. I'm already cautious about going anywhere after such bad service and high prices at several places. I have a long flight back home and I'm starting to get hungry. I figured a milkshake would hold me over for a few hours. Besides, you can't screw up a milkshake, right? So I go to Carvel's.

There are a couple people in front of me. The lady is very slowly making the orders, but she's old so she can't help it. I figured I'll just patiently hold my place in line until I have to board. Hopefully, I'll get to order in time. Just before it's my turn, someone else comes out of the back and takes my order. Milkshake. She takes my cash, hastily makes a milkshake, puts it on the counter and disappears in the back again.

I'm looking at the advertising on the wall bragging about thick milkshakes, then I look at what I've been given which is basically chocolate milk. At this point I have to board, so took my un-shaked milk and left.

Complimentary WiFi. The more airports cotton to this idea, the more the air carriers will love you, as the stranded passenger can re-book their ticket and not stress themselves (or the ticket agent) out.

Just walk up and down the airside for Southwest and you'll see 20+ people sitting on the floor at nearly every gate.  My wife had to sit on the floor when she was pregnant because none of the hung over people also waiting for the flight would give up their seat.  Would it really be that difficult for the airport to install additional seating?

The security lines are horrible on a regular basis.  Fortunately TSA Pre Check has helped with that a lot, but most people don't have that yet and will still get stuck in the long line.

The McCarran baggage claim is ripe with criminals stealing luggage.  The airport also has woefully inadequate security camera coverage of the baggage claim area.  My wife and I had our bags stolen in 2012; the criminals just took the first few bags to come off the belt, and with the very long walk from plane to claim, they were long gone before we had even gotten there to watch our own bags.  The police told us that the airport used to enforce a ticketed passenger only policy, but got rid of that for budgetary reasons in 2007\/2008 time frame, so now anyone can come into the claim area.  They do have plain clothes police patrolling the area, but unless the same person comes to steal bags often enough, or is dumb enough to come in from outside and immediately take a bag versus coming in from the ticketing area so they appear to come from the airport side, they're not going to catch many thieves.  The cameras the airport had also had no record of the people taking our bags; no view of the belt in question, no view of the exits they apparently used.  How do I know the bags were stolen and the airline didn't just lose them?  Because we found the criminals by way of them trying to sell our belongings at a used clothing store; they confessed to stealing them off the belt.

Food-wise, the slightly better than fast food eating options in the airport have all proven to be poor to below average.  The food is typically not good, and the drinks are very expensive and not very strong.  I'd recommend eating before arriving and just buy a $4.50 bottle of water once you're through security.  Oh yeah, typically all the tables will be taken, so you'll probably be eating your food off the floor just like you'll be doing when waiting for your plane.

Finally, I hope you're not catching a cab.  The cab line is outside, which is really pleasant in the 100 degree heat.  Once you work your way to an available cab, the airport charges higher than average fees for cabs to do pickups (compared to other airports), so a rip the customer off mentality has developed amongst the cab drivers.  With the confusing exits from the airport, the cab drivers have become professionals at taking longer routes out that seem to be the most ideal way to go.  You'll pay a few dollars more and if you had not known better, would be none the wiser.  I've had to start telling drivers explicitly that I want them to take certain streets on the way to where I'm going.",3,1,1

Las Vegas McCarran is no different in those respects, its huge, it can take a lot of time to get into it and across it. Lines can often be really long to get through security and the car rental fees are among the highest in the nation.

Where McCarren gets it right is all about LV style, they make the airport fun. 

Lots of great stores and restaurants, lots of LV memorabilia, if you came to LV to gamble you can keep playing slots in many parts of the airport and there are lots of things to look at.

It may be just me but it seems they are never using the luggage turnstiles close to the terminals, they are nearly always empty while your are almost always at the opposite side of a very large luggage area.

Some of my gripes are the visitors themselves too. As our world become more rude and selfish people traveling seem to get worse too. With LV being a party place many tourists take on an entitled everything is about me attitude and forget other people are there too. They block isles, they hog the luggage areas, they are often in party mode on the planes and already have too much to drink before ever reaching the rental cars where the rudeness and potential for problems compound as they continue to drink and play. 

Sounds like I'm just complaining but McCarren seems to try had to get past these things and make the travel experience interesting, fun, distracting, and entertaining as possible.

Compared to other airports in the US, I would definitely rank it in the top 10.  The gates and security checkpoints are easy to navigate and I always find that the security personnel are rather friendly.

However, for those who are just casual travelers... I WOULD STRONGLY advise printing out your boarding pass at your home or office.  Although the security lines move pretty quick, you could spend 30-45 minutes waiting in line at the ticket counters for your boarding pass- This is unavoidable for casual travelers who need to check bags. You will also save a substantial amount of time if you opt to fly with only carry-on\/personal items. Vegas knows how to handle a line efficiently, however lines can be extremely long since Vegas is so popular.

On the bright side, McCarran offers slot machines around every corner (for the gamblers) - which is nice if there is an unexpected delay.  They also offer free wifi for travelers and they have several food options that are spread out within the airport (with more options being added quickly for the expansion).

Most weren't worth a comment, some were amazing and others were terrifying.  Overall, I have to say Las Vegas gets it right with McCarran.  It's not a surprise, nor should it be.  Vegas' life blood is tourism and the airport can make or break just how healthy we really are.  With Terminal 3 open now, the airport seems less congested.  For that matter, T3 is a quiet and open experience when compared to the longstanding Terminal 1.  Both terminals have ample parking:  covered short-term and long-term, economy, and now the addition of a cell phone lot for those times you need to wait.  No more orbiting the airport over and over!

For visitors to Vegas:  your auditory and visual experience beings at the airport.  After you weave your way through your arrival terminal and enter the baggage claim area in T1, you're awash in the sights and sounds of fabulous Las Vegas with slot machines and big screens all around presenting you with continuous advertisements for all the shows you might want to see.  Wade in and enjoy it, then catch your shuttle, limo, cab or Uber to your hotel and enjoy.  If you're landing and retrieving your luggage in Terminal 3, it's a much more traditional (non Vegas) experience, but don't worry, I'm sure this'll change as T3 matures.  Welcome to Vegas and thank you for being here instead of somewhere else!

Final thought:  the airport is amazingly quiet if you're making an early morning departure.  I've done this for most of my trips and love that there's rarely a line at the airlines for check-in, and at the security checkpoint.  When there is, it's hardly worth mentioning.  On a number of occasions I've checked my bags and walked through security without waiting at all, then had plenty of time to sit with a coffee and wait for my flight.  If you're departure gate is oriented the right way, you'll also get to enjoy a fantastic view of the city before and during sunrise.

So far, here's what I like about T3:
- Clean and contemporary design
- Checking-in is a breeze. There are several electronic check-ins located by the airline counters
- TSA checkpoint process is less-stressful in comparison to T1. It's larger and much more organized
- No traffic drama when it comes to drop-off and pick-up

This airport is flawless so really got nothing bad to say. I come in from Stockton, California Allegiant airlines. You land and they have signs directing you to the transport to take you to baggage claims. I generally only have a duffle bag on me so I don't really do baggage claims anymore , but when I did I had no problems. You exit baggage claims and go directly outside and decide which shuttles you want to take(Bell trans for the win!!!! Baby!!!!)  Pay the money for the round trip shuttle and hop on the next one and they will take you to your hotel. Call one day in advance and they will pick you up from your hotel and take you to the airport for your departure. It's really that easy. This is like that one city where I have the aiports mastered 100%...I'm not bragging but just keeping it real ;) . If you want you can take a limo to your hotel...whatever floats your boat. 

Now when leaving Vegas it's still not really complicated. go to your section of the airport(For me generally allegiant airlines) and they will get you your ticket. Now the TSA part is tricky. I've been to Vegas and had times when going through TSA was a breeze but also had times when the line was backed up for days. Basically if you are leaving in the Afternoon\/Evening then make sure you are at least an hour early for your flight.! If you go early in the morning then getting through is generally a breeze. Heck one time I lost my I.D. in Vegas but since I went to the airport so early they were able to get me figured out and situated pretty easily. If I would have went in the afternoon...probably would have been a different story!

This is an airport you love to land in but hate to depart in. 

The happiest part is when you are getting on your shuttle to go to the hotel and you look across the street at all the people leaving Vegas and you can't help but grin......don't laugh since that will be you next lol...",3,4,4

Why I was stuck at this airport for that long is another story, but it was an adventure. Not that I'm saying you should spend a night at the airport... but I mean if you are trying something new, why not.

Anyways on to the airport. This airport (domestic) is most busy on the weekends starting from Thursday night all the way to Monday morning. Most mornings going into the airport is packed. Most people try to catch the red-eye flight out. I don't know what the reason is for this, but seriously the airport is packed at like 4am. It's pretty ridiculous. Wifi is much faster than it is at SFO. 

I usually always fly United, so that's in the D gates where you have to take a tram. Occasionally I will take Southwest in the B\/C gates, no tram needed. So if you are flying out of D\/E gates make sure to get there earlier because you will need to make an extra trip. I have seen too many people miss their flight because they did not take into consideration the extra transportation needed to get to the gate.

Security at this airport moves pretty fast. They have a pretty good system going on here. Before the security to the D gates took forever, but with the new opening of the E gates, it is much faster. 

If you are looking for food.... I think that the B\/C gates have better food options than there are in D gates. I will tell you that I spent too much time at the D gates and the Wheel of Fortune from the slot machines still ring in my ears. D gates there are two sports bars, quizno's, hot dog place, sandwiches, smoothies, diner, California Pizza Kitchen. Of course all food here is on the pricier end. C gates have Sbarros, Wendy's Popeyes, mexican restaurants. Just better options period. 

So if you were stuck at this airport and all you really care about is food then I saw B\/C gates are better options, but if you want a more clean and new feeling I say D gates are better. 

Enjoy your time at McCarren International Airport. Time passes pretty fast when you're there.",1,1,1

It has slot machines in it which is completely badass. You get one last shot at some bug buck before you go and it does help pass the time while waiting for flights. Ok I am going to break this down now. 

Security:
We all have to take our shoes off and go through security. That can either be a very painful experience or it can be easy. Even though it is unpredictable I can say for all the times I have come here it has been easy. they have a system and they know how to move people through security quickly. the agents there really do not want to waste any time. They just wanna get people through and on their way. The only delays really come from people who are not prepared. 

Restaurants and shops:
This airport has plenty of restaurants and shops. They have the small little generic gift shops and they also have really nice high end type stores where you can get clothes, shoes and handbags. They have a good mix of fast food type places and sit down type places. Be aware that they charge airport prices though so get ready to pay more. 

Navigation:
This airport is really easy to navigate through. They have plenty of signs pointing you in the right direction. It is hard to get lost here. they have plenty of elevators, moving walkways, and escalators to help you get where you are going faster as well. Also getting out is easy. They have one area for people picking you up, another for taxis, and another for shuttles. It is very easy to get in and out.

When you fly in there you are pumped about being there and the ding ding of the slot machines gets you excited.  Until  you get to baggage claim and it takes a year and a half to get your bag.  OR maybe that's just when you fly American or another super popular airline since it didn't take that long this time when I flew Frontier.  Getting a cab is fairly easy but you have to queue up and if it is busy you will wait a while.

Check in at the gates has always been easy for me.  Once you get your boarding pass you walk to the tram to take you to the gate.  Why do you have to take a tram there?  It is separate from the main building?  Why are there so many restaurants and shops located before you go through security?  I want to sit and drink at these places but I also want to be close to my gate.  

Once you get to your gate they do have a selection of restaurants but I don't get why none of them really have waitresses.  Counter service only.  However, I'm not going to complain about Wolfgang Puck's express restaurant (Terminal D) - that chicken aioli sandwich was the bomb.  I thought it was funny how every drink has a size choice - I wanted chardonnay.  In the 6oz or 9oz?  (Clearly the only choice was 9oz in my mind...)  Beer in 16oz, 24oz, or 32oz.  Ah Vegas, it is always about the cash!! Upsell!  Upgrade!

The free WiFi was nice for surfing the net on my iPhone.  The option to play slot machines is also nice if you are bored and haven't lost all your money already.  People watching here is stellar too - and you can make up stories about them in your head.  Or you can eavesdrop on people talking about all the crazy stuff that went on while in Vegas.

For example, when I fly Delta I go to Terminal 1 and when I lookup Frontier, which is what I usually fly home, it tells me to go to Terminal 3. However, the last 3 times I've flown, I've gone to Terminal 3, gone through security over there (which in my opinion​ is way slower) only to find out my plane is actually flying out of Terminal 1 and I need to take the tram over there and walk for what seems like miles to the correct gate, when it would have been much easier to have been dropped off and gone through security in Terminal 1 to begin with.

Of course, it wouldn't be the main Vegas airport without a view of the Strip, slot machines and billboards of shows and hotels. The food options are limited and overpriced. I tried the Mexican restaurant here, and it was not good. I also tried the TCBY\/pretzel place, which was okay. 

Dropping off someone at the airport is usually hassle-free. You can park your car at the designated airline section, and help your someone unload their luggage, say your farewells, and watch them leave. But watch out for reckless drivers especially the taxis, and pedestrians in this area. 
Picking up someone at the airport is usually my least favorite part of this airport. You could park at short-term parking and wait for your someone at baggage claim or across the other side of the entrance, but this requires a few dollars. Another option is to try your luck and time your someone's arrival exactly, so you can do a fast pick up at the passenger pick-up area. But don't be surprised when a security guard comes with an attitude for you to move. 
If you're traveling alone, I would suggest parking in the economy lot and taking the shuttle to the airport to save money. But if your wallets are full from a successful gambling trip, park in long-term parking at the garage. 

One time, my plane was delayed for 4 hours...how did I survive? Free Wi-Fi! Makes time go by fast. If the airport was fancier like some of the other airports I've been to, that would bring up my review to 5 stars. Overall, I like McCarran.",2,0,1

I like the automated walkways, the art (yes, there's some art), the glitz of the slot machines, and the ads for shows, particularly in the huge baggage claim area.  And baggage claim has improved noticeably, bags arrive very quickly from the plane.  Free (but sometimes overloaded) WiFi.

How does it hamper or annoy?  I hate waiting for the gate-terminal trams.  Already mentioned the absence of power outlets.  Not enough seating in the gate area.  High priced food.

Love:

-It is close to my house and close to all things Las Vegas. 

-Parking prices are reasonable if you have to leave your car for an extended period of time. 

-The accessibility of the airport is quite good between the 215 freeway and Tropicana or Russell. 

-Terminal D kicks ass! It's the newest terminal with all the best goodies! It has the best selection of food, lots of natural light, and is just overall, a comfortable place to be relative to the rest of the airport. 

-Southwest (USAir used to) uses McCarran as a hub airport. 

-The random fact they have a 24-hour fitness gym here. 

-Slot\/Video poker machines. (I used to ritually put in $10 and play every time I went to the airport to pass the time and hopefully get my trip paid for. After my years of donations, you would think they would rename a gate or even bench after me :)

What I hate:

-Terminals A&B are older then dirt and show it. 

-Lack of food choices within terminals A&B and even C (granted C has done some remodeling and has a few better restaurants to choose from)

-Just the drab feel of the airport in general. Hell.... even Terminal 2, the charter\/international\/hawaii terminal feels old, dreary and depressing.

Let's start with the good things first:
1) This airport has a lot of slot machines. if you like to gamble, there are at least 200 separate machines for you to enjoy.
2) There is a very wide variety of shops and eateries in closely spaced areas. For example, there is a Coffee Bean about 35 feet from a Starbucks. The food court in the early-C terminal has a Burger King, Sabarro, a Mexican restaurant, and some takeout place.
3) If you like people watching, this is your airport. I don't think you can find a wider mix of people than in this airport.
4) There is free WiFi that you don't have to jump through too many hoops to use!  I'm on it right now and it's working great.

Now let's move to the bad things:
1) This airport has a lot of slot machines. They are loud. They are bright. They take up tons of room.If you're not a gambler, this will be the first thing that you notice when you're trying to take a nap.
2) Like most other airports except for John Wayne in Orange County, all the food is overpriced because they know you're trapped here.  Imagine paying $8 for a vegetarian Burger King burger.  I'm not exaggerating. I spent $12 on 3 small pork tacos.
3) Because this is a desert (and all airports don't want to lose money) the water pressure here is atrocious. I spent a full 40+ seconds trying to wash the guacamole sauce (from my $4 mini-tacos) off my hands.
4) For obvious reasons, this airport attracts the type of people that you wouldn't want noticing that you leave your wallet pocket unbuttoned.
5) There are only small designated ""recharge"" stations where you can plug in your laptop and such and they are always occupied because....
6) This airport is very crowded. Don't expect a peaceful experience, but thankfully there is a fair amount of seating.",0,1,0

On that tram, after a brutal weekend of poker, sports book and diginity losses, who should I happen to be standing shoulder to shoulder with on the tram, but none other than Iron Mike Tyson.  Now, I know he lives in Vegas and goes to award shows, but standing next to him was freaking awesome.  He said hi to a couple of us and then sat quietly with his family - seemed like a pretty normal dude (except the face tattoo, prison time, and ear biting - but thats in the PAST!).

There is free WIFI and it's actually pretty quick.  I was able to download a TV show in just 30 minutes.  While significantly slower than being at home, it's much faster than most airport WIFI setups.

The security here is fast, at least if you're in first or can use the first security lines.  They have a whole setup from start to finish just for the first class line, unlike most airports which force a merge after checking IDs.  This is helpful because of one of the major downsides of McCarran.

Now the bad.

My major problem with McCarran is the terminals are not connected airside. Not only are the terminals not connected, but sections inside Terminal 1 which could be easily connected are not.  In order to take advantage of the United Club in 1D when you are flying out of 1 A,B or C you must go through security twice.  When taking the tram to D you can literally see through a glass door to the A,B,C corridor.  Why is this door closed?  It must be better for business to allow passengers access to more shopping, dining and lounges?

The older A,B,C section of Terminal 1 is well...old.  Parts of it are closed or empty and there really aren't a lot of shopping and dining options.  Here's one big reason to allow access to the D gates.

McCarran was clearly designed with the pre 9\/11 security world in mind.

If you're flying out of Terminal 1 make sure you don't come too early. You won't have anything to do.  Maybe that's why they have all the slot machines.",0,0,0

As you move from your airplane to the baggage claim and transportation, each step is preparing you for your overall Las Vegas experience:  Noise, lights and lines.  And possibly some confusion. 

The Good:  The airport is clean, modern, lots of places to eat and sit in the gate area.  The transportation from the gates to the terminals (and there are not 2 major terminals, so make sure you know where your airline really is!)   The new rental car facility is nice, modern, and uses a single shuttle bus for most rental car companies.  The lines for security are the longest of any airport I travel through and many of the mutants that visit Vegas are not clear on the concept of how to go through security efficiently.  (That may explain why Ma and Pa Kettle pack their entire house in to their carry owns and have to dissemble it in to 14 plastic containers to go through the metal detectors.)

The Bad:  Lines.  Lines to get a taxi.  Lines to get transportation to your airport.  Lines for the rental car shuttle.  Just lines.  Things are not always clear which door to exit from to get your specific type of transportation, so check and then check twice.    

Recommendation:  Arrive during off hours.  Either late at night or in the middle of the day.  Depart EARLY morning (before 6AM) or after about 2pm.  That seems to make the airport zoo a bit more tolerable.

Foolish me was not paying attention while planning a trip and ended up here with a five hour layover beginning at 9pm.  We were headed home to Hawaii, and thought it would be fine.  Land, grab some food, catch some sleep, hop on the plane, continue our sleep, and be home in time for breakfast with friends.  I did not count on the airport not being ready to help me with my plans.

Why, oh why, in an airport with flights at all hours of the day and night, would all of the restaurants close at 9pm?  Why would the only things open be the news stand and a pizza hut serving whatever had been under the heat lamp for the past few hours?  

Why, oh why, would there be no signs telling people how to get from the main terminal to the itty bitty terminal one needs to find to check into Hawaiian Airlines?  And why when you find your way to the itty bitty terminal would there be nothing warning you that you won't get to check in until an hour before your flight, no matter that the pre-security waiting area is nothing more than a line of empty counters and a few scattered seating areas?  No food, hidden restrooms, and no space for the plane-full of people who assembled, waiting for the check-in process to begin.  Most of my layover was spent standing, waiting for someone to fire up the computer.  I've never cursed having checked luggage more than for this flight, not even the time I moved from Germany to Korea with a 6 year old and 9 bags all weighing 70 pounds each.  

Because the flight was not available for check in ahead of time, I had to stay ahead of the high school group which filled the entire coach section of the plane.  There were a few hundred teenagers, their adult handlers, and a few scattered families and other late night travelers. We were easy to pick out, as we were the only ones not wearing the school colors (maroon and white) and we were the ones battling to be first in line so we could find places to sit once we made it past security.

At some point during my endless purgatory, a friendly worker asked me if I had enjoyed my time in Vegas.  I explained that  I had been to Vegas before, and enjoyed it very much, but that this was just a layover.  I also told him that this was quite possibly the worst airport experience I'd had in 40 years of air travel, and that if I never returned to Vegas it was simply because I wanted to avoid this airport.

Obviously, I have realized that the on-the-spot review might have been a bit harsh, so I've settled on rounding up to two stars instead of down to one.

Like others have mentioned, it's slow, hot, and disjointed around here. The terminal seems pretty cramped as well - way too many people for the space. The lighting is terrible and just adds to the dingy, dated look. I personally hate the slot machines everywhere - they take up valuable walking\/people space and are almost always empty!!! They could halve the number of them and improve the airport significantly. 

The only pro is that there are a wide variety of food and retail stores. Downside is that the lines can be long - especially for popular places like Coffee Bean.

It was more crowded than LB and Burbank, but people in Vegas don't have like 5 choices of airports to fly out of.  There is a wide variety of places to eat at and shop at while waiting for your flight, and they had very clean facilities.

It was a turn-off to see the HUGE mass of people at the security checkpoint for gate D at 5:20 a.m. (it was also for gates A, and B, I believe), but the lines moved really, really fast.  There were at least 250 people waiting in 2 separate lines, but the BF and I got through in about 10 minutes.  The personnel here were very professional and organized, and people who thought they were late to 6 a.m. flights got through in time.

The seats at the actual gates were not as cushy as I had hoped, but at least they were clean and looked very new.  I also wished they had movable armrests!  I wanted to lay down across three seats, but nope, I couldn't :(

And this despite the numbers of people who flow through daily.  The whole place is kept very clean.  The baggage claim is more clearly laid out and marked than most other airports.  The most complicated part is tracking the public transportation options -- there are several and the signs start to split unclearly in trying to direct people between the taxis on one side and the shuttles\/limos on the other.  (If you've got the time, I recommend the shuttles.  They're about half the price of the taxis and you can arrange round trip from the outset.)  Fortunately there are a large number of information people from the airport and several of the Strip hotels around to answer questions.

Now, the individual airline check-ins are another issue entirely -- they're pretty much awful across the board.  But if you survive them, I've never had issues with security lines and there's a wealth of food, shopping, and, of course, gambling, to be had throughout the terminal in case you've built in too much time . . . which, in my experience, is rarely an issue.

Nonetheless, check-in at McCarran was fast and easy and despite the long security line I got through pretty quickly which was great since I was hung over.
From there getting to my gate was not a problem. I have to say that TSA at McCarran were the nicest and most laid back I've experienced at any airport in this country. 

Again, citing my hungover state, it would have been nice to have more food (as in hangover food) venues in my immediate gate area. A smoothy wasn't going to cut and the lone Mexican place had a long line (and the site of margaritas scared me and sent me in the other direction)

Mitte 2012 wurde Terminal 2 geschlossen und gleichzeitig das nagelneue Terminal 3 für internationale Verbindungen eröffnet. Ich habe es vor kurzem testen können und bin positiv angetan.
Groß, hell, luftig, übersichtlich, perfekt ausgezeichnet. Der erste Eindruck nach der Landung. Gut, die Wege sind lang, aber bei welchem großen Flughafen sind sie es nicht. Dieser Airport zählt zu den vier meist frequentierten Flughäfen der USA. Und das ist eine Messlatte!
Die Immigration-Prozedur schnell, flüssig und vor allem freundlich. Nun gut, man muss sich die Finger bzw. Hände scannen lassen, wird fotografiert. Bekommt dann aber freundliche Wünsche mit auf den Weg, den Aufenthalt zu genießen. Entscheidend ist allerdings auch, wie man selber auftritt. Nörgelnde Gesichter, unangebrachte Kommentare sind nicht unbedingt hilfreich.
Bei der Zollkontrolle gibt man diesen eigenartigen Zettel ab, den man im Flugzeug ausgefüllt hat. Wofür der sinnvoll ist, ist mir trotz meiner vielen Reisen in die USA bisher nicht aufgegangen. Nett jedoch auch hier der Kommentar bei der letzten Einreise: I like your hair  wo schon in der Welt wird man so begrüßt und die Frisur gelobt?
Die Koffer kamen zügig, wir standen ca. 15 Minuten am Band. Ist man dann im Ankunftsbereich begrüßen einen die ersten Spielautomaten. Man mag das kritisch kommentieren, ich mache es nicht, denn wir sind hier in Las Vegas!! Wer daran etwas auszusetzen hat, der sollte schlichtweg nicht hierher reisen. Ich bin schon recht häufig in dieser Stadt gewesen, haben noch nie auch nur einen Cent fürs Gambling eingesetzt. Das kann jeder für sich entscheiden. Und trotzdem kann man diese Stadt genießen.
Positiv ist die Nähe des Fllughafens zur Stadt. In ca. 10 Minuten ist man mit dem Taxi mittendrin. Von jedem Hotel am Strip kann man, wenn das Zimmer in einer hohen Etage ist und Richtung Flughafen blickt, das Geschehen dort wie im Kino betrachten. Und trotzdem stören keinerlei Fluggeräusche in der Stadt.
Auch die Ausreise ist jetzt einfach und bequem. Bis auf die sehr präzisen Sicherheitskontrollen, die schon nerven können  nur: letztendlich dienen sie der eigenen Sicherheit.
Fazit: Seit Eröffnung des Terminal 3 ist der McCarran International Airport eine Flughafen, der seine Funktion reibungslos erfüllt. Was mehr erwartet man als Passagier. Und wer will, kann dann auch vor dem Abflug noch die letzten Dollar und Cents an Automaten verspielen (und mit Glück vermehren). Vier Sterne.

Okay, back then I couldn't even put one damn quarter in but, oh well, what the hell do I care, I'm in VEGAS biatches!!!  Well, let's just say that my many trips to and from McCarran after that was all a blur cause I was NEVER sober coming or going.

Fast forward to 2004 and I now live in Vegas and where do I happen to work? At McCarran! So what I'm gonna break down to you, take it to heart..after working at McCarran for over 6 years and at all the checkpoints, I kinda know it like the back of my hand, so I'm gonna try and get as in-depth as I can.

Busy travel days: Thursday, Friday, Sunday and Monday are busier than the rest of the week so keep in mind to give yourself plenty of time if you are traveling out on these days.  I would recommend getting to the airport at least 1 1\/2 hrs just to give yourself some cushion (2 hrs if there is a large convention in town) unless you are the type that likes the last minute heart pumping energy rush of maybe missing your flight and begging to cut the lines while everyone rolls their eyes at you...Busy travel times- Mornings tend to be busier then evening flights so if you can, book your flights for later in the day.

Checkpoints- A\/B Gates, can get busy but since it's the smallest of the three checkpoints doesn't have such a long wait line as the other checkpoints. 
C Gates services mostly Southwest Airlines so on certain dates (see busy travel days above) can also get pretty busy as Southwest probably has the most flights in\/out of Vegas.  There are actually three ways to access C Gates now, one lane at the D gates and now, a connection to A\/B gates so even if you went through A\/B you can access C gates after security.  There is also the new C Annex located at the end of ticketing by the Southwest counters and has plenty of lanes and also allows you access to the A\/B gates since they are now connected after you get through security.
D Gates is the busiest of all the checkpoints as they service all the major carriers (United, Delta, Continental, American, Alaska, and a few others).  Again, refer to the busy travel days and give yourself plenty of time.

Food- YES, there is food after you get through security...I really don't know why people ask that question over and over again..don't all airports have food\/drink\/bars\/lounges by your gates?? Why would McCarran be any different?  Are there better restaurants at certain gates? Well- it really depends on you right?  Burger King is king at McCarran so don't bother looking for a McDonald's cause there is none. Sit down restaurants? Sure there are some but nothing notable except Chili's at the A\/B gates... Also, keep in mind that some of these places close early during the week as it can get pretty dead some nights, so if you are traveling out on a red eye on a Weds night, you might want to pick up something on the way since you probably won't have a lot of options.

Bathrooms! Okay so here's the deal, at D Gates, the bathrooms are BEFORE security, once you get through security, there are NO bathrooms until you get off the tram to the gates SO if you gotta go, then you need to do it before you start lining up. A\/B gates, there are bathrooms close by both before and after security, the same goes for C Annex Gates.  Now- as far as where the cleaner bathrooms are, D gates is kept up okay, same with A\/B gates.  C Annex bathrooms before security only has 4 stalls and can get pretty nasty so I would advise you wait until after you get through security and use the bathrooms by the gates as they tend to be cleaner.

Baggage claim- can be a nightmare cause it seems like the airlines are always changing which carousel your bags are coming out on after they tell you so just check the monitors when you get down there before you ask us, cause some of us don't work for the airlines so asking us where your bags will be arriving will only get a blank stare as we point you to the direction of the monitors that tells you which carousel to look for...

Taxis are readily available but that taxi queue can get pretty long when there is a large convention in town (CES and AVN together is always a mess) and can cost a pretty penny ($20-$30) but gets you to your destination quicker than the shuttle.  Airport Shuttles are cheaper ($7 per person one way) and you have to ride with others as they stop to drop off people along the way so depending on your needs, you can make the call.

I like that McCarran is located right next to UNLV and only about a 10 minute drive to the Strip. McCarran itself is like a teaser for out-of-town guests. Slot machines are littered throughout the airport and clips for big name shows are played on repeat on huge TV screens. Short-term parking is the way to go for quick drop offs. If you're parked for less than 15 minutes it's free, but I usually end up paying $2-4 when picking up or dropping off family and friends. You pay for parking on level 2 where the main walkway is, or on level 2M Excalibur. Long-term parking is $16 per day. Ouch. Try to have someone drop you off at the airport so you can avoid paying long-term parking if you're going to be out of town for a few days. The McCarran Airport is clean and spacious. There's charging stations for all your tech equipment located near the gates and moving walkways to help get you where you need to go quicker. The food and restaurant selection is pretty good, but not the best I've seen. All in all, McCarran is a solid airport that I'm finally getting familiarized with!

The one thing I love about this airport is that it is clean and there is never a lack of being able to purchase food or look for a restroom and the service is awesome. I never have to wait long for my bags because on this last trip I literally went to the restroom and my bags came out so fast that when I went to look for them they had pulled them aside for me and had them ready. 
Because this airport though is so big my one big gripe is that when you are picking someone up you have to go through the parking lot on the 2nd floor which unlike SFO of SJC or even Oakland you can pick people up right outside of the baggage claim area. This airport has 3 building which you can take a bus too and it is really cheap. They have an area just for Lyft and Uber pick up and a different location for taxi cabs. I have to say though that they are pretty well organized but again the airport is very big but there is always someone around to point you in the right direction. 
Also, they have carts everywhere for convenience if you end up carrying a lot of luggage like me and if you are waiting let's just say there is no lack of entertainment because there are slot machines everywhere and in the Southwest area they have a slot machine with a smoking room. I know bad habit but I will kick it soon enough. Also, many of the shops have good prices on merchandise if you are looking to do that last minute gift shopping as you are leaving the airport. The restrooms are kept clean but they don't have the fancy toilet seat cover that Chicago has but not even fancy seat covers will ever make me go to Chicago Airport again.

The first time I did fly through here instead of driving the Vegas from Arizona where I lived at the time, I flew Delta. I had a layover too which to me having a layover in LAX when i'm trying to fly from Phoenix was pretty stupid, but hey the flight was at a good cost. Anyways, I was delayed from LAX to McCarran for about 2 hours. Little did I know this was just the beginning of Delta ruining what was supposed to be an easy travel.

After leaving Vegas and heading back my flight in McCarran was delayed from Delta for their, as always, unorganized and messy way of running their airline. Once I finally got on my plane and got to LAX again where I was sure that I was going to miss my flight, I did miss it! lol. Then my new flight to Phoenix was delayed 4 hours. We're talking I am sitting in the airport at 1am now, when I should have landed and been home hours ago. I finally get on the plane and make it home by 3:30am, thanks Delta. I don't blame McCarran for this or LAX as an airport. I'm sure most airports would dump Delta if they were allowed to,all this does is reflect on the airport from the opinion of a lot of people and that's not fair.

The food selection in this airport is pretty decent, I just wish they put an in n out burger in this airport, that would be a great addition and probably would end up being one of the most popular food choices in the entire airport. When I was here last I ate at the Home Turf sports bar and grill to catch a burger and some water since I was pretty parched from the Vegas trip.

There's nothing like landing in an airport and having slot machines (over 1200) striking their moneymaking noises everywhere. Yup, you're in Vegas. This out dated airport is more of a representation of the old downtown Vegas then the more upscale and modern strip.

I really wish Clark County had some money they can use to build a new airport. The renovations and expansion of the D gates are an improvement but it still lacks in amenities and capacity as compare to other modern airports that I used.

The main deficiencies are dining options. There needs to be more places to eat then just California Pizza Kitchen and Ruby's Diner. It's not exactly what you expect after having extravagant brunches and dinners at some of the best restaurants in the country. A lot of reviews mention the funky, Elvis hip swinging, sleezy casino smell; I didn't notice it in the newer D gates.

I do like the friendly service from the people working in the airport to the people running the cab lines to even the TSA security. The security and cab lines look long but it usually goes through pretty fast.

If you want to save a few dollars with the cab ride, don't pay by credit card. It's inticing to swipe the card till you find out later they bill you a ""voucher"" fee of $3 bucks. It's really a ripoff because they don't tell you explicitly it's a fee; instead disguising it in ambiguous wording as a ""voucher"". Anyways, that's just the start as you will eventually get your shirt taken in the casinos or max out your debit card in the strip bars. Well, just consider that the entertainment cost.

My husband and I come here sometimes twice a year (although Hawaiian Airlines is at another gate, separate from the main building of the airport)- and I come here for work to renew my security badge (visit the badging office on one side (near the 2nd level entrance and metro way over the other side, above baggage pickup). I also come here to drop off people (family or co-workers)- these are quick trips, though. The short term parking has changed from self-service quarters to flat fees (the minimum charge being $2.00). 

There are little shops (check out the bijoux turner store where everything is $10), restaurants (but you know that airport costs a little more), slot machines (!), a gym, a post office, and historic displays all throughout the floor level (near ticketing) and 2nd level. Lots of bathrooms and seating all over the airport. The airport is well-maintained- I always see cleaning people making their rounds. Kudos to them for doing their jobs.  

The 3 ounce rule on toiletries\/liquids for carry-ons (one baggie allowed), is fully enforced. I always check the TSA rules online. (It doesn't seem like the carry-on bag rule is enforced, though- I see large items all the time.) Do not place coins in a plastic bag in your carry-on! My husband made that mistake a couple times, and then the bag had to get searched (they can't see what it is on the x-ray machines). Wear shoes that are easy to take off and get back on.

I had a flight leaving Vegas at 9am for New York, transferring at Phii,  and I arrived at the security check at around 8:15. Usually that was way more than enough time to go through security check and get boarded. But it was so PACKED at the security check in T1 to Gate D that there were at least over 300 people standing in line waiting to get through. But they still chose to open only 3 lanes! THREE LANES! I saw TSA officers talking and laughing with each others, while hundreds of people waiting. I don't know if they are on duty or not. But their uniforms look like so. 

I stood in line for almost half an hour trying to get in. And when I finally get through (no accident whatsoever at the security check), I arrived at my gate 2 minutes late after the gate was closed. I was put on stand by for both flights and the AA lady told me there was a very good chance for me to get on the flight from Vegas to Phili. However, my second half of the journey would be a little unsure. So there may be a chance that I have to find a place to stay in Phii and then fly to New York on the next day. 

Imagine my anger. 

And I was not even the only one. There was a gentleman already waiting at the closed gate and he was probably only a minute ahead of me. And he missed the flight for exactly the same reason. After I had my flight arranged, a couple arrived and the gentleman came asking me if the flight leaving at 9 was already gone. And they were late, too, because of the long line at the security check.

I am not suggesting they should do anything less at the security check. It is for everyone's safety. I am not suggesting, either, to open all gates even when there is only a short line. But TSA, when you are looking at this many people waiting and trying to catch their flights, isn't it your responsibility to accommodate accordingly?!

Cheap short term parking. $2 to park, go meet someone and grab their stuff then get the heck out of there. And you can pay before you even get back in the car. A quick stop at the gate at the bottom of the parking garage to feed the machine your ticket and you're outta there. 

Cons: The highway signage for where to go for arrivals vs. departures is confusing. The loops and turns and various ramps coming in and splitting off as you try and get to where you can drop someone off is just bad roadway design, period. 
The Airport Police on the departure side of the terminal and that work the pedestrian gates allowing taxis access on the arrival side can be surly and have a serious attitude. 
The interior advertising needs some updating and some more variety of ads. If someone's flight is delayed coming in you'll have the Venetian ad music stuck in your head for days. And seriously, we've got so much here to see, do we really need more Chris Angel promos? Ugh. 
Arriving passengers coming into the D Gates seem to get confused on how to board the tram if they're not going to Terminal 3. I'm used to getting the call...how in the heck do I get to the terminal? Bad signage. It sucks. 
Oh and if you're tired or had a little too much Vegas you're going to walk a lot from checking in to getting on the plane. It's like are we freakin there yet and you've still got more walking to do. 

Don't forget if you arrive at McCarran and catch a cab and the driver takes you to the Strip via the Airport Tunnel you just got screwed...it's called longhauling. Don't put up with it, Google the Taxi Authority phone number and report that cab. The faster, cheaper way to the strip is not via the Interstate and the tunnel. 

All things considered I still like McCarran...where else can you play loose slots while waiting on a flight? For picking up out of town guests I can get in and out pretty fast now that I'm familiar with the place.",3,2,3

A tip I'd give to travelers is you really need to give yourself extra time if you rented a car. The car rental area is far from the terminals and you have to take a shuttle from the rental drop off area to the airport.

There are 2 terminals at McCarran International Airport (T1 and T3). T1(A-C) has a majority Southwest Airline flights. T3-D domestic, and T3-E domestic and international. Terminal T3 is the newest terminal at the airport. D has a linear design and E is designed like an X. All terminals are connected via an underground train.

T3 has a great design. High ceilings, lots of windows, ample seating in gate areas. I have not noticed any cramped areas throughout T3. I don't shop at airports, but there seems to be enough retail scattered around. There are recharge stations all over the airport. They are much better than the freestanding Samsung charging stations I see at most airports. There are electrical outlets and usb ports at each station.

T3 Baggage claim also has a linear design. If your luggage is sent to a high number claim carousel, then prepare yourself for a long walk. 1,2,3,4,5,6... are we there yet.... 15,16,17.... not yet.... 20! Made it! Ok, that is definitely an extreme exaggeration, but it is a noticeably long walk depending on the carousel your flight is assigned.

In fact, the size of this behemoth airport, which I hope is getting 1\/20th the traffic it predicted thanks to the economic downturn, is absolutely re-fricking-dick-u-less! 

I arrived here from Palm Desert with 90 minutes to make a plane change. But getting from the D-Concourse to the C-Concourse, in 90 minutes, was like trying to run a marathon with two broken legs. A Nightmare I tell you!

You're forced to take something like a tram. I was alone in my two trams and I was scared. It was dark and I saw no security whatsoever anywhere. It smelled bad in there. They should have passed out stun guns or something before putting women alone on these things. 

Next, because I had the misfortune to change concourses, airport policy meant I had to go through the security line where you take off your shoes and empty out your laptop. Grrrr! For some reason I made the random extra search draw too. JOY! After 35 minutes in a line of about 300 people, I got wanded and questioned, and then was finally allowed to go on my way. 

Now I had to take another tram. Again I was alone in a dark stinky tram. 

The airport is configured in straight lines that lead to circular hubs. All those damn hubs look alike! I was confused about which of two arms on this hub I should take and so, naturally, I took the wrong one. Since my gate was not all the way at the end, I had to turn around and walk  back. I didn't mind the walk, but I was getting short on time. I know that on some level this was my fault, but I'm usually good with directions which means this airport is way too confusing. 

I finally arrived at my plane which was just about to close its doors. NO!! YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME IN THIS HORRID PLACE!!! 

I never slacked off, sat down, got a coffee (now you know I'm suffering without my DAMN COFFEE!) or rested for 85 minutes of my 90 minute plane change, and I still came perilously close to missing my flight. That's not right.

I guess because travelers are miserable here, the employees are conditioned to be unfriendly. I get grumpy when concessions stands are closed for no reason leaving no choices, and those that are open charge the most outrageous prices for inedible junk.

It all adds up to a really bad last impression, or awful first impression, of Vegas.

Cleanliness:

It's clean, sometimes. Not spotless, but hey, it's airport.

Service(s):

The information desk employees are friendly, and atleast they know what they're doing.

The signs for departure\/arrival are pretty easy to read on nice LCD screens.

I wish there signs for where which escalator flights would be coming down from instead of asking attendants on the floor. 

If you can avoid it, don't schedule flights arrival\/departure on Fridays & Weekends. The airport is packed.



Terminal 2: International flights & Hawaii.

The signs for Terminal 2 are easy to miss. 
I hope they can make it easier to access and find. Maybe even just a big TERMINAL 2 sign.

Parking:

No covered parking here, but the parking rates are the same as Terminal 1.

Cleanliness:

It's a mess in there. It looks dirty, and it feels dirty. If you have to stay long for any reason, remember to carry antibacterial.

There are only 4 carousels for luggage. This isn't bad in my opinion. It makes it easier to find your stuff if anything.

I love flying in and out of McCarran.  I get dropped off at the main entrance and quickly make my way to security without issue.  The lines flow quickly for the most part and sometimes I even come across some friendly TSA agents (though they can be hard to spot).  Depending on which terminal I am flying from I get to see some cool stuff.  When flying Southwest out of the C Gates I get to see the old McCarran that I grew to know as a kid flying out here as an unaccompanied minor to visit my dad.  It brings back good memories.  If I fly to SFO on a different airline (United, Continental, etc) I fly out of the D Gates.  They are much newer and cleaner than C Gates and feel like a mall.  It has a very modern look.  And I love the tram than takes me to the D Gates.  It starts above ground and ends underground.  It is like a mini subway here in Vegas.  Its one of those little things in life that makes me happy.  As for coming home, the trams from both C and D Gates drop you right near baggage claim and it is an easy exit from there.  Usually my dad is waiting there for me.  I have taken the bus and that was a bit of a pain.  I had a hard time finding the bus platform.  Just follow the signs and you'll be fine.  It just may take some time, thats all.

For my hatred of McCarran, picking up incoming passengers as opposed to being one.  I have picked up a buddy of mine twice and both times we kept missing each other with the couple of different bridges from baggage claim to the parking structure.  One time he walked on the  lower bridge all the while I was on the opposite.  The next time he walked the upper.  The confusion did not end there either.  You have different levels of the parking structure with the same number.  Like Level 2 and Level 2M.  Its not just a different section but a totally differnent level.  People on the elevator get lost all the time and end up getting off too soon and getting right back on.  I learned my lesson from picking up my friend so yesterday when I had to pick up my aunt I went in to baggage claim and waited for her.  There are so many escalators for people to come down I did not know where to watch for her.  I nearly missed her despite my best effort.  Nevertheless I did find her and we retrieved her luggage quickly and it was back out to the parking lot of doom.  I should have used the ""Pay Here"" kiosks to get out of the parking lot but no, I left the ticket in my car.  So I proceeded to the pay booths at the exit.  One lane was open that was accepting cash.  I got in that line and sat for nearly 15 minutes before I relaized it was not moving.  I don't know if the front car was broken down or if it was just some idiot fishing for loose change.  Either way it was frustrating.  I ended up at a kiosk at the exit and using a card to pay.  A card a put in the direction indicated by the picture on the machine.  It was the wrong way.  A quick turn around and my aunt and I were finally off.

As we got off the tram, my husband started fiending for coffee, which he detoured to Starbucks, which they mistakenly heard him say his name was ""Manuel"" instead of ""Daniel"" while I went to our baggage carousel (thank goodness for three sons).

After retrieving our luggage, we headed to the Rental Car Shuttle. I sincerely wish I got the Shuttle Operator's name because she was as nice and friendly as ever. She made everyone in the front get up and make room for my 76 year old mother-in-law.

By the way, I LOVE THEIR RENTAL CAR SERVICES and the staff that works there!

As for returning to Honolulu, my awe of McCarran International Airport shimmied down a notch because of the LONG LINES of TSA as well as no convenient web-check-in counters like Hawaiian Airlines on Oahu! I know, I know...the policies and regulations but you would figure that it has been over 10 years since 9-11 that they would have found a better way to accommodate traveler's in efficiently and quickly passing traveler's through (like hire more staff to check IDs).

Anyhow, I noticed also that their slot machines are rigged differently up to where your money is easily swallowed up. For example, Wheel of Fortune slot machines. At the casinos, any time you hit a spin (it doesn't have to be THREE spins), you spin. But, at the airport...you need to hit THREE spins to get a spin. I felt bad for the people that were trying to their last minute luck before boarding and probably lost the last of their money before sadly boarding on their plane.

All in all, the airport is all right. You can spend the time playing slots or reading. Better yet, you can walk around and look at the stores that they have available. What is even better is if you BUY something to eat so you won't have to eat airplane food? 

Good airport. Clean and friendly with money hungry slot machines like a bar hostess if you allow yourself to be swayed by the promises of possible wealth and beating the odds.

I flew into here last week and had no problems... Arriving \/ departing out of the D gates requires using the tram over so keep that in mind.

I booked my flight through US Air but it was operated by United... SO when I went to the kiosk and entered my confirmation code it would not work. I had to ask the lady for help and it went right through with her access card.

I was running behind schedule and arrived at the airport an hour before I was scheduled to leave, and I walked right into my gate and they were boarding. So mid week during the spring it takes about 35 minutes to go start to finish.

One would think that with Las Vegas being a major destination city that the city would invest more money into making it a great representation of what the city has to offer, but with the exception of some slot machines scattered around, the airport is drab and rundown; in fact, its appearance reminds me of a bar\/club when the lights come on at 2 AM and you realize you've been in a shit-hole the entire time.  

While free Wi-Fi is offered, you have to log-in several times due to timeouts.  Dining options (I am tempted to put ""dining"" in quotes because its rather duplicitous here) are basically a haphazard splattering of fast food chains with Popeye's probably being the best option.  I've had both Starbucks and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, and both were underwhelming taste and service-wise.  I imagine that the restrooms at Walmart are comparable if not better than the restrooms at McCarran, so enter at your own risk.

The past two departing flights that I've had out of McCarran have had significant delays, which is odd because I've never experienced nearly as much delay in any other airport, including LAX!  The past delay was due to another flight being moved to our gate, so we had to wait for an unscheduled flight to board before ours, causing a much later departure time. While we were waiting to board, several alarms went off in the airport with announcements that they were being investigated.  With the drastically delayed flights, slim dining options, and poor restroom facilities, this airport certainly dampers one's vacation.   

Considering all of the accumulated poor experiences with this airport, I will now avoid it whenever possible.  The little extra bit of money to have a direct flight with no connection\/transfer through Las Vegas will be well worth it in terms of time saved and grief avoided.  For future Las Vegas-specific trips where I obviously have no other option but to fly to\/from McCarran, I will be sure to take advantage of bar offerings both pre- and post-flight to avoid any recollection of the experience.",0,0,0

I've been through here a few times so this will be my attempt at a combined review addressing some of the other reviewers comments.

Flying Southwest - I'm not sure why people are saying they don't have touch screens, but... they do.  McCarran combines multiple airlines into a single kiosk.  All the kiosks along the windows by Southwest are Southwest (and additional airline) kiosks.  Southwest flies out of concourse C, which seems to have pretty quick security lines (far right along the wall where C & D - first class, lines are).

Flying United - United is easy enough if you're a regular flier.  The usual kiosks and desks are available.  I can't tell you much about the regular D security lines, but the first class line can be a pain.  The line leads up to one or two security stations, but is allowed to filter to any.  When people up front aren't aware of this, the line backs up.  Also, plan for a bit of extra time since concourse D is a decent tram ride and walk.

Other stuff - Yes, there are slot machines here, and I don't know why people complain since loss and gambling seem to go together.  There is a gift shop, etc... If you're flying with other folks on different airlines, hang out with them BEFORE security, since you will not be going to the same place.  I also think the signs here are lacking, which leaves people looking around for where they're going.

Overall... well who cares about the airport?  You're headed to McCarran for other reasons.",0,0,0

There are three security checkpoints that lead to different gates (A,B, C, and D).  One takes you to A and B in the older part of the airport.  These gates don't offer a lot in terms of food or enough places to sit, but security is always a breeze to get through.  Another security checkpoint takes you to the C gate, which is an old run down hallway that Southwest uses.  Security is easy to get through, but from what I remember the food choices include several fast food joints ($10 Subway footlongs- yikes) and Cabo Wabo.  They are currently remodeling this gate.  The final security checkpoint takes you to the D gates, which is the newest area of the airport.  Security takes a little longer to get through, but the terminal is bright and fancy and has nice stores and restaurants.  My planes never leave from the D gates.  Sigh.

In all, if you follow the signs overhead it's easy to find where you need to go.  Security is pretty easy to deal with and I've never waited an insane amount of time in line, even during the holiday season.  Sunday afternoons can be pretty busy though, so give yourself a little more time if your plane is leaving on a Sunday.  

Driving to the airport is easy, parking is easy- it's super close to the strip so it's convenient.  There's a giant taxi staging area that usually moves pretty fast so you can get to your hotel quickly and enjoy your vacation.

Tip: If there are only one or two of you getting into a cab, try asking in the taxi area if anyone else is going to the same casino as you.  There are only a handful of casinos on the strip, so you are bound to find someone else to share a cab with.

Not the best airport in terms of food choices, sitting, or overall looks, but certainly one of the easiest to deal with.  Plus, nothing greets you to Las Vegas quite like the sound of slot machines as soon as you get off your plane!",1,0,1

 McCarran International Airport has gone though a massive renovation to entice travelers to travel and stay in Las Vegas. Advertisements from every show and hotel on the strip will be found here in any of their LED screens. 

In one part of the airport, you can check into your hotel right away before even stepping into your registered hotel. This airport is unlike no other and is quite unique in my opinion. Slot machines all around this airport with the sound of the slots in the background give it that Vegas vibe. 

Sometimes you'll see commercials of Carrot Top, Blue Man Group, Jawacobes doing commercials for airport safety. Quite comedic if you ask me. LOL 

Staff here are always moving just like Las Vegas is on the go. Outside you'll run into more commercials ads from the hotels and casinos to again entice you to stay and gamble. Limos and cabs are endless and you'll never have to wait too long for a ride.

So to be fair, this is not a review of the airprort from a ""Hey, I'm just passing through"" perspective and it is primarily concerned with terminal 1.  
Things I like:  1) When you land you know you are in Vegas; the lights, the sounds, the slots, really sets the tone for a good time  2) Signage was plentiful and easy to follow 3) Plenty of seats in the common terminal areas with power outlets 4) The onsite mini-museum for aviation.  
Things I didn't appreciate quite as much:  1) The audio and visual overload in the baggage claim area; god help you if you need to make a call  2) Lack of signage and direction to on-site amenities outside of security.  If you wander around enough you can find a few decent places (non-fast food) places to eat, but I didn't find or see any directories which made it simple.  Granted, not everyone has the time to kill that I did, but hey, it's my review for my experience  3) Check in area, at least for Delta is kind of depressing, dingy and not well lit  4) Prioritization for the unprepared.  Seen this a few times I have flown out of here now; folks invariably arrive later for their flights here than any other major airport and the folks (like me) who show up with enough time to check bags and get to the gate are asked to wait while  the latecomers are moved to the front of the line.  5) Very diificult to find a semi-quiet space in the airport to read unless you belong to one of the airline clubs. 6) Layout reflects an aiport that has grown over the years and not a well planned design.  The trams are nice, but the navigation from check in to the Delta gates to get to the tram seemed to be a bit much for the older folks and those who chose to bring two carry-ons.",0,0,1

 Eins der Highlights ist die Nähe zum Strip, mit ein wenig Glück hat man bereits beim Anflug einen wundervollen Blick auf die hell beleuchteten Hotelkomplexe. Auch wenn diese zum greifen nah erscheinen und sich der Flughafen bis direkt an den Strip (vom Terminal gesehen) erstreckt, so sind es doch einige Meilen - ein Fußmarsch kommt also eher nicht in Frage.


 Meist hat man bereits einen nationalen Flug hinter sich so das einem die langwierigen Prozeduren für internationale Reisende erspart bleiben. Je nach Fluglinie kann man mehr oder weniger Glück mit dem Gepäck haben, je nach Ankunftsterminal brauchen die Jungs gern mal bis zu 2 Stunden bevor das Gepäck am Baggage Claim angelangt ist.

I remember what McCarran looked like before the new addition of termnail and am constantly reminded of it when I fly into Las Vegas on Hawaiian Airlines. Hawaiian is located at the old part of the terminal; isolated more or less from the other carriers. 

That said- don't try to make any connections to other airlines unless you have AMPLE time. It's about a 10 minute walk to the other terminal or, you could rider their shuttle. Either way, allow yourself time.

Their ground transportation system is sort of confusing. Limos? Private Limos? Door to Door Shuttles? All forms of transportation but they are not all in one place.  If you are renting a a car; you'll need to stand by the car rental bus stop. The bus will take you to the Rent A Car Central where all the rental companies are.

Upshot is they have great food concessions just in case you have time to stop and eat. While I've never looked for souveniers at the airport, I do see quite a few stores for the last minute shopper.

There are definitely better airports around but! Just 1 airport to deliver us to the 9th Island.",5,3,4

Here's a tip:  Either schedule a car service to meet you at the airport (yes, it will cost you $65 and YES, it is worth not having to wait in a taxi line) or look for a dude in a suit, pushing a luggage cart around, who you can tip $1 per bag and he will help you cut in line to get a taxi.

#1. You can gamble. Can't wait to lose money at the slots? Got a couple bucks you want to burn before you leave town? Hit up the slots nearest to your gate! We played a Star Wars slots machine which was actually pretty fun even though we lost. 
#2. Mind the bathroom stall you choose. If someone comes out looking like hell, you probably want to pick another stall. Speaking from experience. 
#3. Be ready for lines. It's a big airport with a lot of people going through it everyday. There are going to be lines no matter what time of day it is. However, they are ready for it... and as long as you prepare you can save yourself some aggravation (ie: get ready for security before you hit security, have your IDs ready, and your patience handy). We got through a huge line to check-in for our flight and another huge line at security in less than 25 minutes.

All of the sudden those slot machines that are everywhere taking up so much space don't seem so great anymore. The food situation is nothing to write home about either.

All the people who work here seem nice enough. One security guy even lent me his pen so my friends and I could fashion a makeshift name sign for a friend who was arriving. Most of the people who are arriving here seem to be in generally good spirits and makes people watching especially entertaining. And how often do you see slot machines in the baggage claim area? 

Things that I will gripe about:
- There is a serious dearth of power outlets in this airport that are not near restrooms or trash cans. 
- There is quite a lengthy walk from some of the terminals to the baggage claim area. Which is fine, except sometimes you're walking through a creepy dark hallway area which makes you wonder if you've taken a wrong turn somewhere.
- Crossing the street to get to the parking area is annoying because you have to wait for the crossing guard guy to decide that there are enough people gathered before he'll open the gate.

I hate with a passion the subway thing that takes you to the D wing. I mean it could be worse, it could be a tram or something.

Major panic attack, because although I am late more often than I would like to be I freak out whenever I am late. SO damn those subway things for giving me a heart attack every time. EVERY TIME. 
One thing though I love flying in because I really feel that I have made it to Vegas with this airport. The constant advertisements everywhere for shows on the strip and the gross slot machines and the hot muggy air when I first get off the plane and head into the airport.

If anything, FAR MORE airports should have these lounges, even if it's only 1 per terminal. IIRC, McCarran has 2 such lounges per terminal(one on each end) here. Having the smoking lounges provides 2 great results, number one being that you won't run into smokers sneaking a cigarette inside bathroom areas(it happens at Chicago O'Hare and Midway at times, and I won't be surprised if I hear reports of people sneaking bathroom cigarettes at Salt Lake City Airport since they made their foolish recent decision(no thanks to SLC's mayor, booourns!) to eliminate their lounges), and number two reduces the lines to go through security. Quit being a baby about it, since per my memory of using this airport in early 2015 it didn't smell badly outside of those lounges. The smoking bar I noticed while in the terminal, and ditto with the smoking slot area in that same terminal I was in while waiting for my flight obviously must have good ventilation, since I didn't smell the smoke outside of those areas at all. I'm an infrequent non-daily smoker, so I appreciated the smoking bar(Barney's, and I definitely noticed the ventilation equipment inside that bar) I used before my flight. Plus the fact I saw they had TONS of non-smoking slots outside the few in those smoking lounges(almost positive I saw more slots outside those lounges, vs. the few within when I took a peek inside those 2 smoking lounge slot areas), is very fair to me!

Moving on, this airport had a lot of food options within it, though I wouldn't say it was my favorite airport ever in this regard. But it was plenty enough, but wouldn't hurt if they could lure some mom and pop places and some chains that aren't already here(i.e. In 'n Out) into this airport. I didn't have a problem finding an outlet to charge my phone, and it looks like from newer reviews, that they've fixed the problem(back in early 2015) of not being able to get Uber and Lyft here. Glad the state of Nevada has legalized ride sharing services now!

If the variety of food options was a smidge better, I'd give this place 5 stars. Still, very darn decent airport, and like I said at the start of the review, more airports should have post-security smoking lounges! Or at minimum outdoor areas post-security where you can smoke, a la Tampa.",2,0,3

Things they can improve:  For the people who didn't have Pre TSA approval, the line was crazy long, I felt bad for these travelers.  They need to execute the security area more efficiently.

1.  I have a strange fascination with billboards, even though I live in a state that has had a billboard ban since 1965 (Hawaii).

2.  In 2011, I've already been on two vacations, both in Vegas.  My third trip (in July\/August) will be in ... Vegas.

3.  Honolulu International Airport (my home airport) always makes me feel dirty and claustrophobic, as if I'm trapped in a warehouse.  LAS is a very welcomed contrast to HNL's brown blandness.

4.  Flying puts me in a bad mood, but I suddenly feel better as soon as I step out of the plane - even more so when the plane lands in Vegas!

5.  I appreciate the free, three-mile shuttle ride to the all-in-one rent-a-car center with bathrooms, seating areas and a snack shop.

6.  It's conveniently located - the driving distance from LAS to the strip or downtown is relatively short.",1,0,2

High points for good shopping while you wait, low points for a complete lack of dining options. 

The bars are okay but don't expect a strong pour (which I need since I'm such a SUPERBAD flier). Rather, expect to be ID'd regardless of your age and to have to deal with self righteous bartenders in the process. On this occasion a rather elderly couple came into the bar and asked for a glass of wine. The bartender REFUSED to serve them because either they didn't have their ID handy or they were just too offended by this guy to produce it. Anyway after they left, the bartender went on and on and on for about 30 minutes about how EVERYONE needs to have ID. Come on dude, it's called the letter of the law vs. the spirit of the law. We get that you know how to follow instructions but seriously... grow a pair and stop harassing 80 year olds. Oh, and does anyone remember when ""making it a double"" only cost a couple bucks more? Apparently those happy days are gone far far away because drinks at the airport have gotten pricey! 

Otherwise, a few tidbits of super useful information:
 
- having to ride the tram is a bit of a pain if you weren't expecting to lug your bags from terminal to terminal.
- the taxi line is faster than it appears. 
-the TSA line often takes forever, especially when they aren't expecting a large influx of people. 
- nobody wins at the slot machines. 
- I still hate Delta airlines.

Viva Las Vegas!

While I don't like the smokey atmosphere of this airport or the flashiness due to the strategically placed slot machines, this airport is def one of my favs because of the way it's laid out.

Once you check-in, you only have to go through security once & you'll have access to all of the gates\/terminals. Of course, this airport compared to HNL is HUGE & the security check-point area feels like you're cattle being herded into pens...but it is relatively quick because there are so many security check lanes!

The trams that take you to the different terminals\/baggage claim areas are pretty efficient...like I said the layout is how all airports should be laid out--logical & convenient. The rental car area is also easy to get to\/get out from.

There is also a lot of airline\/company lounges here! Amex cardholders--there's a Centurion Lounge here that is AMAZING.

I would def not mind traveling through this airport again!

I use the airport quite often, and have NEVER had one problem.  This is a rarity in airports, as almost every airport I've frequented has given me at least one delay, or one problem.  McCarran has never done that to me.  In fact, it's been the opposite.  Every visit to McCarran has been pleasant, quick, and organized.  

The main reason I love McCarran is the security.  There is a separate security checkpoint at every set of gates, making the security much faster than at most airports.  I've never waited at security for more than 15 minutes, and I'm not exaggerating.  I must say I am usually using the D Gates, as I usually fly jetBlue, but have also had the same great experiences in every terminal.  

The food I've had at McCarran has always been solid whenever I go.  I try not to eat in airports, but sometimes it's hard to avoid.  They have the basics like all airports with Wolfgang Puck Express, Starbucks, Burger King, Pretzels, etc... But there is one place that sticks out, and that's the Chicago Style Hot Dog place.  The only disadvantage is that it's located before the security gates, and I know a lot of people like to eat after security.  

Overall McCarran is a great airport, and it's also conveniently located right next to the strip, which is very rare for most cities to have the airport next to the main attractions of the city.  They have free WiFi, and the employees always seem to be in a much better mood.

Maybe I was expecting more glitz and glam for the city that is full of lights and over the top swagger but this airport resembled a tourist who spent a few too many days on the strip. 

The slot machines are a bit exciting as there isn't gambling in my hometown but besides that, this reminds of a run of the mill airport. 

The upside is the staff who were assisting in the shuttle and cab areas were super helpful and gave us tips on how much a reasonable fare costs and to advise the cabbie to not take the highway route to the strip as it is much more expensive.
We ended up paying around $18 to get from McCarran to The Venetian because of this sound advice. 

We learned the hard way on the way back to McCarran to definitely let the cabbie know that you want to avoid the highway on the way to the airport because he stuck us with a $30 fare instead!",3,1,1

Virtually every other major US airport (and leading global ones like PEK and PVG) have eliminated indoor smoking because of the dangers.

When flying out of Terminal 3, things are super easy.  Well signed, quick security, and short walks to every gate.

When flying into the terminal things are a little tricky.  Finding an elevator to baggage claim is difficult.  Escalators are abundant, but it took quite a while to find the elevator.  Once we found it, we were able to get to baggage claim without any more trouble.

Finding passenger pick-up is very difficult as well.  It's obvious the airport is trying to cater to transportation companies and not locals who have a ride waiting for them.  Ground transportation signage is very abundant and easy to read.  The ground transportation area is just steps away from the baggage carousels for easy access. For those meeting their ride it is another adventure.  There a very few signs pointing you to passenger pick-up.  Once you see the signs, you have to make you way through a maze using elevators\/escalators and then crossing a long sky bridge.

Were told by security at door that we could not go in and had to stand in the line to check luggage outside. Only two skycaps working all baggage checkin. When we finally got up to check luggage, we were past cut off time and were told to go inside to stand in another line to rebook. Stood in that line for about another hour then agent acted like it was our fault that we missed flight. She had no idea that everyone was being required to stand in line outside. We are WAITLISTED ON ANOTHER OVERBOOKED FLIGHT!  I can understand if there were weather or mechanical problems but this is just a total screw up between AA and airport management that could have easily been avoided with some communication and proper staffing. Some signs or communications to hundreds of passengers standing outside would have been greatly appreciated but instead passengers are being blamed for your total confusion and we have no idea when we will be taken to our final destination. This is rude and inconsiderate! One passenger started complaining vocally and a ticket agent called security to come and discipline him!  You have no idea what is going on in your terminal and someone should be severely disciplined for many passengers being messed up and blamed for your lack of coordination. We are not seeking compensation - just feel you should accept responsibility for a totally ruined experience and likely a one day delay in travel to be spent at airport in Las Vegas. BTW another passenger asked to be confirmed on a later flight (instead of taking a chance on ""standby"") and was told he would have to pay a $75 change fee (since he ""missed his original flight""!)",1,0,0

Unfortunately, there really aren't very many comfortable places to sit\/lay down when you're feeling the Las Vegas struggle. The place is relatively clean but it took us forever to get through TSA, not because of long lines but because they kept closing lanes and the rate at which they moved the luggage through the xray was so slow that I thought I was going to fall asleep in line. We finally made it through and found our way to the expensive stores with 4$ granola bars and 2$ string cheese. This is expected but it makes me feel better to complain about the inflated prices. We got on the plane without any issues and it was goodbye Las Vegas.",1,1,2

As I opened the door on the stall to exit a janitor was standing just outside holding a broom and dust pan.  I was brief so it seemed like she appeared out of no where and was not in the restroom when I arrived.  I could barely get out of the stall while she was rushing inside.  I couldn't help notice how she very quickly swept the floor but more like just going thru the motions since it was clean (as in no paper or trash on the floor) then she exited the restroom after doing that.  Immediately after, a supervisor (I guess) stood at that same stall and just stared inside for about 5 minutes.  I was washing my hands but still could see the area.  I don't know anyone else's experience. I can only speak about mine.  I don't know why so much attention was placed on this stall.  Maybe some high alert was up for the restrooms.",0,0,0

I actually thought this airport was gonna be nicer since it's Vegas but it's pretty old. They do have a lot of food places to choose from. Getting your bags is way easier and not as confusing. Plus their carousel for it is huge compared to SFO. I suggest getting a cab to get to your hotel than taking the shuttle especially if you have a good amount of people with you since it's cheaper.",1,1,1
5258716,uKq6W2cS6NzKLEM_ZeOeSA,ofMESFOXORl9Ng5KGGf4kg,FaHADZARwnY4yvlvpnsfGA,3,2016-06-20,"I'll make it brief because this airport has a lot of space but not much substance. In classic Las Vegas fashion, this airport is occupied by stores, both name brand and not, and slots throughout its floor. Luckily the airport is no smoking so the lingering atmosphere of cigarettes and vapor don't bathe your clothes as you walk its empty hallways.

The BEST parts of the airport has to do with how clean it feels, the large ceilings, and the shuttle system they have from one terminal to another. It feels very organized and easy to maneuver around. They even have a tube system from one of its terminals back to the main one.

However, there are some serious issues to this airport. One of the biggest is how confusing it is to find the pick up area when you land. Unlike most major airports where you can go curbside next to your check in carrousel and be picked up this space is nonexistent. Depending on which terminal you exit out of you have to either go to the parking structure or try to navigate an empty space between shuttle and taxi lines that stretch forever. It is a nightmare for first time flyers out to Las Vegas and even more so for those who try picking you up who've never done so in Vegas. Another issue is if you rent a car, though convenient to be able to pick up and drop off your vehicle all in one central hub, to get there feels very distant and round-about when driving towards the airport. You'll want to definitely give yourself at least an extra half hour to get here.

All in all McCarran International Airport gets the job done with some great ideas but some awful ones along the way. Once you get used to the airport it'll get easier but for first timers make sure you have patience before starting your Las Vegas trip.",1,0,0
