If you order nothing, you MUST get the beef carpaccio. It is a dreamy dish that serves many.  Beef sliced paper thin, amazing fresh greens and a polenta puff hold this plate of decadence.  This dish  is worth a trip to vegas. 

Flatbread pizza is very tasty.  Prepared thin with just the right amount of everything on top.  Pasta dish with amaretto cookies is decadent and another must.

The d√©cor was beautiful, it sits next to the Bellagio fountains, so every ten minutes or so you were able to see the fountain show. 

The staff was semi-friendly. Our waitress seemed a little taken back by some of the questions we had. I'm sorry, if I don't know what something is, I am going to ask, not just order and hope for the best. 

When it comes to food, we started off with the legendary bread and olive spreads. Both were delicious! I couldn't decide what I liked better, the chocolate rolls or the different oil spreads. Um!

We then moved on to appetizers. My tuna carpaccio was very good. The tuna tasted fresh and the glaze that was on top had a sweet soy glaze to it (it was special that night). 

As far as the main meal is concerned I was deeply disappointed. I had the salmon tri which was basically, three salmons (duh) one seared salmon filet, one salmon tabouli, and one salmon cake. The only one that I liked was the seared salmon. Everything else had a strange after taste to it; so strange that I had one bite and put it aside. I didn't eat the meal. When my semi-friendly waitress noticed that I didn't eat my meal, she inquired why. I explained that I didn't like it and she offered me a dessert instead. No, she didn't ask me if I would like something else, no she didn't offer to take it off the bill or even half of it off the bill, she asked me if I wanted dessert. I couldn't have dessert that day (stupid diet I'm on) so I told her no thank you. I then thought, maybe she would take it off the bill at the end. Nope. I just spent $36 on a salmon tri that I took 3 or 4 bites of and then threw away. What a waste of money!!",1,0,0

The hostess sat us right away, and we were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant was super busy at that time, but the service was exceptional. Both server and the bus boy made sure we've got everything we needed. They were all friendly, professional and polite. We ordered two Bellini (one regular, one strawberry), one flat bread (fig and prosciutto), and beef carpaccio. All were winners but I couldn't believe how tender and packed in flavors beef carpaccio was. The beef was thin, and unbelievably soft. It went very well with rest of the ingredients on the plate: arugula and polenta cake. The portion was generous, and the price was moderate for vegas. Next time, we will make a reservation and sit outside patio to enjoy the fountain show.",0,0,0

She takes our order and everything comes out after a too long wait.  Good thing we sat on patio to distract us from the wait time.  The hostess ""supervisor"" wearing a red suit walked to every table except ours to greet.  It felt as though because we weren't white, we were ignored!  Still trying to have a good time on top of all this, and I go out to hostess to remind them we were celebrating a birthday and she notes it to server.   I quietly tell server it's a birthday for my husband and she says it's all covered.  We order dessert to share thinking my husband would receive something special...nothing came, we even got to the point of paying for our bill.  I mention to server and she says, ""oh, they didn't bring something?""  Duh, who is ""they"" isn't it you!  If we didn't already pay our bill I would have left NO tip!

The men each got the porterhouse which comes with fried lobster mac n cheese.  The ladies ordered scallops with short ribs and polenta.  This may be the only time in history I consider a scallop dish better than a porterhouse.  It's not that I don't like scallops, but I love steak.  The porterhouses were on the thin side, and had a bit of char on them.  I love a good sear, but this went beyond.  It was like one side was left on the grill a bit too long.  One nice thing in this day and age of a la carte, at Olives the entrees all come with sides.  That was a nice surprise.

The scallops were unreal.  Buttery, perfectly cooked.  And, the accompaniments were spot on.   A really good example of a dish coming together.  I was jealous, but fortunately my wife shares, so I got to enjoy quite a bit.

As I said, the service was fantastic.  As our server asked if we would like dessert, he informed us we could move to a table out on the patio and watch the fountains.  Our guests are from out of town, so the fountains of Bellagio were a huge draw for them, and one of the reasons we picked Olives.  So, very excited this was available.  I had port, but the other 3 shared a warm cookie dessert with ice cream.  I had a couple bites, the cookies were of excellent quality.  It was an excellent end to a great evening.  Recommended, and order an order of scallops for the table, even if no one gets them.",3,0,0

Assorted bread basket paired with olive assortment and 2 types of olive spreads.  I asked for the cheese ravioli in a cream sauce. Server suggested that it didn't make for good flavor.  I chose a different pasta dish. 

Beef carpaccio - $20 Large portion good to share 3 or more people. Overall good.  Arugula in the center over something like cornbread but sticky like rice cake (didn't care for that part)

Butternut squash tortellini - the first bite is excellent.  However it is very sweet.  And if you aren't in the mood for it, it is difficult to finish.   I could do with less squash and extra sage would be great. 

For tortellini, carpaccio, sea bass, lobster add on, 3 wine. $205 - 2 people with tip

A four star restaurant in every aspect except for their inability to handle off the menu dishes. At close to $40 a plate, I think there should be some culinary expertise outside of the scripted menu. So I deducted a star for that.

Longer version; I had the Scallops with mushroom risotto with the crispy brussels sprouts on the side. Both were delicious & perfectly seasoned. They did not mention the parmigiano cheese on the sprouts until it was presented at the table. Not a big issue but I would have asked for salt or anchovie instead had I known. One of my companions is vegan. Our waiter John was very receptive. Letting her know which dishes to avoid and why. He came early to aprise her of the bread serving & warn her about the anchovies in the tapenade. She ordered a vegetable platter which had to be made to order) and the beet salad. (Delicious, & again very well seasoned). But was surprised when her vegetable order arrived. There was no culinary finesse. No seasoning just overly steamed vegetables. Perhaps,  the kitchen is not creatively inclined outside of the set menu or maybe (& more likely) they were having an off night.

I ordered the steak with the green beans.  I usually focus on the steak, but with this meal, the green beans.  They prepare the green beans with an interesting tempura style.

I highly enjoyed my stay here and the first place I stopped to grab something to eat was Olives. My boyfriend has gone here before and wanted me to try it out. Our server was very friendly, but he disappeared every now and then. I didn't hold it against him because it was really packed that day.

PAN SEARED ATLANTIC SALMON- wild rice, saut√©ed asparagus, cognac beurre blanc, and micro insalata
This dish was flavorful and fresh. I liked the sear on the salmon, it added a nice crisp and sweetness to the fish and the beurre blanc was very savory and creamy. The wild rice was a bit plain. It tasted bland. When eaten with the salmon, it was okay, but I only wish for it to have a little more flavor.

STEAK FRITES- grilled flat iron, tuscan fries, port glaze, and frisee greens
This dish wasn't all that great. The steak was a bit dry and tough. The port glaze was the best thing about this dish, but there was only a little spread on the plate. I really liked the greens because it added a nice refreshing earthy taste to the steak. The fries could've been seasoned better because they just tasted like regular potatoes.

BANANA TIRAMISU- banana mascarpone cream, banana cake, chocolate sauce, and kahlua sabayon
This was the best dish during the whole dining experience. I have an obsession with tiramisu and have never tried a banana tiramisu. It was divine! It was so creamy and moist. I could really taste the bananas, but they weren't overwhelming. You could still taste the tiramisu and the liqueur. It felt so light; yet so rich with flavor.

Olives really provided a nice view of the Bellagio fountain and you could see the other casinos on the strip. I would come here again if I came back to Vegas.",7,1,1

Wanted to sit outside but settled for inside as there was no open outside seating until after 9pm. Good ambiance and a nice setting with the fountains faintly visible in the background.

Food: Menu had many options that looked great and we all ordered something different. Unfortunately, the food was so average to below average that it led me to write a review . The ladies each ordered a flat bread  (Prosciutto and Fig & Spicy Chicken Sausage). They were fine but nothing memorable. Below average dough with some fancy toppings. Father-in-law ordered the special, Braised Short Ribs. It had good flavor but a little on the dry side. Lastly, I ordered the Crazy Mushroom Pappardelle. It was $34. It was an Olive Garden dish that had a bout 4 or 5 mushrooms in it. It even had the ""Signature Dish"" stamp next to it; it was a disappointing signature dish. I'm rarely a harsh critic when it comes to food but the price we paid and the meal we got was disappointing.

I had high expectations given Chef English's reputation. There are now so many fine restaurants in LV, you'd think all would have to be at the top of their game to remain competitive. 

I had their beef steak tartare to start. The Kobe beef and whatever seasoning they used were totally overpowered by the black truffle emulsion. The truffle flavoring should have been a subtle enhancement, instead it became the main focus of the beef and potato accompaniment. The waffle fries as they were described on the menu were 3 potato chips. 

My Caesar salad was also a disappointment. The lettuce spears were soggy and limp. The dressing was distinctly over garlicked even to this garlic lover. There were exactly 3 little croutons and some mushy tomato pieces. The 6 freshly uncanned, stiff, anchovy fillets were thrown on top of the salad as an after thought.

I'm a bit torn about this place.  My expectations were pretty high going because of friends who raved about it.  My experience ended up being a bit of a mixed bag.

I was meeting some friends in Vegas who wanted to have lunch, and I left it up to them to pick a place with the condition that me wearing a t-shirt would be acceptable (since I was coming straight from an event and wouldn't have time to change).  I felt a bit uncomfortable and wished I brought something to put over my bright yellow t-shirt.  I also felt some of the workers, particularly the hostess, were a bit pretentious.  I tried to make conversation and didn't get much of a response in return.  Our server, while not exceptional, was nice and friendly.  Other workers like the food server and person filling our drinks were okay, but I expected more from a place like this.

As for the food, everything was at least good, but in some cases, not as good as I would have expected.  The fig & prosciutto flatbread was most excellent!  The bread and tapenade were good too.  The Todd's Caesar with anchovies was pretty good, but I didn't feel it was anything that special - it seemed a bit underseasoned.  I had the sirloin with whipped potatoes which was cooked to my liking and was pretty good, but again, nothing special.  I wished I ordered what one of my trusted friends recommended, the butternut squash tortellini.  

Overall, it was an ""okay"" experience.  Not bad, but nothing that ""wowed"" me.  I'll give it another shot if the opportunity presents itself again.",2,0,0

We decided to go to Todd English's Olives Restaurant at the Bellagio and I'm so glad we did. With so many restaurants to choose from in Vegas, we were sold by the delicious-sounding menu and the reviews of the Lump Crab Beignets...on with it. 

So we started with the Lump Crab Beignets -- absolutely delicious! I've had nothing like these crispy little balls of goodness. You must try this. You won't be disappointed.

We also ordered the Kobe Beef Tartare -- although it was good, it was not our favorite part of our meal simply because the competition was fierce! :)

I ordered the Pork Chop with Clam Sauce -- OH EM GEE. The absolute BEST pork chop you'll ever sink your teeth into. I typically don't order pork chops, but I'm so happy I decided to be daring that night. I fell in love as soon as I cut into that crispy chop and fed myself a piece that was equal parts juicy white meat and straight up fatty goodness. There's nothing worse than a lean, dry pork chop. BO-RING. This hit the spot and that clam sauce was so good. Hubby was jealous.

He ordered the Braised Beef which was your standard tender goodness you'd expect from a braised beef -- a sure winner for those not-so-adventurous types. 

For dessert we ordered their Cookies & Milk Gelato platter -- so tasty and so clever, and get this...they even wrote ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate. Bonus points for attention to detail!

One of the highlights of Olives is you can request seating that allows you to watch the water show during dinner. The place is packed and pretty dim, but service was did not suffer.

We had an outside table right at the railing overlooking the fountains - it was incredible (although on a windy day, you could and would get soaked). The wine, food, waitstaff, all incredible. I don't think it matters what you order, it'll all be wonderful. So, why not 5 stars you ask. There was a couple sitting next to us who seemed nice enough. They obviously were having a nice dinner...just like us. However, by about mid-meal, they were standing for every fountain show....right in front of me! After the 3rd one, I kindly asked if they could move to the other side - what a mouth on the lady....the guy, gravity had taken over and his brain (and proper sense) was seated between his navel and his knees. 

Anyways, so time went on, still enjoying the water show and the food. The lady still had her man up for the water show, but she had progressed to humping him to the music. We nicely said something, but at this point, the wait staff should have intervened. I even said something to the wait staff - he just smiled and said she is driving everyone crazy...oh good! She asked my dinner partner to take a picture with her and I was happy he said no. She got some other poor young innocent guy to take pictures with her and he was clearly uncomfortable as she was running her hands across his hips - yes from side to side...across the front, all while her dinner mate was taking pictures. For that poor young kid's sake, I hope those photos do not show up on some website somewhere...surely they will. Anyways, he finally had the good sense to weasel his way out of her grip, but then she started ""posing"" while leaning on our table! I and my dinner mate had finally had enough. I said something to her and my dinner mate said something to her dinner mate. Those comments got her off of our table (after she mumbled some choice words in our direction), but that was not all she put in our direction. She promptly sat in her chair, legs spread wide open, and her dinner mate taking pictures. 

So, any question on why this did not get 5 stars? Olives has an obligation (for our $300 meal for two) to provide us with an exquisite dining experience. They got oh so close, but could not pull the trigger on these other guests. I have to assume that they were as shocked as we were and that shock somehow paralyzed them. That paralysis cost them a 5 star rating.

I would absolutely go back. That is not ever in question. But if my $300 meal includes a soft porn show, then I will go straight to management with my right to dine absent the show.",0,0,0

Most of us ordered the scallops, which were insanely good. I also had the tuna tartare as an appetizer, which I loved. Our service was excellent, and I liked that our server didn't add auto gratuity to our check just because he can since we're a large party. We ended up tipping him well anyway though!

Overall, it's slightly expensive, but considering that it's in the top hotel on the strip, has a view of the fountains and has excellent food, I think it's worth the price",0,0,0

Olives has always been our go to place every time we go to Vegas which is about 4 times a year!  This time it was my birthday week and I wanted to show off Olives to my family.  We arrived at 12:05 and were seated inside.  Waiter finally came over and took our drink orders.  The bread and olive tapenade were slow to arrives as well.  Our food orders were taken and we waited, we waited, we waited...the order was taken at 12:20!!!  As I was waiting I needed more water...the bussers (4 of them) were gathered around the wait station having face to face conversations with each other completely ignoring not only me but, the rest of the customers.  My husband had to get up go over tap one on the shoulder to finally get water refills.  Our food was served and all of the dishes were cold.  Three flat breads cold, chicken\/beef skewers cold, my trout cold with limp gooey french fries (not fresh cut ones either).  We had to get up and find the waiter and told him our food was cold. Of course he acted so surprised.  He took my trout and the skewers and 15 mins later returned with the food.  The kitchen had recooked a trout and PUT IT ON TOP OF THE COLD FRIES FROM BEFORE!  Also, did the same thing with the skewers...so bad that the first skewer he had taken a bite off of was STILL ON THE PLATE!  Once again had to wave down the waiter. and showed him.  He came back and said that the busser told him he had thrown out the first order and that my husband was wrong.  CALLED HIM A LIAR basically!  I was so pissed at this point.  The waiter said he was getting us chocolates to make up for it.  We waited another 30 friggen' minutes for these damn chocolates and we finally got up and went to the bar to get our check.  We saw the waiter go to the manager, some woman, and talk to her.  We figured he was telling her a big made up story about how we were wrong or something.  I went to her and told her what had happened and I was furious at this point.  She showed no emotion, gave no explanation but, took her sweet ass time to ring up the check! I told her that we shouldn't have even been charged for the drinks or anything it was such a horrible experience.  She just gave me a dead pan look and said nothing.   We get back to the room with these chocolates and it was 4 balls the size of marbles with a strawberry cut in half!!!!  I can not believe how bad the service, food and attitude has deteriotated at OLIVES!  I was embarrassed in front of my family after having talked this place up and to have this horrible experience and being treated so horrible at the same time!  I will never go back to Olives and will be sure to tell everyone I know to never go there!!! IT sucks!  The one star is only because it's in the BELLAGIO which we love.",1,0,0

And I am here 1-3 times per year. It really ruined my whole evening and while it was obvious I was unhappy, no one cared to ask why. 

We started with the Beef Carpaccio. Good portion, and tasted good. The only decent thing about the night.

Entrees finally came, I had Seafood Risotto and husband had scallops.

The seafood risotto dish was cold! Other than the sauce on the risotto which was lukewarm all the bits of seafood were room temperature. Not chilled, but just cold. It felt they put my plate together from a steam table that wasn't working properly. The sauce was also very bland and the lobster in the dish was severely overlooked. So as I decide that I'm not going to eat it and send it back, the waiter does a quick ""drive by"" while my mouth is full of bread,and my back is facing him, (he doesn't even make eye contact) so I don't get a chance to tell him to take it back. He's gone. And he was very un-attentive so we don't see him again until my husband is done with his food. No one was around to help!

When he returned I had taken about 3 tiny bites and he clears the plates, and doesn't even ask why I didn't eat. He quickly comes and goes.
My husband's scallops were fine. Warm at least. Sauce was very rich. Nothing bad but nothing special.

We both left very dissatisfied with the service and overall food quality. Too many great choices in Vegas. This is not one of them.",6,2,1

It was also recommended by other Hawaii food bloggers. Located in the Bellagio, the restaurant had a very old American type of vibe (tho conversely, Yelp says the food is new American). It's another one of Todd English's many restaurants. Who the heck is Todd English? I had no clue so I had to look him up. Wikipedia says he's a celebrity chef based out of Boston. His food is American with a rustic Italian focus. His original restaurant in Boston, also called Olives (named after his wife), closed down because of a fire.

Anyhoo, the food.  We were seated pretty quickly for our lunch visit. The waiter offered a complimentary basket of lavosh, ciabatta bread and facoccia, along with some olives and tepenade. Very delicious and quite filling. The menu featured various pasta dishes, flat breads, salads and protein. For our starter, we had the flat bread special of the day which was topped with ham, asparagus, caramelized onions and parmesan. Yum.  I ordered the sirloin steak sandwich which came with a side balsamic spinach salad and garlic fries. The steak was cooked perfectly. I had too much bread earlier so I ended up eating just the steak. The garlic fries...well, not that great. I guess I was expecting something more gourmet. My sister had a burger topped with caramelized onions. It was so good I put some of it on my sandwich. Supposedly they have some great desserts here but we carbo-loaded enough for one meal.

The wait staff were very friendly and attentive. Definitely not  pretentious as I would have expected of a restaurant at the Bellagio.  The entire meal total came out to under $70. Yes, pricey, but the quality of the food (minus the fries) and experience made it worthwhile.",1,1,1

I had the Fig & Prosciutto flatbread - rosemary crust, sweet & sour fig jam, gorgonzola, prosciutto di parma.  It was delicious.  Loved all of the toppings, nice thin crust.  Mom and my uncle had the OLiVES Burger - white cheddar cheese, caramelized red onions, french fries.  The both seemed to like their burger.  Cooked correctly, not too big or small.  Loved the fries.

Saturday night, last minute decision to head down stairs and go to olives.  Sat us right away - GREAT!   Server was nice - Great!   The quintessential Olives and awesome bread - Great! 

 Wine list, okay I understand mark up for most restaurants to be in the 4-5x range what you'd normally pay at your local wino store but how dare you Todd English try to gouge me 8x for a Mondavi Private Reserve 2008 for $163.  I don't care if I'm eating inside a fake replica of beautiful lake country in Northern Italy - absurd.   

Food: 
Squid and Octopus - half cold, half warm, thinking it was a mistake sent back and thrown up on the warmer and 5 minutes it was sent out to us. 

Short Ribs - bland as H E double hockey sticks, another semi-warm dish that really lacked flavor. 

Ribeye au Gratin - sucked, so much Gratin gotten, that the ribeye underneath was drowning.

I've eaten at Olives every time I'm in Vegas since I found the place.  Usually lunch, occasionally dinner.  My wife and I enjoy the flatbread pizzas and the tapanade.  She really likes the Pink Limon they no longer have on the menu, but make for her (+1 star)

They also have seating indoors We take the time and sit on the terrace to watch the water ballet.  Very enjoyable to be chatting and nibbling, then pause for a few minutes to watch the fountains.  (+1 star).

Now to the reason they're getting a handwritten letter.  Last night was a special occasion for us, and the maitre'd, Angel, made a significant effort to ensure everything was incredible.  He seated us on the terrace, but away from the rail.  This allowed us to see the ballet, yet was warmer and out of the wind - it's 65 degrees here in Vegas today, so it CAN get cold at night.  He did this with a few other couples, showing an above average attention to detail (+1 star).

I snuck out after we ordered dinner (fig and prosciutto flatbread, prime rib special - both awesome +1 star) to talk to him about a special dessert for my wife.  He bounced a few ideas off me, then brought in a backup to save us both.  (+1 star) Llena came up with a wonderful passage to write on the plate, then served us each a glass of champagne.  It took some time to write it all, but when it came it was perfect!  (+2 stars, dammit - won't go that high)

The bread and olive pastes were exquisite!

The meal: we received our dishes but one of our entrees came out cold and had to be returned to be reheated. Sea scallops were good and so was the onion soup but was not the very best but no complaints. The butternut ravioli which we were told was prepared in a unique and special manner was kind of alright.

The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because our waiter was amazing (Paul L). If it wasn't for him this review would be a 2. To start, we were a party of 5 and placed at a very cramped table between two parties of 10+ people. We were practically rubbing elbows with the party next to us. So by this time we are cramped and hungry. Looking over the menu I see the prices are a little high. Something to be expected for the Bellagio signature restaurant. However, I did not expect a Caesar salad to cost $18. I've had my share of caesars and some are $18 worthy because the dressing and ingredients are amazing. This one was probably worth $8. When I got the salad the leaves were soggy like they'd been sitting in dressing way longer than before I ordered it, this is the same for the croutons. The dressing had very little flavor and I felt there was very little on the salad. For an $18 salad I should not have to order more dressing. 
We also ordered an order of the crispy taters. These were very VERY dry. They were covered in cheese and garlic. The cheese was not melted, and the pieces of the taters that didn't have the cheese and garlic had no flavor. It was almost like eating crispy cardboard. 
The saving grace, besides our wonderful server (Paul L), was the beef carpaccio. This was amazing, and if I were to go back, which I don't plan to, I would get it again.

I always check the specials first (which rotate daily - there's an insert in the middle of the menu), but as far as the regular offerings, I adore the grilled squid\/octopus and the beef carpaccio (and both are available on the bar menu, so not missing out on these if you come during bar menu hours). The grilled squid\/octopus is perfectly cooked, and comes on a bed of tasty chickpeas. The carpaccio comes with garlic aioli and scallions as well as a gorgonzola polenta, making it a real joy to eat.

I also love the butternut squash tortelli here (reminds me of the one at Mario Batelli's Babbo), and the flatbreads are great (again, check the specials menu too, they usually always have at least one special flatbread).

Ok so let me start by saying this is a painful review for me to write. Literally and figuratively!  I recently dined at Olives twice out of the three days I was in Vegas.   The first time was great, so great in fact we went back the last day we had there. 

The first visit we ordered the Beef Carpaccio, which is absolutely crave worthy and delicious!  We also ordered the salmon and portobello flatbreads. They were all delicious. We sat outside to have a good view of the water ballet. It was the perfect ambiance. So much so that we decided to return two days later. 

So on to the plastic in food day.  We again were outside and having a great time. We ordered the carpaccio and tuna tartar to start. They were both great. As we were on our second bottle of wine we decided to order the delicious salmon flatbread.   I had placed my first piece into my plate. About 3 bites in I felt myself bite into something very hard. It poked the back of my cheek and really hurt. I got it out of my mouth nervous I had cracked a tooth. Well it wasn't a cracked tooth but a cracked piece of plastic almost in the shape of a triangle. So gross and disturbing. We alerted our server. My mom continued to eat her piece as she was still so hungry. My sister then say something sticking out of another piece and pulled it out. This time it was another piece but rectangular shaped. I was mortified. So embarrassed for Olives. I found it to be such an unfortunate situation for such a great restaurant. 

I didn't want my Olives love to be ruined by this. Unfortunately, it is definitely tainted. I'm beyond shocked they only chose to take off the flatbread as well as give 1 free dessert for my sister and mom to share, as I was obviously done eating. I mean honestly they should have taken care of the whole meal. 

I'm not a person trying to get something for free so we paid our bill without making a big production about it. Our waiter asked if I wanted to make an incident report and I declined due to not chipping a tooth. I did have a puncture in my cheek, but again I didn't want to make it a big production.  The server said he had spoken to the chef and it looked like a piece of the plastic they store the salmon in. Ugh so gross!  

How cheap of them to only comp the plastic filled salmon and 1 dessert. I was embarrassed for them by that offer. I am disappointed by their handling of the situation and will share what happened to me with all of my friends and family that stay at the Bellagio regularly. Everyone has been shocked they didn't do a little more.  Maybe if they had I might not have left with not only a puncture in my mouth but a bad taste too!",0,0,0

We were staying at the Bellagio and after reading reviews for Olives, we decided to have dinner there and enjoy the fountain views on our last night in Vegas.

A little disappointing, considering there was an empty table right at the balcony ledge that remained empty the entire time we were there. Our waiter was very busy with a large table next to us, and it took awhile for him to take our order. My husband ordered the gnocchi, and I ordered the butternut squash tortellini. The tortellini received many great reviews on Yelp, but I was instantly disappointed when the dish arrived. It did not look like most of the pictures posted here, it was basically a brown mess on a plate. No garnish, not at all appetizing and when I finally took a bite of it, it was mushy - way overcooked. While I waited for the waiter to stop back over, I took another bite. There was just no way I could finish it. I've never sent anything back in my life, but this was inedible. I took a bite of the gnocchi my husband ordered and it seemed to be overcooked to me as well, but he was fine with it. It took a really long time for our waiter to stop back over and he asked if everything was ok. The look on my face should have been cause for concern, but he didn't wait for an answer and started to nod his head and walk away. I had to stop him and say ""Excuse me? No, this is not ok. It's way overcooked"". He apologized and said he would bring out another, but I asked for a salad instead, not wanting to wait for another disappointing dish. The salad was just ok, and at that point, we were just ready to leave. But of course, it took a long time to get our bill.

I had the porterhouse steak - sounds like a lot, and it was, but it had the bone in it too.

Luckily, the aligning of the stars (along with the double-whammy of getting paid today *and* it being restaurant week) allowed me to go to Olives at Bellagio today, for a three-course lunch.  

""Be advised that our attire is business casual.""  Or so they said, and I obliged with a button-up shirt and slacks.  I was late for my reservation, but they seated me immediately, despite how busy they were.  My friend and I were seating at a table near the window, which was good for viewing the fountains outside, and we were quickly asked for our drinks by the server Julie.  We ordered a Pellegrino and lime to share, and ordered our Restaurant Week prie fixes.  

Starting with the bread tray, I was prepared to be amazed.  The large pieces of bread were very good:  chewy and spongy, and perfect for soaking up the olive and olive-oil tepanade.  It was gone quickly.  The star of the bread tray show, however, was the thin pita-chip bread with cheese.  It was so good that I wanted more, and they gave us more during the course of the meal, as requested.

I had the BBQ pork tart, which was incredibly good, with tender pulled pork baked into a buttery bread tart, topped with blue cheese and a strawberry.  An odd mix, but one that worked together well.  I think a bit more cheese and a bit less strawberry would have helped it just a little.

For the main dish, I had the lamb chops with the Fattoush salad, which also very good.  The lamb was again, very tender and flavorful, and without the gamey taste that many lower-end lamb places seem to leave in.  The only gripe about this was I ordered a medium rare lamb chop, and they said it was medium rare, but it seemed closer to medium well to me.  It did not detract from the experience, however.

Finally, the dessert was an interesting mixture of chocolate pudding, vanilla ice cream, and white chocolate liquer glaze, each of which complimented each other well.  By this time I was very full, but even so, I ate every last bite of it.

Overall, the experience was good.  The service was good, but for the most part left you alone.  Since we ordered Pellegrino, the bottle was on the table, and we did not need to be refilled.  It took a little bit too long to be given dessert, however, and if I wasn't engaged in such a good conversation, I may have been a little annoyed about it.  

All the staff was professional, and adhered to the Bellagio Signature standard.  I even asked someone who hadn't helped me at all where the restroom was, and was walked to the entrance of the restaurant, upon which time he pointed to the hallway that had it, immediately dropping the conversational chat he was having with another server.  It's good to know where their priorities are.

As mentioned in other reviews, there are no reservations for the patio, so if you have your heart set on it, swing by a little earlier to place your name on the waiting list and walk around the Bellagio. It would be much more efficient\/sophisticated if they had system in place where they could text or call you when your table is coming up. Originally we were told to come back in half an hour to check on the table, so we did, but ended up waiting another 20 minutes before we were sat.  

The patio is a really nice place to relax, particularly on  a warmer day. It overlooks the fountain and you can see the Paris Eiffel Tower and hot air ballon in the background. Our food was good - we liked the pear and beet salad and the portobello grilled cheese. The bread\/crackers and olive tapenades they start you with is an elevated touch to the standard bread.  Coming from San Francisco, I'm accustomed to higher cocktail prices, but even then I thought their price range was a little out of touch for the menu and atmosphere. It averaged around $19 for drinks that are fairly standard (Manhattans, etc). I think that price range makes sense if the setting was solely a bar or club, but this is place is really a restaurant first. 

The service was friendly, but unfortunately slow.  The bussers, however, were on top of things. More than once, we had to search for our waiter to order, to wonder where our food was, to call for the check.  For example, our bread wasn't given to us until right before our starters so just as we started to eat the bread they asked us to move anything we had on the bread plates to the starter plates they were giving us.  This was a strange thing to do. Particularly as it was our last day, the pacing was unfortunate, as we already waited almost an hour for the table.

We are a younger couple without the glitz and glam but we were treated like royalty. Perhaps the difference was the server. In our case we had Paul and he was absolutely awesome.   

Before going on with the review let me back up a bit. We were looking for a place to eat that night and were walking through the Bellagio when my wife said, ""That Olives restaurant has a balcony but it is first-come, first-serve so we probably could not get out there."". Me being the kind of guy who would rather ask and get told ""no"" than not ask at all went up to the hostess and asked about any openings on the balcony. To my amazement I was told there would be a table for two in 45 minutes if I cared to wait. With the night being beautiful and a chance to sit outside and eat we readily agreed to wait. Approximately 30 minutes later we were led out to the balcony and seated. The balcony is small, I'd venture to guess there was enough space for about 30 people. I do not know for sure but I believe the tables directly next to the edge overlooking the Bellagio Fountain were reserved for Black Card (mlife) holders which we were not. We were seated at the back of the balcony but we could still see the fountains and had a beautiful view of the strip. (We also just happened to be seated at 7pm when the fountains played every 15 minutes so we saw the whole line up of songs during our dinner...I highly recommend this timing). 

Like I said in the beginning, Paul was our server and he was wonderful. He treated us like we were special though we were not in suits, not bedazzled in jewelry, and certainly no high-roller status. We were dressed nicely though a few on the balcony were dressed very poorly even for a casual dining restaurant. We were served with smiles and warmth as was everyone else out there including the poorly dressed group though by a different server.

Paul even took our picture for us with our camera during what he called ""Picture time"". He had an excellent sense of humor that matched ours which seems hard to do these days. He made our night. 

The customer service, view, and fountains were amazing but the food...boy was that some of the best food we have eaten in a while. The drinks were made perfectly, the complimentary bread basket paired with the Olive Tapenade was one of a kind. Delicious! The flat bread...well it did not last long. For entrees my wife ordered the chicken and I ordered Salmon. My meal was perfect, my wife's chicken was overdone but still tasty. We could have probably requested a new one but it was not inedible and it was still very delicious so we did not. We were too full for dessert though what I saw others eating looked amazing. 

Overall, an excellent experience and I would go back if I was back in Vegas. I also highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious meal. If you are willing to wait for the balcony I would do it and try to time it for the more frequent fountain shows. Well worth it!

On our way to Olive's, we asked some Bellagio workers for directions.  One pointed us in the right direction.  But, as we walked away, his coworker made an insulting wisecrack (unbelievably rude).

The hostesses at Olives were friendly and helpful. The waiter, on the other hand, was simply indifferent. He offered helpful information only when directly questioned. At these prices, I expect more - professionalism. at the very least.  What we got was some burned-out character, who only came alive when offering us desserts (and then, only half-heartedly.)

At fine restaurants, I look for creativity in the menu, especially the appetizers. The menu completely lacked creativity - no interesting appetizers, no interesting entrees, not even an interesting soup.  (Potato soup, really? Is this Luby's?)   The central theme in the menu appeared to be food that can be cranked out relatively quickly in mass quantities (so they can hurry the customer out the door).

We were disappointed with the entrees.  The steak - terrible.  The short ribs - poor.  The chicken - mediocre.  The branzini (fish) - okay (nothing to write home about).  Again, at these prices, you expect fine cuisine.  Instead, you get overpriced mediocre food.  

We all declined dessert.  Nobody at the table seemed willing to throw good money after bad.  Nor should you.

As we left, other unlucky tourists stood outside, waiting to be seated.  I wanted to warn them to stay away (but didn't want to make a scene).  So, I'm warning you: stay away from Olives.",0,0,0

But, I'll go ahead and run with four since it was my birthday dinner, and all in all it turned out to be a pretty nice, romantic experience.

The Positives: 
Bread Basket with tapenade. The bread basket was amazing. I'm not a huge fan of olives (I know, I know...I'm eating at a restaurant called 'Olives.' I get the irony people.) but the green tapenade was actually pretty delish.

GREAT wine suggestion from the waiter - and great waiter. I only wish I could remember what the heck that wine was. We ordered a bottle, and while it was one of the least expensive on the menu, it was totally yummy. Another bonus was that the waiter didn't try and upsell us on some ridiculously marked up version of something I can get at the Kroger for $16. Cheers to you, my friend. 

Beef Carpacchio...UM holy heaven Hallelujah! This was freaking amazing, and pretty dang big, too, for an appetizer. And speaking of big...

Portion sizes. My biggest pet peeve is paying a crapton of money for a tiny amount of food (unless, of course the food is just ridiculously amazing). These plates, including the appetizer, were HUGE. Neither of us finished our entrees and it wasn't for lack of trying. 

The atmosphere is nice, upscale, but there's definitely not a strict dress code. There were people dressed up, but I also spotted a fanny pack or two. But hey, it's Vegas...just kind of have to go with the tourist-y flow there. 

The Neutral:
I was super excited about the Lobster Bolognese (sp?) but it turned out to be a little too rich for my taste buds. Plus, the giant lobster tail that topped it was a tiny bit tough...I mean, it's hard to complain about lobster tail but I guess I was just expecting a wee bit more. The actual handmade pasta was pretty damn amazing though.

The bf ordered the duck special (some sort of duck ravioli maybe?), he enjoyed it but didn't rave about it. I had a bite or two, and while I'm used to duck being a gamier-type meat, this seemed pretty greasy, even for duck. He still ate it though, of course.

The Bad: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get they don't take reservations for the patio. I'm sure it's probably logistically impossible. But seeing as we called MONTHS in advance to make our reservations on the reco of a friend of ours, made our reservations for extremely early in the evening (either 6 or 6:15, I can't remember) and THEN called earlier in the day to see if there anything they could do...I don't know. I'm sure they can't make everyone happy, it just would have been nice, considering it was not only our first time in Vegas, but the patio was the only reason we made my birthday reservation there. Blah blah blah. I know, I'm probably just being a brat.

The tables inside are a bit close together, at least where we sat. In all honesty it didn't really bother me personally, but you could definitely hear other tables conversations...and they could hear ours, so much so that they wished me a happy birthday and doted on the fact that my boyfriend bought me a kindle and how much they loved theirs. It was very sweet, of course, but if we'd gotten sat next to annoying or not nice people, the experience may have been different. Just something to keep in mind.

The hostess was a little bit of a cold fish. But hey, everyone can't be having a great day all the time. 

I know it seems like a lot of neutrals\/negatives, but I have to reiterate that the whole experience really turned out fun and romantic, and a great place to celebrate a birthday. So...yay to Olives.",1,0,0

Although I did not make a reservation it only took us approximately 6 minutes to be escorted to our table inside. However, we still had an amazing view of the fountains. Not too shabby. The atmosphere was very sophisticated and chic. Which is another reason we chose to eat at this place. Our waiter was pleasant but made no recommendations or researched to see if this was our first time dining at the restaurant. Drink orders were taken promptly and the delicious bread sample with the olive tapenade was divine!!  I ordered the butternut squash tortellini which was very light, creamy and had a slight sweetness to it which I enjoyed. The herbal sauce paired really well. My mom ordered the salmon which was MEH! It was seasoned with salt and pepper, NOTHING savory about it at all. One of my sisters order a dish that had to be taken back because the description did not indicate that it was SPICY! (We almost had a reenactment of the scene with Pierce Brosnan in Mrs. Doubtfire). The manager was gracious enough to have that dish remade without the spiciness and did so within a expedited amount of time. However, it would've been really awesome if he could've comped the meal or offered a complimentary dessert. But nah, its Vegas so it's all about the MONEY. Go figure. Anywho my other sister order the lobster fettuccine which was VERY VERY bland & also a  very SMALL portion for the price. I must say flavor wise i expected to experience the richness of flavors that is associated with Mediterranean cuisines and the only thing that truly came close to embodying that area of the world was the olive tapenade. I was really hoping for the best of the best considering the restaurant's real estate location, the price and overall atmosphere. Unfortunately, i left unimpressed and disappointed in the menu.

My fiance and I were promptly seated at our tiny table, even though we were early for our reservation.  The lovely restaurant is dark and candlelit at night. When we arrived, the noise level was manageable, but when we left our ears were ringing.  
 
Our server, Ralph, came to our table promptly to take our drink order.  Ralph was brusque; at no point did I feel welcome.  My Bellini arrived shortly thereafter but was devoid of peach flavor.  Our tuna tartare appetizer looked lovely: the tuna sat atop a a spun cucumber salad (spun?) that was wrapped with strips of cucumber.  Alas, there was no flavor to the dish, possibly due to the absence of the sesame dressing and the whitefish caviar.  The only thing we devoured were the crispy rock shrimp.   We left much of the appetizer on the plate. 

Then we waited...and waited...and waited.  We snacked on the bread basket that arrived with two olive tapenades and a small dish of olives.  About 25 minutes after our appetizer dishes had been cleared, Ralph returned to ask if I wanted another cocktail - my glass had been empty for some time.  He assured me our entrees would be out shortly.  Five minutes later they appeared, their temperature indicating that they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a while.  The base of my ""Duck Two Ways"" was pasta, which I could not even see because sauce ran from rim to rim.  Carrot curls (tasteless) and apricot chutney (apricot? really? all I tasted was onion) were piled on top of my duck breast, which was seared on the outside but completely raw, difficult to cut, and impossible to chew.  The entire breast, save one bite, remained on my plate uneaten.  The breast sat on what was described as rilletes made from duck confit.  This was tasty and made a nice accompaniment for the pasta that was buried under all the bland sauce, which occasionally tasted of rosemary.  My fiance had ordered ""Roasted Maine Lobster Carbonara.""  The overcooked and rubbery lobster was another disappointment.  The pasta had congealed into a solid mass that could be picked up with your fork.  We contemplated sending it all back, but since we had waited more than thirty minutes for it, we went ahead and ate.

When my fiance complained about the dishes, the manager came over to make sure we would ""not leave hungry.""  While I would not have left hungry (I had eaten some of both the appetizer and the entree, and very good bread with olive tapenade), I really don't believe that is the point.  When you pay well over $100 for a dinner, you expect a good meal and a certain level of service.  Olives offered us neither.

In reality this place isn't so bad, I'd go as far as saying i enjoyed myself. After a 30 minute wait we were seated. The atmosphere was a bit more intimate and up scale.

The pace sits on the Bellagio Fountains. If it's important to you, ask for a seat with a good view of the fountain because not many of them have it. 

Everything was overpriced, but hey, you are in one of the most popular hotel's in Vegas.

The bread came out with some sort of olive pure dip or whatever, i'm mentioning it because it was memorable and delicious.  I had a glass of wine and a $34 bowl of mushroom Pasta. It was really a nice tasting dish, one thing that stuck out was the actual flavor of the pasta itself. It (the pasta) tasted homemade and stood out even among the sauce and other items.

My previous experiences at $$$ restaurants made me expect something super tiny so when the waiter brought out the flatbread, I was sooo surprised!  It was almost than a personal pizza and could have totally sufficed as an entree.  It was also DELICIOUS.  The red onions and truffle oil worked totally in sync with each other. 

The rest of our meal was also delicious - I loved my boyfriends scallops (more than my Spring Pea Mezzaluna).  However, we did stupidly order a side order of parmesan french fries.  My boyfriend eats a lot but the bread basket, plus flatbread, a pasta, an entree, AND french fries - we were STUFFED.

We settled on Olives because we couldn't find any where else to eat and we were too hungry to keep looking. At first we were kind of put off because we knew this place would be pricy and we didn't intend on eating such a meal at the time, but I really don't regret eating here at all. Our waiter was great and pretty funny. He offered to change our white napkins for black napkins so we can ""stay sharp"". Our bread basket also came with a black napkin. The attention to detail was cute.

We ordered the Beef Carpaccio, Turkey Lasagna, and Roasted Free Range Turkey (it was Thanksgiving so they had a Turkey menu). The Beef Carpaccio was amazing. I wish I could eat it everyday. Under it was some kind of salad and a bread thing that was wonderful too. The turkey entrees were good too. I think the Turkey Lasagna had a strawberry sauce that was yummy. There was so much turkey in the lasagna!!! There was a big portion of lasagna and I couldn't finish it. :(

It was just me, because my friends were still in the hotel, hungover. It was a beautiful day, and they had a balcony, so I thought it would be awesome if I had lunch on the balcony.  Unfortunately I was seated inside. I assume they probably only seat groups of 2 or more out there perhaps. 

The interior is really dark and dim, which is too bad. Would have been nice to get some sunlight because of the great weather. I noticed there was a narrow corridor past the bar that had seating near large windows though. 

Anyway, digressing a bit here but, the lack of outdoor seating in vegas made me realize how spoiled Minnesotan's are with abundant outdoor rooftop dining and patio dining. It was incredibly hard to find that in vegas! Which is weird considering they have such great weather. Who wouldn't want to eat outdoors and soak in the sun?

Alright, back to the review: the butternut squash tortelli was delicious! It had a hint of cookie in it. So original and tasty! Loved it. The $24 glass of red wine I had along with the meal was fantastic. Smooth and rich. The best glass of cabernet I've had in a long time! Too bad I forgot the brand name of it...

I didn't get a chance to eat at any other restaurants on the Strip since we mostly ate at cheaper areas like Chinatown and downtown Vegas, so I can't compare Olives with the other places on the Strip.

Everything has to be on point because remember these prices are usually more expensive on the strip and in vegas than lets just say Bakersfield CA. This place Olives was a total let down and let me explain why. 

I have been to MANY different types of luxury restaurants everywhere in the country and notice everything from the front of the house to the kitchen to etc... This place just had a small portion of what makes a restaurant great. So let me begin.

It was five of us that wanted to go to dinner on that Saturday night 05\/28. We are staying at Bellagio and since it was a long weekend we did not want to leave the hotel and go on the strip because it will just take forever to go somewhere so we decided to go to this restaurant. When we approached the front we asked for a table of five. Immediately got shot down from the gentleman because we did not have a reservation. While I understand dont get me wrong if it is a reservation only restaurant I am all for it but you also have to remember that we are paying customers. Anytime you have a chance to take in a paying customer you TRY to make an exception out of it and see what you can do for the paying customer. So after we were told we only need a reservation a lady who i assume was a manager or supervisor said that she can accompany us to a table with out a reservation (hence why I am giving this place two stars instead of one. an EXCEPTION was made)

We sat down and was greeted promptly by a gentleman who was nice and after about 15 mins we got our complimentary bread and dip. I was wondering why it takes this long to bring out some bread and dip but since it was packed that night i knew certain patience would be in order so I didn't really get mad at that point on why the bread was taking forever to come. 

so we ordered our entrees and i made the worst mistake in ordering the Ravioli because let me say that dish literally tasted like someone unfroze a TV Dinner and Microwaved it. THERE IS no WAY that is made FRESH and if it is than the chef should be ashamed to accept that type of dish to go to a customer. I should have sent it back but I didnt feel like waiting literally an hour for a new dish to come. 

Wait time for food= TERRIBLE. My god it took literally maybe 30-45 mins i want to say to get our food. Now i understand that its a busy restaurant but that's not an excuse at all. Customers will wait for good food so when food comes out, make sure it is GOOD food and not the shit i ate. Terrible. 

One positive note is that the Lamb Chops my Dad's GF ordered after she was done i had two of them and they were FREAKING AMAZING. Probably one of the best I have ever had in my life so i will give this place a star for that. 

Overall:
Probably would never try this place again unless I am craving lamb chops. Kitchen is a disaster when it comes to expediting food. No one should have to wait more than 20-30 mins for food and when it comes out tasting so bad  than that is terrible. Staff was nice, waiters and everyone was nice dont get me wrong. my this was just the quality of the food and how long we waited.",0,1,0

Entrees: Butternut Squash Tortelli

The steak was minuscule, and yes, I realize plating and stacking food is a cute and fancy and all, but I don't care how you stacked this thing it was still not big enough to justify being $49. I must admit though that my husband missed out on half the dish as he requested the peas, onions, and roquefort cream be removed from the dish. (Yes, this is me sighing unpleasantly as he explains this to the server. Ah, my picky husband...)

I had the Ricotta Ravioli, actually a very decadent dish with the perfect amount of raviolis and sweet Italian sausage. It was the perfect amount of food, and the price was solid.

Foie gras... our table split this as an app. This time around I felt as though the foie gras was not as good. It was a bit stringy, and honest to goodness I was a bit miffed at the lighting in the dining room because I couldn't SEE the appetizer as it was on the other side of the table from me. 

For dessert... my husband and I shared the Pumpkin-pie-like-custard-like dessert creation. The name escapes me now, but dang it was PUMPKINY. I had a bite and was basically floored by how much it tasted like pumpkin. 

Overall... I plan to head elsewhere for birthday or anniversary or night-out dining in Vegas. Although I do like Olives I think there are some places that do the special night out dining better.",3,2,2

She refused, which I greatly appreciated since I had been waiting with a confirmed reservation. 

The hostess we had spoken with, however, decided to sit them in a prime spot overlooking the fountains.

He was definitely right. The bread bowl includes some great custom home-made breads and some signature olives and olive dips which is filling in itself. The Beef Carpacchio came on an entree size plate and includes a lot of very thin sliced high quality rare beef with a mix of cheeses, greens, buttery bread\/cake, etc. It was delicious and by the time I was finished I was full. In the end I believe I got out for around $30 with an excellent and very filling lunch at a celebrity chef restaurant.

His Caesar was excellent. They never brought me the felt bread and admitted to forgetting the order.... so we just ordered onion rings with the shrimp. His burger came WELL DONE.... and wasn't that great. My shrimp was overcooked and frankly tasteless. I am from Boston so I know fresh seafood. The onion rings were VERY greasy. The green beans were excellent ( actually haricot vertes) and the mashed potatoes tasteless. The manager actually came over and asked how the food was. I said,"" Do you REALLY want to know?"" She said ,""Yes, absolutely"" We told her all the complaints and she was SO incredibly nice. She brought me the flat bread but by the time it came my appetite was already ruined.

I had ordered the Maytag Martini. (Next time your in the mood for some great blue cheese try Maytag!) The martini arrived with pimento stuffed olives instead of Maytag. When I pointed it out to the waiter he brought over a couple of Maytag stuffed olives on a napkin rather than have the drink remade correctly. He then disappeared until after we had finished our dinner. 

On their comment card I had written out what happened and asked the hostess to give the card to the manager on duty. I then saw her hand the comment card to the waiter who stuffed it in his back pocket. So far we haven't heard from Olives so I suspect he just trashed the comment card.

Came in for a late lunch with my sister and was able to get a table on the patio overlooking the beautiful fountains. Tried a couple items, and everything tasted absolutely splendid. The bread basket was a great start. Then had:

Tuna Carpaccio - delicious.
Grilled Squid and Octopus - great combination of ingredients and flavor

Portobello Flatbread
Scallops and Prosciutto - amazing flavor. the sauce is very complimentary. risotto made perfectly
PEI Mussels - perfect

I don't think there is anything on this menu that would disappoint me. Everything is prepared perfectly from the fresh ingredient combination, to the medley of flavors and the beautiful presentation. And of course to top it off, a great server.

For dessert though, we ordered the apple cinnamon thing, which was like a cinnamon roll (don't care for it at all). But the other dessert was some type of pb&j mousse cake, which was amazing and different from the traditional cakes and pastries.

Might be a bit pricey, but sometimes we have to treat ourselves :)",2,2,2

Meals begin with an ample basket of bread that is served with multiple olive garnish ""mashes."" Our table also had one of the flatbreads for a starter which was very unique and delicious.

For the main course, I had a combination of a veal special and the butternut squash ravioli both recommended by the server. The ravioli was one of the best I have ever had and the veal was very well cooked and tasty.

Having described the meal, I can say with confidence that there is definitely better food in Las Vegas, but the thing that sets Olive's apart is its location right beside the Bellagio water show. With an outside seating, Olive's is a can't miss spot, but with an inside seating, there are other spots where your money would be better spent. Like many of the restaurants in Vegas, the food is great and prepared by a world class kitchen staff and created by a world class chef, but amidst all of the incredible food in Vegas, Olive's food doesn't particularly stand out in my mind.",0,0,0

I also appreciated that they did not have a fancy Christmas prix fixe and instead had the normal menu with normal prices.  However, I do think its a little overpriced for the quality of food, even at lunch (pastas are $20-$25, sandwiches are $17-$22 and entrees are mostly in the upper $20s and low $30s at lunch).  For those prices, I expect both great food and a great ambiance and the food left me wanting a little bit.

They start you off with a great bread basket that has three types of bread (ciabatta, foccacia and a cheese cracker) with several olive spreads (butter was also provided on request for no charge).   For our meals, my husband had the burger, my father had the steak sandwich, my mother had the salmon with rice and asparagus and I had the scallops with proscuitto (I requested the proscuitto on the side because I don't eat it but my husband wanted to).

There was some confusion with the entrees. They brought out my mom's and husband's entrees first (although they incorrectly described my mom's dish as the trout, leading to some confusion) and then they brought my dad a steak frites, which was not what he ordered, so they took it back.  My entree was delayed too, but for no apparent reason.  Finally the brought my scallops and my dad's steak sandwich.  

One of my 3 scallops had proscuitto on it, even though I had requested it on the side.  I did not care very much for the scallops.  They were gritty and had a stringy texture.  They came with brussels sprouts which were seriously undercooked.  I did like the risotto they were served over, although it was supposedly truffle and I didn't get that flavor.  (I also think 3 small scallops is a fairly stingy portion but it was ok because I didn't really like it).  My husband was also not too impressed with his burger, which was $17.  My parents liked their food and I had some of my mom's salmon and thought it was very tasty.

Although this place is borderline worth it for lunch, it is definitely not for dinner.   They accidentally gave me a dinner menu and my scallops (which were $29 at lunch) would have been $42 at dinner.  No thank you!  I would not want to pay Michelin star prices for poorly cooked, gritty scallops and flustered service.",1,0,0

Shame on Ralph, our waiter for the evening, as well as General manager Valentin, for their overzealous egos.  The bus service from more than one, that tended to our table throughout the night, were a bother as well.  I've had some bad service in my time, but never from such a well known restaurant.  
     Such a nice looking place too.  With its mediterranean motif and lake front seating.  Where you can sit and enjoy the breathtaking fountains.  

     But on to the evening, starting with a packed house, overly loud atmosphere...gotta love those loud talkers.  Staff seriously looked overwhelmed.  Probably due to the table layout, as there were so many and too close to each other. Not only that, aisles were crammed with the staff, making it difficult to move around.  No flow... something or someone is suffering. 

-Where to begin but from the first visit to our table by waiter Ralph.  The waiter sets the tone and mood for the evening. His arrogant presence was obvious and felt.  He displayed the lack of pleasantries, and table ethics.  Only his rushed presence, condescending arrogant attitude was left.  Oh and please don't touch the customer, even if it is only on the shoulder. He touched my guest on the shoulder a handful of times. What's up with that?  Eye contact is very important in service when it comes to interacting with the customer.  The customer should be made to feel important, comfortable, and confident that their needs for the night will be met with a smile.  What a nuisance not knowing who the hell he was looking at behind those large black framed glasses.  He made us feel not only rushed when placing our order, but also all other times he came to the table.  He was not thorough with our table needs for the duration of our visit, as if he either didn't hear us half the time, or he just couldn't handle how busy it was.  When being served our food, he didn't even set the plates down properly.  Handing off one of the dishes to my guest instead of placing it down himself. Really?  I can go on an on with him.  But you get the picture.  

-Bus service? Wtf is with clanging of the plates, banging the water glasses. Reaching over people a number of times, almost brushed my face a few times.  Don't be lazy, take the damn glasses off the table when you refill. Any one of them at any given time would reach, clang, and interrupt conversations.  One thing also, please don't come to the table wanting to clear plateau  in such a haste, then waiving the index finger in a pointing manor saying only, ""you done? you done?"" Wtf is that?  Where's the training? Are you guys short of plates? 

-On to the food
Each of us received our own olive tapenade which was excellent. Kalamata and Green Olive tapenade was accompanied with collection of whole olives(with pits)
-The appetizers we ordered:
  - Grilled Squid and Octopus was just ok. Squid was tender, but the Octopus was overcooked. 
  - Prosciutto with Fig Jam Flatbread was very good (recommended), but could use a bit more jam though. 
- Entr√©es were:
  - Chilean Sea Bass was ok. Tender, but the flavor was boring. 
  - Atlantic Salmon was overcooked, when originally ordered medium rare. When replaced, the flavor didn't muster.  Evidentially the recipe was changed from a year prior. 

The reason why dessert wasn't ordered was because we felt our experience and mood were shot. We just had to find the nearest exit. But before we left, my guests felt compelled to speak to the manager regarding the array of mishaps throughout dinner. They couldn't believe how bad it was either, when a year prior, they had a great experience.  
 
- Enter Valentin the GM. When my guest was expressing his concerns, he keep cutting him off not only misunderstanding him, but also, quick to be apologetic and move on.  Meaning he apologizes over and over again, instead of taking the time to listen. My guest couldn't even finish with expressing all the concerns. My guest just gave up. To top it off, he was asking my guest what he wants.  Are you kidding me? Yes, since you asked, I would like world peace.  You know what, don't ask, just do it.  Be creative, fair and professional. Mind you this whole time, never addressing me or my other guest. If you're going to put out a fire at a table, make sure it's all out. Asking the table of their concerns. At the end of the night, after paying the check, I must say Ralph didn't deserve a tip. So he didn't get one. The comical part of that is, once he saw the big zero, he looked up and thanked us with a condescending tone. Sorry bud, tips are earned not expected.    

-Bottom line is, if we're not happy, or satisfied, someone is not doing their job.

We had Paul as a server and he was the absolute best.  We ended up having a late reservation here since we wanted a table outside to see the Bellagio Fountain show.  When we got seated, we were at a table that could see the show but we were more towards the back. We got a bottle of wine and ordered the beef carpaccio to start with.   This is quite a hefty appetizer and PERFECT if it's a warm night outside since it's cold. By far some of the best I've had ever.

We decided to skip the main course since we had an appetizer while waiting for our table to open up and went for the banana tiramisu. HIGHLY recommend. It was a wonderful mix of banana, cream, chocolate, dark chocolate and it was perfect. 

Before we ordered dessert, a table had opened up in the front row of the patio absolutely PERFECT to see the show and Paul moved us closer without even hesitating.  His great service and thoughtfulness made our night along with the ambiance and good food.

My boyfriend wanted to treat me to a romantic birthday dinner at any restaurant I wished to try, so without any hesitation, I chose Olives! Their reviews looked immaculate, the view looked amazing, and the food...just look at the food! It was an absolute must for me.

View 4\/5 - the outdoor patio balcony has the ultimate seats, so make sure to try your luck and get their early (before 5pm). It's first come first served on the patio, regardless of reservations. If you come a minute late, you might get stuck with the back seats on the patio, which are not as amazing as the seats right at the edge of the balcony - the view at the edge is unobstructed from those large umbrellas and super up close and personal with the Bellagio fountains. 

Service 4\/5 - When we walked up to the host stand, the woman was busy talking to another employee, maybe a manger? But they didn't acknowledge us at all to let us know that they will be a moment. A couple minutes later, when they were done talking, she asked us if we had reservations - I said yes, and gave her my name. I thought that our first impression of their staff and that whole ordeal was disorganized and amateur. 

After we were seated, the service that we received from our waitress Michelle M. was pleasant and gracious. It appeared that she had read our reservation notes, because she even wished me a happy birthday, which was a sweet gesture. Our water was refilled immediately and frequently with the blink of an eye, our bread basket was refilled right when we requested it and also our tapenade and olives were replaced with a fresh batch alongside it. They even doggy bagged the rest of our delicious uneaten bread from our basket and provided us with a new set of the amazing tapenade, to take home.

At the very end of our meal, our waitress Michelle surprised me with a complimentary plate of 3 cream puffs filled with mousse. The plate was drizzled with chocolate, some berries, with a message in chocolate that said ""happy birthday"" and also 1 lit candle. It was a  lovely gesture and we appreciated it so much! 

Ambiance 5\/5 - I am in love with the intimate lighting and decor inside of the restaurant. The environment was dimly lit, mysterious, stylish and sexy. Definitely special occasion it up at this place! 

Food 5\/5 - There was extreme precision and care in the execution and plating of our dishes. The presentation was absolutely gorgeous and vibrant! Both of our dishes were prepared expertly, seasoned to perfection, and incorporated top notch flavor. 

1. Complimentary bread basket with black olive tapenade, green olive tapenade, and a variety of olives were all incredible. Each and every kind of bread was perfect alone, or with the tapenade. I favored the bread that had some pops of sweetness to it and the Parmesan crisp. 

2. Crazy Mushroom Pappardelle with king trumpet, shiitake, oyster & crimini mushrooms, english peas, piquillo peppers, parmesan cream, truffle essence, and lemony pea shoots - $34 - The presentation was exquisite. Was it delicious? Absolutely! The dish was flawless. It was luscious and creamy, the pappardelle was cooked al dente, had a hearty abundance of mushrooms, had an overall great mushroom flavor. 

3. Atlantic Salmon cooked medium well, with creamy beet risotto, saut√©ed vegetables, curry beurre blanc, roasted fennel & arugula - $36 - This dish was stunning to look at and they did not disappoint in execution. The salmon was cooked perfectly, moist, buttery, and expertly seasoned. The risotto, was slightly sweet, very rich, and paired perfectly with the salmon. The vegetables were all beautiful, cooked with care and added an amazing texture to the dish. I was a fan of this dish! 

Value 4\/5 - Honestly, you have to remind yourself that you are paying high strip prices and for also being inside of the Bellagio (with a view like that) you'll be paying top dollar for ambiance. Total was $80.53 for 2 dinner entrees and 1 ($4.50) coke, including tax. The portions were great and they were very generous with the bread refills and the tapenade. Yet, was the mushroom pappardelle worth $34? I don't think so. Maybe if they knocked it a few down to $25...$28 even, then it would be right on the money. There wasn't any protein besides the mushrooms to make that dish that pricey. But we still enjoyed every last bit of it.",6,2,2

First, the bread basket w\/ olives and olive tapenade is sooooo good! The foccacia, the little round kind of sweet, walnut bread is divine!  The dishes that I would recommend getting is the Beef Carpaccio (seriously the best carpaccio on earth! Choice cuts of meat, freshly shaved parm and a balsamic reduction..ugh to die for!).  You need to get the Grilled Squid and Octopus...the sauce alone with the chickpeas, roasted garlic is amazing especially when sopping it up with some foccacia!  The squid and octopus is super tender and flavorful.  I would seriously be happy splitting those two dishes with a friend.  Even though they are appetizers, the portions are large and could really be an entree.  I wasn't a big fan of the Fig and Prosciutto Flatbread...I thought the Gorgonzola was a bit much and overpowered the other flavors.  I could not really taste the fig...fresh figs would have been yummy on it.

No sooner did the bartender whip the drinks, our table was ready and waiting on the deck. We picked a great time of year being October it was a perfect 80 degree day, and in the shaded deck really lovely sitting outside. I can only it imagine it being pretty brutal in the summer and it being say, 117? Yikes!
They start you with a basket of mixed breads and small bowl of olives and olive tapenade, and a pickled garlic clove (which my husband thought was roasted and popped in his mouth and crunched. Boy did his breath stink later!).
We started with Beef Carpaccio and a Tuna Carpaccio (for me, the non-beef eater) that had garlic mashed potato underneath. The Tuna Carpaccio was really wonderful, would have never thought of it with mashed potato, but the flavors meshed very nicely.
For lunch I ordered a flat bread with pulled BBQ chicken, peaches, and  water cress, and crumbled Gorgonzola. It's fairly large so have a good appetite, I couldn't finish it after eating the appetizer. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich with fries, and my other bud had the scallops which looked wonderful too. 
And it you go around 3pm you get a water show from the fountain, pretty cool. All in all a good meal, nice atmosphere with a little entertainment to boot..",1,1,2

I have been to Vegas over a dozen times and Olives is my favorite spot in Vegas. I do not review many spots in Vegas, but I feel with some of the feedback I have seen, it is time to be real.

This is very good, quality establishment, with a solid reputation for food, where you do not have to be in a 3-piece suit and spend a minimum of $200 to dine here. Therefore, it will be a bit busy, crowded, and hectic, pretty much from the time the doors open until they shut them at night. This is usually a good sign.

I have never once been disappointed with the food. The grilled octopus is one of the best dishes I have ever had, and I dine in NYC often and have exposure to top notch food. If you can eat seafood, then you must try this dish. The bread and spreads you receive upon sitting down is great. The entrees are very tasty. I have had many, mostly daily specials, so I cannot pick a favorite, but you cannot go wrong.

Olives has an extensive wine selection. You should be able to find a bottle which is to your party's liking. The sommelier has been knowledgeable and friendly every time I have had a question about a selection.

Now, there is a bit of advice I have for anyone who wishes to dine on the patio facing the Fountains of Bellagio. Make a reservation. Get there before your reservation (20min plus). And ask if it is possible to wait for a table on the patio to open. THEY DO NOT guarantee a table then when you make your reservation. This should be obvious as to why, but some folks seem to forget that, the table you are looking to enjoy is probably a top ten, or even top 5, dining experience in Vegas. I have dined at Olives at least 10 times (AT LEAST) and all but one time I was able to get onto the patio with my parties (and this includes parties of 8+). The one time I wasn't, was due to a small wedding reception (and they probably paid a fine penny for that) which was being held early evening on a Saturday. A little savvy, a little understanding, and a little patience can go a long way.

The service has always been impeccable. My water was never more than 2\/3 empty, the wait staff was around, and the server was never rude or ignored me or my guests. Yes, at times it took a few more minutes to get my food then 'normal' (whatever that is). But with the amount of folks usually in the restaurant, this should be expected and understood.

This establishment is one of the few finer dining establishments I would ever entertain giving 5 Stars on Yelp. So that's why I did. I highly recommend and I will return the next time I am in Sin City.",0,0,0

While Olives is quite overpriced, the redeeming factor it does possess is the view or THE VIEW, I should say. Its terrace is overlooking the Bellagio fountains. So if you can, do wait for the outdoor patio seating because the dinner and show are amazing!

The food is pretty good too. Our two disappointments were:
1) my sirloin came out lukewarm (looks like the dish was waiting for the waiter for a while). Not sure if the reheated it or brought out a new one because the second time the meat was well done as opposed to medium like I ordered. Either way, I expect that a place charging $49 for the dish does not make rookie mistakes like this. (Minus one star)

2) that it was my wife's birthday (I did mention it several times when reserving and upon ordering our drinks) and they did nothing special for her. We were too full for dessert, but they should have done something (minus one star)

Otherwise this would have been a full 5 star rating.

We had a party of 10+ but we didn't have reservations for lunch.  We asked how long it would take, and I forget exactly how long they said, but it was certainly a long time.  But soon the hostess returned and told us that we could be seated.  They had a big table in the back, I'm thinking it was the chef's table, but she seated us there, asking first if we minded.  Obviously we didn't and plus we could look outside and catch the Bellagio water show going on.  

I had the butternut squash tortellini.  It was AMAZING.  If you're a butternut squash fan, you'll love this.  I wasn't really expecting much because I wanted a light lunch, but it was impressive.  The sauce that came on top of the tortellini was really good, and the butternut squash inside was smooth and sweet.  They also serve bread for appetizers along with signature olive spread and olives, they were just as delicious, as a starter. :)  I also tried the pizza with figs.   It was a fairly big personal pizza, and the figs on it tasted amazing, it was a nice touch on the piece, definitely creative and tasteful.

And indeed it was! My steak was probably only 6-8 oz. and was extremely dry and somewhat chewy and charred. But the sauce was good, though it didn't do enough to cover up the char. Lastly, the sorbet dessert was disappointing because the texture was that of dying-sorbet-making-machine-frozen-yogurt. 

But.
The service was wonderful. Our waiter was extremely patient while we perused the menu, and even helped us out when we overheard us discussing how to obtain show tickets. He was sincere and kind, and frequently returned to our table to make sure everything was going well.

After eating about a third I gave up and moved on to the main course- butternut squash tortelli with sage. Ugh. I love butternut squash pasta with sage and make it quite frequently at home.

Our waiter was friendly without trying to be besties and gave us suggestions.  Following his advice, we ordered the Beef Carpaccio for an appetizer to share.

Words can't truly explain how divine that Beef Carpaccio was.. shaved so thin that you could see through it, with incredible flavor drizzles to vary the tastes.  It was fantastic, melt-in-your-mouth beef.  Hubby ate up the fried corn cake that was underneath the mountain of beef, exclaiming how incredibly good it was also.  Sometimes the southern just goes to the bone in that man ;)

Our entrees arrived and were perfectly prepared and gorgeously presented.  Hubby had the porterhouse with sides of broccoli & fried lobster mac & cheese.  I had the scallops with sides of brussel sprouts & some balsamic beets, along with other stuff I don't remember.

First, his steak - perfectly prepared, incredibly tasty.  I sampled a bite of each item and they were fantastic, and based on how clean his plate ended I'd have to say that he totally agreed.

My scallops were incredibly good, and the crispy lil cakes underneath gave a great texture balance that only enhanced the scallops.  There were 3 large scallops on my plate, and I could barely manage to finish two of them though I truly wanted to eat that last one - I was just too stuffed to continue.  The balsamic beets were tasty good, I wouldn't have minded if there was more of that on my plate instead of the brussel sprouts.  As for those.. I'll admit to a total dislike of brussel sprouts.. but these were edible.  Not great, but I'm afraid that's an impossibility... achieving edible status is shocking enough.

All in all, a great dining experience that gave us the perfect cap to an already excellent day :D",2,0,1

Our group consisted of mostly New Yorkers and LA mid-20-somethings - so we're used to good food and over-hyped food.  To start, it was extremely difficult for us to choose a place as a group because the ""nice"" restaurants in Vegas are just a sister\/brother restaurant to some restaurant in NYC, LA, or Chicago.  To find a place that we all have never been to was difficult.  Oddly enough the one we decided on finds its home in Boston where all of us all met (in College).

We made reservations and upon arriving there, our table was ready.  Points. As soon as we sat down (though our party was not complete), the waitress was ready to take drink orders.  Points again.   When I ordered a dirty martini with blue cheese olives - the olives came skewered by a fig branch with pimento olives on the side. Points (I love olives).  One of the girls wanted to have some blue cheese olives - so i asked for another skewer - the waitress said it's $2.50 PER OLIVE...  HUH?!?! EXCUSE ME?? PER OLIVE?!? So like Vegas right?  Negative Points! But then the waitress was able to bring me an extra skewer on the sly. Major Points.  

The food portions are A LOT bigger than she makes it seem.  I'm not sure if it's all the money the gambling folk lose that makes them come in with extreme stomachs.  I'm not sure if it's more that we were planning a long night out and had to save room for copious amounts of liquor.  But the portions were huge.  My best friend and I shared 3 appetizer plates.  The tuna tartare was HORRIBLE. I mean I couldn't find a single person to eat it at the table after one bite.  The tuna was used as the boats to ship large barrels of sesame oil into my mouth.  I could taste NOTHING but sesame oil.

Luckily, the rest of the food was good.  The Beef Carpaccio was AMAZING.  It was giant.  I think the two of us could have ordered that and it would have been plenty.  It is thinly cut and beautiful.  There's a mound of a frisee\/arugula salad in the middle but it sits UNDER the thinly sliced layers of beef so you don't know what it is until you cut into the pieces.  Fun surprise :)

We also had the duck and truffle flatbread.  Again.  It was a large order.  It was amazingly delicious but it was large.

I must say. I am always nervous to order Dirty Martini's because every bartender makes it differently - but it was ON POINT. One of the best I've ever had.  I actually had 2 - a rarity these days as I stay away from vodka.

We were all SO full after this.  We all ate WAY more than we planned and to be honest - it sort of made the rest of the night difficult as it gave all of us massive food comas.  We were probably the most depressing group of girls to sit at the vip table in Prive EVER as we couldn't MOVE from eating such a giant heavy meal.  But hey, at least now all the yelpers know that it's a lot of food and it's THAT yummy. :)",2,0,0

I went for the first time in 2008 with the girls as we hit up Vegas. We 'waited' at the bar to see if we could get a table as you couldn't make reservations back then. Definitely not patient enough to get a seat on the patio we were seated 1\/2 way through our first round of wines....no complaints here. We each got a few appetizers for the table and the ONLY thing I can remember from that first trip is the beef carpaccio. It literally melted in my mouth! 

So headed back to Vegas for welcome in 2011 with my fiance (a magnificent cook and foodie) and 3 Australian friends. As I have been to Vegas before I wanted them to choose what they wanted to do....I had one request....ONE dinner at Olives. So we saved it for our last night. On a whim (the morning of) I went to our concierge to ask about a reservation and to my surprise she called and got us a 5:30 seating! 

Upon our arrival we were seated immediately. My one concern is they really packed us in there but I wasn't complaining! It was a Saturday night and I was beside myself. Bread basket has some crunchy flat cracker with seeds that went super well with the olive tampenade. I prefered the black over the green. And they should consider not chopping the olives so much...it almost was a puree but still soooo tasty. They also included a cranberry walnut chocolate roll in the bread basket. It was sweet and I was surprised it was in the before dinner basket but really liked the flavor :) I don't think I will ever turn down chocolate, I don't care what course it is on.

Terry (fiance) ordered the Layer Cake, a Malbec from Argentina. Spectacular choice, we even ordered a second bottle. It is a great red that goes well with everything we ordered....and at a decent price (for restaurant wine pricing that is). I can't wait to find this for a cheaper price at my local liquor store! :)

Of course I ordered the beef carpaccio as it was burned in my memory forever. I was not let down....it was as good, if not better, than I remembered!

Kate ordered the flatbread specialty, a wild mushroom flatbread. Very rich and filling. 

Bevo ordered the tuna tartare, I was especially surprised and pleased with this pick! I love tuna but this seemed just so delicate and fresh.
 
Patty ordered the squid and octopus which was served with some garbanzo beans and a smokey broth....I was really surprised of this flavoring but really enjoyed it as it was a way I have never had it seasoned and flavored before.  

For dessert Terry and I split the Butterscocth brulee. Magnificent! (and butterscotch is not my first preference when it comes to dessert flavors) This dinner just wouldn't have been complete without it. I also tasted Patty's espresso martini that was perfectly balanced of espresso and liquor!

So although we didn't do entrees we were all stuffed and each got out with about $50\/person including wine and with being able to taste so much!

If I EVER make it back to Vegas my one requirement will be to make it to the patio to watch the fountains from Olives, my favorite place in Vegas!

Synopsis:
1. Get a reservation if possible (on the patio if nice weather) or be prepared to wait for a table....it is worth it!
2. Order the beef carpaccio, you will not regret it
3. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",0,0,1

I'm vegan and try to go to places that will not be irritated with my requests. Olives has always been attentive to my vegan requests and the meals have always been delightful.
However, on Sunday evening the 27th of December 2015 a couple of girlfriends and I had dinner and our waiter John was attentive to my vegan needs and alerted me of things that I could not eat.
When I requested a vegetable plate and John wrote specifically that I was vegan. When my food arrived the vegetables had no seasoning and were overly cooked. Thank goodness I had ordered the beet salad, which was flavorful, tasty and extremely delightful.
The vegetables were prepared in a way that lacked culinary creativity. In other words, I could have prepared these at home.

A friend came in from Cali for a convention so I took her here to eat. IF you get a little later reservation, like 8:15 8:30, and sit by the window or on the patios you have an amazing view of the Bellagio Fountains, they also go off more often after 8 or 830 like every 15 minutes.  Which is just awesome.

My guy friend got the Halibut [priced around $50] which was fantastic! In fact, it was better than mine. I got scallops on top of risotto cakes with beets and Brussels Sprouts [I would never have eaten this dish when I was little] anyhow it was good, but I would def order the Halibut next time :). I had meal envy.

My Cali friend ordered Salmon on top of risotto, I don't eat Salmon, but it looked good. She cleaned her plate than quickly mention she was def going to have to hit the gym when she got back home.  We shared a bottle of Russian River Cab too which was amazing!  She loved this place and said next time she came in town she was going back. Score 1 for me!

Good flavor and a hefty amount of prosciutto AND fig. The octopus was a little chewy and the flavors weren't to too impressive.

What makes this place so wonderful was the wonderful service. Our server was attentive, and our glasses of water were never even less than half full. He bussed our table appropriately, and timed the dinner service exceptionally well.

We had a 5:30 reservation made 2 months in advance that was confirmed 2 weeks prior. Both times it was made known that it was my daughter's sweet 16 birthday and that we would like a patio table and that we had tickets to ""O"" at 7:30. We were assured there would be no problems....

We showed at 5:10 and needless to say, we ate a small table inside barely big enough to hold 3 dinner plates (and there were 4 of us) that had no view of the fountains. When I inquired about the view table I was rudely told that they do not ""guarantee"" such things even for special occasions...this was the ONLY reason we wanted to eat here.

Our service was so bad that  we had to ask for our dinner plates to be removed 20 minutes after we had all stopped eating. Tables around us were receiving slightly quicker and more attentive service. We were only offered refills on our drinks after finishing our meal despite being there an hour and a half. At the hour and half mark (we only had entrees as we never would have had time for dessert) my wife and daughters left the restaurant and I asked for the bill. Only THEN did our waiter acknowledge that we were celebrating a birthday (this was the first time anyone on staff did and since we did not tell him it must have been noted on the reservations from our previous contacts). He stated he had something special for her and that he'd box it up...this took 10 more minutes. When my daughter opened the dessert it turned out to be 3 sorry little truffles and a beat up strawberry...wow how special was that.

The food itself was mediocre and definitely not worth the cost. Our bill was $250 for 4 entrees, 2 cocktails, 1 beer, 1 soda. Meal time was 1.5 agonizingly slow hours. We would have liked dessert but had no time due to needing to get to our show.

I had called in the morning to inquire about reserving a table on the patio to see the fountains, and the hostess told me they don't reserve those tables, I would just have to show up and ask to be seated there.  So I asked if I should go ahead and make a regular reservation for dinner if that was my plan and she said it wouldn't be necessary.  Well my husband really wanted to eat here, so we called a little later to make a reservation just in case, and they told us the only time left they had was 9:30pm!!  Good thing we called, or I don't even know if we would have gotten in!!  So we showed up early just in case and a different hostess very rudely said they were no longer taking names for the patio because there were too many people already on the list.   Fine, whatever.  When she takes us to our table, we're the only table open that does NOT have a view out the window so I ask if we can be seated at one of the other tables instead, and she (again) rudely tells me no, those are all reserved.  Argh.  

Anyway, we thoroughly enjoyed most of the stuff in the bread basket and the olive tapenades that accompanied while we waited for our food.  People weren't kidding when they said portions were big here!!  Definitely plan on splitting everything!  

Our first dish was the soft shell crab with the watermelon panzanella.  This sounded really interesting, but did not execute at all.  The soft shell crab was soggy and did not taste fresh, and the watermelon\/olive\/whatever else was in the salad was just a cacophany of mismatched flavors.  We forced down the crab and I ate the watermelon pieces but we left the rest.  

My husband's dish was less than memorable; I think it was the ricotta ravioli.  A giant bowl of tasteless pasta, with tasteless sausage.  If it hadn't been so blah, I would have been happy to trade my beef tenderloin au poivre with him.  It was a ginormous piece of meat, and while it was cooked properly, it just had no flavor, other than the mounds of cracked peppercorns encrusting it.  Did not taste like tenderloin quality AT ALL.  I figured I should be safe with the most expensive thing on the menu, but nope.  We left quite a bit of that too, which is pretty rare because my husband will go to great lengths not to waste food.  It was only edible slathered in the curried bisque that came with it.  The coconut yogurt sauce was just a tiny drop of white in a sea of orange.  

It was after dinner that our waiter turned a pretty bad experience around.  Since it was getting so late, most of the people on the patio had left, and he told us to get our things and that we were going to sit by the fountains!!!!  That was a real treat--we got to watch the last three or four shows before it stopped at midnight.   The entire meal experience surely would have been enhanced had we been out there the whole time!!!  So we ordered up a vanilla souffle and some drinks and THOROUGHLY enjoyed the rest of our evening out there.  The souffle was very yummy, by the way.  I haven't had too many souffles but this was tops for me.   

So the gorgeous ambience, great view, and yummy souffle contributes three stars...but the rest of our food was pretty crappy.  Three stars might be high but that view almost makes up for it.",0,0,0

We had requested a view of the water show via our OpenTable reservation request but did not receive such a view.  We were advised that would require an additional wait time, no thanks.

Our server while nice and observant, he also made me feel rushed as if he was more focused on quickly turning the table.

Getting back to the wine, the first bottle we ordered did not taste right, the wine steward while willing to replace it was also willing to point out that the bottle we felt did not taste right was fine, aka we made a bad choice in selecting...

Anyways, we ordered the calamari and octopus appetizer.  I liked how it was grilled versus fried.  The flavor was good albeit a bit salty.

For entrees we ordered scallops and the halibut.  Sadly the scallops were undercooked and the sauce on it was very salty.  I was too tired and hungry to send the scallops back, so I called it sashimi and kept eating.  The halibut was good with a nice light taste.

Beautiful bar with lots and lots of drink possibilities (and very talented bartenders).

Now onto the food. Our server brought us warm bread and a plate of olives. The plate had both green and black olive tapenade in addition to a selection of whole olives with garlic. The bread was slightly sweet thanks to a few raisins in each piece, which made for a wonderful contrast with the flavor of the olive tapenade. This was a great way to start the meal.

We started with the Napoletana Flatbread. The ingredients were pretty good, but not the best; the Parmesan did not taste like the authentic Parmigiano Reggiano I would have expected. However, the dish overall was quite good, with a fun balance of tastes and textures.

For our entrees, we got the Chestnut Ravioli and the Butternut Squash Tortelli. The Chestnut Ravioli had a wonderful flavor that seemed to deepen throughout the tasting experience. I found myself leaning back in my chair near the end of a bite, completely awestruck by how interesting and flavorful the ravioli was. The sauce didn't seem to have much flavor, but the spinach and parmesan cheese complemented the ravioli very well.
The Butternut Squash Tortelli (i.e. big tortellini) were great as well, though some may think they're a bit too sweet.

First, our table - we were not on the patio or by the windows overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.  Instead, we were right by the door in a spot open to the shopping mall.  So it was almost like eating in a food court.  Very bright and very loud.  So there goes one star right there.  I'm sure that eating on the other side of the restaurant would have been much better.

Second, the food - with a little experimentation, I think one could find a pretty fine meal.  But that is going to be a pricey experiment.  Our meal was hit and miss.  I started with the charcuterie board, which was good but no better than you could put together at any high end deli.  My entree was the Gnochetti, which was nothing special.  My wife started with the lobster bisque, which was definitely second rate.  But she like her salmon flatbread well enough.  There were other dishes on the menu that sounded interesting, so maybe we just didn't make the right picks.  Still, there goes another star.

Everything else was pretty good.  The service was quick, especially considering that we were with a large group.  The drinks were not stingy, and the wine list seemed to please everyone in our group.  The bread basket was fresh and tasty.  Dinner here is definitely not a bargain, but hey, it's the Bellagio.  What do you expect?  (By the way, speaking of what you expect, why do none of the restaurant menus on the Bellagio website list any prices?  What - if you have to ask, you can't afford it?)",0,0,0

My friends and I ordered the Grilled Squid and Octopus with Chickpeas. Generous morsels of squid and octopus in a tomato based sauce. The chickpeas were firm but not crunchy and provided a nice contrast to the tender squid and octopus.

The baby Lolla Rosa was a salad mixed with red onions, beets, tangerines and wild flower honeycomb, which I found out was a smear of honey. 

We also ordered the Chicken and Gnocchi and Short Rib Pappardelle. The pasta and gnocchi were freshly made and both dishes were excellent.

As we expected, there was an additional wait.  Seating time was 9:15 - wasn't expecting quite that long but okay, we waited and, for the view, it was worth it.  Unfortunately, after all that time we were given a table well away from the rail and didn't get the best view of the fountains.  

We were happy that the view was special because the food was nothing more than average (expensive and average).  Because we had waited so long we had stopped for drinks and an appetizer earlier in the evening so we were not interested in a huge meal.  Good thing because the roasted chicken my husband ordered was a very small serving.  The sauce was delicious but that was the only stand out.  I ordered gnocchi.  Our meal was actually delayed because the kitchen felt that the first order was not right.  The order they served me was very unevenly heated.  I have a feeling I had some of the first order plus some additional new pasta.  The sauce was pretty heavy but the gnocchi were fine.  The menu mentions pulled chicken but there was very little of that on the plate.  

There were several large groups on the patio that stayed for an extended time and were VERY loud - guess that's what you expect for late on a Saturday night. 

Warning- a photographer will come around to take pictures, which we decided to purchase.  We paid in cash and she shorted us $5 on the change.  We didn't notice right away and were too tired to go back and ask about it.  They were overpriced to start with so......",0,0,0

We specifically wanted to eat outside on the patio overlooking the fountains, but unfortunately you cannot reserve a table there - you must request at check in.  We made a reservation for 8pm and arrived a few minutes early to request a table outside.  We were told we could come back at 9pm and sit outside, so we did. 

We were seated all the way at the back of the patio, which has a very obscured view of the fountains because of large overhead umbrellas, but we still enjoyed the ambiance (fountain shows every 15 minutes).  We did not, however, enjoy the service.  Our waiter seemed very frazzled and like he had too many tables.  Also, when we first arrived someone had spilled a drink on a neighboring tables Prada purse - cleaning up the purse and then sucking up to that table seemed to be a priority for the rest of the night.  Our waiter did not greet us or welcome us at all, his opening line was ""can I get you a cocktail?""  We really expected more from what is supposed to be a fine dining restaurant.  We heard ""I'll be right back"" three times from our waiter before he *finally* took our order 25 minutes after we sat down.  We were not even brought bread until after our order was taken, 30 minutes later.  After waiting so long to simply order our food, we were really frustrated and asked to speak to the manager.  The manager did not offer any apology or explanation at all, he basically thanked us for letting him know.

I order Todd's Caesar Salad ($15) as a starter, nothing special.  My husband ordered the grilled squid and octopus ($16), which he said was just okay.  For entrees I had the Brick Oven Roasted Free Range Chicken ($29), again, nothing special - the best part was the grilled onions.  My husband had the Duck Two Ways ($34) which he thought was just okay as well.  We skipped dessert - though after we refused twice and turned down coffee and cocktails, the waiter tried to entice us with ""it's on me"" to make up for the bad service, but we declined.  Nothing was taken off our bill.

Overall, the food was average, and the service was really terrible.  The ambiance was romantic, though sitting closer to the water would have been much nicer to see the fountains clearly (though you will be misted!).",1,0,0

I'd give the restaurant two and a half stars - It's just alright, but too expensive for ""just alright."" I'd never eat dinner there again, but I (might!) go for lunch every other time or so (emphasis on the ""so"") when I visit Vegas. 

I do, though, go to Olives EVERY TIME I VISIT VEGAS, mind you...

Why five stars? Because the BAR IS FIVE+ STARS!!!  The rockstar bartenders there, most noteables are Joey V. and Zak C., actually care to make a good, well-balanced, strong cocktail. 

They friggin' use a jigger and don't put on a show (Fuck the Flairtenders in Vegas!). Your show begins when you start drinking the perfection in your glass. 

Never disappointed, sometimes completely suprised, always satisfied. They've got it in the bag, every single time I've been there, which is about a dozen times in the last three years. That kind of consistency is hard to keep up year after year.

We still managed to have a lovely (if not fairly obscured) view of the strip and bellagio fountains. I managed to walk up to the front to get a bit closer before paying the bill and I got a good view and some nice pictures. 

The food it's self was delicious. My friend and I ordered the beef carpaccio to start with and we shared it, the portion was very large for a starter and the taste was amazing. Then for main course we also both ordered the butternut squash ravioli. This also was impeccable in taste. The portion size wasn't enormous but it was enough to say we had a fairly large starter, I left a couple of pieces of pasta as I was so full and couldn't manage any more. I wish I could have managed dessert as I can imagine it would be just as delicious as the other two courses but we just couldn't eat any more. I suppose it didn't help that we started our meal not very hungry initially from having a huge lunch also.
We also ordered two strawberry cheesecake cocktails and they were lovely, nice and strong!

The evening started off with a basket of bread and three various olive spreads. Now I don't do olives but I had to try it especially with this being my first time here. I tried the dark jam like spread which was really good. I didn't really care for the other spreads since it had a really strong olive spread. 

Our server was awesome very friendly and really was the driving for in our experience. I was tossed between the Salmon and the Chicken and after speaking to the server I ordered the chicken which was set on top cream mashed potato with side of green beans and with some greens with a lite vinaigrette dressing. My friend had the same dilemma between the two ravioli dishes that they have. The server recommended getting a 1\/2 and 1\/2 order. 

WOW!! That's all I have to say the chicken dish was awesome. The chicken was moist and filled with flavor. The greens with the dressing was a nice touch.

Especially because I'm usually the one that chooses where to eat after carefully reading all of the quick tips and Yelp reviews for a restaurant. 

After we were seated we looked through the drink menu they provided on the iPad. I tried the Fountain Mist which had a little watermelon in it and my boyfriend had the one with cucumber and a sugar cayenne pepper rim. I completely forgot the name but it was so refreshing and the pepper gave it that extra zing!

We ordered two appetizers and one entree. At first we were unsure about whether that would be enough food and our waiter Dennis was so accommodating. He told us to see how we full we felt after the appetizers and we could always add another entree. Now onto the food...

Bread basket 
A great selection of bread served with olive tapenades. I couldn't stop eating it!

Appetizers
Grilled squid and octopus - Amazing! The squid and octopus is grilled first then saut√©ed in this delicious tomato and garlic sauce with chickpeas.

Beef carpaccio- I have eaten this at every restaurant I go to that serves it and not only is the portion huge but it's definitely #1 on my list. The Parmesan, onions, polenta, scallion cream, garlic aioli, just works so well together (I'm drooling while writing this review).

Entree
Scallops and prosciutto -3 scallops on a delicious truffle parm risotto. My first bite was delish but when I took my second bite I made sure I got some of the CRISPY prosciutto and just fell in love!

We luckily found two seats toward the end of the bar near the patio (what a fantastic view!) and decided to go with it. Shaky start with no bartender really paying us any attention, however one finally comes over and apologizes for the wait and is more than happy to get us everything we need.

I began with a White Cosmo - delicious - and calamari. The portion was extremely generous, fresh squid, the batter was crisp and light with a balancing spicy marinara and creamy jalapeno aioli (could have been spicier but very tasty nonetheless), very yummy. Definitely a top five calamari dish. From their Restaurant Week menu, I chose the Wild Mushroom Tart with herbed goat cheese, caramelized red onions, black truffle essence and parsley butter. It was tasty with just a kick of truffle flavor, however it seemed burnt and the mushrooms had no body left to it - just crisp, dry pieces thrown on top.

For entrees, I had the Skirt Steak Frites with spicy broccoli rabe, vidalia onion marmalade, watercress, lemon vinaigrette and OLiVES fries - steak prepared medium rare and done to my liking; the marmalade marinade was good although not my favorite steak dressing; the fries were crispy potato wedges with seasoning and just okay. My boyfriend got the Ricotta Ravioli with roasted tomato basil sauce and sweet Italian sausage - very yummy! The ricotta filling was fantastic and the sauce was balanced, tasty and well-bodied.

We shared the Vanilla Semifreddo for dessert that featured a marble cake (surprisingly light, but unimpressive), the semifreddo (fresh, light and a nice richness) and fresh strawberries. Great presentation. Not a dessert I would order again though.
After our meal, we sampled additional cocktails like one with muddled blackberries, mint, vodka, sour and a little soda. All very delicious! The veteran bartenders definitely know what they're doing and have a few tricks up their sleeves. Their housemade fresh fruit infused vodkas are a must try! We sampled the batch made with Madagascar vanilla beans, strawberries and blueberries - WOW. So flavorful and great just by itself.

After making friends with the other patrons of the bar (whom were all also enjoying themselves very much), we ended up staying there for almost FOUR HOURS! We had such a great time with the bartenders and other diners! Based on that alone, I am definitely making my way back there and I'm not sitting anywhere but the bar - great food to munch on during the afternoon and delicious house-crafted cocktails (every drink on their specialty menu was created by a bartender on their staff with the exception of two classics). To think I was going to walk away? Best birthday lunch, EVER.",2,1,1

Then probably 5-10 minutes passed before we were greeted. Service was slow. Seating. Drinks. Order taking. Everything thus far slow. Once we received our drinks and ordered everything seemed to pick up. We were in no hurry just this was really slow. I ordered a shredded veal pasta. It was very good. The crispy potatoes were good as well. Olive tapenade and bread are delivered automatically. They were very tasty. Overall the food was pretty good. Service was pretty slow.

Situated behind Lake Bellagio, the view from window & balcony seats are stunning, especially in the evening. But no worries, even if you're in the dining room you'll still have partial views of the water work.   

Once you're seated, your server will most likely greet you right away and tell you a bit the restaurant & menu if it's your first time. (Service at Olive in general is fantastic. I've dined here a handful of times and never once I received anything short of excellent service.) Then it's the complimentary bread basket with three different types of olive tapenade for the table, they're very delicious btw. 

A few menu recommendations:

Fig & Prosciutto flatbread - This has to be the best Fig & Prosicutto combo I've ever had. The sweet Fig jam goes perfect with the Gorgonzola cheese. The rosemary crust is a nice touch.

Butternut Squash Tortelli - Very tasty Vegetarian pasta dish. The sauce is a little on the heavy side in my opinion.


Another honorable mention is the Jumbo sea Scallops, served in this sweet & sour glaze on a bed of Arugula salad. However, as delicious as this dish is, I don't recommend if you're hungry or if you're looking to get your money's worth. You get about 6 scallops with this dish and it's $39

Flatbreads, sandwiches & pastas are $14-$22;  main entrees are $26-$60 (steaks are in the $50-$60 ballpark). Cocktails are $12-$18.  Champagnes are $110+ per bottle.

The restaurant itself is trendy but very comfortable; and even though it does have a romantic atmosphere, I wouldn't really recommend it as a date place, as it tend to get very noisy during dinner time. It is however, a great place to dine with family (adults) and friends. I would not recommend this place for children. Reservations recommended.",2,1,2

(Note to those who want a balcony seat, there are like 4 two-person tables, and then a handful of 4-person tables. i.e., it's a very limited number. When we initially asked for reservations for a balcony seat, the hostess told me that they don't guarantee balcony seats, but when we arrive, we can request a balcony seat and wait it out. We did not try to ask our casino host to try so i don't know if that route would help.)

For starters, I got the Belgium Endive salad with brie and bosc pears. It was alright ... a little bland. The brie was really good though and I really like endive. I really wanted to try the fig and prosciutto flatbread, but we knew it would have been too much food. Next time ...

For my entree, I got the ribeye with the chedder croquets. The steak was pretty good, even though the meat was a tad on the medium-well side even though I ordered medium. It also came with some vege and two onion rings, which were useless, bland, and too much oil and batter. If this was top chef, Tom might say it something just thrown on there that didn't add to the dish at all.

My dining companion ordered the porterhouse with the ""lobster and ham mac and cheese."" There was one piece of lobster and the pasta they used was like an orzo, which is kind of an annoying pasta to me  unless it's a salad. (personal opinion). But it tasted pretty great. I just wish there was MORE of it!

As the other reviewers stated, the bread basket and the olive tapenade were delish. No complaints there. I will likely return to try some of the other dishes as they sound really great!

For dessert, we got the banana tiramisu. It was pretty good as well. Not a mindblowing dessert. We did eat it all ;)

A few delicate Oysters on the Half Shell with Lemon Wasabi Cream fell in the first category, and excellent tangy Olives Meatloaf with Truffle Ketchup and Smashed Potatoes the second.

It's a classy mediterranean style restaurant located in the Bellagio next to the Bellagio fountain! If you make a reservation, you can ask to be seated near it! When the water show is going on, the music inside changes to compliment the water show! There is also outside seating with a perfect view of the fountain, but I heard you might get mist when the show starts!

Complimentary bread with olives: Wow, I could have eaten this, and only this and I would have been satisfied. The basket contains two types: fluffy bread with caramelized onions on top and this cracker like bread with parmesan seasoning. Both were so delicious by itself or with the olives! There were different kinds of olives as well as two olive spreads. SO DELICIOUS! Certainly living up to the name of the restaurant.

Beef Carpaccio: We all agreed that this was the best dish of the night...and it was only an appetizer! The beef carpaccio is draped beautifully over a block of polenta with balsamic vinegar, garlic aioli, and parmesan drizzled over. The combination of the sauces, parmesan, and thinly slicked beef was freaking delicious!!! The polenta was not good, but I mean who wants to eat that when you have the amazing beef all over it!

Fig and Prosciutto Flatbread: Another favorite of mine! Again, the combination of the fig jam, gorgonzola, and prosciutto is a flavor bomb! The sweetness of the fig jam really complemented the saltiness of the prosciutto. The gorgonzola can get a little heavy so this dish was super filling!

Handcrafted Gnocchetti: This was my entree. The pasta is similar to tiny gnocchi, very tender, very fresh, covered in red sauce made of beef&pork bolognese and tomatoes. The sauce tasted like the sauce on spaghetti but way better!

My party also ordered:
Hokkaido Scallops, which were cooked to perfection!
Atlantic Salmon, the fish was flaky and seasoned very well.
Grilled Nebraska Beef Tenderloin, cooked to a perfect medium rare paired with lovely sauces.
Colorado Lamb Chops, so juicy that you could see the juices flowing out when you cut into it!

We had a reservation at 9:30 on 6\/13.  We arrived 5 min early, and was told it'll be a few minute wait.  That was totally fine, until 20 minutes passed and none of the hosts gave us updates on what was happening.  One word of acknowledgement would have gone a long way. 

We also requested the patio seating, but was told it was raining and they were no longer seating people outside.  Because we had so much time to kill waiting despite the reservation, my husband actually went to the patio to check out if it was raining.  There was no rain and people were sitting there.  Even though I had left a note in our reservation that we wanted to sit outside and told them at the counter that we wanted to sit by the patio\/windows, no efforts were made, and they just sat us farthest away from the patio.  Clearly, they don't give an S about making customers happy.     

At this point, we were bummed but tried to be positive.  We were on vacation after all.

Our positive attitude was crushed soon after by their RUDE waiter who poured my wine so roughly it almost spilled onto my clothes.

His rudeness continued throughout, and he overcharged us in the end to top it off.

In a nutshell, If Cheesecake Factory had an gorgeous older sister her name would be Olives. The exceptional food was the saving grace. But don't choose this place for a special occasion and reservations aren't taken for the patio. And the hostess didn't even have our reservation so we had a terrible table!

 5-stars for food. 2-stars for the crowded, dark, indoor seating area and 2 stars for not going out of their way to make it a 5-star night on my 10-Year Anniversary! 

I don't know why I bothered dressing up, people on this night were VERY casual and I was in my nice dress and high heels, I felt a bit overdressed...

Pasta dishes start at $26 and go up to $41 for Lobster Carbonara.  Then by the time you order a $10 cocktail and pricey bottled water, your bill for two people will be easily in the $200 range. That doesn't include dessert or salad.  

Service was a 4-star. It was a speedy dinner, they turned over these tables quickly. So if you're looking for a lingering affair, this isn't your place. 

The waiter was helpful but dinner ended in like an hour.  Most of my dinner was spent looking at the waiter's station even though I was seated in front of a window (but not next to it). 

It was hard seeing new patrons being taken to sit on the patio while I was inside ""celebrating"" a special occasion. Sour grapes?  Yep! I spent my night staring at two old ladies who were at least next to the window. Then we sat next to a busy aisle so waiters were walking by every second. It was like two clowns short of a circus.  

Don't come here for a special night, too risky and too expensive to pay for indoor seating. 

We ordered the escargot and it came out really fast-almost too fast.  It wasn't warm enough but had all the flavors you would expect (garlic) to create the perfect dragon breath that you'll have after eating it. 

For my entree I ordered the Seabass and it was absolutely amazing.  I'm a huge fan of the Butterfish entree at Roy's (one of my favorite all-time fish entrees with the same consistency) and this entree exceeded above and beyond.  It was served with a mushroom risotto and some spinach and the sauces...wow every bite was truly magical I really, really, loved it.  

My husband had a steak with some lobster croquettes and also tasted fabulous and well prepared.  

He ordered some crazy blueberry martini that the waiter recommended, but to me it tasted like a bar of soap. 

I had a glass of Pink Moscato and wished I had ordered the whole bottle just to get me through dinner for choosing this place on such a special occasion.  

The waiter brought out a nice dish that said HAPPY ANNIVERSARY written in chocolate on a plate with some truffles and it was very nice.  

Overall, never coming back.",7,6,6

Ambience:  Sucks. Way too dark, way too loud. The patio outside overlooking the water show lagoon looked nice, but like the similar setting at the Paris resort's Mon Ami Gabi directly across the strip, you have to be someone, know someone, or just be lucky to sit there. 

Food: Mediocre. The bread was fresh, but like from Vons. The tapenade was too salty. The panzenella salad was VERY good- the best thing we ate, really- a thick slice of toasted bread and cheese, covered with quartered heirloom tomatoes and balsamic dressing. I would seriously consider going back just for that salad, but it was on the daily specials menu, so who knows how often they have it.

The entrees were so-so. My ""flatbread"" (pizza) was bland. Joyce's scallops were tasty, but  they were sitting on a bed of luke-warm, undercooked ""risotto with pancetta"", which had no detectable pancetta in it.

Service: OK- prompt, but at the same time, kinda distacted, if you know what I mean.

No, we didn't order dessert and coffee (hit Red Mango over on Paradise later for that).

My recommendations are the beef carpaccio for an appetizer and beef tenderloin for dinner. Not only is the food delicious, but the wait staff is so friendly and doesn't rush you at all...you'll want to take your time to see all of the fountain shows! 

On our first visit, for my boyfriend's birthday, our waitress brought out a complimentary dessert and offered to take our picture. She even made sure to come over and offer just as the fountains were starting, so we got some great photos. I wish I remembered her name to give her a shout out, but thank you so much! You made it a birthday celebration we will never forget and are still talking about a year later! 

On our second visit, our waiter was Paul and he was THE BEST. When we were first seated, there was a large party sitting in front of us, so we couldn't see the fountains as well, but as soon as they finished, he came over and moved us right up to the front. We didn't complain about the first seating or anything, he was just truly a great waiter. Also, thank you so much for allowing us to take our time (drinks, appetizers, dinner, then coffee and dessert). Our whole party agreed that it was so nice to be able to enjoy the view and company without feeling like we were inconveniencing the staff.

the menu is tiny and unimpressive. we paid $98 for an appetizer, a flatbread and one entree. the risotto was crunchy. we drank buckets of ice water because it was unbearably hot. not a fan in sight.

our waiters were nice and efficient and helped us take a few pictures near the rail instead of having to purchase the ones the photographer is hawking, which i may have considered if we weren't sitting with a view of the waiters station behind us. 

the hostess said congratulations when we checked in, but not one other person we encountered even mentioned it. not a glass of champagne, not a stale cookie sent to us, not even a simple acknowledgement that it was a special night for us. i don't look for freebies, but when i plan a dinner at a pricey restaurant for an extremely important occasion, i guess i hoped for a little bit of celebration or an extra smile from the staff. or maybe to honor my reservation request and not sit us at the worst table.

Upon our arrival, we find out (unbeknownst to us) that the chefs leave at 2:45, so they are no longer serving lunch, but there is a one-page bar menu, consisting of mostly appetizers. We were disappointed, but hungry, and decided to accept, and requested a seat outside so we could sit by the fountains. 

Despite NO ONE being outside, we were told that we were not allowed to sit outside. Upon asking why, we were told that it's closed except during lunch and dinner.

This made no sense to us, but we proceeded with the meal nonetheless.

We ordered appetizers and drinks, and saw a basket of bread and butter go by, and asked our waiter if we could have some bread. We were informed that bread was actually a MENU item, and came at a cost. I can't think of a time in my life that I've been at a restaurant that CHARGED for bread and butter. I was very put off by this.

Specifics: The Caesar salad included relentless little chunks of hard, unripe tomato (???), stale croutons, and no anchovy at all, that I could taste. Well, maybe they waved one over the romaine, but the dressing was SO bland, and of course there was no salt or pepper on the table, this being such a special place.  Well.

Ricotta ravioii with Italian sausage: gummy pasta, raw-tasting tomato ""sauce,"" virtually unseasoned, and very light on the sausage, too, though I finally found a couple of pieces hiding out.

Dessert: Nice generous portion of coconut creme brulee, very good, but with a little PARROT MESS of a topping (mango something), and two sugar cookies that were not just stale, but ""off,"" as in bitter-bordering-on-rancid.

Okay. No, I didn't complain or send anything back. I was a guest, and it was, as I mentioned, a special occasion. But they should at least TRY, even on a Tuesday night. 

Generalities: Okay, I know Las Vegas food likes to be ""fancy,"" perhaps thinking that helps to justify the prices, but really, parts of the menu were such an overwrought throwback! I never thought anyone could make softshell crab sound bad, but bragging about a watermelon panzanella salad (olives, feta croutons, etc.) really ruined it for me.  On wonderful softshell crab?  What, they don't have any confidence in their own dish, or their cooking abilities?

He is my so-called ""food conscience\/police"". 

I ordered the Grilled Octopus, Flat Bread and Mahi-Mahi.  My husband ordered the martini and lobster carbonara.  The flat bread came first and it was delicious.  Never had anything like that before.  Then came the Grilled Octopus.  Only then did I realize that I was already full and probably won't be able to finish my Mahi Mahi so we called our waiter and asked if he can still cancel it.  He was very accommodating.  He said no problem so that's one point for him!

The Grilled Octopus is my absolute favorite.  It's very lime-y and very tender unlike most of the ones that I tried which are kindda rubbery.  It was excellent!  My husband liked the flat bread the most.  We decided we'd share the Lobster Carbonara.  The serving is huge and they split the lobster into 2 so it was easy for us to really share it.  They also brought extra plates in.  Despite the fact that it was very delicious and we really enjoyed it, we still weren't able to finish it.  As a matter of fact, the next time I come back, I'd probably just have the flat bread and grilled octopus.  The Lobster Carbonara was very good too but it was expensive - $41!  

I would have given the place 5 stars except that the dessert was awful.  We ordered the mango brulee and it tasted old. It tasted like it has been sitting out there for a while.  We did not even finish it.  I should have followed my instinct and skipped dessert but then we were celebrating my husband's birthday.  What is a birthday without dessert, right?  Anyway, skip the dessert, eat more of the flat bread and order some cocktails.  That should do it!  And by the way, the view of the Bellagio fountain from the restaurant is just incredible.

You don't need to read anything else. 

But in case you're curious, other noteworthy points- 
-Great view of the Bellagio fountain show. I would've liked to sit outside to watch it but it was RAINING the day we went. Imagine that, rain in Vegas.. 
-Good service. Granted it was lunch time, so maybe they aren't as busy, but nonetheless our service was very nice and the food came out fairly quick. 
-Ravioli was just OK, probably not worth $22.
-Check the specials of the day. There was a seafood pasta on that menu the day we came and it was yummy.
-The flat bread sandwiches are very large and they come with a huge serving of sweet potato fries!

Todd English's Olives has quickly become a ""must visit"" spot for every trip. If you want to spare no expense, you can definitely find this at TEO (their top wine is around 55k. Yep, 55k.) But, if you're like us, and just looking to get a stellar, absolutely memorable food experience with superlative service, and a gorgeous ambiance, then you can also find this here. For around $20, you can share their beef carpaccio, which is a little piece of heaven. 

I cook, a lot, and it kills me to pay a high mark-up for food that really isn't that tough\/expensive to make. Their carpaccio, to me, is one of the all-time best values on the strip. You get amazing meat, shaved cheese (parmesean?), two sauces drizzled on top, two types of tapenades, a very generous bread basket with an assortment of lavosh and traditional breads, all artfully prepared on a polenta and field greens' base. It's a romantic, decadent dish you can share, for a stellar price. Top it off with a couple of nice glasses of wine or mixed drinks, and it's a truly memorable experience.

Their service is also superlative. Curtis, one of their master bartenders, as a huge part of what makes Olives amazing for us. He is warm, polished, incredible at what he does, and our talks with him are always one of our favorite parts of the trip.

Whether it is for appetizers and drinks, or a full-out meal (everything we saw come out looked amazing), Olives will now be a cornerstone of all of our trips, and make sure to say ""hi"" to Curtis if you see him...he's always the cherry on top of an amazing experience for us!",1,0,0

Unfortunately, it got really window as the night progressed so the water show stopped at just about 9pm that night.

The service was friendly and prompt but our head waiter was a wee bit odd.  He'd come up to the table and just look at us....without saying anything.  The rest of the wait staff thankfully were normal and very kind.  

They start you off with a variety of delicious, fresh baked bread and olive spreads - our favorite was the roll with cranberries and walnuts.  We had to control ourselves from filling up on the bread.  We shared the Belgium Endive salad and they were kind enough to split it into two separate plates.  Bosc pears, endives, pistachios and grilled brie - what a great mix of flavors.  He special ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and asked that it be prepared like the Salmon entree with the Salmon fixings and I had the Duck Two Ways.

Both my pieces of duck were infused with flavor but I like my seared duck breast much better than the crispy confit leg.  We were stuffed up to our eyeballs but still devoured the Banana Tiramisu for dessert.  Everything was scrumptious.

While we waited for the rest of our huge group to make their way to the restaurant we munched on their bread basket which was comprised of foccacia, crispy flatbread, and other home made breads. Of course these were all accompanied with olive tapenade. 

To start I selected the wild Mushroom Flatbread which was comprised of mushroom pur√©e, herb roasted portobello, red onions, fontina cheese, and my favorite, white truffle oil. This dish was super yummy and a great starter! They had a few vegetarian entree selections but for my entree I selected the Spring Pea Mezzaluna - the name itself sounded yummy and was comprised of italian mascarpone, fava beans, spring peas, asparagus, baby pea shoot salad, and truffle fontina fonduta. I thought this dish was pretty good though it didn't blow me away.

What really didn't impress me here was the service. We had all ordered individual wines and also a couple bottles of a cab to share - the waitress in her effort to get us through our bottles of cab quickly, came around and refilled my friend's half full glass of Shiraz with the cab!!!  We weren't going for a cave blend. Fail. Second, they brought all but one of our 14 dishes out at the same time. The rest of the table waited about 3 minutes for the last dish to arrive. It was kinda of tacky that they didn't bring all the dishes out together. (minus one star for service).

Food:
Fig + prosciutto flatbread - perfect blend of savory and sweet
Porterhouse - for hungry patrons only! This thing is huge. The filet part of it was so tender!
Rib eye - deee-licious
Kobe beef tartare - not overly seasoned, beautiful texture\/taste
Alaskan salmon - not too heavy.  Could have been a little more tender, but overall, not bad.

Cocktails:
Sidecar - so delicious, and I don't even like cognac.  It's the sugar + cinnamon rim that totally makes this drink
Tiffany - if you like sweet, fruity drinks then this is definitely for you
White cosmo - really light and refreshing

Even the bread basket here is good.  There's a round sweet, walnut type of bread in there.  Pair it with the green olive tamponade.  So gooood.

The Contemporary Olives features a Mediterranean inspired menu including pastas, steaks, rotisserie dishes, and brick oven pizza's all which are set against the breathtaking Lake Bellagio where guests can enjoy a gravity defying water dance. This venue does take reservations but not for the outside patio, which is the only seat in the house as far as I'm concerned. Take my advice and expect to linger a little while; grab a cocktail at the bar, it is well worth the wait. The only negative comment I possess about this venue was due to an experience I endured on my last visit (evening of June 10th, 2009). Upon my arrival the at the hostess desk, I was made to feel as if I was inconveniencing the hostess by asking to be placed on the list for table service on the outside patio. She claimed that no persons were going to be seated on the patio due to the wind picking up and then went back to her business without even offering to seat me indoors. I am not usually treated with such disrespect and was actually considering leaving my favorite venue. I reluctantly swallowed my pride, walked back to the counter and politely asked to obtain a seat indoors. Needless to say twenty minutes later our sweet waitress accommodated my boyfriend and me, moving us out to the outside patio in perfect coordination with our entrees. Besides the rather rude hostess, I have no negative opinions in regards to this establishment whatsoever; I simply adore every item I have ever chosen to indulge. Since I have dined at this venue numerous times and have come across no unsatisfactory dishes, I will walk you through some of my favorites:

Appetizer:
     Oysters on the half shell served with a raspberry minuet nestled atop a bed of rock salt. The pairing of the sweet raspberry and the savory oyster meat is superb; I would have never thought these two components would pair so fabulously. 
     Beef Carpaccio served with polenta, Roquefort Crema, shaved parmesan, and Cipollini onions. I find most Capriccios to be over salted, however this dish is seasoned to perfection. The beef is so thinly sliced it melts in your mouth, and the occasional Cipollini onion adds a nice kick of salt to satisfy your taste buds, absolutely fabulous!
     Sweet Potato flat bread served with sliced sweet potato, caramelized onions, Capicola ham, roasted scallions, all topped with an apple cider glaze. The sweetness of the sweet potato marries magnificently with the saltiness of the Capicola ham; one of my taste buds favorite pairings is the combination of sweet and salty and this dish hit the spot to a T. The flat bread is thin and crispy so when you bite into this dish you get a nice crunch that doesn't over power the flavors of the toppings.

Entrees:
     Pan Roasted Mahi Mahi accompanied with a Shrimp Scampi Risotto, toasted garlic chips, and topped with a crispy Pasta and Micro green insalata mixed with an aged balsamic vinaigrette. This is a healthy portion so make sure you have an appetite when ordering this dish. The Mahi Mahi is delicate and flaky and pairs perfectly with the saltiness of the Risotto and the crunch of the garlic chips. The Micro Green Insalata adds an earthy flavor to the fish that rounds out the flavors in your mouth, yummy!
     Grilled Pork Tenderloin served aside a smoked goat cheese polenta, bacon braised collard greens, red wine glaze, and crisp mini onion rings. My boyfriend orders this dish every single time we dine at olives and I gladly help him indulge in about a quarter of it. This very healthy portioned dish comes with three juicy, cooked to perfection pork tenderloins. The smoked goat cheese polenta just might be the best thing I have ever tasted, creamy and salty with a rich goat cheese flavor!  Every element in this dish pairs excellently, the juiciness of the pork, the crunch of the onion ring, the smokiness of the collared greens, and the richness of the polenta; I always try to obtain one of every element on my fork to conclude in the best bite every time. If you love your mouth you will reward it by indulging in this dish, you can't go wrong!

Desert:
   Banana Bread Tiramisu, paired with a creamy espresso this is the perfect way to end any meal. The tiramisu is light with chocolate chips scattered throughout and a wonderful but not overpowering banana taste. 
   Flourless chocolate cake served with a tart yet sweet raspberry sauce. The richness of the chocolate cake is cut by the tartness of the raspberry sauce, very satisfactory!

Olives is a fabulous venue in which to dine. I recommend coming here for a quiet and romantic dinner with your loved one. The wait staff is always a pleasure, food portions are guaranteed to fill your appetite, and the gravity defying water show is guaranteed to impress!",1,0,0

I would say the food across the board was 2 stars. I would have been happy with the flavor and quality of the food if it were at a low cost chain restaurant, but at a place that is sold as a high end establishment, the food was really mediocre. I had a bib salad that was fine, but bland. It was overdressed and still had little flavor. My roasted chicken dish had better flavor, but the chicken was overlooked and dry and I did have to salt the dish. My fianc√© had the tuna tartar, which he said was also bland and lacking salt and acid. The real bummer was his rabbit entr√©e, which he actually did send back. We both rarely send food back, but for the prices we thought it was worth being honest about the very poor quality of his dish. 

Where Olives made up points with us was in how they handled the complaint about the rabbit dish. Our server was friendly, although seemed overworked and didn't come by many times to our table. He asked how our entrees were and when we weren't satisfied he involved the manager, they insisted on bringing a new dish for my fianc√©, and even remade my chicken so we could eat together. They manager recommended the lamb and my fianc√© was happy with that dish. They also did not charge us for the entree for my fianc√© at all. The service deserves 4 stars and if our server had less tables it would have been 5 stars, I'm sure. 

If I lived in the area I might give them another try to see if the issues we had with the food were just because of an off night, but since we visit Las Vegas infrequently I'm sure we'll want to try another restaurant on our next visit.",2,0,0

Lobster fettuccine. Fresh pasta, rich and creamy. Silky texture on the fettuccine. A good, flavorful dish. It could've used a bit more lobster meat for the price. 

Sea bass. One of the best preparations i can recall. The natural flavor of the fish was accentuated as a main ingredient and not covered up by a fancy sauce. The texture was impeccable. Paired with tender fingerlings and sweet corn, this dish was very memorable.

I liked the decor & ambiance of the place... but that was pretty much all that I was impressed by. My friend picked it because she has a little obsession with the Bellagio water show & she hoped to be able to watch it while we dined. When she called she requested the patio. She was told they don't take reservations for outside, but if we got there early we could request to be sat out there instead of inside. When we got there however, we were told it'd be ""a long time before a party of 9 could be sat out there"". Wish they would have said this on the phone. 

We also had this oddball waiter who seemed unable to hear very well & acted quite distracted. When I ordered the Caesar salad, he asked if I wanted chicken on it. I asked how much that would be (as their prices are a bit steep) and he said ""$12"". Well, the salad itself is $12 so I was a bit confused. After a ""Who's on first"" back & forth bit, I finally figured out he was saying that adding chicken to the salad is $12... EXTRA!  $24 for a small chicken Caesar salad? Are you kidding me?! Don't get me wrong, when the salad finally came (sans chicken) it was small (two strips of lettuce you have to chop up yourself with the parmigiana sprinkled on top) but VERY good. I still fail to see how they can charge $24 for it when they add chicken... unless of course the chicken himself ends up helping you get into a club of your choice later on that night! 

Another friend ordered the ricotta ravioli & we decided to split our meals so I had some of that as well. It was definitely NOTHING special. In fact, there was far more sauce than there was ravioli! The ravioli that was there, was all stuck together. Very weird. 

And so, my opinion of Olives is... I will go back if someone else is paying but never by my own choice. Sorry Todd English... take a cue from Bobby Flay. There's a reason why you were just a guest on ICA and he IS an Iron Chef ;)",1,2,0

May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground, carry on at Todd English's Olives! - Fun (carry on)

With Michael Mina and Sensi closed for the holidays at the Bellagio, I turned my attention to Todd English's Olives! (mainly because of his name and how many restaurants he's opened) You will notice right away how dimly lit the place is in general. Since it was December, I thoroughly appreciated they were playing Christmas music in the background and the fountain view from our table.

The foie gras starter we had was an interesting experience for me. I love foie gras but I don't remember eating it on its own. They made it as an appetizer with brioche, pears, yogurt, and walnuts. When combined with all the components, it works really nicely. However if you eat the foie gras alone, it feel's very fattening and I think only the hardcore foie gras lovers would appreciate it since there's alot of fat essence to it. 

The sea scallops that I ordered was very fun to eat. They put it in a rectangular plate and I just ate it from left to right with the truffle mashed potatoes and cabernet sauce. There was some odd green on it (don't know if it was used more as a garnish) but I just moved it aside and finished everything else haha

Last random personal side note: 
I'm used to wearing dress shirts on a daily basis but there's this feeling that I get from this restaurant that the dress code is on the more formal side. It's not dress code enforced or anything and I normally don't even notice these things, but that's the overall feel that I got from Olives. I don't generally like that everyone has to be up to a certain dress code here just so they don't feel out of their element. Obviously its Vegas so most people dress to impress anyways, but that's not always the case and it shouldn't be. Again, this is not a reflection of the restaurant itself, this was my own personal observation while dining here. Enjoy the fine food!",1,1,2

I had booked reservations for 5pm but we were running late, and I called the restaurant to let them know and they were totally ok with it. When we got there I requested patio seating and it wasn't a problem at all, which was great because I was worried that we wouldn't get one based on reviews. You can't reserve specifically where you sit via phone\/web, you have to ask when you get there. Thank goodness for us they had one available!

Because it is summer and weather in vegas is ridiculously hot, they had mist things on outside, so you get a little damp from the water. but i think that's ok cuz i'd rather be a little damp and cool than sweating my ass off.

When we were seated the waiter immediately came over to take drink requests and with our menus. He was super friendly and courteous, which I appreciated very much. He was quick to bring us our drinks and the bread with olive tapenades, which were AMAZING. He was helpful with deciphering some of the items on the menu as well, and when we ordered, was quick to bring out our food. Just so efficient! And when our food came out the water show was going on so we didn't touch our food yet, and he came over concerned that there may be something wrong with our food that we weren't happy about and wanted to know if there was anything he could do! He was truly the best.

So, my friend and I shared the Tempura-Fried Soft Shelled Crab, the Fig & Prosciutto Flatbread, and Parmesan fries. All were delicious. I'm not a big fan of crustaceans, but the Crab was amazing! The flatbread was a little too salty for my taste, but still delicious nonetheless. The fries were good as well. My other friend ordered the Ricotta Ravioli, which seemed good as well.

Because I had informed them that the dinner was for a friend's birthday, they came out with a trio of truffles for her at the end of our meal, with ""happy birthday"" written in dark chocolate on top. So beautiful! the three truffles were placed on top of caramel sauce, and i think they were key lime, peanut butter and jelly, and dark chocolate. We each sampled one and they were SO GOOD. 

Overall, an excellent experience. The staff was great, food was great, ambiance was fabulous. I can't wait to go again =)",2,0,1

I see a business model of why care about the customer they are tourist they will not return and new ones line up my  reputation will carry me through this moment is a bad one.

Came back 30 minutes later to be seated almost right away; but while walking up the hostess remembered my name! It's just the small efforts that count to make a customer feel appreciated and welcomed.

When I went, I decided to wait at the bar for a friend to meet me. The first hostess rolled her eyes at me and responded with, ""Fine, if you can find a seat."" I was able to take a seat at the bar. The bartender was friendly and the cocktail was excellent. 

A few minutes later my friend arrived. I got up from the bar to meet her and realized that both of the hostesses were being extremely rude. They informed her that since I had decided to wait at the bar, they could no longer give us a table. They also said that she could not sit at the bar because it was completely full. Both hostesses seemed incredibly put out and when I tried to speak to the about the situation, they turned away and hold me, ""You should have taken your table when you got here."" I had only been at the bar for 5-10 minutes, and there were several open tables.

The bread basket is awesome. They have about 4 different kinds of breads - some type of sourdough, some sort of baguette, a paper thin Parmesan-topped crisp, and this awesome onion olive oil herb bread. The breads are also served with kalamata tapenade, green olive tapenade, and whole olives.

The daily special was a grilled swordfish topped with shrimp, over a bed of couscous. Excellent dish. The couscous was warm and popped in my mouth with sun dried tomatoes and golden raisins. The grilled swordfish was a hefty sized portion with all the juices locked in. You don't even need a knife. 
The Olives Burger is big, juicy, and delicious. All the ingredients are extremely fresh and at the peak of their flavors. The fries are wedges and are crisp and hot when they come to your table.

The best part about the experience was sitting outside on the patio and watching the Bellagio fountains. We had a late reservation so it wasn't too hot. The fountains and ambiance were great.
The food was so-so. We are definitely pasta people so 3 of us had a pasta dish and my husband had the scallops. I had the gnocchi with chicken...it was ok. I guess I'm a purist because this gnocchi was served with chicken and red sauce which was slightly non-traditional. It had a good flavor and the gnocchi was delicious (definitely fresh) but the chicken was on the dry side - overall didn't think the dish was worth the price. My dad had the ravioli which was pretty standard and again overpriced.
My husband had the scallops, they were cooked perfectly, but he was slightly disappointed that there were only 3 for the price. Probably pretty standard on the strip though.
Service was not that great either. The waiter only spent about 5 min total at our table, he wasn't that helpful in making recommendations, took a while to get some drinks, including standard iced tea. He also didn't write down our orders - which is fine - but then came back to the table 2 separate times to confirm the orders. That was a little annoying - if you can't remember, just write it down.

Had the Greek salad today. The portion size was smaller than in the past and the price has gone up to $18. It was good but not something I'd pay that much for again.

Ambience: this place was happening. The vibe is nice, especially on the patio. Clientele appeared more business oriented. Older crowd by far. 
Service: mostly it was really good. Out waiter was on top of things. They did recommend a veggie dish that turned out to have meat. That was corrected right away. Water was constantly refilled. Food came out at a decent pace. The waiters recommendation was good. My only issue was that the rib eye special ran out by our 7pm slot.
Food: overall food was good. I wasnt impressed with the bread (cold and hard). The beef carpaccio was really good. It is def meant to share and came out like a salad. Very good flavor. You wouldnt even know you were eating raw beef. My main entree (since they ran out of the rib eye) was the lamb pops. I asked them if they can have the same accompaniment as the rib eye (lobster mac n cheese and bacon brussel sprouts). The lamb was good and cooked well but only had 3 pieces. I would have liked four for my main entree. The mac n cheese was disappointing. It was mixed in with the brussels sprouts and i couldnt even locate the lobster. The Brussels sprouts were ok. Maybe i should have opted for the sea bass. That got rave reviews.

Our server Paul (if I remember correctly) was funny and attentive. We arrived at 6PM with a 645 reservation. When we arrived at 6, the lady said there was a wedding rehearsal dinner in the patio until 8 but would willingly give us a table out there if they finished early. Luckily their rehearsal ended around 7pm and we were given a table outside for 6. The reservation was for my parents 30th anniversary and we really wanted the patio table. I previously read how hard it was to get one so in the end it was so worth it because the view and ambiance was just outstanding. 

We ordered the beef carpaccio and smoked salmon flatbread for appetizers and the beef carpaccio was AMAZING.. I had the mushroom pappardelle and it was a little on the heavy side but aside from that--it tasted on the good average side. My dad had the mushroom risotto added on to his steak. Let me tell you--I love risotto! The texture was good, tasted cheesy and made pretty well. The lamb lollipop was amazing. Tender, soft and tasty. It was made RIGHT. We also ordered the Chilean sea bass and my brother in law had no complaints. Said it was good. In the end of our dinner, our server brought out a couple of mini choux with ""happy anniversary"" written in beautiful hand writing. My parents loved the dinner and enjoyed the show. Took many breathtaking pictures with the fountain show. But I got to say--if it wasn't for the patio seating granting us a good view of the fountain show, I would probably not return since the taste was a little above average but not good enough to be this overpriced.

I enjoyed dinner at Olives and would definitely come back again (for the view) BUT, i do have some cons:

1) When I called to make a reservation, the lady on the phone was pretty rude rushing me off the phone just because I asked if they do floral arrangement for dinner and asked her for patio seating &she said ""let me tell you..when you get here you ask for patio. If you want flowers ask concierge."" She was trying to be nice for the sake of her job but I can tell from her tone of voice that she wanted me off the phone ASAP.

2) Patio seating should be reservable. It would take a lot less effort for customers so customers would not have to worry if they would be able to get a patio seat for special occasions.",2,1,1

( I looooooove carpaccio )

...and its a ginormous heaping plate of Carpaccio you could ever want and then some. Cause you have all this carpaccio slices covering an entire plate not to mention its also burying a pile of salad, and then  underneath the salad is a piece of bread that is soaked in some marinade, just in case the carpaccio and salad wasn't enough to fill you up.
The veal pasta is amazing too. The meat and the sauce is slow cooked into a reduction and then served on a linguini type of pasta. I've ordered this way to many times and its not on the menu. 

The menu changes upon seasons but if there is a plate or plates that you just specifically love and you have trouble finding it on the menu, you can actually make a request to the chef  and he will make it for you. =)

I ordered the Tuscan Farmhouse - It was just okay, nothing really brag about.

Truffle Fries - You just can't go wrong with Truffle fries. lol 

So before my order got there, a few drunk women and guys came up and sat next to me and start speaking very loudly, so I decided to moved to a table instead.

Since I moved from the bar to the regular table, they never assign anyone to serve me, I was sitting there for good 20 minutes, my glass is empty for awhile, no one ever bother to come check on me. Now I'm not sure how the tips work, maybe because i was sitting at the bar first, the tip should go to the bartender? I don't really care, I would have happy to pay more tip if someone willing to take care of me with refilling my glass.

When we arrived we were unapologetically informed seating on the patio wasn't available for 3 hours. The receptionists, all unsmiling and dressed in black resembled greeters at a funeral home, were needlessly dismissive and rude. Once in the restaurant, there were tables askew all over the smallish space, like they realized too late they didn't have enough square footage they needed so tables were set up in corners, and anywhere they could. It feels more like a subway station than an upscale restaurant. The two-tops are postage stamp size. There are no views of the Bellagio fountains in the restaurant.
        The Greek Romaine Salad was fresh enough but surprisingly flavorless. Trader Joes Greek salads are at the same level. The scallop dish was $44 for 4 scallops, which would've been fine had the 'crazy risotto' described in the dish required a departure from reality testing to be identified as 'risotto'- not sure what that was. I ordered the Seafood Risotto, which was hard-to-identify pieces of seafood-tasting pieces of meat in a little tomato-y broth- odd. And was it risotto? no of course not. 
All the servers we interacted with spoke like robots, programmed to say the exact same thing, with the exception of Paul, our waiter, who was the only bright spot of the experience. There is no polite way to remove the crumbs from the dark plastic tables, and Paul tried valiantly to take a small sponge to remove them. 
My wife observed that Olives has a

My husband and I came here a few times during a recent trip to Vegas, both out of convenience and the fact that we like what they have to offer. Two of our visits were for lunch. I love the fact that they start the meal with bread and... Butter? Nope! Olive oil? Guess again! OLIVE TAPENADE! Are you beginning to feel my love for olives yet? ;-) I had to try their daily salad special, which just happened to be offered both days we were there and was good enough that I ordered it twice. The mix of watermelon, tomato, arugula, and feta cheese did a happy dance in my mouth! I chose two pasta dishes for my two lunch entrees... gnocchi with kalamata olives and goat cheese (super great flavors combined there) and amaretto butternut squash ravioli (sweet and savory all at the same time). My husband also enjoyed the gnocchi dish one day and went with a burger for his next meal, which he thought was delicious. 

During another visit, we came for drinks and dessert. The drinks were out of this world good... a daily special of raspberry mojitos with plenty of fresh raspberries and mint muddled into the drink. For my dessert choice, I went with a refreshing sorbet. It consisted of three flavors (peach bellini, mixed berry, and melon) set on top of a dish of fresh berries... a perfect summer day treat! My husband opted for a sweet ice cream sandwich duo that looked super yum.

I'm sure we'll make a stop at Olives again in the future. The food and view are tough to beat!",2,0,2

Had a server by the name of Joel L. We ordered a bottle of Veuve Champagne which I do understand it wasn't the most expensive. However this server NEVER once came to pour the champagne. As a matter of fact we only saw our server less than a few times and once was to bring our food, about 45min after ordering. He never came to check on us, only to try and sell us dessert which of course we bought. 

As for the food: I had the seafood risotto. Very average, I don't recommend it. The dessert the server recommended a coconut cake, was rock hard... Should've been sold as a cookie. 

To top things off, I left a vape mod (E-Cigarette Module) at the table. I called the restaurant multiple times since I left and the manager finally calls back a day later stating his server did not take it has he worked there forever. Well, I never accused him, or anyone at that. Other than his service sucked beyond belief. 

I opened a investigation with Bellagio security. I'm sure there's cameras here and I hope that Bellagio does the right thing and finds out what really happened.

I really liked the bread they serve in the beginning with the olive tapenade. The warm walnut bread with honey was AMAZING and we even requested more.

Started the meal with the beet salad and crab beignets and it was just meh. Really didn't have any flavor and wasn't impressed. The crab beignets also were like deep fried crab cakes and not beignets. It didn't do much for me in terms of flavor or taste.

The main dishes were the portabello mushrooms flatbread and the salmon trio. The flatbread was probably the best thing we ate (except the warm walnut bread rolls...drool...) and you could taste the truffle oil on it too. If you're going to eat there, I'd highly recommend that you order a flat bread.

The salmon trio was a seared salmon, salmon cake, and salmon tabouli. The seared salmon wasn't anything special but i did appreciate they didn't overcook it. I thought the salmon cake was interesting and probably my favorite of the three. The tabouli wasn't memorable. Not worth $36.

Ended the meal with a vanilla souffle and taste-wise it was fine but the consistency was off. My expectations of a souffle at a Mediterranean restaurant were also not high.

Tuna Carpaccio and  Beef Carpaccio are both delish, order those if they sound even the least bit appealing. 

If you like scallops and risotto...the Pan Seared Scallops are worth ordering. The new england style lobster roll is actually a sub...my cousin was like UUHHH, but it was still good because it was loaded with chunks of lobster and was flavorful. 

Service is above average, and I'd come back again. It's not too pricey for its dining atmosphere and the fact that it's in Bellagio-welll of course for the food as well. 

Definitely drop by if you're looking for a lunch spot and is staying or visiting Bellagio.",0,0,0

The first day, I was alone for lunch so I sat at the bar. Two very professional servers with knowledge and personality waited on me. I had no idea what I wanted, so I did what is generally the safe thing. I asked for a recommendation.

The gentleman behind the bar highly recommended the Beef Carpaccio. This amazing dish includes gorgonzola polenta, parmesan, cipollini onions, balsamic reduction, scallion cream, and garlic aioli. I've included a photo so you can witness for yourself this succulent treat. It was the perfect lunch dish in every respect. 

On the second day, I came back for lunch with a coworker and we sat at a table. A nice server came over to take our orders and today, I felt like pizza. So I again asked for a recommendation. The server said, ""Well...it may sound strange, but I think the Fig & Prosciutto flatbread pizza is the best."" 

Figs in pizza? Really? Okay. Fig & Prosciutto it is. And she was right. It was a heavenly flatbread. The figs were, in fact, the highlight of the meal. A unique blend of flavors and I highly recommend you try it.

Something I also like about this restaurant is that when you're seated, they give you a free sample of their various Olives spreads, along with bread that ranges from soft to crispy. You could almost make a meal of these. And since I like olives, I'm a huge fan of the spreads. 

The atmosphere here is outstanding as well. Inside and out. And if you choose to dine outdoors on the terrace, you're right in front of the Bellagio fountains. Enjoy the water show, music, fine cuisine, and the misters (if it's hot outside) gently spraying cool water down to you. 

If you like olives, you love Olive's.",1,0,2

Two words....Delightful Ambiance.....The place was full as I hear it usually is on weekends.  Since this was our first time in Vegas and we hadn't seen the fountains, I requested a table with a fountain view.  It turned out they were able to seat us on the balcony by the railing.  If you will look at the photos I posted, you will see the view was truly something to behold.  After reading the countless reviews touting how supreme the Carpaccio was, I decided I would have to try it.  I was a little apprehensive about trying it when first found out that Carpaccio is raw meat, but when I got to the restaurant I decided that there was NO way I was leaving without trying it, because who knows when id have another opportunity to try Beef Carpaccio.  It turned out to actually be quite enjoyable!  The Onions are juicy and filled with flavor, the Meat has a pleasant taste to it that I cant put my finger on and the sauce and breading definitely complete the meal.  I think its funny though, that after thousands of years without fire and the ability to cook our meat, uncooked meat is considered a delicacy. Just thinking out loud.  The Slow and Low Braised Ribs were so tender that the steak knife was pointless. You could easily pluck pieces of tender juicy flesh away from the slab and every bite was savory.  Since my girlfriend was not having anything to do with the carpaccio (or so she thought. I made her try some and she said it was alright but never again), she ordered the Alla Napoletana Flat bread ( I posted a pic) which turned out to be pretty good as well.  The appetizers are meant to be shared so they come in large portions.  We ended up having to take half the flatbread home.  She ordered the Ribeye, which she said was okay, but they went a little Overdose on the Green Beans. Since it was an occasion I decided id try a margarita (regret it, should have gotten wine) which turned out to be good.  The gf ordered the Bellini which is sparkling wine and peach puree. Overall the experience was good, and Id recommend the Carpaccio and Braised Beef. What was NOT okay with the experience was that there was a lady from Olives walking around taking professional photographs and offering $50 packages.  When I told her I had my own digital camera and wanted her to please take a picture of us using our camera instead she said ""Oh no, Im sorry.  Theres a liability risk right there and im not allowed"" and she walked away.  The couple at the table next to us had overheard and were like ""Thats such BullSh*t ""  They were kind enough to offer to take pictures of us and we thanked them.  Coincidentally 30 minutes later that same lady was making her rounds, and was like ""Oh what the heck, ill take your guys picture for you""....Now im sure you could see the smirk on my face as I looked her over. I told her we'd already taken pictures but thank you anyways. I looked over at the table next to us and they were laughing and pretty much told me if it were them, theyd have told her to **** off. Haha. Besides that slight incident, everything was great and the staff was more than accommodating!",0,0,0

I moved 2500 miles earlier this year and my sister and I did our annual Vegas trip right before. I had  been searching for the best beef carpaccio in the city and supposedly, Olives had it. 

When we stopped by we found out after inquiring that restaurant hadn't opened yet. When we expressed interest in dining when it did open, no one informed us that there were no reservations and standing in line would be the best thing to insure a patio table (we had made it clear we were hungry and desired to sit outside by the fountains to see the show). Therefore, when we came back, there was a very long line. I wasn't happy and neither was my sister. When I went to speak to the front of house team, they didn't seem at all concerned that they had dropped the ball. I would say that my casual clothing put them off, but first, that shouldn't make a difference. Second, if they are going to do that, they should have been able to discern that although I was dressed casually, I was wearing about $10k in clothing, my clutch, shoes and jewelry. 

So we are put onto the patio and things just went downhill from there. Although there were available tables in front right next to the water, we were given the ""bad"" table, the one right by the server station. The table next to us asked why if there were no reservations why they weren't sat up in the front and were given a BS answer (that the tables were reserved). Considering that they were a nicely dressed young couple, you have to wonder who you have be to be given a good table here. We were ignored for quite a while, even after placing our menus closed in front of us. Once our server did show, he treated us like kids at Christmas who snuck over to the adults' table a year before being called up. I dine at places like this or better on a consistent basis. My choice of casual wear on a long weekend with my sister doesn't change my speech, manners or decorum. None of the high end stores we shopped in while waiting for them to open had an issue with the way we were dressed. If we weren't so hungry, we would have left. I treat everyone no matter what their capacity with dignity and respect. However, being spoken to like we didn't belong by our server was rather disconcerting. 

Our food finally arrived and I don't recall what my sister ordered (I'll have to ask her), but I recall that she said it was ok. My beef carpaccio was outstanding. Which makes the experience that much more disappointing. 

Midway through our meal, the other tables that were empty started to fill. It was clear that the servers knew a table of elderly people that they placed next to the water. My sister and I had never been there before and after this experience, most likely never will again. Before anyone says that they must of had a reservation, it states on the Bellagio website they don't take reservations for the patio (in fact, when we came back, she again informed me that they don't take reservations).

We wanted dessert, but frankly I wasn't about to spend another dollar in a place that had gone out of its way to treat us the way they had. I shouldn't have to walk around flashing my boyfriend's black card or have him make a call for people to treat us well. It wasn't a birthday, anniversary, etc. we were celebrating, but my sister and I weren't going to see one another for a long time and this was time spent together before my move. We didn't allow it to ruin the rest of our day because we aren't like that, but given that it's a restaurant in the Bellagio, if you can't get even acceptable service here, where can you? My birthday is next month and we are doing our 2015 trip then. I am considering staying at the Bellagio. But the way we were treated at one of its restaurant gives me multiple reasons  to rethink that.",2,3,0

I'm not sure how this place has a good score on Yelp. The service is odd, too many people try to get involved with your table and none of them are particularly helpful or useful! The food was very average\/poor.

My espresso martini cocktail was excellent, the best of its kind I've ever had. When we came to order wine a strange lady approached us, asked if we needed help then, after we said we thought we would order the Riesling we had seen on the menu,  proceeded to talk about the fact they had Riesling while looking across the room at other tables the whole time. Very odd and completely useless.

A gentleman came over, told us all about the 3 types of water they do and brought us tap after we asked for that. He frequently topped up our water glasses, far more than was necessary and to the point where it was annoying to have him lean over us every couple of minutes. The bread basket was ok. One of the breads was strangely sweet and not nice, the others were just alright. The olives and tapenade were just about edible, nothing special and not particularly pleasant, some of the olives were quite bitter.

The mains came out with a side of zucchini that I'd ordered. This was stone cold so I sent it back. It was replaced but so slowly that we'd finished our food by the time it came out but they still charged us for it! Such poor service. My main of butternut squash pasta was no better than any high street Italian restaurant but much more expensive. The plate was cold meaning the food was lukewarm and the kitchen hadn't bothered to wipe the splashes of sauce off the edges so the whole thing looked messy. The hazelnut biscotti crumbled on top gave the dish an unpleasant sweetness.

They then brought us an small plate of profiteroles (3 tiny things) as a 'treat' for our honeymoon. These were dry and tasteless, we had been planning to order desserts but this put us off and we just left.

We were fortunately enough to arrive to ""the best seat in the house,"" patio seating facing the Bellagio fountains with perfect weather to boot. Amazing views definitely created a romantic atmosphere for my girlfriend and I.

All meals are served with an assortment of bread that comes with a unique tray of both black and green olive dip. It also comes with full olives as well.

- Beef Carpaccio $18 - AMAZING. My girlfriend doesn't generally like non-fish meats all that much, but we both LOVED this dish. It is a huge serving for only two people and will fill you up. Cited by our waiter as ""Olives' best dish."" JUST ORDER IT.
- Black Olive Gnocchi - for her. I believe this was a special. My girlfriend loved it.
- Flank Steak $28 - One of their specials. It was good. Not anything out of this world, but I enjoyed it.
- Three Seasons Sorbet $6 - A good dessert. Seasonal and reasonably priced.
- I don't recall how much drinks cost here, but I don't remember it being anything over the top.

Service was exceptional. Our server was witty and the staff was conscious as to not interrupt picture taking, even offering to take pictures for us. I was drinking water like crazy that day and never reached the bottom of my glass.

If it is a special occasion, it is definitely worth waiting for patio seating. Lunch being just over $100 for two, this is definitely a ""special occasion"" type restaurant and lives up to expectations.

We had reservations for a group dinner, and while the service was good I just wasn't overly impressed with the meal. We started with some flatbreads and a charcuterie board, and I think my favorite part of the charcuterie were the meats they chose to include - salami + prosciutto. The flat breads were good, but not anything you couldn't find somewhere else. I settled on the lobster pasta for dinner because I was really wanting a nice warm and heavy pasta for dinner...in August...this sounds weird, I know....but it really just didn't deliver. It was filling, but just didn't quite have the flavor I was looking for and felt it was just a little bland.

 I have to preface this review with, this is my first visit here and we came here specifically for restaurant week, the lunch menu.

Original plan was to sit outside on the nice terrace overlooking the Bellagio fountains, but the weather prevented us from doing that, so the hostess sat us next to the window, which was perfect. Our server suggested 2 of his favorite mixed drink specialties from the bar, I wish I could remember the names of them, they were so good.

For my app I went with Crispy Lamb Riblets; Sweet Corn Raita, Lamb Reduction, Honeyed Yogurt, Micro Mint. This was delicious. And rather large for an app, it was perfectly cooked, a little crunch on the outside and tender on the inside. My friend ordered the Wild Mushroom Tart; Caramelized Onions, Herbed Imported Goat Cheese, Truffle Essence. This also was delicious, had the perefect amount of every ingredient.

We both chose the same main course, Pacific Sole Milanese; Creamy Fava Bean Risotto, Garlicky Spinach, Lemon Caper Butter Emulsion, Shaved Fennel Insalata.  Right away I noticed it looked greasy, I think the combination of the Milanese with the caper butter emulsion made this dish very heavy and it covered the taste of the Sole. I kept having to drink water after every bite. I loved the risotto and spinach under the fish, so that's what I ended up eating. Dissapointed because I ended up not eating the fish.

We both chose the same dessert as well, Tiramisu Cannoli; Cinnamon Spiced Cake, Espresso cream. This was a different twist on tiramsu, which is one of my favorite desserts. It had a good flavor, nothing spectacular.",0,0,0

I came here for a special dinner during my bachelorette party. The service I received from most of the staff was fine, but our waiter was seriously the rudest waiter I have ever encountered. The more I think about it, the angrier I get. 

To start off, when I made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating a special occasion and I told them it was my bachelorette. At dinner I even had a ""Bride to Be"" sash on and not once did he acknowledge our special occasion, no congratulations, no nothing, whatever. Before taking our order he seemed dismissive to our table. He barely gave us any attention during the meal, and when he did, he was extremely rude and aggressive with us. I guess I would understand if we were being difficult, but I thought we were an extremely tame and polite table throughout the entire meal. 

He seemed even more annoyed when we didn't order enough for him. We had a huge lunch so most of us weren't very hungry and ordered some less filling items. He repeatedly made comments about how little we were eating and if we were ready to finally order steak and lobster. It was extremely annoying and condescending. I understand it's important to waiters for their tables to order a lot, but even if we don't, that does not give you the right to treat us poorly.

As for the food, my sister and I ordered Tuna Tartare, Ricotta Ravioli, Sangria and Chocolate Cake, all the items were delicious. 

At the end of the meal he gave us a ton of grief about splitting the check. My cousin who has worked as a waitress for years tried working with him to see which way to split the check would be the easiest. He basically yelled at her about how difficult the check was and blew her off. We then found out that his job was not even to ring us up, a cashier does that. On top of all the drama, all our cards were charged 2-3 times. I'm sure this will be resolved, but it was just icing on the cake for such a horrible service experience. 

Seriously, this guy was straight up mean to us the entire meal. But, despite his horrid attitude, I still had a fantastic bachelorette weekend.",0,0,0

Located in the Bellagio on the lake with the Bellagio fountains, olives had a mix of Mediterranean\/Italian inspired tapas and entrees. Definitely an olive lover's paradise.  

Location: The wait for the outdoor table was well worth seeing the Bellagio fountains every 15 minutes. I almost forgot that I was on the Strip. There are also heat lamps on the patio which is nice on a chillier night.
Services: Very good, attentive and funny despite the long wait at the beginning.

Food: The bread and olive spreads were so good (a mix of of foccacia and light chips) I ordered the grilled squid and octopus as my main dish which ended up being plenty of food. While the grilled fish was tender and not chewy, the sauce was a definitely too salty for my liking. Salt does not mean flavor.

Years ago, we ate at the original in Boston and wondered about the ""big deal."" Little did we know, Olives would become institution. 

The bar at Olives in the Bellagio was wonderful.  Curtis, our bartender, took personal care of us, making us feel separated from the hordes that were attacking the Bellagio. We had drinks, a salad, and a hamburger.  They were all great.

This is the Las Vegas location of celebrity chef Todd English's signature restaurant, Olives (named for his ex-wife...funny).  This location happens to be in the stunning and beautiful Bellagio Resort and Casino.  The restaurant itself is also really pretty inside, with a FANTASTIC view of the Fountains (and by proxy the Fountain Show) outside of the Hotel.  So if you can score a table by one of the windows, thats some bonus action for you.
So on to the food...Unfortunately my girlfriend wasn't that hungry.  She had the Ceasar Salad.  Although she did say it was the best Ceasar she had ever eaten, so thats good.  We also munched on the complimentary Olive selection and warm chewy breads brought to our table.  For my main course I went with the Oven Baked Atlantic Swordfish.  It was phenomenal.  The portion was also pretty large, which was nice (although it stopped me from getting Dessert it was so big).  The fish was cooked just right, and the sauce that came on it was outstanding.  I could've ordered a glass of that!  
So anyways if your looking for a lovely dining experience in Vegas, you certainly have a million choices, but you can't go wrong at Olive's, especially with the views.  I wouldn't go back to the one in Vegas, but just because I haven't been to many other places there, and theres so many to pick from.  Las Vegas is dangerous for a foodie.

From what i remember i enjoyed everything, from food to atmosphere. It was an unfortunate that we didnt get to sit by the window and watch the bellagio fountain while we eat, that would have been a bonus.

Till this day, all i can think of is their artichoke salad. It was SOOO freaking good. I sometimes still crave for that salad in which i cannot find anywhere else. I believe it was a special dish for that evening when i went. Whenever I walk by Olives when i'm at vegas, i dont see the artichoke salad on the menu anymore. Anyway, the salad was a small portion, it was very light in the sauce, but at the same time it was very flavorful. I remember there was a buttery taste? actually i'll take that back, i dont even remember and i dont want to say the wrong thing... all i know is that it was really good and that i wish i can have that right now in front of me.

My only complaint would be the seating assignment. I booked a table for two over 60 days in advance with the request to have a patio table. I chose 6pm thinking that it would still be light outside at that time and the patio might not be as popular for requests as it would be later in the evening.

Anyhow, fast forward to the evening of our reservation. We arrived 15 mins prior to check-in. Patio was completely full and although I had made a reservation, we were told a table outside would not be available until approx. 6:40 (almost a full hour after our arrival). 

(Insert pouty face here) However, if this classifies as the biggest wrench in our trip - I'll take that any day.

We were seated at the window, so all in all, we were able to enjoy our evening right away.

Bonus: we had the best ever server named Jaime B. She was professional, attentive, and most importantly made us feel so much at home. Her pacing of the meal was spot on! We have dined here twice before in years past and her service was far superior to the fantastic service we had before.

Okay, the food. THE FOOD!!!

This is why we keep returning to Olives.

Their bread basket and signature olive spreads are phenomenal. I know... bread? Phenomenal? YUP. Can't even explain it - you must try it. And whatever those parmesan crisp things are... Mmmm they are great!

We then had the charcuterie board: If you love cheese and meat as much as we do. Get this. You will not be disappointed. It also had spicy cucumbers in a cute little jar. 

Main dishes: I had the Nebraska Beef Tenderloin (medium) with asparagus and lobster potatoes. Yes you read that correctly. LOBSTER IN MY POTATOES! Heaven help me. I ate every. single. morsel. This would be my request for a last meal if I was on death row. Seriously. 

My husband had the Seafood Risotto that pretty much had every thing found in the ocean in it with a little chorizo thrown in too. Hot damn that was good! It wasn't as creamy as risottos I've had in the past, but that didn't derail the dish. 

Too stuffed for dessert. Yep, you read that right too. For once in my life, I was too full to order dessert. (Next time I won't let that happen! Ha ha!)",3,0,1

As I waited for my meal, I gazed at the then-inactive fountains of the Bellagio. 

When my appetizer finally came out, it was quite good, a nice combination of flavors from the watermelon and feta. More than anything, the salad got me ready for the main course. 

As I waited for my entree, I gazed at a family that came in, ordered, and started on their meal. They got about two-thirds of the way through their lunch before my dish finally came out (over ten minutes after my server said my food would be out in a moment). The wait was worthwhile. The scallops were juicy, but not rubbery, flavorful, but not burnt. The bedding of rice was admittedly a tad bitter, and the sprouts sprinkled all over the dish made little sense, but, overall, the meal blew my doors off. So did the check.

We asked around for advice on ""the one place to go"" for a special evening with great food.  Nobody's advice was really that great.  My advice?  Go to Todd English's Olives in the Bellagio.  The food is excellent, the price is acceptable, the setting is classy, the service is wonderful and friendly, and there is even the chance of sitting on the patio for front row seats of the legendary Bellagio fountain show.

At your table, you'll enjoy the complimentary olive tapenade to death.  We had the portebello flatbread.  It was our all around favorite piece of the meal.  We got a lobster mac n cheese on the side instead of with the steak.  It was killer.  We had the cod cake appetizer.  I might reccomend something else, or one of their flatbread concoctions as an appetizer instead, in case you were skipping it.  They are really great.  We also had the Pacific Sole- paired with a great Pinot (the tablet wine list and interactive pairing menu really helped confirm the choice there), it was perfect.  We were too stuffed for dessert, but their options looked great, plus they gave us a complimentary little treat for our anniversary which was in the same month (how cool!).  

As to the service, we did in fact sit on the balcony and watch the fountain show in our laps.  I couldn't imagine a more romantic or perfect venue in all of vegas, having perused and researched the town a bit.  Again, the perfect one night dinner out for a couple.  Getting a reservation is something the hotel consierge in the Bellagio couldn't do for us, but which the hostess (Erica?) made seem like the easiest thing in the world when I talked to her in person.  The conference went late, and I had to cancel, then move my reservation, making it even more difficult to get in, but she worked it all out and we just showed up and walked right out to our seat!!!  It seemed like usually there is a waiting list and such, so this may not work out the same for all, but I'd give it a shot because it is so very worth it, and they are so very helpful.

For as often as I come to Olives, you would think I would have tried the food by now. After walking the strip or chilling in a nearby casino, I usually work up a thirst for a dirty martini. And after sampling a handful around town--and other cities for that matter--Todd's seems to make the best dirty Chopin vodka martini I've ever had. And of course, they've got the good blue cheese olives.

As far as their signature cocktails go, I can vouch that the Southern Sidecar is a masterpiece. However, as the name suggests, it is mixed with Southern Comfort. I'm partial to SC, so I substitute it with the always reliable Crown. Whiskey and ginger beer make just the perfect match don't they? Generally speaking, I don't venture far from Crown or martinis, but one of the bartenders sampled me a fruity, passion fruit vodka-based cocktail whose name escapes me. If you see it on the menu and aren't ashamed to have a pink drink in front of you, order it. 

Speaking of bartenders, my faves are Ernie and Zach. I can honestly say they're the nicest, friendliest, and most personable bartenders I've ever met. And once you've been there a few times, they'll remember your face, order, and whatever problems you were discussing that evening.

As far as RW2011's Dinner menu these are my thoughts:

First Course:
I ordered the Crispy Pork Lollipops with Sweet Corn Raita and Calvados Demi Glaze.  It is basically pork ribs that are cooked until it is crispy, and unfortunately dry.  The best part of this dish is the Sweet Corn Raita.  I am glad I tried it, but would recommend the Shrimp Scampi Tart that my friends ordered instead.

The Shrimp Scampi Tart served with Fontina Cheese, Caramelized Onions, Red Bliss Potatoes, Sweet 100 Tomatoes, Garlic Butter Sauce and Sexy Scallions (yes, not just your plain old scallions but SEXY Scallions).  It is basically a mini-flat bread served on a bed of fancy salads.  The portion was relatively and was served on a wooden pizza peel.  **Highly recommend this if you opt for the RW Dinner Menu.**

Second Course:
All of them are great!  But if I have to rank them it would be as follows:

1) Pan Seared Yellowtail Snapper; Cilantro Lime Risotto, Sauteed Red Belgian Endive, Brown Butter Emulsion.  Why? Because the fish was cooked perfectly, had great flavor and the the skin is nice and crispy while the rest of the fish was still moist.  And of the three entree options, is the healthiest and tastiest selection.  5\/5

2) Braised Short Rib Lasagna; Horseradish Crema, Imported Brie, Fried Spinach, Toasted Crumbs.  Perfect for someone that loves a properly slow braised short rib, because they are very generous with it. And if you are expecting a medallion size portion, you will truly be surprised by the Claim Jumper portion that they serve you.  Big enough to share with your friends or hoard it all for yourself.  4\/5

3) Grilled Prime Sirloin; Creme Fraiche Whipped Potatoes, Spicy Cauliflower and Green Harissa.  It is a good steak, but with so many restaurants serving fantastic steaks up and down the Strip, it wasn't a real standout or particularly memorable compared to the other two. (This was the one I ended up ordering btw).  3.5\/5

Third Course:
Choice of Vanilla Semifreddo,with Marble Cake, Chocolate Sauce, Fresh Strawberries.  OR Banana Delight; Chocolate Fudge Cake, Banana Ice Cream, and Caramel Dipped Banana.  We all ended up ordering the Banana Delight, which was a pretty good dessert.  

Service was good, no complaints what so ever.  4.5\/5

Ambiance:  upscale,dim lighting (great for romantic dinners, bad for taking food pictures), comfortable seats, great view of the Bellagio Fountains. 4.5\/5

Food:  4\/5  Food and its presentation were both good.

Value:  5\/5 RW Prix Fixe - awesome value for the meal and a portion goes to a worthy cause!

Location:  5\/5  Call in advance and reserve patio seating for front row view of the hourly Bellagio Fountain Show.

Olives had a summer tasting menu which ended on July 30th and we just made the cut.  Before I even tell you how great the food was, what a freaking value!! For $30, you got a 3 course lunch.

First Course:
choice of grilled vegetable gazpacho
or
Eggplant tart

Second Course:
Choice of rock cod po' boy
prime sirloin
or
herb roasted chicken with fettucine pasta

Third Course:
Carrot Cake!

My friend had the soup and chicken.  She was kind enough to give me a bite and the chicken was awesome and I don't even really like fettucine.  I had the eggplant tart, which I shared and we both agreed that it was awesome.  The eggplant was breaded and fried and had the consistency of chicken tenders on a flatbread pizza.  Served with arugula.  Yeah, it sounds weird, but it was really really good.  My entree was the sirloin and I loved every bite.

Another bonus, this place has a great view and a lovely patio.  We thought about sitting outside but sweating my balls off makes it a little hard to enjoy lunch, so we passed.  Would definitely like to come here when the weather cools.  Plus, unlike some of the places in the Bellagio, this place regularly switches up its menu.

We started with the flatbread--the HouseFarm? one (with asparagus).  It was solid and had a nice texture.  I preferred the taste of the foccacia bread that came at the start of the meal but this was a good choice for an app and was a good choice to split among three people.
For my entree, I had the mushroom papperdelle.  It was really good.  The description is right on except for the lack of mushrooms in the dish.  There were actually very few mushrooms in the dish but it was still good.  Nothing amazing or different but a very good dish.
The drinks were good (strong).  My friends loved their drink called the Slingback--very delicious and sweet.  I had a martini which was good.

The service here was awesome! Our server Ralph was very knowledgeable and eager to help. The wine guy (not sure of his official title) Adam was awesome too. I remembered having an awesome glass of wine at the bellagio previously and he was so helpful in finding it for us!  

We started with the polenta and it was quite good. I decided to splurge and order the rib eye steak special, which was $50!! Others in my party ordered the goat cheese raviolis and the beef tenderloin. I wasn't blown away with my choice. I was hoping for the price tag I'd devour my meal. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. My other friend that ordered the beef wasn't uber impressed either. The raviolis were awesome though.

My sister and I, with our spouses, came to dinner here to celebrate our mom's 85th birthday with our ""almost dad"". (step dad who is really our dad now.)

The restaurant is pretty and overlooks the Bellagio fountains - awesome!

Waitstaff were very nice.  

The cocktail special was sublime.  I wish I had ordered it - fruit juices with vanilla infused vodka.  Heaven. Truly.  

They brought us white chocolate and walnut foccacia with walnuts, flat bread and some other delicious homemade buttery bread with bowls of mixed olives and two kinds of olive tapanade.   This sent my husband and I directly to the moon, do not pass go, do not collect $200.   He had to bring the manager over to tell her that this, so far, was the best meal he had ever had in Vegas - and we were only on cocktails and bread.  

Once actual eating commenced, things were a bit spottier.  For salads, we all stuck with Ceasar salads.  Pretty good, but WAY too pricey.  No simple green salad should be $17, especially when you have to leave the restaurant and cross the casino plaza to use a public bathroom.  Totally kills whatever elegance you were going for when there is a changing table and public bathroom stuff around you and you are tottering around on your best, most elegant heels, trying hard to be cool. 

Pasta and appetizers included:  Unbelievable little bay scallops in a whiskey cream sauce.   So so so so so so good.  But rich.  Super rich.  Fried prawns - excellent!!   Osso Busso pasta - ummmm.   Savory and meaty and rich.  Pasta was fresh and perfect.  Butternut squash Tortelli - beautiful flavor of fresh sweet squash in perfect pasta.  Sauce was a mite sweet, but perfect as a shared first course.   Goat cheese balls - good, but not nearly as successful. It was really a shrimp dish.  Lots of shrimp, few pasta balls filled with goat cheese.  Disappointing.  For a $38 pasta course, it should have been a --- well, a pasta course.  Honestly, I would have taken most of the shrimp out of it, doubled the pasta and cut the price in half.  

Main courses - Best was the scallops.  Perfectly cooked on rounds of english pea polenta with swirls of beets.  Beautiful and delicious.  If you like scallops, you should look no further.  

Someone ordered the pork chop.  He, actually a picky eater, devoured it instantly and practically licked the plate.  He proclaimed it wonderful and I believe him.

I was the only loser.  I had the striped bass.  The fish tasted funny and it was overcooked.   The funny taste might have been simply the true taste of the fish and I suspect it was no fault of the cook.  But it tasted foul.  I also really hate overcooked fish.  I understand they were really trying to get that skin crispy, and it was.  So - my dinner was really fish skin and broccollini.   Oh, there was a rather ho-hum risotto under the fish.  It was kind of good, but only ok.   Luckily, I was so stuffed from eating from everyone else's plate, it really did not matter at all.  

All in all, it was a wonderful experience and I heartily recommend visiting.  (Just don't order the striped bass).",2,2,2

I guess Todd himself dined here and had an experience similar to mine, and didn't want his name associated with the place.

The food ranged from tasty cheese on the charcuterie board and surprisingly good espresso martinis, to average\/mediocre everything else- and we ordered a lot. Tables are initially served a breadbasket with three mismatched breads, and a tray of olives and two tapenades- the green is best.

CHARCUTERIE BOARD: two types of tasty cheeses (one was a blue), two types of meat (salami and prosciutto?), dates, candied walnuts, and crisps. Wish I could tell you what type of cheese it was, but all dishes were presented without any sort of explanation or comment.
FOIE GRAS: served with fresh fig (singular), port reduction (gross), and truffle crema (tastless, certainly no truffle here). Served without any sort of crackers or bread, and our breadbasket was empty and no one ever refilled it.  Did not care for the texture, flavors seemed off. Would have shared this with my server, but we never saw him.

BRICK OVEN ROASTED FREE RANGE CHICKEN: served with a potato cake and green means, all amid a sea of tasty jus, but the chicken itself was bland. Recurring issue with dishes here. Again, even just salt would have helped this dish.
BONE-IN NY STRIP SPECIAL: served with green beans and fingerling potatoes, steak was plated with a giant puddle of some sort of cabernet sauce? Guess it was meant to hide the fact that the meat was flavorless aside from gobs of fat in every bite, and unseasoned to the point that it desperately needed salt. No char or sear at all. 

MUSHROOM RISOTTO: decent-ish side, mediocre version of a favorite dish. The table ate the entire portion though.
CRISPY ZUCCHINI: no menu description, expected a roasted version but received a plate of tempura zuke covered with cheese. Hard not to like that but odd considering the rest of the menu. 

As you can see, we had issues with the service. The restaurant wasn't that busy, yet we rarely saw our server. Literally went 20 minutes wanting a martini that I couldn't order because he never came by. When he did, he didn't seem to care at all. We were asked what we wanted to drink, what we wanted to order, and if we had any questions- no intro, no script, no explanation of specials, devoid of personality. Didn't even ask to see a dessert menu because we were so put off by the flavorless food and nonexistent service.",10,4,5

When I put the reservation Tuesday @8 through phone, I asked the hostess if I'll be able to book a table outside facing the Bellagio fountain because that is the whole reason I wanted to dine here. The hostess told me they cannot have me seated outside and if I want a table then I had to wait like 20-30 minutes. I asked her if I were to come in early how long would I have to wait since my reservation was at 8pm. She said doesn't matter you can come early but still you will be waitlisted to seat outside. Unfortunately we were not able to go early we were there about 8:02pm which is like 2 minutes by our reservation time. When I asked her if we were able to seated outside she said it will be @9:45pm which is like only 15 minutes away from closing time of the restaurant. We were little upset and we said it's fine and we still had to wait like another 5 minutes to have seated inside the restaurant. 

The restaurant was overly busy that night. When I meant overly busy it was packed!!!! The tables are super close to one another thus the restaurant was extremely loud. We had to talk over each other because of the noisy level. Me and my sister had really bad migraines that I had to take bunch of Advil to get over it! 

Our waiter and runner was super nice. Especially the runner we had I do not got his name but he was a short Hispanic man with a mustache and was super attentive and quick. 

The food selection for dinner is really bad! I have been to other fine restaurants and they had better selections. This was more mediocre. But the main reason I got tired was the amount of time we had to wait for our food! However their portobello flatbread was really yummy! I highly recommend ordering it!

She had no clue what we had planned for her bday. The only thing she knew was we were going to a nice dinner the night of. I jumped on yelp to find a really nice restaurant that would also be a memorable experience for her. I decided to reserve a seat at Olives with a balcony seat in mind. I knew it would be extremely difficult to get but it was definitely worth a try. I called the restaurant asking for the balcony seat and they said they come as they are and it's by pure luck! So I told them it was my fianc√©'s birthday and I wanted the best seat at the time even if it's not on the balcony, at least a nice view from the inside.

So once we arrived and checked in, the host winked at me and said my table is ready. I thought we were for sure going to sit on the balcony as we were headed to our seat, but then we made a sharp left around the corner to a booth. My fianc√© had no clue what I was up to and she was extremely happy and grateful just to be in the restaurant, which was cool. We took our drink orders and enjoyed drinks while ordering our meals. 

While sitting there waiting for our food and admiring the ambiance our waiter comes out and says, ""your food is coming and I hear it's her birthday so I'm going to have them send your food out to the balcony. We have a seat that just opened up!"" So we grab our drinks and head out to the balcony. The look on my fianc√©'s face was priceless! We had the most amazing time and the food was great! That was definitely an experience we will never forget. 

I can't thank the staff enough for making this happen and the restaurant is beautiful inside and out! Roughly every ten minutes the fountains spring up to music while enjoying your meal. My scallops were amazing and my fianc√© really enjoyed her grilled beef tenderloin with mash potatoes. 

I highly recommend Olives to anyone looking for great service, friendly staff and amazing food! They went over and beyond to give us the best experience for her birthday and I'm forever grateful! Thank you!

The OK: the mushroom pasta is 'highly recommended' according to the server. Tasty but over cooked, came out as more of tasty, flat noodled goo. 

The bad: octopus and squid appetizer. Made with hummus so the char taste of the grilled octopus mixed with the hummus produces a bitter, off putting flavor. Watery, not particularly visually appealing. Note I order grilled octopus wherever possible. I love it and this is not up to standards.

I ordered the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi. It came  with a crispy crust, perched on a bed of lime and cilantro basmati rice, ginger bok choy, miso butter sauce, and crispy leeks. The lime and cilantro gave the dish a super fresh flavor, the butter sauce was creamy and delicious, and the veggies were a great compliment.

We were made to wait almost 10 minutes before being seated, which would have been fine if the restaurant was busy or full, but there were dozens of empty tables. The service after that was like a drive-by; the waiter came by and asked if we wanted bottled or regular water then sprinted away, came back and asked for our drink order then sprinted away, etc. All of the bussers and servers apparently had all been trained in the same fashion, to speak quickly and abruptly, then sprint away. Plates clanked loudly on the tablecloth-less table as they were all but tossed onto the table. Well, at least I can't complain about the service being slow or inefficient

Food: in general, everything we ordered was smothered in sauce, making it impossible to taste any of the actual food itself. This was true of the carpaccio, gnocchi, and pork chops. The four slices of duck included with the gnocchi was very gamey - and this coming from a girl who loves lamb and other meats that live on the edge of gamey. 

In all, this was a very blah date night experience, and I probably won't be back any time soon.",5,2,0

But other than very nice ambiance and a decent Caesar salad, that's essentially all the positive things I can possibly say about Olives.

I ordered the rib eye medium rare, it arrived medium rare and had no flavor whatsoever.  My friend ordered the NY steak medium, it arrived almost well-done and had no flavor.  

The sides we ordered -- mac n cheese and mushroom risotto -- arrived almost 10 minutes after the entrees arrived.  In fact, they arrived after we returned the entrees!  But that was just the start.  The mushroom risotto isn't a mushroom risotto.  It's actually a mushroom porridge.  The consistency was all wrong.  And it looked disgusting.  But it had great flavor.  The mac n cheese arrived as 2 triangles.  It was more a mac n cheese cake.  I've had friend mac n cheese at other places before, but this was odd.  And even with the truffles, the flavor just didn't do it any favors.

The 2nd entrees arrived -- the NY Steak was still almost well done.  THe ribeye was better flavored on one side  and simply over salty on the other side of the steak, so salty that I just decided to skip the other half of the steak.

We were incredibly frustrated with the dinner, at this point, but curiosity got the better of me.  Just how badly could this restaurant make dessert??  We ordered the S'mores panna cotta.  It was a pretty good dessert, but it was nothing to really write home about.

I had kicked around the idea of the chocolate souffle, but I would have been tempting fate.  A *real* restaurant would have suggested if we were interested in the chocolate souffle, that we should put the order in prior to ordering the meal.

That being said, the staff was friendly.  The manager did check in on us after the 2nd entree arrive, and after discovering that one of the entrees was still not done properly, we were comped the price of that entree.


For almost $300, including the price of a bottle of Duckhorn, there are far better restaurants in Las Vegas -- even some with great views too.

Don't bother with this place  Besides, Bellagio is shutting Olives down in 2014.  And it can't come soon enough. 

Anyone with a half decent palate shouldn't bother with this place.",3,1,1

The breadbasket contained some delightfully sweet rolls. They were like a healthy, wholesome cinnamon bun, but without the icing and more bread like. I ate several of those tasty buggers. I ordered the chicken. I know: boring. The leg part of the chicken was good, but when I got to the breast, it was dry. I barely remember the accompanying sides.

The mister and I were so starving after our flight. Olives seemed the only choice as we've been to this restaurant five years for lunch and I remember it being outstanding. 
 
 Well, not quite outstanding this time, but nontheless very good. At 3pm, only the bar menu was being served. We ordered fried calamari, caesar salad, and the flat bread with mushrooms. The mister treated himself to a pear martini. The food and the martini was very delish. Calamari is a huge portion. Todd's version of a caesar salad is quite different as he put his own spin with lots of sliced large tomatoes and make their own croutons, bite size pieces of bread. The flat bread was the highlight of our meal and had that MMMmmm factor.

  The waiter was very attentive and gave a good recommend for pear martini, but the food coming out of the kitchen was very slow. Olives has one of the best views for the fountain show.

Their ""signature"" dish, the sea bass, was pretty to look at but I question its authenticity. And, again, style over substance defined this tasteless dish.

Excellent pasta , great customer service, and a prime view of the famous Bellagio water show.

Enjoyed with my family were the following:

- Onion Foccacia (complimentary in your bread basket): perfect tenderness and flavor pact.

- Gnocchi ($32): Did I mention best ever? No? Because I'm not kidding. I've had some good gnocchi in San Francisco and even Florence, Italy - but this plate in particular hit all the right notes in regards to texture and flavor composition. Delicate pillow-y soft gnocchi layered in a beautiful light tomato coulis with pulled chicken, goat cheese, kalamata olives, and toasted pistachios...this is the kind of dish that I'd love to enjoy again and again and again.

- Fettucini Carbonara ($37): ordered this dish bc I've adored a similarly constructed dish at Haven in Oakland. Crab, pancetta, and egg yolks emulsfied in a cream sauce - all the good guilty things in life - how can you go wrong? As a result, the dish was indeed flavorful and the pasta tenderly al-dente, but just a bit too salty for my palate. Overall, very enjoyable, but Chef Kim Alter's version (Smoked Pasta) still remains my #1.

- Prosciutto & Fig Flatbread ($19). Good, but slightly dissapointed. Prosciutto and figs are such a natural flavor combo that you wonder how on earth can you screw this one up? For some sad reason the figs were so overcooked they tasted like prunes. Or, did someone make a horrible decision to use dried figs...and not fresh figs? Regardless, this was the only dish which we had leftovers of.

- Pomegranite Souffle ($14): Though light and custardy as any good souffle and presented elegantly, the pomegranite flavor is no where to be found. It might've been covered up by the creme anglaise and pistachio ice cream.

All in all, though the prices are a bit on the heftier side for the cuisine, you pay for the view - and the delicious pastas!",1,0,0

Todd English's restaurant is modern with a hint of classical decorative details, and boasts a brief, elegant and comforting menu.  With the Bellagio fountains right outside and an outdoor patio seating area (which is fully booked all day so make reservations in advance for lunch or dinner) for the best view of the fountain show, it's a quaint place to stop by and have some great food.

To celebrate my husband's new job, we ate dinner here and I had to make reservations two days ahead because they are always fully booked if you try for same-day.  We were seated indoors with a nice view of the fountain area, and we were immediately greeted by our server for the evening.  Our napkins were placed on our laps for us, and an option of bottled or regular water was brought to the table (I went bottled).  The server explained the specials for the evening and within ten minutes were ordered food.

The timing is excellent at Olives.  Not only do they have a great bread basket to munch on that comes with a terrific, salty olive tapenade, but the appetizers took no more than 8 minutes from order to table.  I was happy with the lack of wait time for the start of our meal.  We ordered, with the server's suggestion, the portobello flatbread and crab fritters.  The flatbread was outstanding, with the truffle oil enhancing the lovely portobello slices on top of the crispy flatbread.  To even out the texture there were caramelized red onions on top, which cut the masculine mushroom flavor down to perfection.  If I had known that the portions were so big I would order the flatbread as a meal in itself.  As for the lump crab fritters, they were light and creamy inside with a lovely kick of sriracha aioli on top, and a bed of herb sauce to scoop up with the fresh arugula sprinkled atop.  Between the two appetizers I was happy with the flatbread, but crab lovers may devour the fritters here.

After our table was cleared and cleaned up (down to the crumbs, mind you), another 7 minutes passed and our entrees were in front of us.  My filet oscar was beautifully presented and turned out to be quite a large portion.  They split the filet in half, but the filet must be very thick because it honestly looked like two healthy portions of meat on my plate.  The char marks were on the edges, which I love, and the meat was topped with beautiful lump crabmeat and sat on a bed of Japanese asparagus and whipped potatoes.  They drizzled a caramelized onion and wine reduction sauce on top that gave the entire dish that umami flavor.  The asparagus were perfectly blanched and the whipped potatoes were a cloud of heaven on a plate.  As for the filet, it was perfectly cooked and seasoned, not overdone with any extra herbs or spices.  It was simply seasoned and well grilled.  I loved every bite.  My husband's chilean sea bass, on the other hand, was fabulous.  I wanted to eat his plate more than I did my filet at one point!  It was light, creamy, buttery, and had that pan sear on top that just blew my mind.  The shaved fennel with arugula sitting on top of the fish was good when taken as one bite with the protein.  Overall, it was a success!

To complete my review we had to order dessert, so we waited the 10 minutes it took for them to whip up the Madagascar vanilla souffle, cooked to order.  They said it would take 15 minutes, but it arrived within 10.  I took a picture of it (which is here) and when they brought it out it had that beautiful golden top like meringue has when coming out of the oven.  The server took a small scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, gently placed it into the souffle,  then topped the hole he made with an entire carafe of  anglaise.  The dessert was heaven.  It was airy and the vanilla used was so beautiful that I closed my eyes with the first bite.  I love souffles, and in all honesty this one is now one of my favorites in Vegas.  Creamy, airy, and with just the right sweetness, it was the perfect end to the experience.

Overall, great food, excellent service and a wonderful change from any other restaurant on the strip.  With a wonderful menu and excellent flavors and textures in every dish, I truly enjoyed the entire experience.

The menu isn't too exotic so you can bring picky eaters (they chose the roasted chicken) but it also has options for those who like to try new flavor combos.

We went to a lot of very nice restaurants, but this was by far my favorite this time around. Atmosphere is cozy for a romantic night with your lady, but is also sleek enough for a business group. It's not cheap though so just keep that in mind...",1,0,0

We offered our guests tuna or beef tartare, Caesar salads or hummus as a vegan option. Hummus portions were huge! Tuna and beef tartare got a ton of good reviews from friends and family!

If this happens, go play some blackjack or craps, because it is worth the extra wait time.  The food was good, but not outstanding.  My husband and I shared a salad, sausage flatbread, and their ravioli with lobster.  I have to admit, the ravioli dish was delicious and different - somewhat sweet with corn essence.

Oh dear lord, they are like pillows of silky goodness, crafted by baby angels and seared with flames from heaven.. Not that heaven's particularly known for its flames. So maybe flames from hell. But you know, when I think of flames from hell, I think of like super spice! Tongue-numbing hot stuff! And these scallops aren't like that at all. They're tender, juicy, mounds of love, served on a bed of creamy risotto... *sigh*

Well anyways, that was my experience the first two times I came here. The third time though, the scallops lacked flavour and the risotto was undercooked. I could feel each separate grain straining against my teeth, and that ain't good. You want your risotto to MELT once it comes in contact with your tongue!!!

If you want a somewhat interesting experience, go for the halibut. It rests on a mound of lime-green risotto that tastes like a savory margarita. And I mean that in a good way. Like, you know, margarita, but warm and rich and salty. Okay that doesn't sound too good, but trust me, it's better than it sounds!

The service here ranges from ehhh to awesome, depending on when you come. Given the time, our servers were able to pile on the charm and lavish upon us their flattery and attention and come up with numerous recommendations for the night. But when we came again on a Saturday night, the servers were harried and would often disappear for 20 minutes at a time.

Getting a seat on the balcony that overlooks the Bellagio fountains is a truly wonderful experience, especially at night, though the inside of the restaurant is fine too (a steakhouse feel due to the dimmer lighting).

Have had really standout service here -- the waiters, managers, and sommelier will take good care of you.  A final word on the atmosphere; the last two times I have gone, I have seen a proposal on the balcony (outdoor seating area), so it really is quite special.  I do feel that this is priced into the menu, so if you are not at all interested in watching the fountains or dining at the Bellagio, you could easily get as good a meal elsewhere on the strip at significantly lower cost.

The reservations line you get through Google or Bellagio.com connects to the hotel's central reservations line, and they don't have a very good sense of how booked the restaurant is.  By asking the central reservations agent to connect you directly to the host (""can you transfer me to the restaurant?""), you will often be able to get a table even if the reservations agent tells you that the restaurant is fully booked.",1,0,0

The staff was very friendly and allowed us to take it all in and take our time; we were there for about three hours! It was great and well worth it.

I had made a reservation 2 weeks in advance and requested to hopefully sit on the patio. The lady said she would put it in, but it isn't guaranteed, I said fine. We were so excited to finally eat here after all the reviews. 
Something must have happened to the chef!
First of all, the front desk lady was horribly rude and condescending. I told her I would love to have my requests met since this was a special occasion and my reservations were 2 weeks in advance.
BE WARNED reservation or not, the patio is first come first serve. Great. This is the ONLY reason you would go to this restaurant and they know it. 
She told me I had to wait 45 min. We had show tickets in about 2 hours that was cutting it close. That was a NO.
She ROLLED her eyes and said ok, wait here then. Excuse me little lady, but get over yourself. 
I politely asked ( I know you think I was rude, but seriously I was trying to have my polite Vegas face on when you try to get things your way), asked her if we could get something close to the patio doors so we could at least see out the window. 
This place is SO dark inside, that I was sure my dad would complain that he couldn't even see the menu. Yes, he did. 
You know where there little hipster sat us? It was near the window...BEHIND the busboy\/cashiers desk area. What view did we have? NOTHING. Urrrghhhhh
Ok, well I thought the food would make up for it. No. 
The food is so overpriced for what you get, and I dine out a lot am willing to pay for a great meal (at Atelier the portions are 2-3 bites for $20+ COMPLETELY worth it). 
Oysters- SALTY, bland and yuck. You get 4 in an order for $17
Carpaccio- Ok this was not bad. It was not the best, but ill give them this one.
Ceaser Salad- $17- Good. How could anyone mess this one up. Count them...1 ....one.... crouton in the salad. Thats right. 
Mahi Mahi- SALTY and not not not worth $45
Steak- Edible, good portion, you can have better elsewhere
Salmon- ok. 
Complimentary dessert for mom's birthday- 3 pea sized truffles. Wow do they splurge or what.!
Seriously, our waiter was excellent, friendly and funny. The food was not memorable or good. 
Total bill was around $250 for 4 people that are including a beer and a bottle of wine ($34).

Decor is contemporary and wood-rich, seating a little cramped, balcony availability a little confusing. 

We came in toward the end of the lunch session but too early for the dinner session so things were in a bit of upheaval as they wound down to finish one mealtime and to prep for the next. After a wait and a search for who to talk to to get seated, we were finally seated at a long half&half (half bench\/half chair) row of tables. I could extend my arm and eat off my neighbor's plate if I wanted to. It was a little noisy due to all the hard surfaces in the restaurant, but not too bad. The decor was beautiful.

I selected the Beef Carpaccio (not having any idea what Carpaccio was) over the Tuna Carpaccio. When it arrived, I wasn't sure if I was seeing raw meat on there or not. Perhaps it had been cured in some way but kept the raw look of beef. I hesitatingly forked off a small taster portion, not knowing if I would actually like this concoction or not. OMG... heaven! It was SOOOO good! One of those dishes that just teases and excites every little tastebud in your mouth! Textures, flavours, everything! LOVED IT! Actually, I loved it so much, I have no memory whatsoever of what my husband ordered. I know he liked it, though. :o) 

Service was ok. Seemed a little confused initially. But once we got our server and our order in, she seemed a little more aware of getting back to us every once in a while.

Ambiance:
The ambiance is breath taking. Sitting outside you get a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountain show, when the weather permits. Sitting inside is not as satisfying, it is a little dark and subdued. If you are looking for romantic the outside patio is incomparable. The wait staff is friendly and professional. One more thing I must add is that this is a good place for lunch because if you do sit outside you want it to be sunny so you can get a picturesque view of the strip and ""Lake Belagio"". 

Food:
They bring out some very nice basket of  breads with a variety of olives and olive tapenade (hence the name olives, get it).
Items that I have tried: 
Beef Carpaccio (usually always on the menu), perfectly executed. For those who are squeamish about raw food or meat, be a little adventurous it will pay off. 
Lobster Risotto (seasonal) this is one of the highlights, phenomincal, comes in a light cream sauce, perfectly cooked arborio rice, with plump chunks of lobster meat. 
Lamajoun Flatbread - has ground lamb on it, I know that some american palates find lamb troubling, I myself am a fan of GOOD lamb. This pizza-esque dish made for a great appetizer for four.
Ricotta Ravioli - I personally do not like ricotta on the west coast, usually it is unseasoned and flavorless, not at olives. The sauce is vivid and with the sausage crumbles, these scrumptious and al dente firm pockets of well seasoned ricotta just shine.

Food: Good

We ordered:

Eggplant Parmigiana flatbread
roasted roma tomato, caramelized onions, fresh buffalo mozzarella, 
garlicky bread crumbs, pistachio basil pesto.....18

- The flatbread was pretty good. Considering I don't eat veggies, I dug this. This is green eggplant not purple, which threw my mom off. Was a little greasy but still good.

Porterhouse Steak 
crispy fried lobster mac & cheese, shiraz demi glaze, butter braised broccoli, red pepper pur√©e.....56

- Ordered medium-well and it came out fairly rare. The demit glaze was amazing and the steak was very, very tender almost falling off the bone. The lobster mac n cheese was ice cold (probably sitting around waiting for the steak). One of the men standing around noticed my discontent and attempted to fix the situation by offering to bring out a warm side and he did, however he brought out the wrong side. Crab cake!! And it was bomb. Not right but nice effort.

Rainbow Trout, came with Brussel Sprouts risotto? and something else.. $38?

- Mom got the special for the day and enjoyed her meal greatly. She said she wished there were more brussel sprouts.

Bill ended up being $163 before tip. Not bad. Two entrees, the flatbread as an app, two glasses of wine and dessert. I was expecting it to end up being about $230 without tip.

Considering how many people I send here a week and how much they all pay for dinner I was expecting service to be top notch. It was not. My server was less than attentive. I think he was either trying to get laid or get a big tip from the six top of chicks sitting a few tables away. I decided to bring my mother out to a nice dinner and the service was lacking. My mothers been a waitress herself for 25+ years and I myself work in the industry and we both thought the server sucked. I don't think I'll be back despite how good the food was.

Oh and the server ended up getting screwed because his party of six all wanted seperate checks and paid with credit cards. Karma for you buddy!",3,1,1

Here are my tips and recommendations:
-We came here for my grandmothers 80th birthday and made a reservation on open table about a month ahead of time. I would HIGHLY recommend making a reservation as it seems to get filled up fairly quickly.
-We asked for a table on the patio so we could watch the fountains but were told these are not guaranteed and we will just have to see what is available when we come in. When we came to check in we were able to secure a wonderful table were we could watch the fountains several times throughout the dinner. 
-The wait staff was out of this world and were super helpful and made my grandmother birthday one to remember
-I got the Caesars salad, and although it was a very good salad, it wasn't the best I had ever had but I realize I was paying a lot for the ambiance of the place
-The cookie butter creme brulee is the stuff of dreams, it is soooo good!! I am still regretting that I had offered to split it with my sister in law instead of getting my own

They were speared with a Rosemary sprig  and I was instantly in love.

We started with the carpaccio and both had specials - steak and miso bass. Both were delicious, although the miso was a little salty - I had commented that I hoped it wouldn't be salty to the husb when I was thinking about ordering it so I should have seen it coming.

You'll find shades of light Caravaggio
   Would love to portray.
   Its chefs, I would say,
Hit zesty home runs like DiMaggio.

The dark interior of Olives with its spot lamps creates a play of light on dark that a 16th century Baroque painter with a dramatic flair for chiaroscuro would appreciate. The evening we were there, they also hit a tasty home run in my culinary ballpark. However, you don't have to know much about Caravaggio or Joe DiMaggio to appreciate the goodness of this excellent restaurant at the Bellagio.

We arrived early on a Friday night in February before attending the 7:30 Cirque du Soleil ""O"" show. We were shown to a table next to the window where we could easily see the fountains out front. Our waiter, Paul, promised not to dally too much so that we wouldn't be late for the show. Because we were time constrained, we only ordered main courses and wine. There were five of us who ordered and shared four dishes: a sirloin, a beef tenderloin, a pork tenderloin and (last but certainly not least) a lamb popsicle special that I hogged all to myself except for a few bites.

These delicate lamb chops, served rare, were simply luscious. I sampled the tenderloins and sirloin, but their flavor paled next to the lamb. Complementing the meal perfectly was a Petite Sirah from Clavo Vinyards near Paso Robles, CA. There was absolutely nothing petite about its robust tongue-tantalizing presence. I got my big ""O"" for the evening, not from Cirque du Soleil, but from the meaty delights found at O-lives.

Being that we were at the Bellagio, the meal, the tastiest I had in Vegas, was a major $$$$plurge. The bill (excluding tip) came to $330 for four entrees and two moderately priced bottles of wine.",5,1,4

Loved the complimentary spreads that came with bread basket. For an appetizer, we had ordered the Beef Carpaccio which was everyone's favorite as it was very fresh.

My BF had the Fig & Prosciutto Flatbread and thought it unique and very yummy. Crust had the oven brick baked taste to it. I had the Ricotta Ravioli. I was afraid there would be sun-dried tomatoes but the waiter was nice enough to verify with the chef whether or not there was any in the dish. Very bold flavors, I really enjoyed the dish. Our friends thoroughly enjoyed their dishes as well.

Since nearly everyone was still hungover, we all opted for a cup of coffee to end the meal. It was on the weak side :(

The blue nose bass - This was one of the specials on the menu. Blue nose bass has a similar texture to Chilean sea bass, perhaps slightly rougher. The waiter recommended the Chilean sea bass but this one had a more unique pairing. When I find the exact ingredients, I'll add it here =P 

The ribeye - What sucked me in were the croquettes which turned out to be less than spectacular. The ribeye was also not marbleized at all. It tasted more like a mediocre flat iron steak. 

The bread basket with the olive spreads were pretty delicious. I liked the slight sweet raisin like bread in the basket the best. 

I was a tad sad that the meal was on the expensive side but the food was not all around solid. Ah well, I still loved the view and of course the company =P I think this is a great place for appetizers and happy hour to soak in the gorgeous view but I'd probably skip dinner here again. And if you plan to come here for dinner, stick to the bass.",5,3,4

The ambiance is dark and intimate, and if you're lucky you can sit on the outside under heated lames next to the Bellagio Fountain Show.

Overall I think it's a solid three stars. Service was excellent throughout, but I think the style of the dishes tended to be a bit too salty for us and doesn't quite fit our palate.

- The free bread comes with two types of tapenade and pickled olives.  So you get elements of salty and briny early.

- For Appetizers we got the squid and octopus in a brown sauce with chickpeas.  The sauce was actually very good and balanced and went well with bread.  Octopus and squid both very tender - definitely share with two people!

- Wife got the diver scallops which came four large per order - seared on one side, well seasoned and juicy.  Perfectly cooked.  The sauce (vinaigrette ?) made it a bit too salty however.  Truffle mash was decent.

- I got their mushroom pasta, which came with like four types of mushroom with pappardelle pasta cooked al dente.  Flavors were good , but I think it went overboard with the Parmesan.  A bit too much cream too.

- Dessert we shared a pumpkin torte that was just outstanding - it had pumpkin chips, to add texture and zing and layers of sweet and spice just like pumpkin should be.  The cake layer was thin and the whole dish was airy.  It went really well with their black coffee.",1,0,0

Starter, Grilled Squid and Octopus w\/ chickpea vinaigrette.  The ""starter"" was practically a meal for 2.  It was really good though.  The squid was really well cooked.  The octopus could have been a bit more tender but tasted good.

Next we had a flatbread with fig and prosciutto.  The fig component was fig jam and dried fig.  Pretty sweet, but with the prosciutto and cheese, can't recall what kind, i thought it was well balanced.  The GF thought it was just too sweet.  This thing was big too, like a medium pizza. 

Pasta, I ordered Sweet Pea Agnolotti.  Again huge portion, but very good.  A little heavy on the cheese.  But the summer vegetable ""matrix"" served with the cheese and vege filled dumplings was satisfying and almost meaty.

Service: 4
Decor: 4.5

Located inside the Bellagio, this is one of the restaurants that has outdoor seating right in front of the water. Too bad it was so hot, otherwise it would have been sweet to sit outside. 

For lunch my boyfriend and I ordered the Tuna Carpaccio and Lamb Ribs for our appetizers. Personally, I think our appetizers were so much better than our actual entree but oh well. The Tuna Carpaccio was surprisingly good, even though it was a huge piece of tuna covered over some greens and potato (yea, potato wth?) I think at first, it took a little getting used to but I ended up loving it. The Lamb Ribs were delicious, freakin' melt-in-your-mouth good kind of deal. 

For entrees we got the Chicken Waldorf Salad and the Spaghetti. Boyfriend said the salad was good even though it just looked like a huge chunk of lettuce and my spaghetti was okay; very light. I don't think I fully enjoyed it because I was so full from the appetizers (btw, the portions here are pretty damn big haha)

The service was great; very friendly and prompt. All the waiters sported orange shirts that matched the color of the chairs so it was a little bit of overload but oh well.

 We made reservations, so being seated was quick and easy. The decor was beautiful - warm colors and an olive branch motif. An added plus was the bursting fountains right outside the window! My only problem was that the booth I was seated in was too low for the table, so I felt like I was sitting in a hole. 

We were quickly served a variety of breads and olives, which were all very delicious (my boyfriend told me it was the best bread he has ever eaten in his life). I ordered the seared beef tenderloin and my boyfriend ordered the rabbit two ways and some wine. Both were presented beautifully. My steak was cooked perfectly and had the softest texture of any steak I have ever had. There was a quail egg and mushroom ravioli on top of the steak, which was very delicious, yet surprising because the quail egg yolk bursts in your mouth. I think my favorite part of the dish was the crispy parsnip chips that were perched on top like a flower! I tasted the rabbit two ways, which was even better than mine. The flavors were very complex, so we left satisfied.

The service was overall good and the waiter was nice, but I must say he was one of the most awkward servers I have had in a long time. He really did not know how to talk to us. When wine was ordered he could barely ask for an ID. We are  21, we look young, you should not be afraid to ask us for our ID, since it's part of the job. He also seemed to give us different service than the older patrons. I might be young, but when I am ordering the most expensive thing on the menu I would appreciate equal treatment.

They kindly gave us the next available patio table with only an extra 30 minute wait (which wasn't bad, the time flew right by spent at the casino). Our server was a delight, he was nice and informative. He recommended the ""Slingback"" as one of my Birthday drinks and it is definitely a must get!

Our server was kind enough to take a bunch of pictures for us during the dinner, and moving tables and chairs to take pictures of us when the fountains were on.

It was by far the worst restaurant experience we had during our 5-day stay. My husband had been feeling a bit under-the-weather, so we chose not to order any drinks. Once the waiter realized this, he paid absolutely no attention to us except to bring us the food and the bill. He didn't even ask us how the food was, which was too bad, because it was TERRIBLE. 
Everything looked pretty promising when we brought it out, my husband had the salmon and I had venison on top of bacon polenta. The polenta turned out to be the most offensive part of the meal. It was dry, mealy, and over salted. The spinach side was also too salty, and while the venison was decently cooked, it was ruined by the horribly textured mess underneath it. I left most of my food on my plate, and my waiter flew by the pick it up without even beginning to ask if I enjoyed it. My husband's salmon was significantly better than my dish, but still unremarkable for a $25 dish. 

The only upside to our experience was the olive tapenade and bread basket that was served during the wait. Delicious. Unfortunately it did not make up for horrible service, and lackluster overpriced food.

The lobster wasn't light, tender and fresh; it was heavy and a little greasy, again, like it had been sitting around in its sauce for too long.

Ok, I was so disappointed. I truly expected more of this place. I had not eaten at any of Todd English's restaurants so i wanted to give it a try and lets just say it will take me a while before dining at another one of his places. 
Service: staff was helpful and polite, not even once they let me open the door that goes to the patio, where you can see the fountains right in front of you, that was very courteous of them. Then our server was not bad but not the best. We ordered an appetizer right when we sat down and after that i had to say more than a couple of times (during the first mins) that i was not ready yet to order my entree, so i felt a little rushed there. On the other hand, i don't believe he was very knowledgeable about the menu. Don't get me wrong, he knew the names of course, but had several doubts and gaps about the cooking process and the ingredients. I know that might sound a little extreme but when Im paying $50 for a single plate I want to know all the details about it. (The prices are subject to change here, we went during holidays time).
Food: our appetizer was the beef carpaccio. It arrived to the table in a matter of a few minutes. By the time we were already getting a taste of their focaccia bread and their complimentary tapenade (nice start). Carpaccio was 5\/5. Thinly sliced, well seasoned, accompanied by greens, spoon bread, topped with shaved parmesan cheese and drizzled with a yummy reduction. Highly recommended. One more thing, good sharing size. (We were two, but we eat a lot too). 
 I ordered the gnocchi with pulled chicken. The pesto cream was delicious; it was of decent size, not too much chicken in it though. I thought the gnocchi was almost too soft; recalling the ones I had when i went to Italy these lacked some bite. 
Up until here i liked my plate overall, then i bit into a couple of pine nuts that tasted old. It reminded me of a day when i found a little bag of them that i had misplaced, oh were they rancid. Well, i let that go; ate my gnocchi but would not rate it as a 5 stars plate. 
We also had the pork chops. This was the main disappointment. They were hard, dry, spicy (not able to tell from the description in the menu). Nevertheless, it was on a bed of a very buttery polenta(5\/5) and some saut√©ed collard greens. Something that caught my attention was how fast the pork chops arrived. Id say too fast, considering the time pork chops take to cook. That lead me to consider the possibility of the pork chops being previously cooked and then just ""heated?"" I did not say a word of this to my boyfriend for he was the one who ordered them and started eating them. Two bites after he told me the chops were very dry and tough. I told him that a pork chop is not the juiciest thing in the world but then i tried them. He does not know that much about cooking but he does know about eating. And yes, they were dry and tough indeed. A whole plate of dry, tough, spicy pork chops. He does not like spicy food but he combined it with the polenta and was able to finish it. We hate complaining at a restaurant ,( i had never done it before) and my bf always finishes his plates( idk, thats just something he has always done for some other reasons since he was a kid). After finishing our plates I asked the server how they cook the pork chops there, and i think he got nervous. And yes, they do not cook the pork chops to order. I told him they were a little tough and dry, he said he was going to let the manager know. 
End of the meal, i don't know if he told the manager or not because nothing happened. No one passed by our table, no apologies... Just as if nothing had happened. 
Oh and one more thing, it might not have nothing to with the food but lots to do with first impressions, i pointed two misspelled words (from the main menu) to the server. What a joke. That infuriates me, i cant resist misspelled words on prints. Id think at least 10 people'd go over the menu before printing it. 
Well, im not going back.

An enormous bread basket kicked off our meal. It came with two types of olive tapenade and some oil-soaked olives. Very schmancy. For lunch, my friend had the scallops which were fantastic, while I had a Caesar salad with ahi tuna which was light enough for lunch but filling enough for someone who was out boozing until all hours the night before. 

Although we chose to sit indoors, the balcony tables had the advantage of misters and a stellar view of the Bellagio fountains. 

The Stone Cold Fox also known as Todd English wasn't on the line, but I happily daydreamed about him waltzing through the dining room to greet us nonetheless.",4,2,2

We had a 5:15 reservation but be prepared!  We had to wait in line to get seated -- I found that to be odd.  

So on to the food -- the foie gras appetizer was divine.  I had the gnocci and chicken, and there was scarcely 3 tiny pieces of chicken in the dish.  They were so small I had to hunt for them.  My partner had the sea bass, and that looked and tasted good, but the beans that accompanied the dish was weird.

The entire meal with tip was $191.  I probably will never go back there when I'm in Vegas again.",0,0,0

Maybe it was because we tried to go to 2 other places prior that were either closed or had a long wait and we were just hungry, but I'm going to venture that it was actually just that good.

The hostess seated us semi-promptly by Vegas standards and they had a pretty full house. Our waiter was friendly, engaged us in conversation (but not too much), and was willing to give suggestions.

First of all, I have to gush about the olive tapenade they serve with the bread basket - OMG! As a lover of all things olive, I would go back just for this. 

I started off with a tropical martini concoction. I can't even remember what was in it (pineapple juice?), but it was really yummy and had the perfected sugar rim. But it was also $14. Yikes.

Since we were starving (it was 11 pm our 'home' time), we ordered the prosciutto and fig flatbread. It was simply delicious. It had whole figs, and COVERED in prosciutto. Toppings tended to fall off as you took a bite, but it was still delicious.

I had the Chicken and Gnocchi and it was really good. The chicken wasn't as well prepared as the gnocchi and sauce, but overall it was really good. The downside was the flatbread was so large and the olive spreads were so good, I was full by time I got my entree.

One thing I will say is a downside is it is a little pricey for what we got - 1 flatbread, 2 pasta entrees (one with sausage and mine had chicken), and a drink each and it was nearly $150 with tax and tip.",0,0,0

Reservation locked in 3 weeks in advance for 6:45 Friday night. I learned from fellow Yelpers it'll take an additional 45-1 hr for patio seating. Good thing we hit up Wicked Spoon for brunch! We came back around 7:30 and were led past the dim yet lively indoor seating and through the double doors granting entrance (or is it exit?) to the balcony patio overlooking the gorgeous water show every 15 min. I honestly thought our group of 3 would be seated at the 4 person table near the doors. Our lovely hostess led us to the middle of the balcony, front and center at the stone railing with no obstacles blocking our view! Getting starry eyed here. Perfect views!!

Robert M. took great care of us. He came by every so often to make sure everything was to our liking, very hospitable. Soon he brought over focaccia and cheese crisps with an array of whole olives and dips! 

We started off with:

Smoked salmon flatbread was loaded with the good stuff! A bit of red onion here and there, chive whipped potato, drizzled with caper cr√®me fra√Æche.

Portobello mushroom flatbread with white truffle oil! Wild mushroom pur√©e, fontina cheese, red onions, I had portobello everyday this Vegas trip-- Shake Shack & pizza from Aria buffet but still loved this! Huge portions for ~$20!

Mom & sis ordered grilled Nebraska beef tenderloin medium well. One was more red than the other. I tried some-- it's called tender for a reason. Decorated with asparagus on a bed of bacon polenta with chimichurri drizzle.

I had the chicken ""Parmesan"" which did have some bone\/cartilage still on it. Moist breaded chicken smothered in marinara, delicate greens and Parmesan, atop whipped potatoes with a bit of pesto and carrots, purple stalks of cauliflower. 

We almost said no to dessert but who says no to banana tiramisu? A twist on a classic Italian favorite, hints of banana fused into the light and fluffy cake garnished with thin sheets of dark chocolate! Terrific sweet notes to end an unforgettable meal!

A few tips:

*interactive touch screen menu outside near the check in podium

*check book has a blue light in it for easy reading!

*no restroom in the actual restaurant-- directly across from the podium outside, shared with the hotel

*It gets cold on the patio during winter even with heating lamps-- bring a warm jacket. 

*check out the song list schedule for water shows:

When you walk into this dark light area and candles going it was nice and romantic and just felt very cozy. I loved it and I enjoyed it quite a lot. We got sat on a booth for 2 and on the opposite side were chairs. That was fine with me and we had no problems with our seating. It was a nice view of the water fountain. :)

The bread did taste very well and the olives and olive spread was really good. I enjoyed it a lot. I ordered a salmon that was crusted with so many different flavors it was very different than many places. All I can say is that this place is something special with the uniqueness of style and different ingredients that they use on each dish.  I also tried my aunts chicken which tasted salty and sweet with fruit possible. Anyway it was very different to me and I would say this a place to go and try at least once. 

I had a splendid dinner and a great time. :) Also the service was very good, always had my drink refilled and the server was nice enough to check up on us if we needed anything else.

On a Saturday afternoon, reservations are a must for locals and visitors alike.  Indoor and outdoor seating are prime, especially if you want to catch the Bellagio fountain show right off the balcony.

We both enjoyed their $20.09 prix fixe lunch menu.

A wonderful bread basket filled with focaccai, bread rolls, and crispbread start your meal, along with olives and tapenade.  Yes, it's really that yummy and good.  (I've been here once before for drinks and all I remember was their bread basket!)

Starters
* BBQ Pork Tartlet ""roasted suckling pig, maytag blue cheese, caramelized onions, butter baked puff pastry"" - I'm not big on the puff pastry stuff, but The Husband ordered this and he was quite satisfied with his bits of pork and cheese.

* Watermelon Panzanella ""scarlett & golden watermelon, fresh mint, cracked black olives, feta croutons, togarashi"" - A very refreshing salad, especially with the golden watermelon pieces.  The feta croutons were especially good, although I didn't taste any togarashi in my salad.

Entree

* Chilled Rare Tuna Nicoise ""haricot vert, heirloom tomato, cornichon, smoked hard boiled egg, nicoise olives, champagne vinaigrette"" - Tuna seared perfectly to a beautiful color and the smoked hard boiled egg added a nice taste against the green beans and salad.

* Char Grilled Lamb Chop ""fattoush salad, za'atar spiced pita chips, minted feta, pine nut vinaigrette"" - Two nice sized lamb chops rested on a bed of lettuce.  A hearty but light lunch at the same time.

Dessert

* Seasonal Sorbet Trio ""served with fresh fruit"" - Flavors included mango, blackberry and I think, lemon.  It was refreshing with the added fresh fruit.  A clean dessert.

* Drunk Chocolate Trifle ""dark chocolate puddin', vanilla bean ice cream, bailey's white chocolate ganache, double chocolate cookie"" - The dark chocolate pudding that laid on the bottom was exceptionally good, similar to the kind you ate as a child but much more upscale.  The ganache and cookie were good too, but I found myself digging for more pudding!  

Service was good, our water glasses were refilled on a regular basis (and I love how he covered the glass with a napkin so it doesn't spray everywhere).  They were busy and the staff looked like they were busy too.  Not disappointing at all.

We were so looking forward to a wonderful night, dinner at Olives followed by the famous Cirque show ""O"". Arrived at 6.55 for a 7pm reservation and seated by 7.05. Plenty of time for a meal before our 9.30pm show in the same hotel. Or so we thought, the hostess said 1.5-2 hours was the average. Everything got off to a good start, friendly welcome, nice table, lovely decor and ambience. We ordered a bottle of sparkling mineral water which arrived promptly. After about 10 mins we met our server Michelle. She asked if we wanted lemon or lime - yes lime would be great thanks...  but she forgot about it. No big deal..: it's just lime. She returned and I ordered a glass of wine - and reminded her about the lime. We asked for recommendations on the menu and went with the beef carpaccio as an appetizer... which was brought out maybe 10 mins later and just moments after our basket of bread and olives. We had started to think they were forgetting to bring the bread and olives as it took so long for those to come out. The beef carpaccio was HUGE, beautifully presented and delicious, excellent choice. Easily enough for 2. We finished that and the bread and waited to order our entrees... nothing. Michelle was busy attending to every table around us but just kept passing us by. Feeling full of bread and carpaccio, we decided instead of ordering two entrees we would just split one and then share dessert and an espresso martini... still waited.. nothing. Eventually Michelle came by...:More than an hour after we were seated and a good half hour after finishing the appetizer. We told her to forget the entrees: we were running out of time before the show and would just order a dessert and cocktail, she said she would bring the menu.:: we continued to wait... eventually at about 8.25 we gave up and asked for the check. This was a dinner we had allowed 2+ hours for and fully expected to spend $150 or so on 3 courses (splitting app\/dessert) and it ended up consisting of one appetizer; one glass of wine and a bottle of sparkling mineral water, $50. So on the bright side; we saved $100 or so... no apologies at all from Michelle - she was either oblivious or didn't care. Although it was Sunday night on Memorial Day weekend; the restaurant wasn't crazy busy, in fact when we arrived it was in the lull between show times but it was getting full by the time we left. It's fortunate that we felt fairly full after the beef carpaccio and bread, otherwise we would have left the restaurant annoyed and hungry. We went to the local patisserie for dessert instead and grabbed an Irish coffee from another bar. It's such a shame \/ we were really looking forward to a wonderful celebratory dinner but just couldn't wait to leave after being dismissed by Michelle multiple times. We are typical generous tippers, but the service tonight was among the worst we have had from a restaurant of this caliber. Yes, we would return for the location, ambiance and quality of food..but would sincerely hope to get a more capable server, who knows how to take a meal order in less than 80 minutes. Don't let our experience turn you off Olives, but I do hope the management reads these reviews and takes necessary actions. We were extremely relaxed and patient for the first hour and a quarter but after that it was just a joke to be forgotten about so many times... truly a disappointment, but we did see that everyone around us was taken care of very promptly; maybe just bad luck. Next time we would wait for a balcony table and insist on another server. Our experience with Michelle would be rated a 1 or 2. Everything else about Olives we would give a 4 or 5, hence the average here of 3. With a halfway decent server, we would have easily rated it a 4 or 5.",1,0,0

I highly recommend their bellini.  It is as good as it gets outside Harry's Bar in Venice, Italy.  Ask the server about their specials.  I had a crab crusted Chilean Sea Bass special that was the best sea bass I've ever eaten.

There is something for everyone.  Fish lover, carnivore or vegetarian.  Everything we tried was perfectly prepared.  The ambiance inside and outside is elegant without all the Vegas fan fare and the service is comparable to a New York City 4 star restaurant.

Bravo! Will definitely be returning.....and definitely partaking in the Chocolate Fallen Cake for dessert again.  Wow!",0,0,0

The inside is dark, but the atmosphere is relaxing and really pretty. I love the location of Olives, because you can see the Bellagio watershow outside the window while you eat. Pretty awesome. 

Starters: I ordered the Capaccio and was really glad i did. The meat was fresh, and comes with a little salad

Dishes: I ordered the Halibut. It was okay, i wasn't too impressed with it. My friend who told me to get this dish said the fish is suppose to taste like butter. But it didn't. It was still good. Loved the spinach risotto, it made the whole dish more on the creamy side. 

The sea bass on the other hand, tasted like butter. If i could have a do-over, i would order the sea bass. 

The ribeye was nothing out of the ordinary, but still delicious.",2,0,0

This week I finally had the opportunity to come back. I brought a very choosy eater with me, but I had scoped out the menu in advance and figured there'd be enough variety to make both of us happy.

Service was attentive, but a little detached - not really warm. That's OK, I mean it's Vegas, I'm not there to make friends, but the other places where I ate, the servers managed a little friendliness.

Seating was not as tight as it is in some other places, but they do bunch together all the table-for-two diners so we're practically in each others' laps. Wouldn't be too bad if peoples' behavior was uniformly civilized, but naturally that's not the case so you might end up with an undesirable dining ""companion"" from the next table staring at every forkful you put into your mouth.

ANYWHO. You came here to read about the food, not the other person there, who you probably will never run into anyway! Well I started with the Bibb salad which was overly oniony for most people, but perfect for me. My own dining companion ate most of our shared bucket of bread - there were four different varieties, with two pieces of each, and an olive and tapenade plate to spread on them. Rich, salty, saucy - a great starter.

For our entrees, I got the scallops on a truffle-mashed potato bed, starting out nutritiously-conscious enough by diligently eating all of the sauteed sea greens first, but then dropped the act and over my own but-I-really-shouldn't protests I licked the whole melty truffly scallopy plate clean. The scallops were like perfectly broiled butter-pats of the sea, not an iota of rubbery or chewiness. High marks.

My companion developed an epic inability to make a decision, suffering a choice-freeze of Shakespearean proportions, so he ended up ordering three sides instead of an entree: A side of lobster tail (oh em gee, how spoiled can you get - just the tail? None of the effort? He's not from New England), a side of grilled shrimp (anyone else counting the cholesterol points, or am I just copping a sea-bean-eatin', healthier-than-thou attitude? But wait), and a side of ... lobster mac and cheese. He was in bliss. Ah, to have a twenty-years-younger heart!

Other reviewers had mentioned how dark it is in the interior seating area, and that's no joke. It takes a long time to get adjusted. Luckily the bill comes on a lighted notepad (no, really) so even if you can't really see what you're eating, you can at least see what you're paying.",0,0,0

The food was unremarkable. We started with a Fig & Prosciutto flat bread, which was fine but nothing special. I had the salmon which was by far the best main course at our table, however it was drenched in butter so it was very rich and I could not finish it. The butternut squash tortellini was shaped nothing like tortellini but more like cannelloni and lacked taste completely.I don't even remember what the men at the table had. The also had a photographer going around the restaurant snapping pictures, which reminded me of a cheesy cruise ship. The photographer was asking $45 for the pictures she took and rolled her eyes when we said we were not interested.

I ate here three to four months ago and for some reason I can't stop thinking about it. I must share!

First, we were seated on the patio and had a front row view to the Bellagio fountains...talk about magical!

We ordered the charcuterie board, roasted chicken, midwest ribeye and falling cake for dessert. They were all very good. The chicken was the juciest-most perfect chicken I've ever had! Who knew chicken could be elevated to such a level?

Here's the real ""WOW"" factor. Our server was extremely busy that night, but her service did not lack in the slightest. In fact, it was the best service I've ever had. I have been a server for a five star restaurant so my standards are very high-trust me when I say the BEST service I have ever had. 

My boyfriend's mashed potatoes were a little below par, but when she came by to check on our food he didn't say anything. He's a pretty easygoing guy. 

She came back 30 seconds later and asked ""Sir, how are those mashed potatoes?"" He told her they were not as hot as he would like them to be and she replied back by saying, ""I thought so. I knew they didn't look right."" She had the kitchen bring another plate out of perfect mashed potatoes. 

On a busy night like that, she could have not said anything and took our word for it. But, she went out of her way to make sure that everything was perfect. She also asked visitors to politely give us space when show time began. Another major bonus.

When the entrees came I had the salmon again bland no taste and it was cold. Also had the filet which was also cold so I called the waiter and he said get us new hot dishes. So when the dishes came back it was the same salmon the same filet reheated again. Actually my salmon wasn't even reheated they just put the salmon on a new plate with new hot mashed potato!

It was the last day of our trip and we wanted a drink at Fix, but it was closed.  We had dinner reservations at Spago, so we thought we'd make our way over there and grab a drink on the way.  That's when we found Olives.  Their bar was open so we stopped in.  Their bartenders are fantastic, their martinis are huge and the water show's wonderful.  As we were sipping our drinks, I was curious about the infused vodkas.  That's when the bartender asked if I'd like a taste.  Of course I would!  So he poured me a good amount, shook it up to chill it and served it up.  That's service.

As we were sitting there, since the bartenders were so nice, we decided to cancel our Spago reservation and ate at Olives.  We also wanted to sit outside and watch the fountain show.  The patio seating is 1st come, 1st serve and we had no problem with that.  What we had a problem with was the gale force winds blowing through.  It blew down a bunch of the glasses on the tables, which changed our minds about dining al fresco.  

Once we were back inside, we ordered and our apps came out.  They were HUGE.  Just as big as their martinis.  Had I known that, I would've stuck with just the apps.  When my entree came out, I could barely eat it and ended up taking it home.  Yes, home on the plane - it was that good.

The best part was that we were sitting next to the door and the candle on our table kept blowing out.  But our server was super diligent in re-lighting it over and over again.  It was either diligence, or fear of getting his ass kicked for not keeping it lit.  Kudos to him!",0,0,0

This was an extremely enjoyable meal.  I got here early enough I could sit on their patio overlooking the Fountains of Bellagio.  They had 8 LP heaters cranking out the warmth and it was great.  Nothing says success like location, location, location.  On with the meal.

You get a nice basket of bread and lavash and a three section dish with olive tapenade and olives.  One section has green olive tapenade, the middle has a small olive assortment, and the last section has a ripe olive tapenade.  The tapenade with the bread and the lavash is almost addictive.  Ask your server and you'll get the recipe they use for making the tapenade. 

Course 1:  I ordered the crispy lamb lollipops with sweet corn raita, Calvados demi-glaze, Za'atar carrots, and Greek yogurt.  The description comes from their Restaurant Week menu.  It was very good, but it was poorly named.  I expected some kind of different use of lamb to create a lollipop.  Instead, they were lamb ribs.  They were tasty with a nice crispness, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  The corn was an excellent accompaniment.

Course 2:  I got the Airline chicken breast on a bed of lobster mac and cheese with broccoli florets and ""Truffle Fondue, Buttered Broccoli Florets, Marsala Jus, Toasted Bread Crumbs.""  The quoted part is from their description.  The word fondue is used very loosely.  The chicken was nicely grilled and seasoned well.  The meat was very juicy.

Course 3:  I got the Strawberry Mascarpone cheesecake with the center filled with a rhubarb mixture.  Excellent dessert.

Service was very good.  It was relaxed although the place was crowded and I was taking up a primo spot on the patio.  Iced tea was refilled often.  The courses were spaced nicely so I got to enjoy 3 fountain shows during the meal.  It really is a nice spot, and it's a place to which I'll return.

We had an 8:30 reservation and the hostess said she'd be right with us while helping people who didn't have a reservation for 10 minutes. We were informed we'd have to wait until 10:15 to be sat outside, but could sit us at a table next to the window (with two fat people immediately in front of outside blocking the view). Oh well, the interior was super nice, dark and very romantic feeling. 

Our awesome busser quickly brought us three great kinds of bread, some olive tapenade and Pellegrino quickly. Our pretentious sommelier was quick to assist us, but looked down at my selection (a $125 bottle of Stag's Leap Cabernet). I got the very distinct feeling for some reason, because Im young they thought I didn't have money or something ridiculous.

Our waiter dropped off our menu and then seemed to completely forget about us. We finally waved him down and ordered the tuna tartar as non-spicy as possible, the sweet potato gnocchi and the grilled sirloin. 

The tuna tartar came out pretty quick and was very good. A little too spicy and raw for my date, but I loved it. After that, it took what seemed like forever for our food to arrive. My date loved the sweet potato gnocchi. My steak was cooked to the correct doneness, but per the usual for steakhouses, needed more salt. This, and I had no idea what it was that accompanied my steak. Server was nowhere to be found. I finally flag him down and he explains what was on my plate, but I'm not sure what this was. HAHA... I asked him for salt, but it never came. After 15 minutes or so, I flagged down the busser who hooked it up. 

We finally got the bill and got our food wrapped up. Place was incredibly overpriced for the service and quality of food is not worth it. Its the same price as Bouchon, so I would recommend anyone in Vegas to go there instead.

First of all, if you get a balcony table, the view of the fountains and the strip is very nice.  

Second of all, they have the BEST beef carpaccio on the strip!  Delicious, thinly cut raw beef drizzled with balsalmic and shaved pieces of parmesan....Yum!  If you dont wanna go for dinner, atleast stop at the bar for a cocktail and the carpaccio!  
Third of all, great service.  There are a lot of people on staff there to make sure you have a wonderful dinning experience!  Our water was always full and we always had everything we  needed!  They are definitely professionals working there.

My fiance and I went for an early valentines dinner \/ late lunch on Monday.  We ordered a bottle of red and we always get the carpaccio and octopus to start. He always gets the short rib and this time I opted for a mushroom crusted halibut special they had on the V-day menu.  Everything was on point and each bite made my taste buds feel like there was a party in my mouth!  We ended the meal with the dessert on special and we split an espresso martini (they put it in two separate martini glasses for us and they were the size of a full martini each)  Bonus! 
        
The dessert was a flourless chocolate cake with baileys icecream and chocolate covered strawberries.  Awesome!  The martini glass with the cake and icecream was rimmed with sugar and pop rocks!  It was a really fun surprise to the dessert.

This is clearly a case of the latter.  How this place has 4 stars is utterly beyond me.  This is the only place I have ever been I would literally give a 0 star if I could.  Being originally from the northeast, I truly love and appreciate Italian food.  What a disappointment.  While the food was not very good, the service takes this place down to an F-.  This was without a doubt the worst dining experience I have ever had in my entire life.  The majority of the people we interacted with were incredibly rude, to the point where you are just sitting trying to enjoy a nice dinner (an excessively expensive one at that), and you start to feel defensive.  How can you possibly enjoy a dinner in that kind of atmosphere?   On top of that, everything took so long to get right by the time we got our food it was close to closing time.  This lead us to be the last table in the restaurant, trying to finish up while they were closing.  Before we had even finished everything, the manager kindly told us they are a union shop and have strict rules, and we were getting kicked out.  Yes really.

We devoured the complimentary bread basket with spreads and olives. The assorted bread was great I was in carb heaven, the cheese crisp was good and the spreads were delicious on the fresh bread. 

Our entrees took about 30 minutes and was served all together. I thought the salad would be served first. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the crab meat was sweet.

We walked in for lunch on a beautiful Saturday and were told it was a one hour wait for a outside terrace table.  The hostess told us though that as tables open up, if the next party on the list isn't there, they give the table to the next party - like you have to be present to win.  Because of that, we had a seat at the bar and were served by Jimmy V., an old-school bartender who was quick and friendly.  The wines by the glass selection is quite good so I had a nice French Chablis and my lunch companion had a S. African Chenin Blanc.  Very nice.  Well only about 10 minutes had passed when we were told that our table was ready!  That was a nice surprise.

There's a reason why the outside terrace area is in high demand and it's because of the waterside view of the spectacular Bellagio fountains.  What a beautiful setting.  Having a front row seat to that bombastic display is a bit distracting but in a good way.

The food was uneven.  A nice bread basket, some tapenade and olives came promptly.  I had the soft shelled crab sandwich which was nicely done - pleasantly spiced with Sriracha.  It was served with skinny fries - skinny sized not skinny in calories!  These were tasty but unfortunately were cold.  My companion had the beef carpaccio which was a huge serving of paper thin raw beef served with a small salad, a gorgonzola polenta, cipollini onions, scallion cream, balsamic reduction, garlic aioli and shaved parmesan.

OVERALL
We all enjoyed this dinner and would certainly recommend it for a more upscale, but still casual lunch or dinner. 

AMBIANCE
I requested a table on the patio, and we got one. I will say it's a bit hard to see the fountains if you are at one of the back patios, as we were, but you can easily stand up and go look. I would highly recommend the patio over the inside, as I think it just has a nicer feel and nice view of the strip no matter where you sit.

ATTIRE
Although the restaurant looks pretty opulent, it's actually pretty casual. We went for an early dinner (5:15) and there was guys there in bathing suits and t-shirts. 

DRINKS
My friend and I ordered two of the most popular martini's and they were both excellent. My friend ordered the Slingback, which was a brightly colored, refreshing mango concoction. I can't remember the name of my martini, but it had pear puree in it and was also very tasty.

FOOD
They start you with a bread basket which is DELICIOUS! Carmalized onion focaccia and a cheesy cracker bread were a great way to start the meal.

We ordered the Fiery Chicken Flatbread (note - their online menu seems to be outdated and has a different chicken flatbread, which I don't think is around anymore). It was really tasty, although by the name I expected it to have some heat, which it didn't at all.

Seven of us visited Olives almost four weeks ago for late Saturday night dinner.  Reservations were easy, the host and hostess were able to seat us outside on the patio around 9:45pm for a wonderful view of the fountains. Food was very well prepared and absolutely delicious--I strongly suggest going for the steaks, the meat was a great cut and the medium rare grill was spot-on.  A friend had the flatbread which was very good, and we all shared a really well-paired charcuterie board that got our palates ready for the main course.  If Olives was only about the food, I would strongly suggest you to go and try it.

If only.

The downside here: the service.  Our server, a seemingly nice woman with spiky hair came by to welcome us and take a drink order.  Great.  Drinks then took about 25 minutes to come out.  I should probably mention that there were about 9 tables on the patio, and two servers working them, though out server probably only had three or four including us (the inside of the restaurant was half-full, but other servers were there for that).  Once drinks arrived, a few of them were incorrect and had to be re-done.  One of which was my single scotch which I had ordered with a single ice cube.  Now anywhere in boutique restaurants, a single cube with a scotch (a $20 finger of Oban mind you) means a two-inch solid cube or sphere of ice dropped in the finger of scotch allowing it to mellow the taste and nose of the whiskey.  When the scotch first got to me it was on the rocks (and looked like it had been wallowing in small ice cubes for a good ten or fifteen minutes.  The server saw the look on my face and realized that it was not the way it was ordered and took it back - returning a minute later with the exact, same, scotch (as I could tell by the watered-down color), with a small tiny cube floating in it, as if it had just been pulled from the commercial ice maker.  Nice to know the servers have no concept of drink prep.

After we all had drinks we were told she would be right back to take food orders.  Just a heads up, ""right back"" at Olives means about 25 minutes again.  Finally ordered the food, waited another 30 for it to come out, and six out of seven of us got served.  Yep, six out of seven, because the server didn't enter in everyone's order.  So the final person in the party got served 10 minutes later.  You might think the server's attitude would be apologetic and humble but no she was icy and blaming everything on the kitchen... funny given that the manager brought out that late dish and said it hadn't been entered...

On the one hand, yes, the other two or three tables seemingly assigned to this server were a bit needy. But if you can't get to most of your guests and you're the server in charge, then you need to ASK FOR HELP - there was another server out there who easily could have jumped in and assisted at different points. But we quickly got the impression that our server was competing with the other, not working in tandem.  If a restaurant is going to be successful, the wait-staff need to work in concert with each other to ensure the guests have a good experience, which is really a failure by both the server and the management.  Otherwise you get comments like this one:

If it's Saturday night in Vegas and you're looking for a place for a late evening dinner--look somewhere else.",7,0,2

Warm bread basket was particularly good. I hate olives but I was eating the olive tepanade UP. It was so yummy. 

Course 1: Calarmi and BBQ pork tart. The tart was just OK, but the Calamari was awesome! Some of the best calamari I've ever had. I'll definitely be ordering that if I dine at Olives again. 

Course 2: Lamb and Tuna nicoise salad. My salad was nice. It had cool touches - the egg was hard boiled AND smoked (very unique!), and the tuna was decent. The lamb was better, however. Seasoned and prepared perfectly. 

Course 3: Fruit Sorbet and chocolate trifle. The sorbets were excellent, but the trifle must have had crack in it. AMAZING. Dark chocolate pudding, Bailey's mousse, vanilla ice cream.. heavenly.

I have never tried making any of his recipes, and I don't own one of his cookbooks, but I have been eager to eat at one of his restaurants for years, probably 3 or 4. I had some big expecations, I guess you might say.

Olives delivered on service (we sat at a table in the bar, Chris was helpful and engaging), ambiance (sexy and modern) and fabulous concept - updated Mediterranean fusion. 

However, I felt the menu seemed a little short on variety to me. For a Mediterranean restaurant, I was hoping for more pasta dishes. Chestnuts didn't sound appetizing to me, and the butternut squash ravioli's sounded somehow out of season... kind of heavy for 108 degree Vegas heat. So we ordered the Veal Milanese: rosemary noodles, cipollini onions, whole grain mustard cream, white wine, crazy mushroom ragu, parmesan. It was rich. It was tasty, The noodles were soft, maybe too soft? The cuts of veal looked like chichen strips; I think we both expected them to be more bite-sized and tender than they came out of the kitchen. But the mustard sauce was a real winner. I would try to replicate that at home, wow.

We also had the Bibb lettuce salad, and it was fresh and perfect.

The complimentary 2 olive tapenades, plus olive salad they serve when you are seated is a fabulous way to kickstart the tastebuds. However, they really should work on the breads if they are going to use insanely good olives... a delicious bread with the right texture- that would be an improvement; ours was a little dry. But how can I really complain about a freebie? 

For dessert, we ordered the cookie\/ice cream sampler, which is an assortment of 3 big cookies, 1 macaroon, a piece of fudge, an almond\/raspberry bar and a delicious red velvet cupcake with frosting. It also comes with 3 mini scoops of the day's fresh ice creams: we had vanilla bean, strawberry and Bailey's! The cupcake and Bailey's ice cream were the best things on the plate, and at $11 it was a really reasonable pricetag.

This place was great, but I think I'd try one of Todd English's other restaurants before I'd go back to Olives.",1,1,1

We went to Olives for restaurant week last night and had the 50.09 tasting menu with wine pairings.  http:\/\/www.threesquare.org\/?p=1447
Krista and I shared each course to make sure we got the full experience.  

The only reason this visit got 3 stars (and I am struggling to leave that many!) was because the appetizers and service were worth 4.5.  The rest of the meal was a slim 2 stars.  I know $175 with drinks and wine for a Todd English meal is a deal, I just left feeling like most of the other restaurants on the Three Square list would have done a better job.  The meal felt contrived and uninspired.  It seemed like they chose the easiest items to pre-make, heat and serve.  It could be compared to mediocre wedding fare.  I felt the tasting menu was meant to get you in, but was not a restaurant priority.  Based on this lack of passion, I would not dine here again.

The Meal Breakdown:

Appetizers: 
""Ham n' Cheese"" Arancine - Smoked Mozzarella, Serrano Ham Risotto, w\/ Roasted Tomato Soup
Excellent - The best part of the meal!  A crisp shell hiding savory ham and cheese topped with one of the best marinara's I have ever had is hard to beat.  I could have these daily and not feel bad about turning into a 500lbs pile of cheese.

Chili Rubbed Black Mission Figs - Gorgonzola Cream, Bacon Bread Crumbs, Rosemary Grissini, Micro Basil
Very Good - The combination of figs and sharp cheese is one of my favorites.  The breadsticks on top were  extraneous, but then again I just pushed them aside.

Entr√©es:
Salmon BLT - Boston Bibb Lettuce, Heirloom Tomato, Crispy Bacon Lardon, Toasted Bruschetta, Caper Aioli
Good Flavor\/ Impossible to eat - The salmon was perfectly prepared and the presentation was beautiful.  Now try to eat it.... All of the ingredients were piled atop the 1\/2 inch thick Bruschetta that you needed a mallet to break through.  I gave up on the whole concept and ate the components separately, leaving the bruschetta for the pigeons.

Portobello Picata, Truffle Mashed Potato, Shaved Baby Artichoke Insalata Frisee, Truffle Vinaigrette, Parmesan
BLAHHHHH.  It was a pile of boring.  The mashed potatoes were uninspired and the Portobello lacked any flavor.  They reminded me of tempura veggie's from the local sushi joint.  It was dry and not worth the effort of bringing the fork to my mouth.

Desert:

These are not even worth reviewing separately.  My only thought while tasting them was..... Did they get these from the frozen section at Costco?  They were pre-made crap that failed on all levels. The Foster had a stale ""almond cake"" and the Trifle's primary components were J-E-L-L-O and a nabisco cookie.

Almond Banana Foster - Almond Cake, Caramel Rum Sauce, Whipped Cream

Drunk Chocolate Trifle - Dark Chocolate Puddin', Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Bailey's White Chocolate Ganache, Double Chocolate Cookie",1,1,1

Chilean Sea Bass - the fish is so tender inside and it maintains the natural flavor, accompanied by fava beans plus tomato saffron nage. Very memorable and highly recommended!

For appetizer I got the fig and prosciutto Flatbread which was good but not really a value when it comes to price.

I had the pork chop which wasn't bad but want unique. It tasted like any normal pork chop. Maybe my expectations were too high but I wasn't impressed at all, especially at those prices. My advice is you could always try something else and as the food wasn't bad, I don't think I would go back.",0,0,0

But if you have the chance, definitely go to one of Bellagio's restaurants on the lake because your experience will be 10x better.

With OpenTable reservations, we came by for drinks, appetizers, and desserts after lunching at Pho Kim Long in Chinatown. We actually arrived 45-minutes past our reservation time, but I'd called in advance to let them know we were stuck in traffic on the strip and subsequently had a hard time finding the restaurant. FYI, Olives is located in Bellagio's shopping area, near Louis Vuitton and Dior.

For a table out in the patio (requested with my reservation), we waited an additional 10-minutes. The patio is a lot smaller than I envisioned and the promotional photos online definitely made it look much larger. Regardless, you still get a great view and seeing the fountain show every few minutes was cool.

Complimentary bread is served with olive sauces that I didn't particularly like. We ordered Truffle Fries ($9), Banana Tiramisu, wine, and beer, which came to $50 incl. tax. The fries were served with ketchup, which wasn't ideal. Everyone knows truffle tastes better with garlic aioli... And if you like thin crispy fries, as I do, you probably shouldn't get these 'cause they were more like potato wedges. The tiramisu was amazingly light and delicious; I love bananas and all the textures of the lady fingers, cream, chocolate, and fruit made it one of the best tiramisus I've ever had the pleasure of eating.

I'm unsure if I'd come back to have lunch or dinner as it's pricey and I'd rather spend that money towards something else (like dinner at Picasso on the other side of the lake); but I will definitely be back for drinks and desserts the next time I'm in town.",10,3,8

For $75 bucks a head you would think the food would be memorable and the wine pairings would be spot on.... not so much at Olives.

Our party of 5 all got the 3 course tasting menu with wine pairings. 

The starter course was OK- nothing special.  Some of us had the garspacho and others the crab sticks- both were OK.  Wine was just OK.

Main course was King salmon or airline chicken or flank steak.  All 3 were disapointing.  The salmon was overcooked and flavorless and was served with some mushy risotto that had an overly generous seasoning of lemon preserves (I grew up eating wild salmon and was very bummed), the steak was your average cut of meat the surprise was the airline chicken- which was a chicken breast and dark sauce.  Chicken was tender and flavorful- but come on.... $50 and only the chicken was good?  
The big deal breaker of the evening came with the wine pairing- a run-of-the-mill pinot that was comparable to some two-buck-chuck.  Being from the Bay area.... we know wine, and this was not a good one.  The sommelier noticed we werent drinking the red and asked why.  We explained our displeasure and she graciously brought a small sample of a malbec instead.  It was appreciated. 

The STAR of the evening was the dessert and the sweet dessert sparkling wine.  DELISH!  Icecream or lemon cake.... both were amazing and the sparkling wine was am amazing complement. 

All in all, it was a good meal- but not amazing by any standards.  When I pay that much for dinner (and when I am in a city of cullinary greats) I expect the resturant to bring their ""A"" game.  Olives brought a solid ""C"" game.... and for that I wont be returning.",1,0,0

FOOD
Complimentary bread and dip (4 stars): The bread variety was great. The spreads are all olive spreads, really good if you're an olive fan, if not, you're out of luck. 

Margarita Chicken Sandwich (3.5 stars): Juicy chicken, not amazing flavors but pretty good. Needed more basil. 

Spicy Chicken Flat bread (3.5 stars): Needed more flavor too, but still good. Not as crunchy on the bottom of the pizza, but the crust was crunchy. 

Cookie Sandwich Sundae (3.5 stars): Actually pretty small compared to the picture they show you! But good when it's so hot out outside! We asked to do both vanilla ice cream sandwiches and they did it. Good ice cream, good cookie. 

Complimentary Cream Puffs for special occasions: So nice they gave something for a special occasion. Who ever they have writing in chocolate is so talented, looked perfect. 

VIEW (4 stars):
With the fountains on it would definitely be a 5 star experience! We came on a weekday at 12:30PM for lunch and got a seat outside. I was waiting for the fountains until the waitress told me they don't turn on till 3PM on weekdays. WHATTTT, why am I here? Well it was still pretty to sit outside near the water and see the view of the strip, but the reason I came here was for those damn fountains, a little disappointing. So come after 3PM on weekdays! 

SERVICE (4 stars):
At first when they took us outside on the patio for seating they had 2 tables open, one with partial shade, the other in the over 100 degree heat. They need to fix the umbrellas to cover all the tables more, how can you eat in that heat! We ended up scrunching into the partial shaded table. But everyone was nice.

A great friend of mine had made reservations here a while ago for her sister birthday and she rated them a generous 2 stars but however I still made reservations to come here to see for myself. Don't be like me just avoid this place. 

We've been to Bellagio's Fishtail, Prime, Buffet, Lago and Harvest more than once and nothing but exceeding service and food. This place wasn't anything to even compare to the above. When I initially made reservations I asked for a table on the patio a few days well in advance. However, when I checked in there was 45 minute wait. I opt for the inside available seating. Our server Eric came by took our appetizer order and gave us a ""half ass"" run down of the short menu. He took our drink order then too. We started with the Beef Carpaccio and Tuna Carpaccio which is a favorite for us anywhere but here. We received our appetizer before the server had even came back to take our main order, brought us our drinks, bread, or even a plate for the appetizer. So we waited a few minutes to wave down our waiter politely. It took him another few minutes to get our plates, so be it. The quality of the Tuna was awful, but had a great presentation (for what it's worth). We ate what we wanted of it and waited over 20 minutes to get our waiter to take our main order. He was surprised when we replied to him that we wanted to place our order as if he had forgotten about us. After taking everyone's order he said oh sorry if took so long. So it's Mothers Day obviously and I didn't want to be rude so I let it go. Main entree took too long to come out and of course we were all really hungry. The quality and taste of the food are so bland. I felt like I was eating at Applebee's. The service on the other hand was horrific! Excuse me do you mind bringing us a bread basket like all the other tables? Excuse me do you mind refilling our drinks? Can we get a to go box? Can we get our check? Can we get a dessert menu? Can we get our dessert order taken? CAN YOU DO YOUR JOB?! 

The cherry on top was the lack of the server handing my mom a flower that they were generously handing out to the Mothers. I didn't even bother asking. I was so disappointed but still paid our $200 and tipped him a too kind, too generous 15% tip. I guess you can't always get your money's worth.

It was worth battling the heat. We were seated at one of the tables closest to the  fountains and it really added to our experience. 

Before we even looked at the menu the bread basket and tapenades arrived. I liked that they not only had a traditional kalamata tapenade, but also green olive tapenade. Both were very good. I started with an apple salad with blue cheese and bacon among other things. The salad was really good, they didn't overdo any one ingredient and the flavors went well together. My husband had the oysters on the half shell and he definitely enjoyed those. 

My entree was the Olives meatloaf. Yum. The meatloaf was definitely an upgrade on the typical meatloaf with a truffle ketchup topping. I loved the mashed potatoes and cauliflower on the plate as well. My husband had the cast iron trout which had a very tasty seasoning and a nice crisp.

For dessert, I knew I had to get the banana tiramisu since I've never seen any variation on tiramisu offered by a restaurant. It didn't disappoint and all of the flavors on the plate were very good. My husband had the seasonal sorbets which were watermelon and mango. Wow, I don't even care for watermelon and I couldn't stop stealing bites. The mango was very refreshing.

The view was amazing.  Although, be warned that if the winds are high, then you might get a bit of spray from the fountains.

The food was the best I've ever had in Vegas, and I've done my fair share of eating there!   They bring out an assortment of breads and spreads, and olives.  Super tasty.

We got an appetizer, the special that night was a heirloom tomato salad.  It was huge, definitely enough to share for 2 people.  

I had the salmon for dinner, and wow.  It was cooked perfectly!

Definitely want to make another stop back through here when we go back to Vegas next.",0,0,0

Food- 
The bread came with different types olives (go figure!) and 2 olive spreads. OMG, amazing. I would probably go back for just this! 
I ordered the seafood risotto...which was fantastic and perfectly cooked. 
We got the cremw br√ªl√©e for dessert....it was delicious but I was too full at this point to really enjoy it.

But I have been underwhelmed with Strip dining before--we often venture off the Strip for dinner.  But we had a busy day this day, knew I would not feel like driving and have always wanted to visit a Todd English restaurant...I have NO IDEA why he would want his name on this restaurant.
I reserved two months in advance.  Requested a patio seat.  When we arrived, waited 10-15 minutes to be seated, no mention of patio seat.  Not even asked.  The front of the house is chaotic and busy.  The hostess was frazzled and a little unfriendly.  The dining room itself is frazzled, frantic and busy.  Everyone is rushing around, looking unhappy.  It is not soothing and calming at all.
We got water right away by a frazzled gentleman.  That seemed to be his only job (see later).  Our server showed up after a while and wanted to take our order right away.  When I suggested we would like a cocktail first, he told me to ""Make sure I don't forget about you.""  WTH?!  It just went downhill from there.  The service never improved.  A sommelier\/manager came by to take a wine order, mainly because he needed the tablet.  Our Rose then sat forlornly while we finished our cocktail.  A cheese plate was plunked in front of us, with no explanation of the cheeses.  Dishes were NEVER cleared in between courses (The water guy apparently does NOT pick up dishes).  When our second course showed up, the runner awkwardly stood there with it while we gathered up our dishes and handed it to him.  Dirty forks and knives were never replaced.  We sat with our second course empty dish for over 20 minutes.  This is when our sever realized he ""forgot"" us and ran off to order the entree.  We had to flag down our server for another glass of wine (after glasses sat empty for over 10 minutes) when the entree arrived.
The food was mediocre.  For more than $200 for 2 people I would expect better.  Cheese plate was uncomposed (french goat maybe with STRONG may tag blue cheese), beet salad was no better than cafeteria (We had better at Caesars buffet) and pasta was a little cold and overcooked.  No way were we going to stay and endure dessert. 
And I'm not sure what constituted ""meditteranean"".  Olives maybe?  Not sure what else really.

The restaurant itself has an amazing style and ambiance. Finally, the views of the strip and the Bellagio fountain is spectacular. 

The food however was awful. Like - just terrible. Where the menu boasts freshness, bold flavors, and interesting combinations that make your mouth water - what ends up on the plate in front of you is nothing as promised. 

We had the fig and prosciutto flat bread and the grilled calamari and octopus. The flat bread was ok. The crust tasted like a saltine cracker. And there was nothing spectacular about the prosciutto. 

The calamari and octopus portion was so small and there were more chick peas than protein on the plate. But I wasn't too sad about that since the protein itself was mushy and watery. Further, the dish had no seasoning. It was really bad. 

We both ordered the branzino as an entree. We both sent it back. Again, the fish was watery, mushy, and quite gamy. I took one bite and lost my appetite. The dish also lacked any kind of seasoning whatsoever. 

Finally, we ordered the peanut butter chocolate cake for desert. Couldn't taste the peanut butter. And the cake was dense and dry. 

The food is just bad. Poor quality, no seasoning, mushy and flavorless.

I suggest you go somewhere else or maybe just try a few appetizers there if you want to see the view. But, in my opinion, even trying to choke down their appetizers to see the view is not worth the price of admission.",2,1,1

RAO'S and OLIVES were the best nights, even though each serves entirely different Italian cuisine.  RAO'S is NYC good ol' school, where OLIVES is fusion post-modern 'fancy' Italian.  

You have to be an amazing chef to reinvent a cuisine.  Lobster Pumpkin Bisque, Crab Beignets, two different salads, the swordfish, Beef Carpaccio, and Butternut Squash Tortelli richer than any cheesecake. 

There wasn't a bad plate on the table, and in fact -- everything was amazing.  I am irked by celebrity chefs but I'm a believer of Todd now. 

This isn't a place to simply feed an appetite.  This is the type of place you'd dream about holding a wedding reception.  Kinda cramped quarters, sure, but the view of the Bellagio fountain creates the 'illusion' of space.

Once you can forgive the exorbitant bill that unfortunately can\/will\/must arrive -- what can I say -- this is one of the finest meals I've ever witnessed in or out of Vegas.

I had made reservations online, specifically requesting a table out on the patio overlooking ""lake"" Bellagio, and when we arrived, a table hadn't cleared yet. We didn't mind, and took two seats at the bar. There, I enjoyed the most delicious lemon-flavored cocktail, complete with sugar-rimmed martini glass & all! 

Soon, our table was ready & I have to say that we got a fantastic table, the perfect spot for me & the Hubs, right on the lake's railing... perfection. At least for Las Vegas :-)

We ordered another round of drinks and awaited the arrival of our entrees. The bread & olive tapanade served while we waited was nice, but nothing to go crazy for. I ordered a special of the evening - shrimp & pasta. Unfortunately, the shrimp looked a bit like fishing bait and I located a number of small shells throughout the dish, but the overall fresh, creamy lemon flavor was good - I wouldn't order it again. The hubs ordered a fish special of the evening, along with some asparagus, which he raved about. 

We opted for a third round of drinks and some fountain-gazing after our meal, since we weren't ""feeling"" the desserts at Olives.

We were sat outside, which is great real estate because this place overlooks the fountains. However, it's also December. We are local and we've seen it. I would have gladly given up my view of the Bellagio fountains to not sit in 45 degree weather. I just found it odd that we were sat outside and not asked if this was okay with us. Again, it's cold outside and plenty of spots were available inside.

Their drink menu is on an iPad which is kind of a hassle. Their ""cocktail"" section is only martinis save for one drink. Unless I just couldn't figure out the program, seems like their mixed drink menu could use some more selection. Not everyone wants a martini with 3 tbsp of alcohol in it for $16 or a $300 bottle of wine.

We were brought a bread basket and poured water pretty quickly after being sat... And then we waited, and waited, and waited some more. We easily sat there for 15 minutes watching our waiter whirl around the other tables and not even stop by to introduce herself as our server. I started to think that we were supposed to use the iPad to order like you are expected to do with the alcohol.

Eventually the waitress came over and from there on, the service was fine. The food was good but the menu is small and limited.

WARNING: when sitting on the terrace at night, expect to be caught in the middle of a constant traffic flow of inconsiderate people coming outside to take pictures, stand RIGHT OVER your table to watch the fountain show, and other rude BS you shouldn't have to deal with when paying at least $100 for dinner.

BIGGER WARNING: Someone comes around to take your picture and it costs $70.00 for two pictures in a Bellagio souvenir photo booklet. Don't get guilted in to buying the photos because they know you can afford it. Just say no before they even take the picture and avoid the awkward sales pitch at the end of your meal.",1,1,1

We made reservations for 10pm on a Saturday night and was seated promptly and even was able to request patio dining with the best view of the bellagio water show. The waiter was nice although he didn't check on us as much as other nice fancy restaurant servers do. There was a variety of complementary bread including sweet bread, hard toasted bread, and a soft loaf. The spread is none other than olive spread 3 ways; green olives, black olives, and whole olives in the middle. We ordered a mozzarella flatbread for an appetizer, which I could have done without because the bread is already fulfilling. The flatbread was just a fancy pizza and was not worth the $17, although it did make for good leftovers. 

I ordered Pan Roasted Chilean Sea Bass with shrimp scampi risotto, toasted garlic chips, crispy pasta, micro green insalata, & aged balsamic vinaigrette. The sea bass tasted like butter and the garlic chips gave it a nice added taste. There was also mashed potato underneath the beautiful presentation. My boyfriend had the Veal Agnolotti Al Plin with slow braised osso buco, fontina cheese agnolotti, and truffle butter. Delicious! The veal was so tender and complimented the sauce and pasta really well. I suggest both dishes! Both tasted great with riesling white wine. Expensive but tasty! The portions were also a good size enough to eat in one sitting but not too small where you're not fulfilled.  

The best part of the whole experience was the environment. You can't beat front row seats to the water show with the likes of  Frank Sinatra and Celine Dion accompanying the show. My favorite water show was with the song ""Time to Say Goodbye"" by Sarah Brightman and Andrea Bocelli. Very romantic. Looking for a date spot or a girls night out, this is a great place. I would recommend going at night to fully enjoy the beauty it has to offer.

 Pros: online reservations, prompt seating, beautiful view. Cons: patio dining request once you arrive only so it's not guaranteed and it is very pricey, but a beautiful place to check out at least once! So save up, dress nice, and enjoy the view.",1,0,1

I relied on Yelp again to find some good eats.  We called about 2 PM the same day and was lucky enough that someone has just called to cancel, and we got in for 4 people at a prime 7:45 PM.

Olives is in the Bellagio in the mall area.  The hostess was very prompt and professional and seated us in our table.  Our waitress promptly arrived and asked for our drink orders.  She seemed disappointed that we only ordered ""tap"" water (we had enough to drink during the day and the night before), but nevertheless it came promptly, and was kept full for the duration.

The menu was sparse with a variety of types of food on it.  Our group ordered the Mahi Mahi and a couple of types of raviolis.  The highlight was the Mahi, with a Shrimp Risotto.  The fish was cooked perfectly, and tasted very fresh (for the desert).  The only complaint that it was very salty.  For dessert, we ordered some falling Chocolate cake, which I think fell from the sky because it took about 25 minutes, but it was excellent.  

As we were enjoying our dinner, we realized that we were by far the youngest group there (Mid 20's).  Oh well, we were dressed up to.  Nice simple decor and a view of the fountain show.

Agnolotti was flavorful, but the veal is braised to the point of shreds\/mush which I wasn't expecting. Also, the portion was really small.

Arrived a few minutes before our reservation where they confirmed our seating request and then wished mom a happy birthday before leading us outside. Our ""table for two"" along the railing would have been more appropriate for a date but it was exactly what she wanted and gave her a great view of the show for the evening. 

The sea bass was excellent (we both ordered that) and everything that came along was well prepared. Our glasses, bar or otherwise, were never empty with service both prompt and professional. 

For desert, they brought out a ""mini-tray"" with happy birthday written in chocolate, timed perfectly with the fountains erupting. Well, I think that timing was luck but made her evening. 

I forgot to mention to mom that a Pimms Cup is not just lemonade, Spite and a cucumber but gets its name from a liquor. These hit the spot but it wasn't until her second, when I joked about needing to pace ourselves, that she was ""really enjoying"" the fountains.

Appetizer: Cantaloupe Soup OR Portabello Piccata OR Caprese Tart

Entree: Roasted Breast of Chicken OR Lake Superior Whitefish OR Grilled Skirt Steak

Dessert: Coconut Caramel Cake OR Seasonal Sorbet Trio

Since I was already getting the steak, my friend opted to get a burger and truffle fries instead of doing RW. I was asked if I've tried Olives before and I haven't...we had bread service and that's when I realized why I haven't been here - I'm allergic to olives! Too late, we already placed our order.

Cantaloupe Soup:
With almonds and minted creme fraiche. I like cantaloupe so this was an easy choice plus, it's different. A nice, cool and refreshing soup. It's lightly salted so it's not like eating dessert. It's best eaten with a spoon which the server didn't give me. 4\/5

Grilled Skirt Steak:
Came with Italian sausage mashed potatoes, roasted Brussels sprouts, Pinot Noir reduction topped with watercress salad. I love steak but this one was not that good especially if they don't give you a steak knife. 3.5\/5

Coconut Caramel Cake:
Came with chocolate malt ice cream and coconut brittle. I'm not a fan of coconut but I was not in the mood for sorbet either.  The ice cream was very good. The cake was like a deconstructed macaroon. Not too bad. 4\/5

Olive's Burger and Truffle Fries:
Dressings on the side: pickles, tomatoes and onions. This usually comes with Parmesan Fries but my friend got it substituted with Truffle Fries. His first burger was cooked medium-well...and dry so he sent it back.  The second burger was perfectly medium-rare. Tasty and juicy. The fries were perfect! 4.5\/5

Despite the utensil snafu, Olives has good things going on.  The burger and truffle fries...yum! They have a nice view of the Miracle Mile and the Fountains of Bellagio if you sit at the patio. There are birds waiting for a free meal but they're not pesky.",5,3,3

I had the asparagus salad and the fig\/prosciutto flatbread for lunch.  I don't recommend ordering so much food for lunch, but I tend to over-order in general.

back to the food...since the place is called olives, the red seeded whole and mashed and green seedless whole and mashed olives were yummy when smeared on any of the bread selections.  we started out with the tuna carpaccio which was a big slab of raw tuna topped w lemon ailoli and capers over a bed of greens and a pasta cracker.  i could have really done without the greens b\/c it added a bitter flavor to the tuna.  then it was followed by a flatbread topped with asparagus bechamel, prosciutto, caramelized onions, and i also think fig.  oh the taste was sensational, first you feel the crispiness of the flat bread breaking in your mouth, then you taste the salty prosciutto, and then the sweetness from the onions and the fig surprise your mouth.  this is a recommended order people!!!

A three course meal was only $20.09, which was relatively cheap for Vegas and comparable to a hand of blackjack. They really don't kid about the namesake of this restaurant. Right off the bat, we were given bread and three different types of olive spread. While I do love olives, I found them to be quite salty and boring after a few bites. But the bread basket was good, which was filled with various different types of bread. 

For the first course, I tried both the BBQ pork tartlet as well as the crispy calamari. The tartlet was good because of the puff pastry. The calamari was great because it was fried to perfection and it was battered in tempura for a change. For my entree, I tried the chilled rare tuna nicoise. The tuna was seared perfectly, but the dish was littered with more olives. The one surprise of the dish was the smoked hard boiled egg. I say surprising because it was very smokey, but almost to the point where it overpowered everything else on the plate. For dessert, I had the drunk chocolate trifle. This dessert was actually my favorite course of the meal. The double chocolate cookie and white chocolate ganache left me wanting more. 

For Restaurant Week prices, the meal had great value, but for an ordinary restaurant, I see nothing special here. I can see how the theme of olives perpetuates throughout the menu, but they could be a lot more subtle. Olives are very bold in flavor and when they are just randomly sprinkled in a dish or served as a spread, it is just unimaginative and boring. The lack of creativity in this aspect left something more to be desired.",2,1,2

I also wanted some good olives, and although the bread was top notch, as was the olive tepenade, the actual olives tasted worse than the ones i buy from Trader Joes.  At least the service was decent if unenthusiastic. Seems like some servers think because i do not drink i don't know how to tip. Too bad for them.",1,0,0

Spent my formative years in Boston and worshiped ( I say WORSHIPED) Mr. English. When he opened in Las Vegas he exalted himself to a new status in my book. LV was at it's turning point and he took a gamble. The gamble was good - a lake side patio spot at the Belagio (now everyone has a lake in Los Vegas, right Mr. Wynn?). I'm afraid the glory days are gone. Olives was Olives when they first opened at the Belag. but, now it's another Hotel Restaurant. Im sure it's no easy task to keep that Charles Hill Ambiance in the desert. Where are all the blue blazers? 

The food: My favorite part was the bread basket. THE best tappenade I've ever had. A garlicky green olive version and lovely kalamata duo. Fantastic bread, great olive oil and marinated olives (duh?). My scallops were dressed to kill in super rich veal demi and chantarelles; accesorized by a brinoise of butternut squash cooked in vinegar with crisp micro-greens. 

Across the table was a Chestnut Apple Soup. Sub-par. No texture, little flavor. Chestnut's are intense and rich, bold with flavor? Not in this soup. Bad order though if you ask me. This was with a nameless, extraordinarily un-memorable salad (again, can i say BAD order) that I won't bore you with. This could be all chalked up to bad order? 

The plates are gorgeous, service is great and the view is great. My food was great but, across the board, Olives was a little marginal in my opinion if you are stuck inside. Sorry, Todd!",3,3,3

Me and Nathan were walking through the Bellagio and decided to stop here for some drinks but it ended up being our Dinner destination. Todd English is a master of Mediterranean Cuisine and one of my Favorite Chefs it was nice to eat at his establishment. We sat at the Bar and we were waited on by a Bartender named Zach (cool guy, so down to Earth). Nathan got himself Vodka while I got a Cocktail called Bababuie (Silver Blanco Tequila, Cr√®me de Cassis, Lime Juice and Drambuie) Cr√®me de Cassis is a Sweet Liqueur made from Black Currants and Drambuie is a Golden Liqueur made from Scotch and Honey.

Nathan wasn't feeling all that Hungry so all he got was a bowl of Crispy Taters with Thyme and Garlic. For my Appetizer I had Grilled Squid & Octopus with Chickpeas, Tomatoes, Garlic, Parsley and a Hummus Vinaigrette (Tender Octopus, texture is like Grilled Sausage, the best way to eat Squid is Grilled I love that is was swimming in an Ocean of that Vinaigrette but too many Chickpeas on top, I would've preferred less). I also enjoyed some homemade Pita Chips.

For my Entr√©e I got Gnocchi handcrafted with Yukon Gold Potatoes and Parmesan Cheese mixed with a Corn & Leek Puree with 2 different Preparations of Duck, a Ragu of Duck Confit (which was Incorporated with the Puree and mixed into the Gnocchi) and thin slices of Smoked Duck Breast along with Cherry Tomatoes and finished with a Drizzle of Pomegranate Reduction (There was a lot going on, Gnocchi that were light as a Cloud, Tender duck infused with a Smooth Creamy Puree of Sweet Corn and Mild Leeks, get a Pop of freshness from the tomatoes that sliced Duck had a subtle but not to intense Smokiness and the Pomegranate gave some Tartness.

They also make Flavored Vodka's in House, Blueberry, Pineapple and Blood Orange, I tried the Blueberry and it was Awesome. For Dessert I got the Coconut Pound Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream topped with a Malibu Rum Caramel Sauce along with a Scoop of Watermelon Sorbet with Fresh Berries (It was a big piece of Cake that resembled a slice of Texas Toast, Crisp on the outside but Soft and Fluffy on the inside topped with Sweet Vanilla Ice Cream, the Caramel was Rich. The Sorbet was a refreshing finish to the meal, although I didn't have any of the Berries).

For a After Dinner treat Zach whipped up a Cocktail called the Slingback (Absolut Ruby Red Vodka, Fresh Lemon Sour, Passionfruit Puree, Simple Syrup & Lime Juice). It was both Sweet & Tart and the Sugar on the Rim helps tone down the Tartness with each sip you take.

This was by far one of the best places I've dined at on the Las Vegas Strip, I'm gonna recommend this place to my Dad for our Group Dinner next year. See ya then !!!",1,1,1

We stumbled across this restaurant while walking through the Bellagio, and since my friend has an olive obsession, we went in solely because the name of the restaurant was Olives.

The server was friendly, efficient, and offered a lot of suggestions. I ended up getting the scallop dish, while my friend ordered their bass. Simple and full of very well-developed, amazing flavors. Neither dish disappointed.

If you are looking for a restaurant that is, all mild exaggeration aside, basically in the fountains...look no further.

As a Vegas first timer, I definitely wanted to both stare at the fountains Oceans 11 style and have dinner somewhere close so I could see more than one or two shows at a time. Olives was a last minute decision, and, of course, was packed. We were told there would be a 45-60 minute wait, which we were fine with, but we ended up getting a seat on the patio (I highly recommend sitting out there) in less than 5 minutes. Nice start to the evening.

Now on the patio with an excellent view, we were lucky enough to be greeted by Paul - he was the nicest, friendliest, most accommodating waiter we have ever had. He made sure we had great seats throughout the entire meal, which included moving us to a table at the edge (right by the fountains) sometime in between apps and dinner. When we saw the table open up, we thought about asking to move...but Paul came over to tell us that ""Unfortunately, we won't be able to bring your dinner to this table...because now you are both sitting over there!"" 

The experience was amazing. It was the most relaxed dinner we had in Vegas, and probably one of the most relaxed ones we've had in a really long time, anywhere. Everything was timed perfectly, we never had to ask for anything...it was almost like they read our minds.

In addition to playing musical chairs and watching the fountains, we also ate some really good food. I would recommend the watermelon salad and tuna tartare, but those were hard choices to make (among the many very delicious sounding appetizer options.)

For meals, we had one scallop dish, and one very indecisive panic between the lobster pasta and the ricotta ravioli. I asked Paul what he would recommend out of the two, and he said ""let me surprise you."" I love surprises, so I was down for that. I ended up with a  1\/2 portion of each meal, divided by a thin line of balsamic glaze. Both meals were amazing, though if I had to pick one, I'd go for the ravioli. 

All in all, we had an amazing dinner, saw at least 5 different shows, and sat as close to them as possible. Paul was a fantastic waiter and the food was delicious, so this place lands a very deserving ""must go"" rating for anyone looking for an incredible dinner in Vegas.",4,2,5

The onion bread and sesame crisps were a good start.  They were both flavorful but the bread was so salty that I had to down my water after.

The rest of the food was beyond subpar for the price, and the grilled squid and octopus lacked any flavor, and didn't have any characteristics of what one would expect from something that was properly grilled, plus the sauce was at best, akin to a bad Middle-Eastern garbanzo bean soup seasoned with dirt, and overwhelmed what little favor one might hope to find in the squid, or octopus. Our bus boys was the only one who seemed to know anything about quality service, which we discovered in chatting with him was something that he learned while working at another dining establishment, which was apparent, as he clearly couldn't have learned anything about quality service from the cold, and rude front desk, inattentive servers, or the the rather pompous, uncaring, and unapologetic GM, whose ego and demeanor belong in a frat house, not an establishment of this nature.

I actually liked the environment because I were seated in the outside patio.  The view was super nice! It's very very pretty at night.  Don't worry about the cold weather because there were heaters outside.  The only sad thing about the night I was there because there was a little rain and it was super windy.  so I guess if you are planning to go, check the weather too!

I ordered the following plates:
1) Pan cake with Foie Gras steak $25 (again, if you know I'm a big fan of foie gras.  I give a-OK to this one.  It's not that I don't know it but it did not have the original taste.  But guess what, the mini pancake tasted really special and i love it!)

2) Escargot - $18 (hmm... i don't recommend this.  sorry)

3) tuna tartare - $18 (no..... don't order this.  it was just plain tuna sashimi (i think it was not marinated) and some cucumber in the bottom..... If you are in the SGV area,  please go to La Grande Orange Cafe in Pasadena for the tuna tartar only $14)

4) Lobster Pasta - $41 (a big disappointment.  I'm sorry to say I didn't like it.  I saw many people recommended this and it's about lobster so I gave a try.  Failed.  It was a big ""plate"" with a little portion of pasta and two pieces of lobster.  The lobster tasted like it's only boiled.  The sauce to the pasta was okay but for $41... I was hoping for more.)

5) Lemonade - $6 (it tastes different and was good.  But $6 I think it was overpriced)

The service was okay, not at my expectation.  The view, again, super nice, despite of the weather.  We took some photos there and the server was nice enough to help us take one photo.  

The total bill came out around $115 which is quite expensive to me.. but the good thing is I have $60 from my mlife credit so I only had the pay the rest.  So don't forget your mlife card.  If you gamble, use it to pay!! heheh 

My tip is make reservation ahead of time.  Go around at 6PM before the peak time.   If you are like me, prefer bigger portion of food... maybe it's not really a good place to try.  But if you like to enjoy the view and enironment and not about the food, there you go, a must try!",1,0,0

Service: 
We had a reservation for 3 at 6:45pm and we all were running a little late but the staff held our table we all go there around 7:30pm. We were very happy they waited for us. We were instantly greeted by our waiter his name was Carl and he reminded me of Steve Harvey and he was really funny too. I knew at that point we were gonna have a good night.  He was very professional and knew the menu to a T. He recommend the popular drinks and allow us to go over the menu. 

Drinks\/Starters:
My wife order some really sweet mixed drink that looked like a can of motor oil in a cup.
I just ordered a beer and my boss order a glass of wine.
They gave us bread on the table at OMG it was wonderful. It was like a raisin nut scrumdiddlyumptious roll and 3 different type olive dipping sauce. It's not good when the bread is delicious because you want more and more but then you get too full and you can't eat your dinner.

We decide to order some appetizers. My wife order Foie Gras for $26.00 and i understand why. I ate her Foie Gras in hawaii. Sorry hun.
My boss and I tried the ""Greek"" Style Romaine Salad with
tomato, cucumber, cracked olives, red onion, feta phyllo triangle, oregano dressing for $17.00 ea. It was great I thought maybe that it might be weird tasting but all the ingredients work really well together. I was impressed and so was my boss.

Our Carl i mean waiter was johnny on the spot which the refills and taking our orders which was great because we could see he was very busy but still makes time for us. I loved the service. 5 stars all the way.

Entr√©es:
My Wife and I order the Chilean Sea Bass with cannellini bean & sausage cassoulet, garlicky broccolini, oj glaze, watercress for $46.00 ea. We throughly enjoyed the meal but sadly we have had better in Newport Beach, Ca and that might be because the fish is more fresh there and Vegas fish is frozen. I am not sure but it was still good. 3 stars.

My Boss ordered Linguine Alle Vongole with littleneck clams, red pepper flakes, white wine & garlic, parsley for $36.00. He said it was really good and he loves Vongole and it was right on point. 

Dessert:
We order a Mango, Berry, Watermelon Sorbet which was 3 scoops and it was so silky and amazing. Not to sweet and bit tangy. We all shared it and it was perfect because my wife likes mango, I liked the watermelon and my boss loves the berry and it couldn't be more perfect.

Experience:
Overall the total service and meal were 5 stars and I would definately come back when we are in Vegas again. It was rad that our table was close to the window because we could see the Water Show while we were dining. We left with full belly and great memories.

Thanks Olives aka Carl for making our night and to my boss for paying for everything. Cheers!",9,5,6

Seated right away.  Sometimes at fancier restaurants you aren't seated immediately even though you have reservations.  They brought us out to the patio that overlooked the fountains. It was great to see the dancing fountains throughout dinner.  What a fantastic place for dinner!  Even though it was July, the sun was just going down and it was pretty comfortable outside.  

I know I usually don't dine at places like this except for special occasions, but they brought out the drink menu on an iPad!  I was impressed.  You just tap on the mixed drink and it would tell you what the ingredients were.  It was great to see technology making it's way into menus.  (Plus I love apple products)

We ordered from the Prix Fixe menu.  This runs $55 per person and $20 more if you'd like the wine paring.  I started with the grilled shrimp skewers and pineapple salad.  Absolutely delightful!  The salad was so light and refreshing.  The shrimp had a fabulous flavor that definitely hit the spot!

My entree was the gilled Alaskan Halibut over mushrooms with fennel potatoes.  OH MY GOSH!  Very delicious! So far my bday dinner was perfect!

For dessert I had the pineapple lime cake with coconut ice cream.  Not too sweet and very light cake.  A great treat for the end of my meal...  or so I thought!

For my birthday they brought out 4 cream puffs drizzled in chocolate with Happy Birthday written on the plate.  They were incredible!  And yes I shared...  :-)",4,3,3

I'd read that the complimentary bread here was worth the trip - and it is. It was flavorful and crisp - just the right start to the meal. I had the following:

Crispy Pork Lollipops - I'm not sure what I expected to see, really, but this ended up being the largest app I'd ever had in a restaurant of this quality. While I'd have been fine with half the portion, it is not because it was lacking in any way. The ""lollipops"" ended up being tender ribs with a great flavor. 

Salmon en Croute - The pastry was dense enough to handle the salmon, which was cooked perfectly in its shell. 

Chocolate Mousse - Beautifully presented. Great consistency and flavor. 

I also tried the panna cotta (the panna cotta was actually my original dessert.) which was very mild. I'm not into mild desserts, but my dinner companion was. So, we switched :)",0,0,0

When you have kids and want to go on vacation without them there is much to prepare for, after two days of planning and preparing our children and their babysitter we were exhausted by the time our plane landed and we arrived at the Bellagio, therefore, we were starving!

We got there between lunch and dinner therefore the bar area was the only open area. I desperately needed some fermented malts and barley, so much so I was willing to pay for it as opposed to drinking for free on the floor or in the poker room. The only downside is they do not have any beers on tap, just in the bottle; however, they had a good selection. My wife's diet coke was $5 dollars?! Not sure if it was blessed with baby tears or had gold flakes in it, but diet coke should never be $5 dollars..

Anyways, the wife ordered their burger with the works, and I ordered the beef Carpaccio. Let me start off with my wife's burger, it was only about a 3 star burger, the accompaniments were pretty standard for a place like this, to include over-ratted truffle oil, do not get me wrong, I like truffles, but having had many truffle oils and owning some myself I find it hard to pay the extra for something I do not feel to be as pure or as good as what some places try to portray it as. Her burger was decent, only slightly over cooked but came in at over $20. The fries that come with it are probably made by 3 potatoes; they were sliced like jo-jos so they were even huger in appearance.

My beef Carpaccio was by far the best I have ever had. This is an explosion of flavor and compliments. The beef tasted so fresh, crisp, and clean.  Underneath had a deep fried Gorgonzola polenta square, on top was parmesan, cipolin onions, balsamic reduction, scallion cream, garlic aioli the nice thing about the deep fried square was the subtle heat it radiated throughout the dish. The toppings were perfect and wonderfully complimented each other. 
For my wife's meal and my meal, which was technically an appetizer it cost us over $60 bucks that included 1 beer 1 diet coke and tip. But, it was still worth it, I will forever remember my beef Carpaccio, it is easily one of the best dishes I have had!",7,5,6

From start to finish it was two hours for lunch, I think this is unacceptable. We were seated right away and greeted pretty quickly. The server was pushing a glass of Shiraz on me which I agreed to. He also took the drink order for my two friends. We got the 3 wines 15 minutes later, and when i asked for bread he said it would come after the menus were gone but he still hadn't taken our order. I had the Cesar salad that had no flavor and the tomatoes were too ripe and very mushy. My friend had the tuna carpaccio which was good and had very nice presentation. 

The entrees came after an hour and 20 minutes from when we sat. We had to ask three people about our food and we heard our waiter ask someone where it was also. I had the pasta special which was with chicken, mushrooms, peas on paradelle. It was very bad, all the flavors muddled together and the paradelle was thin and overcooked. The chicken was shredded which I've never had on a pasta with white wine sauce, I didn't even finish a third of it. My friends had sandwiches which were just fine. We had to split the check and the waiter made a big deal about it and said he had to talk to the manager. For what i detailed above at lunch, it was $150.

Now the place isn't cheap.  But it's convienietly located in the Bellagio so you can gamble, eat here, then go to a show...or go back to gambling. 

It's a dimly lit restaurant with dark decor and very proper, nicely dressed servers. 

We ended up getting 2 appetizers to share instead of getting an entree each.   The special of the day was a sausage flatbread.  It was so delicious.  The spicy sausage and the gooey cheese on top of the buttery, crispy flatbread made me drool.  It was so good that I went back the next day just to have it again!

We also got the kabobs.  The chicken and the beef were both tender and so well seasoned.  I hate biting into beef and having to gnaw my way through the thing but this was cooked perfectly. 

The next night we got the the carpet baggers also.  Delicious.  Fried oysters on top of truffled mashed potatoes?  We licked those oyster shells clean!  I am still thinking about those to this day...

Not only were our appetizers quickly brought out but the bread basket they give you to start with is dangerous.  The rolls in the basket are varied so you wanna try each one: rosemary loaf, white chocolate bread, and crispy bread to dip into their complimentary olive spread.

For starters, the carpaccio, is delicious.  It's different.  It's not about the beef but rather all the ingredients creating a more substantial dish.  The garlic aioli, balsamic reduction and Parmesan cheese go so well together and their combined earthiness accentuates the sweet, raw beef flavor.  The Kobe beef tartare is also excellent though not traditional.  

Flat breads are all excellent.  The thin, crispy, and slightly blackened bread is the perfect foil to any topping.  The fig and prosciutto; wow!  Mushroom lovers should not pass up the Portobello flat bread.  Really well cooked without all the liquid that usually makes any mushroom flat bread soggy.

Pastas, especially stuffed pastas, are excellent.  The goat cheese ""dumplings"" pair perfectly with a tomato ragu and pesto.  The butternut squash tortelli, the perfect dish for the fall, is absolutely delicious in its simple brown butter sauce with texture from crushed amaretto cookies.

For all my visits, I have never made it to any of the mains.  It is just to hard to skip the starters, flat breads, and pastas.

Service is excellent.

The wines by the glass selection is limited but very well chosen.  The overall wine selection is very good with many reasonably priced, simple wines that match the cuisine well.

Another inexplicably hyped celebrity chef eatery with inflated prices for minuscule portions on gigantic plates. Very dark and loud inside and I could barely see or hear my sister and her husband who had unfortunately ordered this appetizer before I arrived:

BEEF CARPACCIO with gorgonzola polenta, parmesan, cipollini onions, balsamic reduction,
scallion cream, and garlic aioli. Good God what a big pile of slop that was. Everything tasted the same: bland and mushy. 

I didn't much care for the entree choices either...very limited. Here's what I ended up with:

Chicken parmesan with whipped potatoes and vegetables.

Verdict? I could barely find any of the aforementioned on the plate(maybe because it was so dark) but even after feeling around with my fork to ensure everything was gone I couldn't believe how hungry I still was. Even the double Ketel One on the rocks I had was piss poor. Way too much ice. Ditto for the second one. I don't even know what my sister and hubbie had nor do I care. It looked so tiny in the dim light I doubt I would have recognized it beneath a spotlight.

Before I get to the food the restaurant and the furniture felt they needed an urgent update, the restaurant felt used and worn.

When we sat down to the table, we received
A Bread basket with two kinds of tapenade and olives that were really salty,
¬†
For starters we ordered the fig and prosciutto flatbread,
And the tuna carpaccio,

Two dishes I've eaten in the past and I really enjoyed - Big disappointed this time.

It took a long time to get the food, more than half an hour,
Even tough the restaurant was half empty.

Last time the flat bread also had caramelized shallots and a touch of rosemary.
The combination of sweet figs with prosciutto and caramelized onions and a touch of rosemary was a wonderful combination.
But this time, the bread was flooded with sweet fig jam with no trace of onion and rosemary, so sweet on the border of inedible.

The tuna carpaccio had the same illness, poor performance.
In the past it was a wonderful dish. Fresh tuna, light mashed potatoes made with olive oil, crunchy cracker and capers. This time we got tasteless tuna and a lump of bland mashed potatoes. Really not tasty.

As main courses I ordered the scallops on carrot risotto,
 My wife ordered one of the Day Specials, the New York Strip with Shiitake Mushrooms glaze with mashed potatoes and green beans.

I do not know where to start but the dishes were bad.

I received my three scallops sitting in a risotto.
 The scallops were fine, but the risotto was bad.
Instead of getting a rich and sticky creamy rice with some bite in the middle,
I got tasteless overcooked rice sitting in a pool of water with a trace of orange color.

I ordered this dish because I saw Todd English cooking this dish
In one of the  morning shows, when he cooked it at looked really good.
The risotto looked rich with a fluorescent orange color. The dish looked really really good, nothing resembling the dish I got.

All I have to say about my wife's dish there is no connection between the steak she received and a New York Strip steak.
Does not look like, much less taste like a new York strip steak.
The dish was filled with a really  strong shiitake mushrooms sauce, 
a trick used to hide poor quality meat it is not something I was expecting to get in this restaurant 

A $12 Steak at longhorn steakhouse is much much better than this steak.

I'm sorry if I sound critical it is my opinion,
It was my wife's first time in this restaurant and she was really disappointed,

 In a city like Las Vegas there are endless options for restaurants for this price.
 I ate in countless restaurants in the Las Vegas when I lived here,
And I was never disappointed like this.",1,1,1

We had high hopes for Olives, and the dinner menu looked so promising.  Alas, it was not to be. We started with the Beef Carpaccio, which was one of the waiter's recommendations. It was underseasoned and just underwhelming, there was a decent piece of crispy polenta hiding under a mass of salad greens, the beef was all over the plate hiding under a mass of sauces. The Caesar Salad was a 'deconstructed' salad, basically a wedge type salad - not what we were wanting or expecting.  For the main entrees, we got the Mushroom Fettuccine and the Sea Scallops.  The scallops were not seared very well, no flavor and the pasta was again, under seasoned and just not very good.  I expected more mushrooms since that was the title, but is was swimming in a cream sauces with little mushrooms, and there was red pepper in there that I thought tasted really distracting. Underwhelming is the best word to describe everything.  

Plus, the decor was really dark.  Yes, I know it's mood lighting but it was too dark for that kind of a restaurant.  Could hardly see the menu or the food!  I felt like it was the type of restaurant where they're herding people in, then herding people out.  

For the prices they were charging, we were left very disappointed.  We expected a quality meal but instead received mediocre food - way too much going on with the plating.  Too much garnish, saucing, just too much stuff on the plate, didn't allow the main ingredients to shine.  And the main ingredients were prepared in a sloppy, unrefined manner.  I actually prefer Cheesecake Factory over Olives, and I would rate the type of food as on the same level.  Except Olives charges 3x as much. 

If you want a truly memorable meal and are willing to shell out the bucks, skip Olives and go to Tom Colicchio's Craft Steak.  Amazing service, fabulous food, quality throughout. That was definitely a meal to remember.  Olives, meh, not so much.",0,0,0

Not a cheap date, but expect well executed Mediterranean-inspired food, creative drink, and efficient service in a wonderful space, overlooking the amazing Bellagio water show outside.

It can be loud inside, but the expectation should be to sit outside on the patio on all but inclement conditions.  It's worth the wait, as the water show is spectacular and elevates the Olives experience.

Make reservations early.  Don't wait until the day-of if you want prime time, and note that patio seating is first come, first served, even with a reservation.

The drink menu and wine list are on a balky, awkward iPad device.  The list is impressive, for sure, and yes, they are pretty pictures and great descriptions.  But Olives' use of technology for technology's sake is overly complicated, imoho.  KISS.

Our waitress was accommodating and friendly, and took the time to go through things on the menu we weren't quite sure about. We ordered the Tuscan Farmhouse flatbread, it had shaved ham, mozzarella, asparagus and caramelized onion. It was very good, the bread had a nice consistency, doughy but crisp. My husband ordered the special, spaghetti and meatballs in a cream sauce. He said it was good, but the cream sauce lacked in flavor. I ordered the beef tenderloin, it came as a perfect medium. It had a nice crust to it, and was like butter when cut. The mashed potatoes were nice, as well as the tempura asparagus. We also chose to get the zucchini sticks, and so glad we did. They were seriously one of the tastiest things I ate our whole trip.

Those fountains are LOUD when they go off, and the temperature on the patio easily drops ten degrees - such a fantastic show. We started off with a rosemary manhattan each - I didn't really taste the rosemary much, but overall a solid cocktail made with Maker's Mark. The freshly baked focaccia and olive tapenade were also solid and a great start to the meal. I had the famous Todd English beef carpaccio. The brick of polenta hiding underneath the mound of beef wasn't my favorite, but the combo of the tender beef, baby arugula, shaved parmesan, balsamic reduction and scallion creme were spectacular. I would come back for this dish alone. The pear and beet salad was also very good. I love that they use lolla rosa instead of the usual romaine, though the salad was a little overdressed.

Our waiter was excellent, let us move tables twice and kept the bread and oil coming before we had ordered a single item. His attitude didn't change when we told him we had a voucher - which is huge. Almost a huge as the portion sizes! I am, as I mentioned before, a food whore. There cannot be enough food. But...Olives came close. And it wasn't just the quantity, it was also the quality. The beef carpaccio was a poem on a plate...delicious, thin and lean slices of well seasoned beef over a bed of polenta and some greens...mouthwatering.

I generally DON'T like the food here, but I continue to suggest this place for business lunches\/dinners, take family\/friends in town here (probably primarily to sit outside), and even... eat here myself when I shop at the Bellagio (in my defense, it's usually around lunch when I shop here and I'm always FAMISHED when 1-2 rolls around.. it's just convenient).  I guess my biggest issue is that I don't know how to categorize the cuisine.  It's got a little bit of everything, but it's called, ""Olives""?  Often, there's something curried, something sriracha'd, something greek, something ""mediterranean"", something with all french touches... It's just confusing.  Besides that, in the million and one times I've been here, I've run into some of the most inexcusable food screw ups.. like, totally overdone-dehydrated-DEAD parmesan fries, meat being over done, excessive spices.

Well, it really is a pretty restaurant, and the outdoor seating is great, with the water show (FYI- everyone both outside and IN run out when the show comes on and flood the balcony), the music, air, it really is nice to eat there.  I've never had an unpleasant experience with the service.  It is a nice restaurant... BUT, I just feel like the food, while decent, really isn't all that spectacular.  In other words, I recommend lunch here- like a later lunch- 1ish (the portions are HUGE), not dinner (although an early dinner brings an ideal time to sit outside).

I've had just about everything on the menu and I like:

Calamari - nice and crisp, but I like calamari from anywhere, including some dingy Jersey highway diners at 2am.
Tuna tartare - the cucumbers and crispy shrimp make it.
grilled squid & octopus- tahini like dressing was tasty.
fried ravioli - A. it's fried, and B. the SAUCE was great.
mushroom\/truffle oil flatbread- it's HUGE and really awesome.
filet with curry-yogurt sauce- great sauce.
seasonal creme brulee (passionfruit or coconut..something tropical)- perfect portion and sweetness

Things that have been a total disaster:

Parmesan fries
crab fritters..... bean puree and mango salsa???  yuck.
beef carpaccio

Although Vegas Strip can feel very artificial (and it mostly is), accepting its identity is key to starting to enjoy it. Committing a food foul is easy when one is judging a restaurant by its view...but, I'll admit that this was definitely a factor here. Olives was indeed a beautiful, but also a very delicious experience. 

The butternut squash tortellini was a flavorful dish, extremely heavy though. There is a bit of an overpowering taste to it from the sauce. I'd recommend it to someone who likes alfredo pastas. The handcrafted gnochetti on the other hand, was simply phenomenal, very well balanced and savory dish. The bolognese and roasted tomatoes added plenty of that natural umami flavor.

The breads were all warm, soft, and fresh, and included a particularly yummy type I would guess is called onion-topped foccacia.  Amazingly enough, the bread was not the star of the complimentary appetizers.  They also brought out a dish with black and green olives and olive spread in the same two varieties.  The green one was enjoyable enough with quite a bit of natural kick, but the black one was pure magic.  It was almost like like secretly mixed butter into it.  I'm completely full right now but somehow this is still making me drool.

We ordered the portabello mushroom panini and the butternut squash tortelli.   Both were particularly fresh and pleasant; the pasta was probably a bit inbalanced with the few bites that had enough cheese on them being the better ones.  A very nice surprise was the fried pickles that came with the panini.  Don't cringe - these were plenty mild, probably because of the frying, and when dipped in the provided mustard sauce generated a little dose of magic.

Service was very prompt and attentive, and our only regret was that we couldn't eat more.  We came in with no expectations, and left plenty happy and only about $40 poorer after tip.",0,1,0

They serve Hoshizaki ice (worlds most perfect ice), so my grey goose and pineapple cocktail tasted great. Vegas water tastes awful, so having ice that melts slowly and that eliminates containments makes for a better tasting drink.

Our server recommend the banana tiramisu for dessert. It was nothing special.
 
Pineapple iced tea ($6) and two pears cocktail ($14), both were awesome!
The complimentary bread basket was nice, 3 kinds of bread, 2 tapenades and olives.

Being from New York, we're used to small appetizers. When we go out, we'll share a few appetizer dishes and one or two main courses. At Olives, we ordered the beef tartare, tuna tartare, charcuterie board, a flatbread, and the gnocchi. Our server, Paul, who was very sweet, suggested we order the carpaccio instead of the beef tartare since it was the most popular appetizer. Expecting like six slices of raw beef and a few mesclun green leaves, we were surprised when this large plate came out with a mountain of beef. The carpaccio was all over the plate and in the center, it covered a mound of greens and a polenta cake. The carpaccio and tuna tartare were delicious, but were so filling. I wish our server had warned us.

After those two appetizers, it was hard to enjoy anything. The flatbread with fontina, ham, and asparagus was great. The charcuterie board was nice, but we could've done without it. The gnocchi in pesto cream was also okay, but at this point, we could barely touch it we were so full.

First of all, we called the day of  to push back our Saturday night reservation a few hours, and they were accommodating. However we showed up about 40 minutes late anyways and didn't expect to still be able to get a table since they were booked solid. The hostess said she would do her best to get us a table or we could eat at the bar. We waited about 30 min and she was able to seat us at a table. We felt very lucky and were appreciative of her efforts.

We each ordered cocktails and each one was wonderful. They give you an ipad with the drink menu, which is a fun and useful incorporation of technology. I had a ginger one, which had a marvelous rich ginger flavor. It was the favorite among the group. I order a lot of ginger-y cocktails and this is the best one yet! 

For an appetizer my friends and I shared the beef carpaccio. I have never ordered this dish before, but it was outstanding. My foodie friend informed me that the beef was the perfect quality and it was likely the best she had. It cost about $20 and it was worth it. Great for sharing!

I ordered the scallops for my main course. They were buttery and delicious on a bed of perfectly creamy mashed potatoes. Possibly the best I have had and worth the price of $42. My friends ordered the prime beef tenderloin which came with a crab cake ($52) and the mushroom pappardelle ($32). The tenderloin and crab cake were very tasty, but we spent some time debating whether it was worth the high price. Neither the beef nor the crab cake were particularly special or prepared in a difficult way, although they were definitely better than average. The crab cake was my favorite part, probably because I love crab. Additionally, the pappardelle was good, but also not outstanding. 

We were too full to order dessert.

The service and ambience of the restaurant was lovely. Not so dark you can't read or see each other, but dark enough to have a relaxing, romantic atmosphere. They serve three types of bread (chocolate walnut, foccacia, and a cheese crisp) with olives and olive tapenade. We enjoyed quite a bit of these. When our meal was winding down, the man who served our bread\/bused our table informed us to keep an eye out for interesting people. He would not tell us who. We hoped to spot some celebrity entering the restaurant after this comment, but were unsuccessful.

Olives is high-class and the prices reflect it. Pay attention to the floor with the beautiful mosaic type of tile in-lay. Great view of the fountains if you're lucky, too!!

FYI: if you sit in any of the booth seating, it feels like you are a child again when you try to peer above the table. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But, still, you do sink into the booth. Go for the chair. 

My waitress was Kimberly and she was phenomenal. She steered me in the perfect direction when I had trouble choosing which cocktail I wanted (#firstworldproblem). I picked the ""Slingback"" -- Absolut Ruby Red vodka, passion fruit pur√©e, & fresh lime juice with a micro-sugar rim. Extremely refreshing but steep at $14 a piece. 

You receive some delicious bread- a Parmesan crisp type, an olive bread, and a buttery focaccia. The olive spreads are good but especially tasty if you like the taste of having an ocean's worth of salt poured into your mouth. 
TIP: Do not miss the Butternut Squash Tortelli ($17)-- I've ordered this several times and it absolutely does not disappoint. I made friends with the table next to me and the woman I talked to loved her Greek salad and especially the chicken on top.

I enjoyed my first trip to Todd English's Olives for lunch.  The view was great though you may have to deal with cigarette smoking on the patio and the food was both good and reasonably priced (nice housemade pastas and good scallops).  Dinner at Olives did not offer the same experience.  The dining room was pretty dark and the food was very overpriced like other Las Vegas restaurants backed by well known chefs.

The dinner menu at Olives did have similarities to Olives' lunch offerings.  There was a good mix of starters and housemade pastas (though the housemade pastas on my last trip were more my style).  For dinner, Olives nixes the lunchtime sandwiches for more substantial entrees.

Dinner started the same as lunch--breads with olives and a variety of olive spreads.  I started with the seared foie gras, which was served on buttered brioche and garnished with spice poached pears, honeyed yogurt and crushed walnuts.  It was a mostly sweet plate especially given that the portion of foie gras was so small.  I really enjoyed the spice poached pears--nice caramelization and sweetness.  The foie gras was good and creamy, but it was just too small of a portion.

For my entree, I had the seared scallops, which were served on truffled yukon mashed potatoes and topped with sauteed sea beans and a Cabernet reduction.  The scallops themselves were a very good quality--fresh, moist and soft.  Unfortunately, they were also quite salty.  The sides were okay but nothing special.

For dessert, I had their chocolate molten cake, which was not the most original dessert, but it was still a very good dessert.  The cake had a good outside crust while the center was hot, rich, chocolaty, and gooey.  The cake and the warm, gooey center went very well with the okay but not great ice cream.

Service was just okay.  It took a while to put in our order and while our server seemed pleasant, she also seemed a little distracted.

As mentioned, dinner prices are high here.  The prices are consistent with similar quality restaurants in Las Vegas, but the entree prices here would be very overpriced in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.

Olives' food is at the very least okay, which is actually better than a lot of Vegas restaurants.  Still, the food is not that remarkable and it comes at a very high price at dinner.  Olives is not a bad option for lunch where prices are lower and the atmosphere is nicer, but you might want to seek another option for an upscale dinner in Las Vegas.

Olives is located in Bellagio.  Like almost all of the major hotels and casinos on The Strip, Bellagio offers complimentary valet and self parking.",18,14,18

I did over the phone a month ago! Fumed over this the whole dinner. Why call in advance then?? This took away the one star. Our waiter Chris was very helpful and attentive. All the dishes were excellent, especially the Beef Tenderloin and Char Grilled Lamb Chops. Yummy! Our friend was able to cross off a couple of his culinary bucket list items by ordering the Beef Tartare and Sea Urchin dish. A little out of my comfort zone, but he said both were amazing. My wife ordered the Butternut Squash Tortelli and found it to be like a Thanksgiving dish with the sage in it. She asked if it could be returned and they promptly replaced it with her second choice, Ricotta Ravioli. Loved it. All in all, would I return??? Yes, but I left with a bad taste in my mouth by not being able to get the window table I had reserved a month in advance.",0,0,0

There are a lot of great tables, and a couple crappy ones. We fortunately got a good one, but I could see how someone could be upset if they got seated basically facing the mall, for what you're paying in food. 

The food itself was very good. The Beef Carpaccio my dad got as an appetizer and boy was he surprised. It's basically a full meal in itself. If you aren't splitting it with at least another person, you're crazy. It's like saying I'm going to have the nachos platter as an appetizer. Look at the pictures; it's huge. That being said it's one of the most dynamic and interesting dishes we had that night, and sticks in my memory months later writing this review. 

I had the scallops for dinner, which had some interesting sea beans which made for a deep, briny flavor. Not for everyone, but I enjoyed them. 

So ya, if you can, ask for a table outside or at least away from the mall side. If you're looking for a cheaper meal, go with the flatbread. More reasonable (half price) compared to a full entree, you'll leave full, and the people around us seemed to be enjoying them.",2,1,1

______________________________________

My first visit to Olives was in February 2009. It was an incredible meal, one that left us craving for more and allowed us to end our week of indulgence (2 B'ways, 3 Cirques, 1 Le Reve, & many good meals) on a good note. We had:

* JUMBO SEA SCALLOPS - sweet corn risotto, fall heirloom tomato salad, arugula, warm bacon bread crumbs
     - [5\/5 - The flavors, textures, and smells were perfect.. Those scallops virtually melted in your mouth. Still the ultimate best scallops I've ever tasted.]
* PAN SEARED MAHI MAHI - honey white polenta, baby carrots, butter braised giant prawns, spice market sauce
     - [5\/5 - It's been a while, but I recall it being very soft, well-seasoned, and yummafying.]



______________________________________

My second visit to Olives was in January 2010. We had:

* VEAL AGNOLOTTI AL PLIN - slow braised osso buco, fontina cheese agnolotti, truffle butter
     - [5\/5 - Wow. I will tell you this - my friend was very, very, very jealous.]
* RICOTTA RAVIOLI - roasted tomato basil sauce, sweet italian sausage, garlic bread crumbs
     - [4\/5 - Delicious, but not really very special.]",2,2,2

- As a woman dining alone, I was treated like a seating challenge, rather than a guest.

- Raw garlic on an un-wiped condiment tray (tapenade smears on the sides are visually alarming) just sets a really sloppy tone for the meal.

- The Bibb salad was so harshly dressed with an overly acidic vinaigrette, nearly raw onions & raw walnuts that 3 hours and 2 coffees later, I can still taste it on my tongue.

- The board for the flatbread sits so awkwardly on the table (it was longer than my arm), it's hard to maneuver around. The fig and prosciutto flatbread itself was so oil-drenched, overly sweet AND overly salty all at one, I ate one piece out of crazy hunger and left the rest behind with most of the salad.

This was honestly the worst restaurant meal I've had in two years, and sadly, the worst meal before that was at another Todd English restaurant. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt because he has in the past had such a great reputation, but I've been too badly burned twice. Other chefs who actually care deserve my dining dollars.",6,2,2

Olives is a beautiful restaurant overlooking the famous Bellagio fountains that manages to be elegant, without being snobby. We were seated right away and blessed with a warm & friendly, attentive server that handled everything perfectly from start to finish. It's been over a week and I'm still dreaming about the food & cocktails! 

A Few Tips:

1)  Make reservations. They won't guarantee a spot on the patio, but they'll ensure you're seated quickly. If it's freakin' hot outside (often the case in Vegas), don't be a dumbass & ask to sit outside...you'll most likely be uncomfortable & sweaty.

2) Dress up a little. I wouldn't call it overly ""fancy"", but you will most likely feel out of place in jeans, so leave the fanny-pack at home.

3) Order a Signature Cocktail from the menu. They're a little spendy...but oh-so-delicious and refreshing! My ""Two-Pear"" martini was worth every penny.

4) Listen to your fellow Yelpers and order the recommended dishes. Your tastebuds will thank you! We ordered the fig\/prosciutto flatbread and it was sweet + savory & crispy...delicious! Our entr√©e, Butternut Squash Tortelli...was a medley of amazing flavors and each bite literally melted in my mouth. I ate slowly because I didn't want it to end...ever. Simply devine!

5) Their portions are decent, so come hungry. Plus, dinner comes with a huge basket of assorted breads with 2 yummy tapenades. If you overeat, you'll ruin the whole thing, dammit...so don't.

6) Dessert? To be continued.........because I will be back!",1,1,1

While other people are busy shopping for Xmas gifts, I'm always busy thinking and dreaming of what my Xmas meal will be. For 2010, I went to Olives for my Xmas dinner and was amazed at the wonderful service and delicious food. 

We ordered off of their Xmas menu so some of the items featured are not a part of the regular menu...sadness *tears* I was thankful I came here to celebrate my Xmas nonetheless.

For starters I had the carpaccio and the chestnut soup. The Carpaccio is freaking amazing and its HUGE! The whole plate alone could have been my entree and I would have left a happy happy girl. Amazing, fresh, and clean flavors, it was soooo good, I still drool dreaming of it. The polenta cake on the bottom though was a miss and I would have been happy without it. The chestnut soup was creamy and delicious, not too strong or heavy. 

I split the Lobster pappardelle and duck two ways. The pappardelle was very generous in lobster portions. It had a full lobster tail plus more lobster chunks cooked with the pappardelle. The duck two ways wasn't bad, but I've come to realize that I'm just far too picky about duck that its hard to please me.

I didn't like the dessert selection, but I went with the cookie plate because it seemed the safest of all the choices for me. It was actually a surprisingly delicious treat. Cookies were warm, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. Peanut butter cookie was the bomb and the cookies were still delicious the day after!

Would definitely come here again. The service is great and the food is amazing, I would love to just try out some of the other selections in the future! Todd English lives up to the hype!",1,0,0

I ordered the chicken & artichoke flatbread with grilled shrimp on the side. Everything tasted wonderful...even chicken-which can sometimes be bland & tasteless-was amazing! It had an orangey glaze which I've never experienced before in any meal. My bf ordered the free range roasted chicken...I could tell he loved it because he ate everything on his plate!

The reason I only gave four stars: we had reservations & still had a TWENTY MINUTE WAIT. Not cool. Inside the restaurant it was extremely noisy, so we asked to be seated out on the patio. The patio is awesome because it's much less noisy, plus you get to see the Vegas skyline & Bellagio dancing fountain.

Our server, Dennis, was very attentive and made was able to answer any questions that we had about the menu.  

We chose the Manila Clams Fra Diavolo for my wife and I chose the Short Rib Pappardelle.  Both came out very quickly and were very fresh and flavorful.  Service was wonderful, and we never felt rushed at all.  I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking  for a nice quiet meal.",0,0,0

I had a rabbit duo (braised leg and stuffed loin) and both were delicious. It's really hard to make rabbit without it drying out and they did it perfectly. The stuffed loin was tasty, braised leg was perfect. And great portions (no overly tiny food here).

The hostess informed is the earliest we could get out there would be 8:45 but she could get us a table by the window. We obliged. 
About 5 minutes later, we were seated and on the way to the table, the head hostess told the one seating us to bring us to the patio. Awesome. Things are starting off well. 
We ended up with a great table close to the fountains and ordered the fig and prosciutto flatbread (per our servers recommendation) for an appetizer. Between that and the bread basket with olive tapenade they serve, we were practically full by the time our entrees were served. The flatbread was good but not mind blowing. 
Our entrees were superb though: my husband had the tenderloin and crabcake and I had a striped bass special. His tenderloin was cooked perfectly and he could cut it with a fork. The bass was fantastic- perched above a bed of risotto with peas and lump crab meat. I was so full from our bread basket overindulgence but couldn't stop eating it. 
The fountains played a few times while we were out there and the looky-Lou's that come on the patio to watch\/take pics\/etc is a bit annoying.
Food and ambience would score this place a 5 but I had to take off a star for two reasons:
1. The table next to us was a young family- 30 something couple with their two kids- probably 18 months and 4. The baby screamed the entire time. Being parents of an almost two year old ourselves, I understand that dinners out can be challenging. Which is why you couldn't pay me to take my kid to a place like this. I am super conscious of those around me when my daughter is cranky and I was disappointed that these parents weren't the same way. Definitely put a damper on our ""romantic"" evening and I was surprised the olives staff didn't say something but understand that's a tough position for them. 
Second- I could tell the waiter was irritated we weren't drinking (my husband had a beer but I stuck to water as I had a few cocktails while we were gambling prior to dinner) and that we skipped on dessert (which we usually order but were so full). I get it. Waiters want you to order booze because bigger bill=bigger tip. I could have done without the snotty ""sticking with water huh?"" Comment though. 
Pretty minimal but those things did detract from a 5 star experience. 
Awesome food though and we will go back.",0,0,0

Where do I start? Our cocktails were horrible; we ordered Sangria, and I swear it was something a kid breaking into his parents liquor cabinet would make: horrible. I didn't even bother finishing mine.

The food: my husband ordered the Alaskan Salmon, I ordered the pasta special for the night. BOTH of these were horrible. The food was SO salty that you couldn't taste ANY flavor except salt. Our food came out TOO quick, that it leaves me wondering if maybe certain items are plated in advanced? 

Our Server would be better suited at a lower class establishment. He bombarded us as soon as we sat down; we had no chance to even look over our menus. When we didn't order cocktails straight away, we didn't see him again for ten minutes.  He didn't even bother explaining the specials at all, and yes there is an insert inside the menu, but you would think at least he would do some kind of introduction into the specials. Our food arrived, and our server would pop up now and then to say things like, ""Taste good?"" or ""How's the taste?"" It was strange. He was plain crass, and he didn't seem to really care much about our experience at all.  You think for menu items costing in the range of $26 all the way up to $54 a plate, that you would get stellar service; sadly this is NOT the case.

The worst part was the bill: $131.00 for food that I could've gotten at the Olive Garden. I was so burned when we left this place. I was totally shocked when I came here and read that it was getting 4 star reviews! Do not go here. Stay as far away as you can.

Beef Carpaccio melts in your mouth with a savory mustard. Its served on top of mountain of mixed greens with polenta hidden underneath.

On our last visit, we started with the escargot and I swear we were served a small army of those little suckers, all yummy in their baths of garlic and butter with goat cheese crostinis.  I nearly passed out.
 
We've enjoyed their pastas, especially the lobster carbonara, the seabass is always fantastic, and any time we've had a steak with any preparation, it's been sublime.  

It's always crowded,  folks.  Even with a reservation, you might have to wait.  So belly up to the bar.  The guys there are very un-Vegas-like and actually friendly and there's a nice wine list.

I was so excited to take my husband there during our recent trip to Vegas. It was a perfect day, as we arrived right at opening time. Upon approaching to get seated, the hostess just stood there staring at us, and never properly greeted us. It was so awkward that I had to speak up and say, ""We'd like a table for two, preferably on the balcony"". She never once said a word to us. We should've left then and there, but I was starving. From the point at which we were seated by another hostess, things improved. The fountain show and coordinated music were awesome. I ordered the pasta dish with sweet Italian sausage, while hubby ordered the Salmon. I definitely enjoyed my meal more than hubby. 

But I must say, we will never return and I wouldn't recommend Olives to a friend because of the rude hostess. As they say, first impressions are lasting. And there are way too many other restaurants where we can spend our hard-earned money!

And for the record, the hostess was an old White woman (55-65 yrs old). We just so happen to be an African-American couple in our 30's, who make a combined income of about $300,000. We were both dressed professionally and well-groomed-as always. Yet, a White couple in their 30's walked up behind us, dressed in jeans, t-shirts, and a baseball cap--looking ever so bummy! The hostess lit up for them, saying, ""Welcome to Olives. Thank you for dining with us today. Would you prefer indoor or outdoor dining?"". Go figure! Not necessarily saying that race was a factor, but just saying....

I hope that Olives' management reads these reviews to see how the selection of your staff affects your business. I've already shared our experience with a few friends and family members (both Black and White). You may want to retrain your staff on proper Customer Service skills towards all customers.",5,3,0

The fountains don't do their musical numbers until late in the afternoon, so it  was more like sitting over a shallow lake, but pretty.  The service was okay, not great.  However, I think Todd English needs to come in and check in on the food prep.  

My friend ordered the Greek salad with Salmon.  I had the beef burger.  Her salad looked like it had been shaken with the dressing the night before, limp and wet.  I would have sent it back, but she's more reserved that way.  I tasted the salmon.  Nothing special there.  

My burger had next to no flavor.  I kept putting more salt and pepper on it.  I'm not sure how you can have such a bland burger, but they managed.  

The best part of the meal is the bread and thin crackers that they bring to the table beforehand.  

It was disappointing, but from the other reviews...it seems we must have been there on an off day, or something.  I wouldn't chance going back, though.  A $22.00 burger needs to be special as does a $29.00 salad with Salmon.",0,0,0

As for the food, well, hard to top it. We were especially fond of the beef carpaccio, yummy and ever-so flavorful and very appealing to the eye, too. The lobster bisque was full-bodied and creamy good, the Caesar salad as fresh as could be, and the tuna tartare had just the right amount of spice taste and texture for us.

My brother doesn't even like fancy food, but he found himself in love with that flatbread! I wish I had your flatbread cookers in my house so I could have one of these every day even though then I would need to go to the gym twice as much! Mmmmm cheese....

I also got to try one of your pasta special dishes too which came with all kinds of seafood piled amongst all of the noodles and in this tomato based sauce that was so flavorful. After the flatbread though I barely had room to finish this dish and be able to walk to my fancy vegas show afterward! Everything in that dish was perfect though. And my mom and brother were both happy with their dishes too!

But the reason for a star knocked off was a) our waiter decided to take his sweet times at some points with bringing us our drinks b) for staying in the bellagio and this restaurant being in the bellagio and us making our reservation through the hotel we kind of expected to have a table with a better view...Our view was of the fancy shopping stores outside of the restaurant and really as fun as it is to look at escada normally, I would have liked to be able to focus on my food a bit more.

We were strolling around Vegas on a Saturday just before noon looking for a good place for brunch.

I THINK I have been to an Olive's many years ago in Massachusetts. We arrived about 11:50am and they said they had a 20 min wait for an outside table. So we went to the bar for a cocktail and an appetizer of Beef carpaccio. (that was the best food item we ordered) It was on top of a risotto cake. I also really like the olive paste they serve with the bread basket.

Sure enough - about 20 minutes later we got an amazing table in the small outside patio with another stellar view of the Bellagio fountains (we had been to the Paris restaurant the night before), and the music is on speakers right there - so very fun.  (I think we say 3 sessions of the fountain during lunch, 1 song each)

We split a flatbread of the day (buffalo chicken - which wasn't very buffalo-y and not great) and split a bibb lettuce salad that was supposed to have blue cheese in it - but I didn't see or taste any. The service and the view were fantastic - we were not hurried (even though we ordered only 2 small plates for 3 people), the food ...Meh...

Sure enough as we were leaving the place inside was about 65% full, so we go there at just the right time. Warning - they do allow smoking on the patio and there were two guys at the next table smoking when we got there - but they left soon after...but I can see how you could get stuck next some heavy smokers - which would have made me want to eat inside.

Sommelier provided beautiful wines for us to enjoy with our dinner, ( ok, maybe we enjoyed the wine a little too much).  Peppercorn Filet and Scallops w pancetta Risotto were our entree selections.  Both were incredible.  Seriously, to get food this good, in such a beautiful surrounding is an amazing experience.  We eat around the world and this was such a memorable night for us, we cant wait to go back.  The views of the Bellagio Fountain shows simply were a bonus.

There are friendly hostesses seating you on time for your reservation in a beautifully appointed dining room, a nice drink\/wine list, and an interesting menu.  However, the execution is terrible or at least it was for our dinner experience on a Friday night.

First of all, we were seated or crammed into a table about a foot and a half away from people on each side.  Second, we did not get our drinks for fifteen minutes and did not even get water for ten.  When our waiter finally appeared, he told us how busy he was and tried to get sympathy because some old man was demanding.  Okay, we gave him the benefit of the doubt until I asked him a question about the menu and his answer was, ""You know, I am going to have come back because I really need to wait on that table.""  So much for us sitting there not being helped for fifteen minutes...ugh.

With regards to the food, it was above average.  The bread and olive tapenade was commendable.  The boston bibb salad fell in the alright category.  The true winner for us was the portobello flatbread.  I can imagine that if I would have had a salad and flatbread for lunch, I would probably be writing a much better review.  Then, my husband had the risotto special and I had the halibut.  The fish was flaky and quite tasty, but I could not even dent it, it was so large.  The risotto was undercooked and lacked pizazz.

All in all, a disappointing experience and not one living up to the name or price of Todd English.  I think it is time for him to drop in on his Vegas restaurant to see how things are going.",5,0,2

My experience here, from start to finish, was great. We arrived to our reservation early and sat at the bar while we waited for our table (which we requested to be outside and they were able to accommodate us if we waited til our actual time). The service at the bar was great, as were the other guests sitting there, and they even have iPads around that have the drink menu on it. 

Once our table was ready they took us to a spot on the patio that had a perfect view of the famous Bellagio fountain show.  To start we ordered the grilled octopus--it was very tasty and fresh, but needed a tad of salt which we were able to season and once we did the favors popped. For dinner I had the scallops and my bf had the short ribs. My scallops were delicious-tasty, lightly seasoned and meaty. My boyfriend loved his dish as well. Service was also great, and we were not rushed at any point during our meal which I was really happy about. 

Olives is definitely worth a visit and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone----but also make sure to sit on the patio to watch the fountain show as it's really awesome to see up close.",2,1,1

The interior design was very flowy and romantic, kind of like Lothlorien meets old Spanish metal lamp sculptures. 

We shared three appetizers and a main course. The salad was satisfactory, the two different styles of foie gras served on one plate was what I looked forward to as soon as I saw it on the menu. One was warm and roasted, one was steamed. Mm... foie gras.... The only thing they failed on was that they did not de-vein the thing properly, which meant it did not cut cleanly and I was fishing for the stringy things. But it tasted great.

An interesting part of the menu was an offering of various flatbreads, topped with various offers. We got the simplest one with buffalo mozzarella sprinkled with dry herbs. It was nice and soft, the mozzarella having a bit more dense and less stringy consistency than plain mozzarella, which tells me there was actually thought behind the choice rather than just novelty. It reminded me very much of the pizza I had at Mozza, and I preferred this one much better.

The main course was seared salmon with a pepper crust. Very unfortunate in that the server was late in picking it up from the kitchens. It was sitting under the heat lamp for so long that by the time it came to us it was near well done. It still had decent texture, but because it was meant to be seared it wasn't flavored much, but since it was too cooked when we ate it, it tasted very bland. Definitely something I would try again when done right, to see it would have been. With every other dish done pretty well, it was a feeing of sadness more than disappointment.",4,0,4

No conversation as to yes we do have availability or come with me or anything. I asked the hostess, are we supposed to follow her? Yes! she quipped. 
So anyway we are seated at a 2 top near the entrance and was handed a iPad type thing and told we could look at and order drinks from that and we were also handed a menu?!?!? Ok we are at a Small 2 top where do I sit this thing down? A minute or two after that a server named Richard approached and was very gracious and reviews the drinks and menu with us and another server brought some olive spread and some olives and bread that were very good.  Things were turning around because of the server. We ordered flat bread with figs and prosciutto. It was very good and served hot and the thin bread was fresh and tasty. I ordered the scallop with risotto and it was very good in flavor but the risotto rice was still s little hard. My husband ordered to pasta special and it was cooked well but I didn't care for it, had a cinnamon like flavor that overpowered the light tomato sauce. The man at the table next to us orders the same thing as my husband and the portion size was totally different as well as the sauce. His was very dark with sauce while my husbands was lightly covered, so some inconsistency there.

-Beef carpaccio: This thing is huge and really good. It was actually my first time trying beef carpaccio so I don't really have anywhere else to compare to, but it was good!
-Scallops: Our waiter recommended this dish so I got it. The scallops were very fishy smelling and tasting. So i did not like it too much.

The basket of bread and the olive tapenade were excellent... not your standard rolls and butter.

The rest of the review might be skewed though... and I was 3 martinis in by the time the entree hit :-)

The tuna app was perfect all around.  The ribeye was actually one of the most flavorful I have had.  It was a touch over medium for my taste, but it was fairly thin so harder to tell medium.  The balsamic glaze was perfect with it as well.  For desert, I had the chocolate cake with the hot chocolate center (forget the name... still a big hung over).  It was alright... it would be a skip next time.  The coffee was good though, so that made up some points for dessert!

I've been going there for several years, and I have never had anything less than an exceptional cheeseburger at Olives, and by ""exceptional"" I mean PERFECT. Long after this civilization has fallen they will still tell tales of the Olives burger over camp fires and in space craft

Start with the braised squid and octopus app, which was just sick--even if you don't like octopus, you will love this--the dish was transcendent--Enough about the seafood---- strap in for a burgergasm.

The meat is a proprietary blend with the perfect grind and pressure applied when forming the large patties.  Med rare is the only way to go, and they always nail it. The burger had a perfect, salty crust and just juicy enough to saturate the bun without overloading it.  The meat to bun ratio was so precise, that the very last bite left my fingers dry with a cohesive bite of meat and bun which had the same mouth feel as the first.

    * Perfect, deep, grilled sear.
    * Seasoned inside and out.
    * Toasted, moist brioche bun.
    * Dry aged rib and sirloin fat cut back in for added flavor and moisture.

I was probably trying to impress him with my total indifference to carbs.  But here we are, a few years later, about to be married and I pretty much attacked that bread basket.  Onion focaccia, garlicy-cheesy crisp things, and spiced up dinner rolls.  I was in heaven!

We ate more than just bread - we shared the Calimari which was somewhat more salad-like than just regular calimari.  I thought the sauces were very good and ate more of the sauces\/dressing and the greens than actual calimari. 

He ordered a shrimp pasta dish that had some Asian flavors going on.  I think it was the pea shoots that I eat on other dishes, but it kind of threw me.  A very saucy dish, but good.

I had the Olives burger which I had my eye on from our last visit. The glazed balsamic onion was a nice addition and the burger itself was really juicy.  Combined with the greasy bun it made for a somewhat messy burger - and that sauced up onion was sliding all over the place!

We had very good service and it was a nice way to end an awesome weekend in Vegas!",0,0,0

I had tried to make my reservation on the restaurant website but it said I had to call.  I should have done it through OpenTable b\/c I never have problems with them.  The concierge had told me the dress was business casual and men cannot wear shorts, but when we were seated, I saw plenty of men wearing shorts, so that was a little irritating. 

Our dinner was great though!!!  I had ordered a dirty martin, but there was barely any olive juice in it, so I asked for more on the side.  For our appetizer, we got the charcuterie board, which was so good!!  The pickles were the best part!! They also give you really good bread and olive tapenade which was excellent.

For my entree, I had the seafood risotto, which was so good.  I probably shouldn't have eaten all the bread because I was getting really full, but I managed to eat almost all of my entree.  I also tried the tenderloin which was excellent!!  My friends also ordered the scallops for their meal, which they say was really good as well!!

We were really full for dessert, but we were celebrating a birthday, so we somehow ordered 3 desserts for 5 people!!  They did put a candle on one of the desserts, so that was nice.  
We tried the banana tiramisu, the chocolate peanut butter lava cake and the cookie butter creme brulee.  All of which were wonderful!!!!  We couldn't stop eating even though we were so stuffed!!!!

Went here for dinner on Sat 2\/15 and while the patio was already full (I had a 5:30p reso for a week now), asked to be seated as close to the windows as possible so my parents could have a view of the fountains. Cha-ching! Request granted. Our server, Rick, and myself made great rapport and the entire staff was on top of it during our dinner. Had the malbec - definitely recommend it. The free bread is delicious and they give you as many refills as you want (the onion bread is my favorite). We also had the lobster mac & cheese & the Portobello flatbread, both recommended and both customer favorites. Dad had the chicken, and while he loved it, he was (happily) surprised by the huge portion. Mom had ravioli sans sausage and said it was delish. I had the chilean sea bass and it was perfect!

I think I set my expectations too high because I enjoy Todd's other restaurants so much (Kingfish and Tuscany) But after having an amazing meal the night before at Scarpetta i realized that Todd English cannot shake a stick at Scott Conant and maybe that makes me biased. 

Service-
From hostess and waiter; TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE. You should be ashamed of yourselves, your water guy\/ busser out shined you by far. I wish I could remember your name but man oh man get your head out of your ass and serve the people!

Food-
Bread and olive tempanade was terrific. But that's where the meal fizzled. The scallops and risotto was over ambitious and the Diver scallops we FAR from fresh.
The waiter only said 3 words the whole night and two of them were Tuna Tar tare. Well i have 2 words for you buddy: TRY AGAIN. It was lacking texture, flavor and complexity you would expect from a $30 appetizer. That's all I have to say about that.

Ambiance- Ehh romantic efforts with obnoxious tourist loudness

Overall- Wont be back, Todd sorry you didn't win my heart over this time.",7,3,2

We settled for a table by the window and beyond the dark interior and the pillars in our way, I caught snippets of the show, especially when the fountains spouted high.

The food at Olives is good, but not enough for me to remember what I had the first time around.  This second time, I had the tuna tartare and the roast chicken.  G had the roast squid and octopus and the chicken sausage flatbread.  I would have to say the appetizers were better than the entrees.

The days Starter special: applewood smoked Seared sea scallop on pork belly. Served on top of bean-ish things with a strange sticky but yummy jam thing outlining it. Next to this was a blob of green fluffed stuff with nuts on top - NO flavor. I think it was supposed to be whipped avocado something or other but really the only reason I can fathom it being there was for something green on the dish. Overall this was very good but I got a few very salty bites.

The butternut squash tortellonini (sp?) (NOT tortellini - this was a long thin crepe like noodle). With sage in butter and nutmeg sauce. YUM, like dessert on my plate. SO rich in fact, I had to take half home with me (FYI its good room temp too). They gave me this awesome take home bag and utensil kit (wet wipe and toothpick included) too.

And even though we did not sit outside (it was 8 pm and still way too hot), we still had a pretty good view of the Bellagio fountain which was great.

So bottom line, if you want to sit outside and experience the fountain up close then definitely make the wait and sit out on the patio.  If you just  want a delicious meal, with air conditioning and a semi great view of the fountain, sit indoors. You will not regret it.

The worst part is the service. I was with a large group so gratuity was already included with our meal. Our server was not attentive at all. Took forever to come and take our drink and food orders and he was incredibly rude! He made it seem like it was a bother when asked for recommendations or any questions for that matter. He was actually very passive aggressive. It was almost like he didn't care about how he served us since he knew he was already getting a good tip. We complained to a manager and he didn't seem to care either. The food itself was very disappointing. But to be honest I can't even remember clearly because I was too upset about the server to even enjoy my meal. I'm giving two stars because the view is amazing and I would only give this place another chance if I were to go with a smaller party.,0,0,0

I was here with a group of 10 (had a reservation) so a decent sized table but nothing that should have caused issues. When we were seated, our host ordered apps for the table. They arrived....45 minutes later. I mean - it was a cheese board, carpaccio and a flatbread most of which can literally be thrown on a plate. Not cool. On the plus side, if you are a carpaccio person, the Olives version is really good. 

Most of us enjoyed wine service from an extensive (and expensive) list. The one person who ordered a drink was forgotten and our server had to be reminded. Twenty minutes later, her drink arrived. Mind you - the restaurant was not full and the bar had maybe 10 people at it. 

So, on to entrees. I had the agnolotti which had lovely flavors and would have been delightful had it not been served cold. The Parmesan garnish was completely unmelted. If I hadn't been a guest, it would have gone right back. One person received the wrong dish altogether and two others ordered the salmon which was advertised as coming with broccolini, yet green beans appeared. When questioned, our server checked and sheepishly reported that it now comes with beans. Fine - then update the menu and\/or train your servers!!

By the time we received our entrees, the table behind us (same size, seated after us) had already paid and departed so not everyone had issues that night. 

Olives charges fine dining prices ($40-50 entree prices) so I'm going to hold them to a fine dining standard. A mistake or two is completely understandable but my experience was that neither the front it back if the house had their shit together. Our server was really nice, thus the second star.

If I'm paying $80 per person I will only give it 5 star if it outperforms other similarly priced joints.  I think that's much more useful for people browsing the site for advice.  I've been to lots and lots of Michelin star-ed places so I know the kind of quality you can get for these ""high"" prices.  

So after being disappointed by Bouchon @ Venetian the night before its on to the next one ... Olives @ Bellagio.  I went there based on the rare 4 star average Yelp rating.

First impression wise both the decor and service are not Michelin star worthy while the prices are.  Not surprising that this restaurant hasn't seen a star yet.  Like this it never will.

The bread was brought out with some olives and two types of spread that are given lots of props by reviews on Yelp.  The bread was good, but again not spectacular.  Some pieces were too salty.  The spreads are NOTHING to rave about.  We can all go to the grocery store and buy the exact same spreads on the cheap.  Not impressed in the least..  I rather have higher end bread with nice butter.  Better bread for example can be found @ Spago's in LA.  It was also much better @ Bouchon.

We started out with the Kobe Beef Tartare.  This was solid though I've had better meat tartare in other places.  For example the Lamb based one @ Gilt in NY is top notch.  If nobody told me it was Kobe I would have never noticed.

Then came the Calamari that was recommended by the waiter.  Let me say this clearly ... DO NOT GET THIS.  The calamari are too heavily battered and both the batter and the sauce are VERY salty.  I asked the waiter and he said it is *a little* on the salty side.  As I ate the stuff with my girlfriend we concluded that it tastes exactly like ... marinated olives.  Horrible.  It was on a bed of arugula which I enjoyed.  But in general it actually made me a bit sick.

For entrees I got a mushroom fettuccine and my girlfriend got the Chilean seabass.  

The fettuccine was a HUGE portion.  Just unnecessary.  I enjoyed the dish but for the price it doesn't cut it.  The sauce was too thin and the pasta was clearly slightly overcooked.  Again no Michelin stars here.

The Chilean was also enjoyable but not price worthy.  I can get a much better plate in LA for about 1\/3 less.

Then since it was getting late we got moved to the patio for coffee and a tiramisu.  The coffee was fine.  Didn't stand out but it never does in America.  Maybe in Paris or in Italy.  The tiramisu was low grade, but I didn't care because it is SO nice at the patio.  Watching the water shows is a great experience.

My advice here is go somewhere else.  I haven't found THE stop in Las Vegas yet but I'm still hunting so watch my future reviews.

If you do want to go here then INSIST on sitting on the patio.  Just wait however long is necessary.  It is worth it.  I'll be @ Picasso (2 Michelin stars) later in the week and I'll definitely wait for a patio table.",1,0,0

Loved the ambience, the food was above average and the view of the fountains was worth the tab, for sure.  Cocktails were overpriced for their size (not surprised, being the strip and all) food textures a bit mushy but flavored nicely.  The fig & prosciutto flatbread is generous in size, but the base bread is rather floppy and soft, at least it was in our night.  My biggest disappointment was the noise level...off the charts loud.  It's definitely not an intimate dining experience although it looks that way.  Seating is super close and tight, but I get why with the need for maximum revenue for a prime locale.

If you can handle a wait for a patio table (or get there just before they open), DO IT! So lovely to dine next to the fountains. My advice is to have a big, late breakfast (buffet anyone?), skip lunch (or have a snack) and hit Olives as soon as they open at 5:00 to snag an outside table. You'll be able to walk off dinner, or hit a show. Then you'll be just hungry enough to have another snack somewhere before calling it a night. 

The service is always top notch. Before appetizers, a love duo of olive tapenade (with some whole olives in between) is delivered to the table. We always order the beef carpaccio. It's HUGE and delicious. On our last trip, I was pregnant, so I couldn't enjoy the carpaccio, but watched my husband devour it with fury. The steak is great, but my favorite entree are the scallops with mushroom risotto. We ordered the peanut butter lava cake for dessert last time, and while it was truly delectable, it was a bit rich and could have used a scoop of ice cream or gelato.

Buuuuut I got distracted by the Olives burger with Truffle Cheese and Truffle Fries!  Woops lol...at least I was able to sample off it!

To start, the Complimentary bread. Good stuff in here, but it's amazing with the fresh olive spread!  Before coming here, I've never had enjoyable olives...just not my thing I guess, but I enjoyed most of these very much!  Yum :D

First course, Cantaloupe Soup: Almonds and Minted Creme Fraiche. I like cantaloupe, but not really in soup form. Not overly sweet though, just not for me.

Second course, Grilled Skirt Steak: Italian Sausage Mashed Potatoes, Roasted Brussels Sprouts, and Pinot Noir Reduction with Watercress. This was good, but not a very tender cut in the first place. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes with the sausage inside though! 

And for me, Olives Burger ($21): Truffle Cheese, Caramelized Red Onions, and Truffle Fries (+$3). First burger came out MW, sent it back and got a perfect MR. Initial juices pour out front\/back, truffle cheese has a tasty bite, and the caramelized onions added a nice crunch! The truffle fries were very good, with lots of truffle oil.  One of the better burgers you will find in Vegas!

And to finish, Coconut Caramel Cake: Chocolate Malt Ice Cream and Coconut Brittle. Yummy! Imagine a coconut macaroon cake with a rich chocolate ice cream on top.  MmmmMmm good :)

We sat outside to enjoy the view and Bellagio fountains, but the fountains weren't working that day! Would have been a great view of them at the patio tables. Loved all the little birds flying around, looking for snacks.  They weren't pestering though, and added a nice touch to the beautiful day.

Service was a little off...soup got served without a spoon.  Waters went empty couple times, and my first burger was overcooked, but overall my experience was good, and the burger and fries were great!

The food (lunch menu) was mediocre and the prices did not reflect the poor quality of food. We were seated on the patio and met business colleagues for lunch. It took forever to get our servers attention so that we could place our order. If I didn't catch her eye when I did, I think my only option would have been to throw the menus off the patio and into the water in hopes of getting somebody to come by. Once she did acknowledge us, she was pleasant and attentive enough. 

I had the North Atlantic Sea Scallop which came with mushroom risotto. The risotto was very bland and scallops were adequate, but by no means mind blowing or even in the top 5 of my favorite scallop dishes. My husband had the beef tenderloin, and after sampling it, I'd say it was around 3.5 stars. The other two members of the party had grilled chicken breast and ricotta ravioli. I am guessing they enjoyed it, but not having sampled them, I can't comment on the dishes. 
The bill ended up clocking in at around $110 without any drinks or appetizers. I would be ok with this if the food and service were not one step above Applebee's quality.
My husband assures me that dinner here is actually good, but having not tried it, I can't say. I did see many people ordering the flatbreads, so perhaps that's the lunch item to shoot for.

If you get there early you can sit on the patio area and have an amazing view of the water show.

I'm not a big meat eater in general, but their Beef Carpaccio is a must for an appetizer to share.  My family and friends like to share everything when we eat out, so I would say I have tried most of the menu at this point.   Their pastas are delicious.  The pasta with truffle shavings was tasty and so was the shrimp & cheese gnocchi.   The rib-eye is best medium rare so if it comes more cooked send it back.   Our waiter Rust took care of it right away.  My friend said she thought it was just as tasty as Kobe beef in Japan!  The scallops are great too.  Oh, the bread basket and olive spreads are fantastic!  Be careful not to eat too much of it because it will fill you up fast.   Also, save room for at least a tasty white chocolate key lime truffle. Yum!
  
The wine list is incredible with many boutique wines such as Williams Selyem.  They will not allow you to bring wine that is on their list for corkage so double check when you call.   The Sommelier came out to greet us and she helped us pair a great dessert wine with their foie gras dish.   We met the head chef too!  What a young and accomplished guy.  The restaurant manager even came by the table and said hi to us.   The service was fantastic and if you experienced any less just let them know.   Our server Rust took great care of us.

I was very impressed. The meal was not haute cuisine or anything very experimental (in fact the dishes seemed addressed to a wide audience) but it was one of the most satisfying meals I can remember. Let me echo Yelpers' praise of the butternut squash tortelli, which is so heavenly that I can't imagine that I will ever see this classic being done any better.

A friendly waiter with cool wraparound glasses took charge of our table for the evening, which had a fine view of the Bellagio fountain which had the unfortunate accompaniment of a Lee Greenwood song. The waiter was very knowledgeable and hospitable, even offering to split my pasta dish so that we try a few varieties. Started us off with some cocktails, which initially struck me as pricey but after a couple more days in Vegas seemed like a rare bargain. Nice varied breadbasket with olive and walnut tapenades. Ordered a beet and watercress salad special with port and bleu cheese dressing, which was original and outstanding. Continued with sea bass, which was excellent but not transcendent, and the unforgettable tortelli, which though half the price of the meat options was better. The desserts were also excellent; English seems to have downplayed the complexity of the desserts (I have the Olives desserts cookbook, which demands about a day's work per confection) a little, though not to their detriment. The ""Triflin' Drunk"" is an alcohol-and-chocolate eightball. The tangerine creme brulee was a bit easier on the tummy but equally delicious.

Highly recommended. Reasonably affordable (we paid around $60 per person for a three-course meal with the lower-priced entrees and one cocktail apiece).",2,1,1

* Sweet Potato Apple Soup - i didn't had any, but it must be really good since my friend chowed it all up and did not mention how tasty it was until it was all gone
* Carpaccio - the presentation does not look good, but the more i eat, the tastier it gets and i could not get enough of it
* Souffle - it tastes as good as any good souffle.  u probably want your own if u love dessert because it is like eating air
* Double Cut Pork Chop - impressive presentation & ginormous portions compared to other dishes.  moist, a bit fatty and charred with a slightly sweet sauce that is somewhat like the chinese ""char siu"" sauce

The minute the restaurant opened, there were people steadily streaming in, and we were lucky enough to be right next door and slipped in to grab a window table with no reservation. Service was prompt and considerate, if a little absent towards the end because of the full house. 

Freshly squeezed grapefruit juice:
(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=AXdkmCKI1Ecjo4FQgIAFhQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
Albeit a tad on the pricey side, definitely freshly squeezed. It was a nice refreshing start to the evening, and it paired well with the dishes later on in the meal.

Complimentary bread basket and trio of olives and spreads:
(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=HJqGN2P4gzy8WU73s8cVEw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=Eh4exgjM4Oyo-gh4gMYp2w&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
I wasn't a huge fan of the rolls, but I thought that the flattened sesame pie-sheets (definitely not their proper name..) went incredibly well with the olives and spreads. I could taste the freshness of the toasted sesame seeds, and the spreads were perfectly seasoned and mixed to a creamy pulp. 

Grilled squid and octopus:
(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=FCD_yLBMl1v9Xh5rhbbcFg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
I can't remember the last time I had such tender squid and octopus. The seafood in this dish was cooked absolutely perfectly and suffered no hint of rubberiness. The portion was generous, and the seasoning was spot-on; there was a good balance of richness and tanginess which kept the dish from being too heavy. If I had to be nitpicky, I'd have preferred a different presentation, but the overall dish was more than enough to offset the plating.

Chilean sea bass with cannellini beans, broccolini, and watercress:
(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=L1KH45eB2WicaUr1kgp3Rg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
Like others have mentioned, the sea bass was cooked incredibly well. The meat was flaky and tender, which paired well with the soft cannellini beans. I understand the contrasts of the broccolini and watercress, but I felt that the greens were a bit disjointed in flavoring compared to the sea bass and beans. The broccolini on our plate was also a tad undercooked. 

Mushroom pappardelle with mushroom medley and lemony pea shoots:
(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=nqUMOBmQxSU7hpZRleIOjg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
When our server recommended this dish to us, we were initially hesitant, but I am so glad we listened to him. The pappardelle was so freshly made that I could still taste the fragrance of rolled flour, and it had the perfect thickness and cook. The mushroom medley was also fragrant without tasting too much like mushroom (if you know what I mean.. sometimes the occupants of the fungi kingdom can be a bit too pungent). I would order this dish again in a heartbeat, and I can't remember the last time I was that excited about a pasta dish.

I'm looking forward to my next visit to Las Vegas just for the grilled squid and octopus dish as well as the mushroom pappardelle entree..",10,7,10

For the appetizers, we had the Tuna Carpaccio, Grilled Squid & Octopus, and some kind of steamed mussels dish. The Tuna Carpaccio and Grilled Squid & Octopus were good, but nothing spectacular. As for the mussels, a couple of them were not even open and for the few that I had, there was this really unpleasant taste that lingered in my mouth. I've never had mussels with that kind of foul taste before... ugh.
As for the entr√©es, speaking for everyone at my table, the resounding feedback? Too salty. 
My brother, who ordered the Chicken Margherita since it was one of the ""Chef's Selections"", could not even finish his food. My sister, who ordered the Ricotta Ravioli, liked the ravioli, but said that the sauce was way too salty. My father, who seemed the most satisfied with his dish, had the Beef Fillet, and my mother had the Spaghetti Alle Vongole, which she thought was okay. I had the scallops, and the worst part of the dish was not the extremely salty rubber scallops, but rather the crunchy... undercooked risotto.

Next, came the entrees...I ordered the almond-crusted swordfish with a lobster vinaigrette and boyfriend ordered the sea scallops.  I nearly died when I had that first bite of swordfish.  Holy Cow.  I was in food-induced shock.  The swordfish ate like a steak, and the layer of almond slivers on top went perfectly with it.  Combine that with a sort of potato salad drenched in this lobster vinaigrette with chunks of lobster meat.  Jesus.  Words can't explain how perfect, it was.  Also- the portion was huge.  More than enough to supplement for the fact that boyfriend's sea scallops were meh.  They were cooked perfectly, but the raisin sauce over it was way too sweet.  We were able to split the swordfish and both be satisfied.

Our waiter came to us several times during the meal was really friendly and extremely courteous.  When he suggested dessert, we were enticed, so we ordered the trio of sorbets.  Our waiter asked if we would like to take dessert on the veranda, and we were more than happy to accept!

I think they can get pretty busy here during peak dining hours so I would encourage you to make a reservation.  We did so using OpenTable.

Olives has indoor seating as well as patio seating.  You can also choose to sit by the bar.  The indoor area is very relaxing with little overhead lighting letting the natural light from the patio serves as the main source.  The outdoor area is great as well seating around 10 or so groups\/tables.  There were large parties as well as just couples dining outside.  This is probably the best place to eat as you will be able to see the Bellagio Fountain Show during dinner.  This area is kept very cool with umbrellas and misters throughout.  

I would say this place is pretty formal in terms of attire.

The menu and service here are great with a nice selection of flatbreads.  They provide you with a drink and dessert menu that is presented through an iPad.  A very modern way of dining and a definite need at more venues.  Service was prompt but not overbearing allowing us to dine at our own pace.

 Most people ordered the ""Olive's Hamburger"" - heard rave reviews!

So if you're not in for a messy lunch, skip this! Hamburger ($20 w\/truffle cheese. $16 w\/o truffle cheese). Some ordered the chicken breast ($20) and was very disappointed. The amount of food, especially compared to the hamburger was about 1\/2. It was a single chicken breast on top of a pureed potato? And some veges. The worst part was that the chicken was SUPER dry. I had a bite and did not want any more :( Those that ordered the chicken breast had to steal bread or fries from others! I ordered the special pasta of the day. It was a sword fish and shrimp pasta in red sauce ($23. and WOW. I know i had the best plate in our table. It was delicious. Everything was cooked really well.

It was the perfect Vegas dinner for my sister and I, who dreamed of having a view of the Bellagio fountain shows while we ate. Well, we got THE BEST view.

I made a reservation for 6 on a Thursday night, thinking that might be early enough to score a seat on the patio. We showed up and asked about it, and the hostess told us we could come back in 45 mins and they would try. Cool, it was pretty early for dinner anyway and we wanted to see the conservatory and lobby exhibits, so we did that and came back as requested. 

We were immediately seated at the best table on the patio, front and center along the lake. The sun had just set and other diners quickly filled in the spaces around us. Several people asked us how we scored that table. We felt so fancy!

Our server, Paul, was the best. He was charming and friendly and insisted on taking several photos of us throughout the dinner. We got some great shots to capture this wonderful memory together. We had appetizers, entrees, cocktails, and dessert, so we stayed about an hour and a half - during which we saw 8 or 9 different fountain shows. Amazing!

Oh, I suppose you want to hear about the FOOD? Hmm, ok. It was spectacular, too. I was actually surprised at the level of quality everything was, AND reasonably priced. Our tab was under $100! We loved everything:
- Bread & olives starter (free)
- Two huge cocktails
- Brick oven roasted chicken entr√©e
- Fig & prosciutto flatbread (also huge, about 8"" x 12"")
- Molten chocolate cake
- Dessert coffee cocktail

I love the breads and olive tapenades that come before the meal! I'm especially fond of the chocolate bread....it has a slight sweetness while still retaining a traditional ""bread and butter"" taste.

The highlights: 
The beef carpaccio was delicious and fresh, paired nicely with an arugula salad, parmesan shavings, polenta cake, and balsamic reduction. 
Chilean Sea Bass with wild mushroom risotto and sauteed spinach was cooked perfectly! 
And their desserts were to die for! I usually find that if a restaurant does their savory foods extremely well, their desserts end up lacking. I almost always order dessert when I'm dining out. And I can say that I am IN LOVE with Olive's hazelnut souffle! Baked perfectly with dramatic height it is paired with the most delicious type of creme anglaise. 


The overall dining experience was so perfect that we made reservations for dinner the next night, but the second time we sat outside with the view of the Bellagio fountain.

I ordered the Lobster Fettuccine which I don't see on the yelp version of their dinner menu (Perhaps it needs updating...). It tasted very good and had what I thought to be unique flavors. The dish was the perfect size for a meal for me, not to big nor too small. 

The reason I could not give 5 stars and had to settle with 4 stars is because I felt like we were slightly rushed. Maybe because it wasn't perhaps as big of a check as maybe there was hope for.

There is a very warm and welcoming yet sophisticated feel in Olives.

We sat at a small romantic size table and had the most soft spoken yet confident waitress who gave us the most perfect service. In her beautiful accent she explained items not on the menu and recommended a cocktail for us. She was never unattentive and never over attentive.

       How come I've never written a review here? One of the most decorated, respected, and charismatic chefs in the world, Todd English has enjoyed a staggering number of accolades during his remarkable career. Also to his credit, English has authored the critically acclaimed cookbooks, The Olives Table, The Figs Table and The Olives Dessert Table published by Simon & Schuster. He's been in countless television shows, publications, and what not.

     This Las Vegas offering of a Todd English favorite features a Mediterranean-style experience set against the breathtaking backdrop of Lake Bellagio. House-made pastas, steaks, rotisserie dishes, brick oven pizzas and sommelier-recommended wines complement the dining atmosphere. If you get a patio table during lunch time here, it's so nice to watch the water show at the Bellagio Fountain. 

   A charming and handsome talented chef, however, you will rarely catch him here because Executive Sous Chef Abraham Aguilar is the one in charges here daily. However, chef Todd English is usually here during some of the food and wines events, and you will surely catch him. He's quite a nice gentleman, beside a great chef. 

- Grilled Squid and Octopus - vinaigrette of chickpeas, tomatoes, toasted garlic, parsley - was always a hit.

- Beef Carpaccio - gorgonzola polenta, parmesan, cipollini onions, balsamic reduction, scallion cream, garlic aioli is a MUST ORDER

- Flatbread - Fig & Prosciutto rosemary crust, sweet & sour fig jam, gorgonzola, prosciutto di parma - delicious.

- Spicy PEI Mussels - charred tomatoes, green onions, fresh jalape√±os, garlicky chablis emulsion, capellini pasta, basil oil, herbed crostini - is always 1 of my FAV here. 

- Braised Lamb Shank - stewed french lentils, wilted kale, natural lamb jus, rosemary sprig - probably 1 of the BEST on the strip, if not the the best.

      I love coming here for lunch more than dinner, the vibe, the water show, the good service, and the consistent of the food, very reasonable price point for the strip, and all the top notch boutiques around here, perfect spot for a shopping break, as if I have any money left from donating to the tables.

For three girls, we had two appetizers and split a less expensive bottle of red wine and it came to around $100 before tip. A good value for excellent food, service and a great show.

As young girls on a budget, we chose the cheapest red wine on the menu and the server - a lovely older gentlemen was nice enough to point out that it wasn't a typical wine and doesn't have much flavor so he gave us a sample. Definitely the blandest red wine I've ever had. We were so grateful that the server was looking out for his guests rather the check average. Or at least it seemed so. So we ordered his recommendation, a wine only a few dollars more.

As for the food - ordered the beef tartare and the fig and proscuitto flatbread. The beef tartare was very good, but the flatbread was out of this world amazing. So simple, but the ingredients went so well together.

Twice for lunch, once for dessert, and once for drinks.  Each time this place did not disappoint.  It's located just inside the Bellagio, near all of the shops that sell things which very few people can afford.  They do have a small, but nice outdoor patio.  They have big umbrellas and misters to help you avoid the heat.  It has a nice view of the fountain show if you eat out there at night.

I tried several different things while I was here:  Caesar salad, complimentary bread, gnocchi, cheeseburger and fries, rasberry mojito, and some cookie ice cream sandwiches.  Everything I had was really good.  Lots of good flavors in all of their dishes.  They're also big on presentation, which I like as well.  I probably liked the cheeseburger and fries the best.  It was full of flavor, and it was huge.  I don't think you could go wrong with most anything on the menu, though.  It's probably better to come here for lunch, as everything is a little cheaper.

Yes, the name is part of the title of the restaurant, that's how you know where to eat when you're in Vegas.  Mina has like five (including a Nobhill gastro-pub).  Our seats were amazing, because we sat on the outdoor marbled terrace, looking out onto the strip across the Bellagio fountains.

It's all pretty over the top, they give you 2 napkins (?!) for some reason, and pour your order of a glass of wine from its own little beaker.

We dined on grilled calamari and chick pea dressing, which was delicious, probably the best chickpeas I've had in a long time, and an enormous portion.

I love restaurant roasted chickens, I might even have a problem with it, because it keeps me from ordering other things.

First off, I have to absolutely recommend the peach Bellini.  I usually don't like this kind of mixed drink..I'm more of a wine\/Champagne or vodka gimlet girl, but I just could not resist when I read the description - sparkling wine and peach puree..SOOO GOOD!

My memory is a little hazy on what my bf ordered, but I ordered the Olive burger.  I know, I was thinking it would be too heavy, but how can you resist a burger that comes with a balsamic glazed onions and PARMESAN FRIES (I am in a deep french fries obsession).  It was no short of amazing.

Decor-wise, the place is beautiful as well.  It also has an outdoor seating area which I'm looking forward to sitting at when we go back for dinner.

The only reason why I cannot give this place 5 stars is because of their carpaccio.  It was horrid.  They pile on so much carpaccio onto your plate, it looks unappetizing..I feel like carpaccio is something that should be presented  in a way that portrays how delicate it is...I found out, there really can be too much carpaccio.  And I do recall, it started to taste a little gamey and it seemed to be sliced a little thick - my bf and I really really did not enjoy this dish.

The oysters were pretty unappetizing...couldn't really tell if they were supposed to be raw on the half shell or baked? Kinda confusing..and the taste didnt make up for its looks.  I dont recommend ordering the oysters at all!! (Then again, what do expect when you come from the coast to eat in the desert)

Remember the pizza dough challenge with Mario Batali?  Unfortunately, the judges weren't impressed because he lost that challenge. 

The restaurant's airy and open layout, leather seats and dark lacquer tables, available patio seating by the Bellagio fountains lend to its low-key elegance, but I wasn't impressed with the dishes we had here. 

Fortunately, it's restaurant week in Vegas (similar to Dine about Town in SF with prix fixe menus offered at reasonable prices). Part of the cost of your meal is donated to Three Square, an organization that is committed to eliminating hunger in Southern Nevada.  The prix fixe for dinner is $50.09.

We started with a lobster cocktail served with a yellow tomato puree and horseradish vinaigrette.  The lobster was fresh, while the sauce was boring. 

For our entrees, bf had the grilled hangar steak with garlicky broccoli rabe, lentil and grain chili with cucumber raita.  The raita was a refreshing touch. The steak, cooked medium rare, was chewy.  That's probably attributed to the cut instead of the cooking method. 

My butternut squash ravioli is free-from shaped, cooked in browned butter, sage and topped off with lots of parmesan cheese.  I like the contrast of the sweetness of the squash with the saltiness of the cheese. 

Surprisingly, dessert wasn't disappointing.  We shared a chocolate trifle made with dark chocolate pudding, Bailey's white chocolate ganache, a sliver of a double chocolate cookie crunch topped off with vanilla bean ice cream.   Absolutely rich, absolutely no complaints.

Service was slow at the beginning but got better later on.  Friendly waiter and efficient bussers.  The lag time between dishes is long, but the bread basket and olive tapenade proved to be good distractions while waiting.

Thanks to restaurant week, the cost of dinner didn't hurt the wallet as much.  I don't think I want to pay full price for food that is less than stellar.

No such luck; all the fountain-view tables are wait-list only, meaning, you show up for your reservation and just wait.  Our reservation was for 9:30, and they informed us upon arrival that since it was so late, and they already had a long wait list for outside, there was no chance we were getting one.  Bummer!  I thought our chance might be better with a late reservation, so heed my warning.  We did get a decent booth with a view of the water.  I like that this restaurant has a casual dress code, but maybe they go a bit too far; the guy at the next table was attired in a wife-beater and shorts (9:30 on a Sunday night).  The bread was yummy, and more like a dessert - white chocolate walnut rolls!  We shared a shrimp scampi flatbread and it was too heavy\/creamy so we just picked off the shrimp.  For my main I had the Chilean Seabass - this was incredible!  I loved the whole dish, and the portion was huge.  DH had the Ribeye and enjoyed it.  For dessert we had cookies and ice cream - yum :)  We also ordered the Falling Out cake, but it was too liquidy and rich, with too little ice cream (one tiny scoop) to accompany it, so we ended up not really eating it.  Overall, the restaurant was just okay.  Although the seabass was delicious, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, especially without a fountain view.  The tables are too crowded together; we got lucky with the booth, but most of the tables are lined up with inches between them.

Chef Todd's beef tartare is truly the best creation ever. A platter of thinly sliced prime over a bed of crisp greens and polenta.

It's pretty classy looking but you won't feel too out of place with jeans and a t-shirt (although I was amused with the people dressed more than business casual with young kids in tow dressed as young kids tend to dress - I'm sure that's their normal weekend getup and I am nowhere near that fancy).  Reservations are recommended but we got a table for 2 right away at around 1:00 PM.  

I really really wanted to try out some appetizers but we skipped them because we knew there wouldn't be room.  The flatbreads that other tables had were looking really tasty.  If I go back, I'd be willing to just go all appetizers for a meal, pick a little bit here and a little bit there, but that's for another trip.  

The wine list is extensive (the Bellagio boasts thousands of wines and tens of thousands of bottles, so it was expected but still impressive to see).  The cocktail list is full of the usual trends these days, which wasn't appetizing to me (although I did get some simple cocktail with cognac, cointreau, ginger ale, and some other things which was pretty good).  They had a very tasty sangria that had the perfect amount of brandy.  

They give you table bread at the beginning, which was really good.  There was some onion bread, normal bread, and sesame seed cracker things and it was served with some green olive tapenade, black olive tapenade, and a few special olives outside of your normal black and greens.  Really tasty, although in my mind it's very hard to go wrong with bread and olive tapenade. 

My meal was the chicken and vegetable lasagna.  It came out in a cylinder, like a lasagna stack or something, and was more like a mix of lasagna ingredients all swirled together than your traditional layered lasagna.  Cream sauce too, instead of tomato-based.  It was awesome.  There was a lot of chicken in big chunks, lots of perfectly done pasta, and all of the veggies gave it a healthy spin.  Nothing was overpowering, proportions were spot-on, and it was overall deliciously tasty.  I got to try the ricotta ravioli, which was also awesome.  The Italian sausage inside had the perfect spicy kick that let you know it was there without needing to search for it and without being too spicy.  The red sauce with that was a good complement.

The price was high, like all of Vegas and especially the Bellagio, but it didn't feel out of place here.  You got what you paid for and you'd be hard-pressed to find the equivalent meal for a lower price anywhere else in the US.   The service was pretty good.  The waitress had a look to her like she was already looking forward to the end of her shift but was still attentive and nice.

I've been to Olives two or three other times and either I'm getting more difficult to please or their food is going downhill because we left a little disappointed. There are still some good items on the menu like the butternut tortelli. Fresh pasta is always amazing and top it off with a wonderfully rich sauce and you'll swear off those crappy Italian chain restaurants for good. Don't forget that you can order half portions of their pastas if you'd like to sample several dishes.

The disappointment started with the beef carpaccio. The serving size is so ridiculously large that it looks unappetizing. There's a huge softball-sized mound under the center of the beef full of greens. The dish is also drowning in sauces that dominate in flavor and all of that wonderful beef flavor is lost. There's just too much going on. The dish is large enough for 4-6 people.

The next disappointment was the ribeye special. The overcooked and bland steak had all the appeal of a choice cut, $2.99 special from your local grocer. They really should have been ashamed of serving that dish. It was one of the worst steaks I've had in a long time.

On a positive note, the view from the patio is gorgeous! If you can get a seat out there you'll be treated to the Bellagio fountains and one of the better views in the city. It can get really hot out there so go early when dining for lunch or late when dining for dinner.

A few tips:
Make reservations and if you don't mind eating a early dinner, make it for 5, that's when dinner starts. You'll for sure get a good window seat or patio seat.
Order a drink, a nice dinner is not complete without a tasty drink. We ordered bellinis and they were perfect.
Don't eat too much bread because the portions are pretty decent. From experience, It was pretty hard for me to stop snacking on the bread and olives. But you want room for their mouthwatering entrees!

The Vegas location is far too often a showplace, a place set up by the casino-hotel to draw in (or keep) patrons by having his (her) name on the door, but with little connection to the famed chef once the menu is approved, the kitchen trained, and first month of operation has passed into history.

(See my write-up of Nobu, as one example; and why go to Bouchon when the original is so [relatively] close to where we live?)

So it was with some trepidation that we boarded the Southwest flight to Las Vegas for my daughter's 12th birthday.  

You know Southwest . . . you get there early, board the plane as part of the ""A"" group, and then wait as the subsequent hoardes of of ""B's"" and ""C's"" crowd the aisles -- moving nowhere, because someone's behind is blocking the aisle as they struggle to squeeze that rolling suitcase that should have been checked anyway into the overhead that's already too full with everyone else's stuff and . . . . 

But I digress.

So I'm sitting in my seat -- the exit row with the extra legroom -- and waiting for everyone to take their seats so we can get this plane in the air, when I look up from my in-flight magazine with the spiffy articles, and who do I see standing in the aisle in front of me?  Celebrity chef Todd English.  OK, I've been to Boston; I liked the original Olive's and Fig's.  Our eyes meet; I say ""I like your food""; he says ""Thank you,"" and works his way farther back to a free aisle seat.

I ask my wife if she noticed who that was.  ""Who what was?"" one of my daughters says in a gramatically incorrect but clearly understood reply.  ""Todd English,"" I answer.  ""Who?""  ""Todd English,"" I repeat, as if saying it again makes it any clearer.  ""Oh,"" my youngest daughter says, ""I saw the name on the shirt, but I thought that was the designer -- you know, like Tommy Bahama.""

(Yes, it's true, Todd English was wearing his black chef's jacket with his name embroidered on it.)

I thumb through the in-flight magazine, find the ad for his New Orleans restaurant ""Riche"" and show the kids his picture.  ""Ooooooh,"" they say simultaneously, suddenly much more interested.  So the wife and I explain who he is, that he was on the original (pilot episode) of Iron Chef America, that he has restaurants in Boston, etc., etc.

About then, the plane pushes back from the gate, the ""talkers"" explain how to buckle a seat belt to all the people who haven't been in an automobile in 30 years, and we take off . . . 

By the time the plane lands, our daughters are psyched up to have dinner at Olive's in the Bellagio, and I call from the airport to see if I can get reservations for dinner that night.  I can.  I do.  And that's that.

We get to the Belagio, and walk the mile and quarter from the Valet to the restaurant, and I give them our name.  We wait for about 10-15 minutes to be shown to our table, and as we walk in, Todd English comes out from around the bar to head off someplace and we nearly bump into each other.  We say hello to each other and shake hands; he looks somewhat surprised to see us; I say, ""Where else would we eat tonight""; he laughs, thanks us, and we go off in two separate directions -- him  to who-knows-where, and us to a gorgeous table outside on a patio overlooking the spectacular water fountains at the Bellagio.

Dinner was delightful.  The service was superb.  The food was fantastic.  The waitstaff was wonderful (even to the extent of taking a picture of the four of us for my daughter's birthday with his cellphone and sending us the picture!).  The sommelier was sorry that the name of the winery I worked for was mispelled on the list.

And for the first time . . . the food I had at a Vegas restauratn was BETTER than I had at the chef's original location.

All I know is that THAT night was magical!",3,3,3

If you sit on the patio you can view the water show but you do get sprayed by the mist.  We didn't want to wait for a table on the patio so we ate inside which was still very nice..and dry!  

To start I had a Slingback which was a ruby red vodka, passion fruit pur√©e, lemon sour and sugar rim. Super yummy. Then we had the fig and prosciutto flatbread which was amazing and the tuna tartare which was okay. 

I had the pan seared halibut with risotto and spinach.  The fish was perfectly cooked and the risotto was creamy and delicious. My friend had the sea scallops which were also perfectly cooked and tasty. 

For dessert we shared the cookie platter and the hazelnut souffl√©.  I didn't eat any of the cookies but the souffl√© was to die for. They bring out the souffle and place the vanilla ice cream in the center and pour as sauce into the center. It all melts together and is super light and airy but creamy. It was definitely worth the 15 minute wait.

The crispy flatbread served with the predinner bread was very yummy.  It had Parmesan cheese baked on it and had a little bit of spice to it.  This was served with a couple olive spreads and olives.  Surprisingly enough I am not an olive fan but the friends I was with said it was very good.  One of the orange olives they said had a mild wonderful taste.  I requested olive oil with balsamic vinegar for my bread and that was promptly brought.

I was trying to decide between butternut squash ravioli and the ricotta filled tortellini. When I said this to Paul he said, ""have half and half"".  Of course I would love that option!  The butternut squash was a warm yummy harvest taste. The filling was so smooth and the perfect amount of sauce was mild and just perfect.  They must have literally made the pasta when I ordered it. The filling was butternut squash not the pasta.  The tortellini was filled with a smooth and wonderful ricotta cheese.  This was not a heavy pasta either.  The marinara sauce was sweet and had finely ground sausage that was lean and wonderful.

Another person in our party had gnocchi.  Some places made big heavy gnocchi.  These were little thumbnail sized gnocchi shells that were light and held the sauce just perfect.   

Oh my goodness, the creme brulee was out of this world and not a tiny little ramekin. We usually get a dessert to share but this was a special occasion and we each got our own and it was just about too much.
 
Perhaps it was circumstantial but we visited on December 14th which is a slower time in Vegas.  There was no wait.  It was a bit chilly to sit outside but we could see the water show from our table.  We were initially seated by a table of loud and obnoxious young men who were business guys with a college mentality.  These guys were not the fault of the restaurant and we requested a table change.

Ordered:

x PORTOBELLO FLATBREAD (wild mushroom pur√©e, herb roasted portobello, red onions, fontina cheese, white truffle oil) - YUMMY. This was my favorite of the night. I LOVEEE portobello mushrooms, so with some truffle oil... game over.
x SMOKED SALMON FLATBREAD (chive whipped potato, shaved red onions, caper cr√®me fra√Æche) - This was good, but I just felt like I was eating a thin lox bagel. Not something I'd order again.
x SPINACH RAVIOLI - I forget what else was in this one, but it was special on the tasting menu and we asked if we could order just that. This ravioli was VERY good. Highly recommend ordering if you're a vegetarian.
x BUTTERNUT SQUASH TORTILLA (brown butter, amaretto cookies, sage, parmesan cheese) - Eh... the sauce was way too sweet for my savory dish. I hate that more than anything in the world. it was well made, but just not made for my tongue.

They serve olives, tapenade, and a bread basket to start. Everything was soooo good! They even had the cheesy bread crisp I love so much from Joe's Seafood at Caesars!!

I don't see why not.  The Fountain alone is amazing to have as a background of a great meal. Todd English's Olives in Bellagio has class and taste, and won't hurt your wallet.  From the interior design, to the food on the plate, everything was balanced and cohesive -- it all felt like they belonged.

Upon making reservations, I was happy to be seated next to the window facing the fountains.  I asked for the tables outside, but there were none available.  In hind sight, eating inside was a better decision. It was warmer, the decor was nice, and I still sat directly next to the fountain.

Complimentary bread and olives (how fitting) was given before our meal.  The bread varied from chiabata and flat breads, and eating it with the olives was tasty.  It was a bit salty, probably because I used too much, but the taste was very clean and pure. It isn't your normal bread and butter -- that's a good thing.

To go along with our bread, we opted for the Beef carpaccio to compliment our appetizer.  Yes, beef carpaccio is raw beef. Never having it before, and knowing they are known for this dish, I was excited.  The beef was fresh and of high quality, as it should be.  The polenta and gorgonzola, and scallion cream gave it a nice creamy texture.  My favorite was the balsamic reduction.  It was sweet and acidic, which helped break up the richness of the beef. The parmesan, cipolini onions, and garlic aioli rounded out the flavors nicely.  It was a great first experience.

Of course, I love prosciutto.  Salted cured meats?  Fatty and buttery deliciousness?  I am there! Their Fig and Prosciutto flat bread is a must order for sweet and salty lovers.  The fig jam was a bit sweet for me and overpowered the Gorgonzola.  Gorgonzola is a pretty salty and strong cheese -- the rosemary crust and the prosciutto di parma was savory.  Maybe a bit more prosciutto, and a bit less figs would have made this perfect.

The butternut squash tortelli was a great dish as well.  The filling was a mixture of amereto cookie and butternut squash.  A bit sweet, but I guess that is the theme of the meal.  The sage and brown butter, with parmasan cheese made a sweet yet savory sauce. It was a perfect balance of sweet and savory.  The outer layer pasta was freshly made and perfectly cooked.  This was one of their signature dishes as well.

For dessert, we got the truffles.  It came in a trio on top of some of the best caramel I have ever had. One truffle in particular had a dark chocolate, coffee filling that was so rich in flavor.  It was a perfect truffle.

Eating all this good food, watching the fountain show, and enjoying it in the comforts of Todd English's Olives was a pleasure.  Yes, the food had a theme of sweet and savory going on, and we did risk the dangers of eating raw beef, but it was all worth it. All that goodness, and to top it with complimentary dessert truffles was a display of exceptional service. Things like this make me happy. Good food with good people in a restaurant with great food.

       Quick tip if you don't want to walk through the casino, the Bellagio has a valet side entrance right on Flamingo and the restaurant is in the door to your left go down I think about three or four shops and it is there on your right, but if your visiting take the main parking in, go through taking the larger walk ways until you get to the shops and then on your way out rather than going left to parking go right and you go directly into the atrium. It doesn't cost any money but it costs the casino millions it is absolutely gorgeous and a ton of work, it always seems to amaze.

Must try:
- Beef carpaccio - I'm a sucker for carpaccio. This carpaccio definitely is number 1 on my list! Gorgonzola rosti cake at the bottom of the thin sliced huge pieces of tender beef, perfect amount of parmesan cheese, cipollini onions with the touch of balsamic reduction. HUGE portion!
- Tuna tartare - it's not my favorite, the portion is much smaller. it's refreshing but too gingery for my taste.  
- Crazy mushroom pappardelle - 4 of our party ordered the same pasta! That should tell you something! king trumpet, shiitake, oyster & crimini mushrooms, english peas, piquillo peppers,parmesan cream, truffle essence, lemony pea shoots... truffle makes this pasta so much more flavorful (yes, I'm a truffle person, I mean, who isn't?!)
- Sea Scallops - truffle whipped yukon potatoes, saut√©ed sea beans, cabernet reduction. The scallops are almost palm sized, the truffle whipped potatoes are delicious with the delicate scallops. The sea beans are top of the scallops are very interesting, never had it before but it adds a crunch\/texture to the dish!
- chocolate hazelnut souffl√©  - we were told that the portion is small, it's actually decent for everyone to have a few bites! It is delicious! perfectly puffed up souffl√© with creamy chocolate hazelnut inside. Who wouldn't love it?

Service - we had an amazing service, even though they were really busy but our waitress was super attentive and kind :)

The saving grace was the fig\/prosciutto flatbread but even that had a few pieces that were burned to the point of being black carbon so we couldn't eat them. Glass of wine: $20. The saving grace was our server, who was professional and pleasant.",0,0,0

We were told that the seating in the bar was open, but the restaurant wasn't open yet. Except every seat at the bar was full. We asked if we could grab a two top table just across from the bar - just to have a place to sit. 

I can't even explain the response we got - and how much of an inconvenience our simple request was. We were told that the bartender wouldn't serve us there, so I offered to order and pay at the bar but still wanted to sit.

We have been staying at the Vdara and have been treated with nothing but respect and gratitude. The run around we got from the staff at Olives and the rude attitudes we received was completely unacceptable. The way that we were treated was so unacceptable - especially for a place that was empty except for the bar seating. They clearly do not care about customer service. We walked straight to the Vdara and received exceptional customer service. I highly recommend avoiding this place if you want to have a good dining experience.",1,2,0

Maybe it was view, maybe it was the food, maybe it was the company, but my party and I started out here before heading out into the night and it was THE perfect way to begin our evening. Having eaten here before in the Bahamas and loving it, I knew this place would not disappoint. Olives is Todd English's take on modern Italian favorites that focus on a more expansive mediterranean forte. 

First off, can we talk about the bread and tapenade? Holy olive oil Batman, oh my goodness is that stuff addicting, I think we ordered 4 or more refills for my party of 4, I could have just snacked on that all night...but I was indulging my whole meal.

For apps I highly recommend the beef carpaccio: gorgonzola polenta, parmesan, cipollini onions, balsamic reduction, scallion cream, garlic aioli. What a pretty dish to look at as well as eat, I think it was on our table for no longer than 60 seconds until it was just an empty plate. According to the server, it was there most popular appetizer, and I can see why, GET IT!

Feeling pasta, I ordered the ricotta ravioli for the win knowing it would please. It was a generous helping topped with roasted tomato basil sauce, sweet italian sausage, and garlic bread crumbs...delicious. The other menu item that caught my eye was the butternut squash tortellini which was made with brown butter, amaretto cookies, sage, and parmesan cheese. Luckily my friend ordered it and I got to try some and man was that just as good, but be forewarned, it is a more sweet dominated dish in regards to flavor, think sweet and savory like a sweet potato, but nonetheless great. 

Todd English does it right, from the service, to the atmosphere, to the all important food and Olives is no exception, come here for a great dinner!",3,1,3

We asked how the menu worked since some places have smaller portions that ordering an appetizer, small plate and entree is necessary. Our waiter pointed to the menu in annoyance and said these are the appetizers, these are the entrees etc. well thank you captain obvious we figured that out when we opened the menu. So.... Are the portions a good size? If we split an app and got our meals will that be enough? We started off with the charcuterie, not a lot of meat and decent cheeses. Came with house made pickles that we could have done without. I ordered the prosciutto and fig flatbread. It was ok, the prosciutto was more chewy and ""ham"" like. My husband ordered the pesto cream sauce gnocchi. Everything was tasty but was almost soupy with the amount of pesto they put in it. Also the table Next to us had the same waiter and they asked him what scallops are, his reply was an annoyed ""it's fish"" well I wouldn't consider scallops to be a fish, maybe describe it as a shell fish similar to clam.

This might do the trick for folks who frequent the olive gardens and maggianos of the world. Perhaps I'm being too harsh, it is billed as a Mediterranean restaurant after all. But it don't get anymore Italian than gnochhi. At around 20 bucks a pop, I'm expecting the softest gnochhi that doesn't resist the bite and that doesn't come out in under 10 minutes a after the order was placed. I can count half a dozen places in San Francisco with better Italian fare for 2\/3rds the price.

Service, location, ambience, however were very good, in true Vegas spirit. Maybe their non Italian menu items are better.

My group of 8 was seated promptly per our reservation, and we were impressed with our view of the fountains. We gave ourselves 2 hours for dinner before we caught a show. We informed our server, who assured us that we would absolutely make the show. That's when it all went downhill.

It took 30min to get drinks ordered, then another 20min to receive them. Only then was food able to be ordered, and only then to come out another 40min later. 

Not only was the food incredibly delayed, it was also incredibly inaccurate. A girlfriend and I both ordered a gnocchi dish, but both received a red penne pasta with 3 measly slices of chewy, overcooked duck. We were left with 5min to eat our inaccurate, poorly cooked, overpriced food before running (in heels, of course) to still miss the opening of our show.

Also, I couldn't help but notice the table next to us complaining from the moment we arrived. And where was our server the whole time? Avoiding his upset tables, I assume. 

I also cannot help but notice that other poor reviews name similar complaints. And the business offers an apology? Sweet notion, but that just doesn't make up for a terrible experience - it certainly won't feed my group and I when we were seriously hungry, and it definitely doesn't put my money back in my wallet.

(One star because of expectations based on price point and location.)

What do they sell here - heavily?  THE VIEW.  So, what are you paying for here?  THE VIEW.  The food is almost second.  On their website, what do they show you?  THE VIEW.  They show pictures and pictures of the gorgeous views of the fountains.  Um, you're not sitting by the fountains - not even close and they're super snobby about it, like there's some secret way to get it.  It's bait and switch because you literally have no chance of getting that view here at dinner... yet, that's their main selling point (and people who get it stay longer than two hours).  We checked in at 6:45 and they saw it notated that I requested the fountain view.  The hostess (who never smiled once), knowing it was requested in my reservation, callously said it would be another two hours if we wanted that, knowing we were there for a 6:45 dinner and, what, we're just going to walk around for two hours?  Then I would have made a 4:45 reservation, if that was the case.  Instead... what view did we get?  The view of the planter in the back corner, and windows with drapes blocking any kind of view through the umbrellas outside.  We were laughing about how bad of a view it was.  (I'm attaching a picture in this review.)  

I hate to keep harping on it because, with sitting near a view of ANY kind, this place just looks exactly like the Cheesecake Factory decor.  If I want to a Cheesecake Factory experience, I would have gone there for 1\/3 of the price... for the same views and probably better food.  We were also laughing because of how loud it was, as we were by some interior waiter station, clanging cups and broken glasses... the soundtrack for the little bit of the fountain we could kind see.

Also, I was completely over-dressed with a suit and no tie.  People are in here with shorts and t-shirts.  What!?  There's no jacket policy?  Or, at least a collared shirt?  It's farm town tourist central here.  I expected this to be along the lines of SW Steakhouse and it's not even close, as far as class.   

Our waitress was awful.  Just an older lady who tried covering up a bad attitude with a teeth-gritting fake smile.  Her lack of knowledge of the menu was astonishing.  We asked about a couple wines and if it was dry or sweet or whatever and she just kinda repeated what we were saying, like, it can't be both.  Any other place, the waiter\/waitress would have brought out a couple samples.  Not with her. 

The food.  I ordered a Greek salad and gnocchi, with a Riesling.  The bread and olives were great... I love olives and they have various kinds and spreads.  All great.  The salad was good, again, with olives.  The entree of the gnocchi?  Sloppy mess. Dry, overcooked chicken.  Soupy.  Random mess.  I ate half of it then just gave up.  Brutal.  How do you screw up gnocchi?   

Kind of sad when the bread and spread far exceeds the entree.  

The only thing upscale about this place is price point... nothing else justifies it.  It is NOT a ""fine"" dining experience.  Trust me, if you want a nice night out... go to ANYTHING at the Wynn because you what you ""think"" you're getting here... is exactly what you get there.  I've been to a number of places there and all were great, especially with the water view.  Just a different vibe, better service, etc.  The ONLY reason to come here would be the view and there's apparently some super secret way to get it... which I do not know of.  

Obviously I had, what I assume to be, an ""outlier"" experience, basically, the worst possible experience one could have but I'd never risk giving it another shot... so there won't be a follow-up review.  I've seen enough.",1,0,0

When we said that we don't eat meat he made sure we get some good vegetarian food. We didn't plan a cake for my 30th as my wife and I both are healthy eaters and definitely cannot consume a whole cake. We went for a Tiramisu for the dessert and when our server found out that it is my Birthday, he wrote 'Happy Birthday' on the side of the dessert plate and lighted a candle.

Unfortunately our second visit did not live up and I'm sad to say that we will probably not be returning to this location. The view does not make up for all of its shortcomings. Let me start with the strong points - view, service, cocktails, and wine list. The food and moderately rude hostess are what don't hold up. 
-Chilled avocado soup: very bland and uneventful
-gazpacho: good... Nice spice but not really any other dimension
-lobster wrap pasta: quite good, but at $45 it's really just average
- prime filet: slightly overlooked and slightly dry and the sauce was blocked (and soaked up) by the potatoes. Plus you get what tastes to be a frozen crab cake plopped on the side of your plate that tasted a bit funky.

Unfortunately, this is when we gave up on this restaurant. I had half my plate thrown away, had our $150 bottle of wine corked, and disenchantingly requested our check. I mentioned some of the meals shortcomings to the waiter the end of the meal (my mistake for waiting) and made it clear I was not looking for discounts... I just wanted to pass on the feedback since it was a family favorite and we had such great memories from our first time here. Unfortunately I don't think the feedback was understood (probably just pegged us as a young couple that doesn't know what good dining really is), but the waiter did graciously reduce the bill (slightly)

This was our last meal for our Vegas trip and unfortunately it was the worst. I'm left frustrated that I still don't have a proper steak to pair with the beautiful wine that remains on my counter",0,0,0

After being seated at our table, they left us with an iPad that was an interactive wine\/cocktail menu, which I thought was pretty nifty and cool. After ordering cocktails, we started with the Tuna Tartare, and it was nicely flavorful of fresh tuna. For the entr√©es, we went with our waiter's recommendation. My wife went with the Sea Scallops which was delicious, and I went with the Pan Seared Northern Halibut. My halibut was exactly as our waiter had described it would taste, and everything from the fish to the bed of risotto it sat on was outstanding.

For an establishment in such a prime location touting a very high end menu and rock star chef branding, you would think that the dining room staff wouldn't be the sad end of amateur hour. The dining room is not large, there were plenty of waiters milling about, so I'm not sure why the service was so spotty. Orders were forgotten, mixed up, glasses of high end single malt scotch were filled with crushed ice, even when explicitly instructed otherwise. Pretty much every milestone in the dinner (ordering drinks, ordering appetizers, getting food, getting post-meal drinks, getting the check) was preceded by a painfully long wait for a waiter who managed to disappear from view for long stretches of time. Being that this was a weekday, my assumption was that the pro-level service was reserved for Friday nights and weekends. Unfortunate, to say the least, that the poor-service ended up being such a distraction for a great meal.

Trust me, it's painful to do because I enjoy dining at this restaurant, but the lackluster service was a turnoff, especially taking into consideration that I came here with friends for my birthday dinner.

Service - I called the restaurant twice to make and confirm my reservation, and twice I was put on hold for over 10 minutes -- I kid you not. On top of that, the receptionists were snooty both on the phone and in person. Wait service didn't go above and beyond like in the past. Essentially, we received ""just get the job done"" kind of service. 

Food - Delectable is a perfect word to describe our entrees. All of my friends enjoyed their orders, as well as the foie gras appetizer, which I praised in a previous review.

Crazy Mushroom P: I can't recall the full name of this pasta dish, but it's crazy good. The dish has peas and mushrooms mixed into creamy pasta. It's truly mouthwatering. Being a fast eater, this forced me to slow down and savor each bite.

Restaurant Layout: Dining here during a busy Saturday evening has made it apparent to me that this restaurant isn't an intimate dining spot. Tables are closely arranged together. Maneuvering through the sea of seats is like having to go through a Double Dare obstacle course. Plus, it's noisy, which makes it difficult to carry on a dinner conversation. 

Overall - As much as I like this restaurant, I won't be returning for a very long time. Instead, I'll be visiting their competition where I can expect exceptional food AND exceptional service.

We must have seen the Bellagio fountains firing up at least 10 times during our dinner and every time it felt like I was watching it for the first time. It was a chilly night but the view,service and food more than made up for it.

We were given a bread basket (lavash, focaccia and some sweet bread) along with a trio of olives and tapenade upon sitting. I could gorge on those all night but we had to save our appetite for later. Being vegetarian, we ordered the one veggie pasta they had on the menu (butternut squash ravioli) and the eggplant flatbread to share. The flatbread was super yummy and though it did not look too big it pretty much filled our stomachs up before the pasta arrived. This was good because we did not like the pasta dish all that much - it was bit too sweet for our tastes.

The service was extremely friendly - special mention to the guy who refilled our waters. He was attentive,friendly and kept making sure that we were comfortable in the chill of the night (they have outdoor heaters but I chose to sit near the fountain where they didnt have any).

Sure, one can get ham and eggs for $1.99 in the Fremont Street district, but save that for the end of the trip when the dealer's gotten the better of you.  While you still have a few bucks in your pocket, splurge on yourself at Olives at the Bellagio.

The hotel housing Todd English's only west coast outlet is a spectacle in itself- go a little early to admire the artwork and gaming floor.  Yes, the gaming floor- classy doesn't even stop there.  But getting the right table at Olive's will give you a view that you'll still be talking about on the plane ride home- the Strip, of course, but a front seat view of the fountains from an entirely different angle.  

The menu is largely seasonal, I understand, and may require a bit of study.  Think cruise ship menu- there's always something that you're not going to have one clue how to pronounce or, even if you do, you have no clue what it is.  But don't count it out- Coq au Vin (Coke-ahh-Vin) is actually chicken in a wine sauce, for example, and is delicious.  But I digress.  We ordered meat dishes, I the pork tenderloin with polenta and green beans, my cousin and steak.  They were both superb dishes that I can still taste if I close my eyes and focus.  

The service was a little subpar- disappointing for a Todd English restaurant, in my opinion.  The sommelier seemed disappointed that we only ordered one glass of wine each.  And the wait staff probably assumed that two younger guys either weren't going to tip well or who knows what.  Despite my disappointment in the service, I remind myself that Olives is all about the food.

FOOD: I personally ordered grapefruit juice and the mushroom flatbread pizza. I know that it's almost impossible to do pizza wrong, but they did it SO well! The crust was toasted to perfection, and the chef was definitely not skimpy with mushrooms. *drools*

Buffalo Mozzarella in Carrozza : mozzarella wrapped in house made pasta, heirloom tomatoes,parmesan creama, balsamic roasted red onion, basil flakes -  this was pretty good...very cheesy...i liked it because i love cheese but my friend thought it was too much...good portions and the vegetables was yummy

Char Grilled Kobe Skirt Steak : summer ratatouille, red wine bordelaise, maytag blue cheese croutons, crispy fried onion rings -  huge huge portion, i didn't finish mine cuz it was too much food.  the steak was okay, a little chewy and I normally don't eat steak ... but I thought it was okay 

Mudslide Ice Cream Sandwich : double chocolate espresso cookies, bailey's ice cream,kahl√∫a chocolate glaze, caramel sauce - yummmyyy...loved it...

I came here to do the bar menu and have a few drinks for my BIRTHDAY..I thought the bar menu was from 4:00-6:00pm but it was 3:00-5:00pm. We had arrived at 4:15pm and ALL seats at the bar were taken but there were small tables next to the bar that were EMPTY.  

I asked the host if we could sit at one of the small tables and he informed us that ALL tables are for DINNER ONLY and it starts at 5:00 pm. ( he wasn't the most friendly) Well there goes that plan. No one would be leaving the BAR and then the menu would be over. I have never heard of a restaurant that ONLY provides seats at the ""literal"" bar when they are serving their bar menu. Maybe they do things differently in CA.

Plan B: Go to the Bellagio fountain show..which was wonderful as they had the show to the tune Lady Luck by Frank Sinatra..ahh...classic Vegas..on the way back, we walked past OLives and I thought well I have to at least get a birthday drink and they had 2 seats open. The bartender poured well ..got our money's worth, not watered down like most restaurants ( that is why I make my own most of the time).

The greatest piece of raw food that ever entered my mouth. I was not alone in this sentiment - the other three gentlemen in our group for dinner completely agreed that this tartare was unbelievable. In fact, as good as my duck confit was (aside from being a bit oversalted, but I expected as much since it was deliciously combined with capers and anchovies), I would've preferred 3 entire orders of tartare in lieu of an actual entree - its that good! 

In addition to the delicious food, the view of the fountains and the outdoor seating (with heat lamps, of course) in December makes for a pretty decent outing.

It was a special night, all three of us together in this crazy city, and I wanted dinner to be special.

So I asked a bunch of friends where we should go for and early-ish dinner on a Tuesday. I didn't want anything off-the-charts fancy, i.e., something you had to super dress up for or that would send us in to the poor house. But I DID want something memorable and lovely. The winning recommendation was Olives.

Wow.

First of all, we got seated right by the window overlooking the famous Bellagio ""lake"" and fountains. Granted it was too early for the dancing waters, but still, it was nice.

We each started with cocktails. They were all excellently prepared and generous. My dirty Grey Goose martini with stuffed bleu cheese olives was insanely good. I tried to look up my friend's order online, but can't find the cocktial menu. But it was a grapefruit-based martini that looked refreshing and she said it was yummy.

My friend and I both started with the Bibb Lettuce Salad. Sometimes, simple salads are the best. And this was one of those times. A very generous serving of in-season, super-fresh, tasty bibb lettuce, lightly dressed with a lemony vinagrette and some shaved onions and chopped walnuts. Perfect. 

Then the entrees arrived.

We all ordered seafood.

Mom: the salmon.

Friend: the sea bass.

Me: the swordfish.

Okay, I can only directly comment on my own entree because we were all scarfing our stuff so crazily we didn't manage to share. But I will say that they reported their entrees were most excellent. And judging by their empty plates, I believe them.

The swordfish: Day-um. I don't eat red meat, so when I go out, I usually order a good ""meaty"" cut of fish for my entree...tuna, swordfish, etc. I have never, EVER, had swordfish this tasty before. It was broiled with crushed almonds on top, and served on top of seasoned mashed red bliss potatoes and wilted greens. Seriously? My mouth is watering just writing this...and I just ate dinner, people!!

Read other reviews about balcony seating not being able to be reserved in advance went there a bit before reservation time to request outdoor seating.  Was told it would be about 2.5 hours later.  Was in no hurry and not that hungry at that time so no problem.  Came back just under 2 hours later to check status and they were able to seat us right then.

Balcony has a couple of seats along the railing that are 2 and\/or 4 person size.  There are a couple larger tables in the middle and a few seats alone the doors away from the fountain.  Was seated near the door which wasn't a issue since you still have good view of the fountain shows.

Wasn't very familiar with the portion size so me and my friend were going to split 2 flatbreads and each order an entree.  Server quickly told us that would be too much food so we just got 1 flatbread.  The server was right, there was plenty of food between the app and entree.  In fact, was so full didn't order dessert.

Got the mushroom flatbread and the gnocchi with duck.  Both were really good.  Gnocchi dish may have been over-sauced a bit.  It had good flavor and was an enormous portion.

While the new look is a complete dramatic change of the original I can live with it. What I miss the the most, however, is the original friendly crew that always recognized their regular customers starting with the hostesses, the bartenders to the servers and the managers that had always welcomed in a engaging and courteous manner.

I've tried most everything on the menu and seem to always come back to my ultimate favorites:

*fig, prosciutto flat bread
*boston bib salad
*butternut squash tortelli

I've always started and ordered the White Chocolate Martini. There was an original recipe of this served when it first opened that many(including myself) came back to time after time. It was simple, yet decadent made of vanilla stoli, clear cream de cacao and a splash of something else. Then they would garnish it with a white & milk chocolate swizzle stick.

Today, if you ask for ""White Chocolate Martini"" they automatically give you a liquidy, creamy white concoction. When I've asked the bartenders I'd like it the original way..countless times the bartenders(that are no longer the originals) would argue with me saying they ""only"" do it in the white creamy way. However, I always seemed to get my special cocktail when I have to order more specifically for the original ""clear"" chocolate martini then amazingly these bartenders seem to know the exact recipe, though initially act as if they've never heard of such a cocktail. And after they finally make the cocktail(after wasting minutes in arguing) they wimp out on the chocolate garnish...unlike the decadent original way when the restaurant first opened.

Reservations:  This is probably the most challenged comment I could make of this place. When calling in for earlier dinners (that need to be followed by a show), they always say that 6-8p.m. is all booked up and the earliest would be 10:30. However, I can count on my hand where I've brought groups of 4-6 to walk in with no reservations between 6 & 8p.m. where we were able to get a table immediately and get served.  The hostesses are not the friendliest of the bunch, unlike when the restaurant first opened.  And forget asking politely for a table on the balcony to watch the fountain show, they are extremely protective and act as if it is ""off limits"". Perhaps they reserve it for their favorite high roller guests or as long as they get a decent side tip in order to fulfill the request.

I'd say the more accurate defined ratings would be:

Food, Beverage:  five stars
Environment:  three stars (five if you can actually get a table on the balcony. I miss the original friendlier esthetics)
Service: two stars (due to the argumentative bartenders & the pompous hostesses)",4,2,3

We made reservations for 11 of us at 7pm last night but got there around 5:30 to try and get patio seating to watch the fountain show but no luck. I guess you have to stop in 2 1\/2 hours prior to get on the patio wait list. Even without that, we were still seated later than our reservation (which was not their fault since they can't control how quickly customers vacate after dinner). 

The cocktail menus and desserts were displayed on iPads. Instead of getting several cocktails, my husband and I just decided to go with a bottle of wine. The 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon from Pasa Robles fit well with the beef tenderloin that I ordered. My friend ordered the Tiffany Cocktail which was sweet, light, and refreshing and of course, target as a ""girly"" drink!

The beef tenderloin was ordered medium rare but on the ""rarer"" side. There was a demi glaze that was slightly sweet but not overpowering. The beef was cooked perfectly and it was a perfect meat selection that had pure taste but not entirely unique like some other places where I've had steak in Vegas. It was served with lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus which made a good traditional combo. The tiny bits of lobster in the mashed potatoes was a nice touch.

Service was great, as it should be for a restaurant like this. Our waiter handled our group of 11 seamlessly and even split our checks at the end which was hard because our group was being silly and the environment was very loud.",6,4,3

Cons: shockingly unfriendly staff

Even though there was only one major con, I still only rate this restaurant a 3-star, because of the service. I went there for my 21st birthday with my boyfriend and was loving the atmosphere and the food, but extremely disappointed at the staff, especially for paying so much money! Our waiter did not check our ID's when we ordered wine, and as I said it was only my 21st birthday and I look like I am 16 years old. There was hardly a smile from both the staff who seated us and our server. The only friendly staff members were the buss boys! I tried to chalk it up to being a Friday night, but out server's behavior over the dessert menu was appalling. My boyfriend wanted to order me some dessert to celebrate my birthday, but I was insisting I was too full for it (especially for another $20 on a slice of cake). My boyfriend still tried to let my server know that it was a special occasion for us and our server responded with ""We would have been able to do something, but you declined to order dessert"" loud enough for me to hear. Upon seeing the disgusted look on my face the server said ""Let me see what I can do"". He then brought out a plate with three of the smallest cream puffs I have ever seen and a candle and just set it on the table with the check and walked away. Let me begin by saying that I was fine with not having any dessert or candles, and my boyfriend was only trying to make me feel special, but what the server said and how he acted was service that I have NEVER received anywhere, let alone somewhere where dinner for two cost us over $150. I have eaten on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi across the street at Paris for the view of the Belagio water show several times before, and unfortunately that is where I will be returning to.

We were by far the youngest people having lunch, but that didn't stop us form being overly obnoxious with the picture taking, loud giggling and inappropriate comments. 
We started with the beef carpaccio, which was out of this world! The oysters were just eh...too big for my taste. I had the butternut squash pasta, which was delicious, but way too much food for my still drunk state. We also tried the scallops, which had huge potential, but tasted fishy...so I'd say a miss. The halibut was also fishy...another miss. Overall, I'd say Olive's is very hit or miss....I can't rave enough about the carpaccio, and the butternut squash was nothing to scoff at....however, everything else was lackluster...and dare I say too fishy smelling\/tasting. 
With all the fine restaurants in Vegas, I don't think I'll be back to Olive's...for the price, nothing should have smelled or tasted fishy....that's just amateur!

The view (if you're able to get a seat over lake Bellagio) is even better! It is very difficult to find a good charcuterie place on the Strip, and I'd have to say that this place is my favorite.  My recommendation is that you go early to get a good table, and also indulge in the appetizers\/drinks! I can't imagine how crowded this place must be on the weekends, but my boyfriend and I went on a weeknight and were able to get a table easily!

Food: It does seem to me that you pay a premium on the food due to the fact that the view from the restaurant is absolutely beautiful. However, I'm not sure if that's a fair judgement based on the fact that I wasn't able to try everything on the menu. My boyfriend had the stroganoff (the special) and I had the butternut squash. Of course we also had charcuterie (which if I could, I'd give a 10\/5!) 

Ambiance: While the yelp review lists that the restaurant is casual, I did see some nicely-dressed individuals during our dinner! I think you can get away with business casual, especially if you're intending on setting outside. The Bellagio water show is absolutely stunning to watch from the outside patio, especially during sunset. The restaurant also offers photography for purchase for anyone sitting outdoors, but my boyfriend and I found that the waiters did a great job of capturing the moment for us on our iPhones (yay technology!)

Service: If the review was based on service alone, I would give the restaurant a 10\/5! The server we had whose name was Ann was absolutely wonderful, and kind.

We were seated right at our reservation time.  I really like the look of the room, very warm colors, interesting shapes. It feels a little crowded though. We were seated on banquets( long bench\/table\/chair ) along the wall and although not packed in as tight as Paris or NYC seating, It did feel tighter than I like. People on either side of me were closer than I like. Would be nice if they removed 3 or 4 tables from the room.  We had a bit of a view of the Bellagio fountains, a nice touch. The room is very loud, not from blaring music, just very loud from the crowd. It is not a room for an intimate conversation. We were slightly dressed up - blazers with dressy shirts and pants and nice shoes and were dressed better than most in the room. The food was mostly excellent. Service began with a nice assortment of breads and a plate of various olives and two tapenades, all excellent. For apps we had the carpaccio, which was one of the best ever and the beef tartare which was good but under seasoned for my taste. Our dinners were the veal and fontina fazzoletti and the short rib paparadelle. I thought the veal had a slightly scorched taste but was still very good. The short rib was wonderful, very rich, flavorful and tender. Some of the pasta was gummed together, not a deal breaker but kind of a drag. I mentioned it to our waitress, who was great, and she offered to replace it but I was fine with it and didn't want to interrupt the pace of our dinner.

Our waiter was very kind and prompt! I wish i remembered his name to write it here. 

The meal we ordered was Tuna Tartare (Excellent!), Beef Carappachio (Well Made and Yummy for my first time trying it) and Prime Tenderloin w\/ Tempura Asparagus and Crab Cakes (Most interesting  and  Taste was GREAT overall). I've never had big slices of onions carmelized inside the mashed potatoes before which were Awesome!  (Photo Provided)

The presentation of their cocktails were most delicious looking. I ordered the Pineapple Doli was absolutely delicious! The foam on top reminded me  a lil' of the Dole Whip Factory from my previously visit to Oahu, HI. (Photo Provided)

The only mentioned that we were celebrating our First Anniversary was on Opentable.com, I wasn't sure if they got the message but the end of our meal they were soo kind enough to bring us a creme puff dessert with ""Happy Anniversary"" handwritten perfectly in chocolate to enjoy! That was seriously the highlight of our wonderful experience here! (Photo Provided)

************Cons:***************
They have tables indoors and outdoors with the view of the  Bellagio Fountain Show. We made reservations for 5:15pm  (restaurant opens at 5pm) requesting this but a couple SERIOUSLY ONE minute before us got this special view table! DARNN!!!  Oh well.....If you guys want an amazing view table, you should definately try the outdoors ones available. It was 115 degrees this weekend so No thank you for us this time. Not the restaurant's fault at all......(Photo Provided)

My Prime Tenderloin wasn't cooked to the ""Medium Rare"" as requested, but more Medium more.

Just two small cons....I count those as not so important overall!!",1,0,0

It's a very nice restaurant with great service, but the food was just ok. I had the Cuban sandwich, which was some kind of Chef's special that day, and it was just kind of soggy. Pretty much devoid of all texture. It came with house made potato chips, (which weren't any good on their own since they had not been salted...at all) so I put a few of those inside to make it a little less boring. 

Overall, I don't want to be too tough on Olives. Great service, the charcuterie and cheese app was good, and it's a nice place to go.",0,0,0

Made our reservations in advance via Yelp. Honestly, it was mostly for the terrace view of the fountains. I'd been here years ago with my sister for a birthday for lunch & had recalled the view. We were not disappointed, we got a great table.  So for the view I would have given the restaurant 5 stars, but...

We shared the grilled squid & octopus appetizer which was tasty & the seafood was cooked very well, but it consisted mostly of chickpeas! Almost should have called it a chickpea appetizer.   For our main dishes we shared a fiery sausage flat bread & sea scallops.  The flat bread pizza, although good, was not what we expected from the ""fiery"" description. Sausage was quite bland, but carmelized onions & herbed cheese was good. Now the scallops were delicious!  They were cooked perfectly & very yummy. So overall I'd have given Olive's for the view & the food 4 stars, but..

Servers were all very nice, but we did seem to have an issue with getting our main entrees.  I know this is a kitchen issue & not our waitresses fault.  People all around us were served & were eating yet we weren't until my husband asked about our meal.  Since we didn't order anything that seemed extremely complex, why did it take longer?  So taking view, food & service into consideration, I could only come up with 3 stars for the whole experience.

I felt the need to write this review based on a recent one that stated the carpaccio was bad.  It is one of the best things you will EVER eat!  We order it every time we go to Olives and always wonder at its deliciousness.  The crispy moist polenta cake hiding underneath, pairs perfectly with the cool tender slices of delicious raw sirloin skirted seductively over the huge plate.  The warm cipollini onions dance around the perimeter begging to be adorned with a drizzle of the 2 amazing aiolis showered rapturously from above.  The piquant baby arugula teases the palate giving just a slight bitterness that balances the richness of the dish.  Well, at least we like it... everyone has a different palate!
 The bartenders here are the best!  We always go and have lunch at the bar with Joe, who has worked here for quite a while... a charming service pro is he.  
 Other lunch favorites are any of the amazing flatbreads, the squash pasta, or the spinach ricotta ravioli.  We think that the food is exceptional.

I made a reservation through Open Table and requested to be seated outside. Upon checking in with the hostess we were brought to our table and seated inside the dining area. I found it a little odd that the hostess did not acknowledge my request from the beginning. She could have said, ""Hello, I see that you requested to sit outside, however this is not currently available, would you still like to join us for dinner tonight?"" 

And I completely get that probably 90% - 100% of people who make a reservation are looking for outside seating (which is extremely limited), but a simple conversation at check in would prevent any confusion or disappointment. I'm sure the host team is at the point where they have so many people requesting outside that they just avoid the conversation altogether so as not to get angry people or lose those who made a reservation.

While eating there, I did see a couple who threw a tantrum when they were brought to their seats inside. The guy started to create a scene over not getting to sit outside, and was eventually subdued by staff. However, after their server came over and started them off with drinks, the two left the restaurant. 

Just be honest and up front and let the person decide. 

In terms of food, the bread was great, it is served with various olive spreads. I ordered the tuscan flatbread for dinner which was sizable and was salty but savory.

Check out Olives and ask for a patio seat where you can feast while watching fountain shows in front of the Bellagio.  Outdoor seating is limited, so making a 5pm reservation and arriving a few minutes early is your best bet to secure a table. 

The menu was relatively small, but full of luxurious options. We ordered the charcuterie plate as an appetizer to our scallop risotto and seafood risotto entrees.  While waiting for the appetizer, we were served two different olive spreads with a crunchy crisp and soft focaccia bread.  This was a nice twist to the traditional balsamic and olive oil dip that is usually served in a nice restaurant. Both breads were tasty, but the crunchy crisp stood out with a more complex flavor profile. 

For drink, my significant other ordered a Chardonnay from Napa and a Pinot from Russian River Valley. I felt like spirits and tried the rosemary infused manhattan.  The Chardonnay was great and the Pinot was good...but had a bit of a bite and wasn't as full flavored as the Russian River Valley pinots I am used to. The manhattan was tasty without the rosemary infusion being too overpowering. 

Our entrees arrived promptly and tasted spectacular. Every few bites we looked up at each other and said, ""mmm....this is good"".  I'm sure I could come up with a slew of adjectives to describe my buttery soft scallops with savory rich risotto and my significant others chorizo spiced broth seafood risotto, but I find the simplistic grunts and nods of satisfaction tend to represent the highest compliment we can provide. When eating food this good, we tend to be too busy enjoying the meal to spark up much conversation or debate highly descriptive prose beyond basic descriptions of complete satisfaction. 

For desert, we shared the creme br√ªl√©e and chocolate peanut butter lava cake. I'm a total chocoholic, but I think the creme br√ªl√©e came out the winner. The lava cake was also quite good with the peanut butter adding an additional layer of richness to an already luxurious chocolate explosion. 

During our meal, we enjoyed 3 different fountain shows and plenty of people watching from the view. I'm sure dining inside is just as tasty, but how many restaurants can you dine at and enjoy multiple over-the-top water shows that shoot several stories into the air?

The foie gras served with my meal was delicate and properly seared. I wish I could say the same for the filet, which - ordered rare - was served over-cooked, dry, and completely unseasoned. Staff were nowhere to be found after dropping off the dishes, so there was no one to run interference with the kitchen.

Since we were still relatively full from lunch, we opted to wait an additional 45mins to be seated by the window where we could enjoy the Bellagio Fountain Water show. 

We were promptly seated at 6:45PM. Three different servers asked us if they could get us something to drink. It was a bit confusing because we didn't know who was our actual server for the night, but felt nice to be acknowledged.

My fiance and I ordered a glass of wine each and then went for the Hudson Valley foie gras appetizer and Boston Bibb salad. Both were delicious. The foie gras melted in my mouth and I wished we had a larger piece of it. The salad had a nice mix of greens and the dressing was very tasty.

Since we are fatties, we continued on to order our entrees. We decided to share the fig and prosciutto flatbread and sea scallops.

The prosciutto was so thin and decadent and paired wonderfully with the fig. The scallops were sweet and juicy. The truffle mashed potato was delicious. Every bite I could taste the truffle oil coming through and it brought out the sweetness of the scallops even more. My fiance thought the truffle oil was too overpowering and the mashed potato not lumpy enough, but I thought it was still phenomenal.

We'll definitely come back to try the beef carpaccio and other dishes we were too full to try this time around.

We ended the night with a perfect berry creme brulee. The berries were fresh and gave the perfect tartness to the creamy and sweet creme brulee. There were also bacon and pepper cookies on top that actually worked really well with the dessert.

Of course nothing could beat watching the water show while enjoying such a great meal! It was defiinitely worth the wait.",3,1,0

During our recent Vegas trip, my family and I dined here after watching a performance of ""O"".  We chose Olives mainly because of its convenience, as we wanted to dine at a restaurant located within the Bellagio property following the show.  

LOCATION: Bellagio Hotel in the area with the luxury goods shops.  

CHECK-IN:  I made a reservation online for 915pm.  We showed up a bit early, perhaps 15-20 minutes, and therefore I asked if there was a chance we could be seated.  Unfortunately, the hostess informed us that the tables weren't turning around as quickly as they had hoped due to the inclement weather closing the patio seating.  

We all decided to pass the extra wait time at the bar, of course.  The bartender, ironically, had lived for a few years in Kona.  And for some reason, knowing that Hawaii connection put us at ease and the time passed quickly as we had a few drinks and shared some laughs.  The hostess came to gather us from the bar and showed us to our table as soon as it became available.   

FOOD:  Menu offerings are extensive.  To start we decided to share the salmon flatbread and the beef carpaccio (thanks to a recommendation by our server).  For our main entrees, I chose the gnocchi, my mother selected the salmon, and my brother the pork chop.  

Firstly, the appetizers were delicious, and extremely filling as the portions are huge.  Really, they were.  Both the flatbread and carpaccio could have easily been an entree all by itself.  I surmise that we thought our appetites were more ravenous than they actually were.  We did our best to make a dent in the flatbread and carpaccio, and though each was delicious in its own right, we didn't want to stuff ourselves prematurely.  I would make a strong recommendation for either these appetizers.

The entrees were also generous portions.  The gnocchi was simply delectable, and I wish I could have eaten every morsel of my entree.  All the components of the dish including the gnocchi, smoked duck breast, and corn and leek puree, combined to create an outstanding dish.  I managed to eat about half of my dinner before I called it quits.  It was incredibly good.

My brother and mom enjoyed their entrees as well.  As they were nearing the full capacity of their bellies, they manged to eat all of the salmon and pork chop, respectively, before finally setting down their fork and knife.  Needless to say, we all were very satisfied with our food.

SERVICE:  Extremely attentive.  Our server was a friendly gentlemen who not only was patient, but was also helpful in recommending appetizers and drinks.  He answered all our questions about the menu, and checked on us periodically throughout the meal.  Excellent customer service overall.

BOTTOM LINE:  A very delicious and memorable meal at Olives.  Bring your appetites, or a lot of people, if choosing to share an appetizer.  The portions are generous.  Delicious food and quality service made this dinner quite unforgettable.",15,10,12

As you have read from prior reviews, you cannot reserve patio seating ahead of time. We arrived at 7:15pm to be told to return two hours later for patio seating. OK...I was expecting that. Luckily we were staying at the Bellagio and we weren't that hungry anyway so we went back to our room to relax and returned at 9pm. 

When we returned we waited another 10-15 minutes before being seated on the patio. We were actually seated all the way in the back by the door and had an obstructed view of the fountains due to the other tables and the umbrellas. NOT HAPPY! I can't believe we waited two hours for that. The service was extremely slow at the beginning. After 25 minutes, our waiter's assistant finally brought us water. Another 15 minutes later and our waiter finally takes our order.

My husband had the Ribeye steak and I had the chicken and artichoke flatbread. The food was very good!! We also ordered the dessert as well! (I forgot what it was, but it was very good!) Our waiter never asked if we were here for a special occasion but I casually said it was my birthday when he passed me the dessert menu and then brought me another dessert that said ""Happy Birthday"" on it! Very cute! 

We were also approached by a lovely woman who took our picture! The pictures turned out great! We bought the large collage of pictures.                       

This place is expensive. Our bill was easily $120 without alcohol. Be prepared for a hefty bill! All in all, there are so many other places on the strip with great views that won't make you wait over 2 hours for a terrible view. We will go somewhere else next time.",2,0,0

We also had the osso buco pasta with a nice tomato sauce and a pasta with butternut squash and brown butter sage sauce. Both of these dishes were fabulous, full of flavor and great texture.

I know they can't guarantee a window seat or outside seating but just the fact that they didn't try despite my request that I made with my reservation was frustrating. The service was OK nothing too special. The tables are super close to each other (less than arms length) and it is very noisy. So not romantic! There were 3 different people who had wine glasses fall off their tables and break (seems to be quite the often occurrence). In fact the tables are so close to each other that I got elbowed in the head by the waitress serving the table next to us! I was very disappointed because it was nothing like I pictured it, don't let the dim lighting, candles at every table and the 'view' of the fountains fool you.. it is not a place for a quiet romantic dinner!",3,1,1

The food, while very pricey, was delicious though had a few execution issues.  For example, my otherwise excellent beef tartare had two separate beds of mashed potatoes that really didn't make sense.  The striped bass that I had from the specials menu was delicious.  I loved the flavor of the butternut squash tortelli but I thought that the plating wasn't very attractive.  Portions were just the right size, but with most entrees hovering around $50, this is not a cheap night out.  Service was excellent.

They have two kinds of bread and they serve it with a smorgasbord of olive spreads. OMG!!! I knew i loved olives, but it wasn't until I ate here that I realized how much my love for them would grow.

I would have been content eating the bread and olive spreads alone, but the waiter urged us to order an entree.
We ordered the Ricotta Ravioli and Fried Sea Scallops.

I was so pleasantly surprised at Olive's. I had heard good things, but being that it is not one of the top billed eateries on the Strip, I didn't have terribly high expectations. Todd English is an amazing chef, so I knew it wouldn't be bad however! 

We had a reservation and were seated right away; which may not sound like anything to remark over, but I've experienced hour-long waits in Las Vegas even when I had made reservations. 

Our waiter, Russ, was such a doll. Knowledgeable, friendly, there when you needed him & gone when you didn't. He didn't mind at all that my colleague and I needed lots of time to decide and had loads of questions. 

We both started with a cocktail, The Slingback. It was delish! Absolut Ruby Red, passion fruit puree and a couple other things I can't remember. But boy did it go down easy...

For our started we chose the beef carpaccio which I had heard much about. Boy, you Yelpers know your stuff...this was hands down the best carpaccio I've ever had. And I've had hundreds! It was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and I could not get enough. The serving size was massive; more than enough for my colleague and I and probably enough for 4 to split. 

For entrees I had the Lobster Bolognese and Janet had the cast-iron Branzino. Both were just divine. The lobster bolognese was something dreams were made of. Handmade pasta really capped of the flavors, and there was a puree of anise which I normally would have avoided like the plague, but it paired so well with the sauce. I was in heaven and ate way more than my lil tummy could handle! 

We were too full for desert (tragic, I know) but there were multiple selections that sounded amazing.

I was very surprised to find it so packed on a Monday night, so of course there was not a chance of us getting a seat out on the patio or just a fountain view, but we still asked anyways! 

The lighting in here is very dim, like most other fine dining experiences in Vegas! Typically, I don't enjoy being seated so close to other diners, but in this case I didn't mind (probably had something to do with the very entertaining older drunk couple next to us though)! I hate to stare, but sometimes you can't help yourself...they were downright drunk and funny! 

They start you out with some different breads and olive spreads....this is great, by the way! We shared the Prosciutto and Fig Flat bread and the Squid & Calamari as an appetizer. The Flat bread was very fresh and interesting, but we weren't too fond of the appetizer. We both thought the squid paired with the chickpeas made for a mushy & bland overall taste. I have read great things about this app., so I was excited to try it, but it just didn't do it for us! 

Hubby was getting a little flustered by the end of the meal. It did take our server about 20 mins. to get us our bill...that's a wee bit too long. I understand being busy, but by the time we were done our meal (10PM) a lot of the other diners were already out the door, so come on! After a couple failed times to waive him down, he finally came over on his own, like a waiter should...anyways, we didn't even let him ask ""Any room for Dessert?""...it was simply ""BILL PLEASE"", hahaha! 

We actually came back here a few days later for a quickie lunch (ironic , right?) and both ordered sandwiches with fried pickles that were excellent. And, we were out of there in no time! 

I would come here again if they could promise us a fountain view, because I think that's worth it myself! Enjoy!",0,0,0

We were impressed. It might have been one of the best meals we've had.  We started with the sausage flat bread, which was a little spicy for her, but i loved it. :) then the main courses we split and had the Chicken Gnocci and the Short Rib Parpadelli. amazing is all i have to say. Also, we seriously contemplated taking home a bag of the Chocolate Walnut Bread. mmmm.

I was going to try the beef tartare, but at the suggestion of our fantastic waiter, we got the beef carpaccio. Delicious is all I can say. The waiter found out that we were in the food industry so when we ordered the flat bread he brought out a Trio dish with fig and prosciutto, olives classic, and portabello. Downright amazing is all I can say. Since my girlfriend is a part time vegetarian she got the Pasta butternut squash tortelli, and she loved it.

We started with cocktails at the bar and enjoyed the English Men's Club look of the restaurant.  The tile floor and dark wood beamed ceiling are gorgeous.

Outside we ordered the Chestnut Ravioli to start.  They were delicious and crispy.  The light marinara sauce was really good and we dipped our bread in it too.  The bread basket had cheese flatbread, focaccia and yummy rolls.  They served a black olive and green olive tapenade, along with seasoned olives too.  

I chose the Pan Seared Jumbo Scallops with Mushroom Risotto and Spinach Salad as my entree.  My dinner partner went with the Grilled Pork Tenderloin.  The scallops were perfection in my mouth.  The flavors were fantastic.  The mushroom risotto and spinach salads were the perfect accompaniments.  Her tenderloin was elaborate and was a large serving that she didn't make a dent in.

We enjoyed the Bellagio water show and decided to prolong the evening with dessert.  We couldn't decide because everything on the menu sounded amazing, so we went with their Bits and Bites, which had a little of everything.  Well, we should have stopped with dinner because the dessert experience wasn't as good as the dinner was.  They had 3 homemade ice creams but 2 tasted like vanilla and the 3rd wasn't good (plus, we couldn't figure out what it tasted like).  The best things on the plate were the ice cream, homemade Oreo cookie and vanilla chip cookie.  The blueberry tart wasn't bad.  The rest of the assortment wasn't good.  :(  There was what looked like a shortbread cookie but it had cayenne in it and we both had burned tongues.  The cute little strawberry cupcake was horrible and dry.  Two other cookies were also unmemorable.

It was about 9:30 on a Sunday night and quite packed...thankfully we had a reservation. While we did arrive a few minutes early, we were promptly seated. 

I wasn't terribly hungry so I passed on a pre-dinner app and just ordered an app for dinner. My fellow diners, however, did opt for some apps one of which I did steal a few bites of, the Tuna Tartare. Very delish! Fresh diced tuna mixed with rock shrimp with a clean, but slightly spicy sesame dressing all atop a crisp, lightly dressed, julienned cucumber salad.

For my dinner I chose the Steamed Clams. Not completely what I had expected, but a nice dish nonetheless. A LARGE bowl of steamed clams tossed with a chunky tomato and garlic sauce. I was expecting a sauce more along the lines of a white wine\/garlic or a garlic\/butter sauce so the chunky tomato veggie sauce caught me off guard. (For the record- it did not say tomato sauce on the menu). The steamed clams were perfectly steamed, tender and served in abundance! I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce and found it to be a bit ""burdensome"" when trying to shell and eat the clams. 

Service, was so-so. Our server was prompt and efficient, but definitely not the most friendly. He was a bit cold and you kind of got the feeling he didn't want to be there. 

Everyone seemed to be pretty satisfied with their meals, but no one was raving about it either. Overall good meal, decent service, nice ambiance (we were sitting inside and had a nice view of the Bellagio water show).

The service was SPECTACULAR and it made everything that was already great so much, much, much better. The best drinks I had during our week in Vegas were here. They were the first drinks we had here too, which should be noted. Very tasty...

Our server was honestly so great that I wish I could remember his name. Brian said he was hitting on me, but I so don't think so. He was just a very nice and authentic guy in a very strange and shallow town.

They bring out some olive purees, relishes and stuff, but since we don't love that we had some butter and an alternative dipping sauce that was much more to our liking. The breads were good and sour. We especially liked the one with onion on the top.

For lunch, we had pasta. I had one with clams and sausage in a spicy red sauce that the waiter recommended. I ate every last bite. It was totally, totally good. I almost got carried away and ate all of Brian's too. His had a more alfredo-type sauce with a bunch of bacon. Both dishes, I have to say, were superb.

Everyone is talking about how great the ambiance was, but I think that was the weakest aspect of the dining experience at Olives. Brian complained that the table was too small (he's a tall guy) and too close to the other tables. He also stated that it was a little on the pricey side. One positive aspect was that I could see the Dior boutique from my table. Eff the fountains, show me some handbags. Oui!

By the end of our lunch, I was completely drunk and full and happy. I have nothing but love for Olives. I wanted to go to this place a second time during our stay but Brian said no. But we'll be back on our next visit. I loved it. S.W.A.K.",8,11,8

-- shrimp encrusted mahi mahi: crispy fried shrimp sit atop firm, mild-tasting fish. Came with a bit of mushroom risotto. 
--fig & prosciutto flatbread: I am a fan of thin crust pizzas so I loved that their menu has a variety of flatbreads. This one was a mix of salty from the gorgonzola cheese & prosciutto & sweet from the figs & fig jam. Crust was thin, but chewy & flavored with Rosemary. Try it!

I had been there for lunch before and had a nice time.  There were 14 of us this time.  My boyfriend called the restaurant to make a reservation about 6 weeks ago and they recommended we sit at the 'farm table' since it was one long table that would fit our group.  He called to confirm the reservation and they again talked up how great it was that we were going to be at the farm table.

This farm table was in theory a nice idea, but it was in a semi-private room behind the kitchen.  It was the middle of July and I'm pretty sure it was cooler outside than at our table.  When we asked the manager about making it cooler, they said they knew the table was hot and they had been working with the hotel to make it colder.  If they knew the table was typically hot then why would you recommend a group sit there for a wedding dinner?

This was supposed to be one of the only days where the newly married couple shouldn't have had to worry about anything and instead of enjoying dinner with his new bride, the groom was up several times to talk to management about the heat.

  On top of it being so hot and some people from the party having to leave because their side of the table was so unbearable, the service was absolutely awful.  Our server was not nice and did not even review the specials until someone asked if there were any.  He rushed us through ordering and when we ordered champagne he did not congratulate the bride and groom, he just asked who needed glasses for the bottle.

I had one bite of a salad because it was so hot and then spent the rest of the time going in and out of the restaurant.  The bite of the salad I had was fine, but the lettuce was a little wilted, maybe because it was so hot at our table.

I looked at the menu which ran about $40-60 for main entrees and roughly $20+ for appetizers. My wife was hungrier and decided on the pork chop. I told our waiter I wasn't very hungry and was contemplating just ordering two appetizers as my dinner. He stopped me and told me just to order the one since it was huge.  That advice was worth gold as there's no way I could have finished anymore food. The carpaccio appetizer was pretty darn amazing... My wife whose typically not a raw beef person said she would get one by herself next time. Her pork chop main was thick and tender but very heavy.,1,1,1

My mother had the Tortelli pasta.

The flavors were good but the temperature left something to be desired.

To be honest, after eating at all the other Bellagio restaurants (Sensi, Le Cirque, Picasso), I didn't expect as much here but was very pleasantly surprised and proven wrong...sort-of.

The reason why I say sort-of is because we got entrees, and whereas the entrees were good, I would skip them next time and just do all appetizers because the appetizers were a lot better.  I would say overall, this place is 3-stars for entrees and maybe 4 or even 4.5 for appetizers\/salads\/dessert.

We came here as a party of 2 for a Sunday 6pm dinner. They were already jam-packed, so definitely make reservations!

We ordered the following:

APPETIZERS
* Tuna Tartare - Stellar! I love how it's not super spicy like how some other places make it, so you can actually taste the freshness of the tuna but still infused with the wonderful Asian-inspired flavors of the tartare.
* Pan Roasted Foie Gras Steak - Not the best I've had. The Foie Gras was a bit thin, creeping on the side of being overcooked (a bit too charred on some edges), and it was accompanied by an apple compote crepe that makes the whole dish feels like foie gras over apple pie.

SALADS
* Beet Salad - Loved it! I'm a fan of beet salads and this one did not disappoint.
* Beef Carpaccio - FANTASTIC! My favorite dish here (although the Tuna Tartare comes very close). I had high hopes for it when we ordered it, and then when it came out, it literally looked like a disassembled lasagna or something--I remember thinking ""OMG, we shouldn't have ordered this"", but looks deceive! It tasted heavenly! Very fresh and tender beef and the sauces and flavors were perfect. There's a lump in the middle which is the greens under the bed of carpaccio.

ENTREES
* Jumbo Sea Scallops - It was sort of a hit and miss for me. I LOVE sea scallops, so I think that was the only thing going for the dish for me. But it was a bit overcooked (I prefer it more tender, lightly seared, but this one--the edges were getting rough) and a bit too salty (I was trying to scrape off the sauce, which was a bit overwhelming).
* Cast Iron Norwegian Salmon - Very good. Better than the scallops and very enjoyable dish, but the appetizers were still better =)

DESSERT
* Vanilla Souffle - I'm a sucker for souffle, so even though we were chalk-full, I couldn't pass it up, so we ordered one to share. And this one was executed beautifully and I'm happy that I stuffed myself for it =)

Bread (complimentary) was really good. There was a mix of the crispy flatbread, a sweet honey crusted bun, and some cut focaccia pieces. They weren't warn, but they were definitely fresh and we liked the focaccia and honey breads the best. Service was pretty good. They were a bit busy, we had to ask for another bottle of water twice, but overall, it was excellent.",0,0,0

Well, last night Valentin and our server Michelle again went above and beyond to welcome us and make sure that everything was perfect! Both were so considerate and helpful, and Michelle's food recommendations did not steer us wrong.

I got the Agnolotti, and while small, it was delicious. My wife got the pulled chicken & artichoke flatbread which she liked, but did not love (she did not ask Michelle for a recommendation haha).

Valentin and Michelle sent out the cheesecake as their dessert pick and it was wonderful! They wrote happy anniversary on it, and it truly made the night special.

We were seated on the patio with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain show.  They even let us move closer when a small table was available.

I started my meal with a cocktail, the Lychee Blossom, and it was definitely flowery... a little too floral for my taste.  The bread and cracker basket was alright; it was fun to taste the different tapenades and olives that came with it.

We had the infamous Beef Carpaccio, which was really saucy but tasty nonetheless.  We also tried the grilled octopus dish, served with chickpeas and tomatoes, which was also tasty.

My boyfriend had the shortrib with a truffle fried egg and I had the butternut squash tortelli.  I had a bite of his short rib, which was alright...but I've had better. My tortelli was good, but a bit sweet.  We ordered some corn\/polenta dish that was a little weird.  We usually love polenta but this had fresh corn mixed in and it kind of threw the texture off for me.  The garlicky spinach (compliments of the chef, I guess) was really good.

We ordered the lemon tarts for dessert (I LOVE lemon desserts) but I was  a little disappointed when it arrived.  3 little store-bought tart shells (I work pastry in a kitchen...so I know the brand) with a bit of raspberry puree and runny lemon curd sloppily spooned in, topped with over whipped cream and some pretty candied lemon rounds.  

They also sent out their salted caramel cheesecake, which sounded good, but needs just a little bit of work (I enjoy salty-sweet desserts, but this one was a tad heavy on the salt). 

Bottom Line: 
It was a nice birthday dinner.  The weather was nice enough to sit outside (keep in mind it was the beginning of November) and the Bellagio fountains were  beautiful.  The food itself was so-so considering the amount that I can assume he payed.

Bread basket: Yummy flatbread and carmelized onion focaccia with green and black olive tapenades with whole olives as well. One of the tastier bread baskets I've had!

Appetizers of Watermelon Panzanella and Calamari: The panzanella is a ""bread"" salad. Nice and big red and yellow watermelon cubes on top of mixed greens with olives, feta cheese and big cubes of toasted bread. Watermelon was tasty and paired nice with the salty cheese. The calamari was nice and crunchy, but came with this creamy aoli on top, would've liked something with more acidity to balance it out

Entr√©es of Chicken breast with black lentil hummus and grilled lamb chops. The chicken was a tad dry, but came on this bed of huge, thick cut, meaty, and sweet tomatoes, very nice. The black lentil hummus was yummy, nice lemony kick but warm and a bit thinner than usual hummus. The lamb chops were very tasty, with some type of bubbly glaze, I ate these up. The fatoush salad on the side was nice complement.

Dessert of seasonal sorbet trio and drunk chocolate trifle: The sorbets were a nice and I really liked the orange looking one, probably passionfruit. The bf didn't think there was enough chocolate in the trifle, there was only some chocolate ganache at the bottom. I thought it was just ok.

Lowdown: It's all about the view since it sits on outside of the Bellagio fountain lakes. Make an early reservation and sit on the patio. Weekend water shows start at noon, breathtaking! As far as the food, it had some good flavors, and with this price very reasonable, cheaper than brunch buffet. Normal priced though, wouldn't go, some problems with here and there with execution. There's probably many restaurants that are better at this price range, especially in LV. Do go for the view though!",7,6,6

The Tuna Tartar was probably the best I have ever had and we had the Fig and Prosciutto flat bread was great but little too sweet for me as an appetizer. Also the banana Tiramisu was great.

I was  put off by the cocktail list which has given in to the recent Vegas trend of sweet, large, and ingredient heavy drinks that are more about style than substance. My husband's  ""rare"" steak came out mid-well- a major disappointment for an avowed carnivore. The other meals were fine, though not rave-worthy. Most frustrating was the completely incompetent service that left our glasses empty and orders untaken for entirely too long; the awkwardness when she would actually make it to our table was painful. All this being said, the atmosphere is inviting and the view of the Bellagio fountains is lovely. I used to say that Olives was an affordable upscale option in Vegas with 4 star food; I now consider it and affordable option with 4 star ambiance, but with 3 start food and 2 star service.",0,0,0

While it was okay from sort-of-near the windows, to really watch and hear the fountain show absolutely get a table on the outdoor patio.
While the staff was generally accommodating of my dietary restrictions, it was not nearly as much as other reviews led me to expect. Perhaps my standards are getting higher as more restaurants become helpful. They did have bread available for me while everyone else had their bread basket, so for once I wasn't sitting there watching them eat. It was a couple slices of toasted sandwich-style white bread, very light and fluffy. It was good with the olive tapenade that came with the bread.
There is not a separate gluten free menu or items marked as such on the regular menu. The process is you ask about something and if the server doesn't know they go ask. Helpful, but rather drawn-out. It also wasn't an option to substitute sides, so I ended up with a potato side that had cheese in it that I couldn't really eat. After a while I just settled for something. Their specialties seem to be flatbreads and pre-made pastas so there wasn't great choice.
They do have a gluten free pasta option but not as a substitute in their regular pasta dishes, most of which were some kind of stuffed or prepared pasta. The option was to have gluten free pasta with a basic marinara or bolognese which seemed sort of silly to do at such a fancy\/expensive restaurant.
They have a tablet drink menu, which was more a gimmick than offering anything different. My mom had a very good cocktail with mango in it, and I had one with passion fruit and a sugar rim that was okay but VERY sour. We got the charcuterie platter, very good, with prosciutto, salami, pickled vegetables, cinnamon-dusted walnuts and figs, and three kinds of cow cheese. Substitutions of a goat or sheep cheese weren't available, though our server checked.
My mom and I both got the roasted chicken. I don't recommend it. The pesto potatoes were good, though I could only have a taste because they had cheese. The roasted vegetables were okay but rather sparse. The chicken was nothing special and pretty dry. My dad had a veal pasta dish that he proclaimed delicious.
The server did his best within what they had available, but it didn't turn out to be a meal worth the high price tag. His efforts are the only thing keeping it above two stars. However, it has the lowest price tag of the seven restaurants listed for fountain-watching, all the rest being listed as $50+. If you're going for the fountain, again, definitely go for the outdoor table even if it's an extra wait.",0,0,0

If you are lucky, you can sit out on the patio for an awesome view of the fountains. The interior decor is hip and contemporary with some booth seatings. 

Unfortunately, the food is quite disappointing. For starter, the beef carpaccio was unappetizing and the presentation was too. There's mushy beef on top of salad and polenta. It was a bit gross with a huge portion too. The mussels capellini dish was alright, but it was nothing special. The mussels were fresh though. The lunch beef sirloin is quite big, but the edges taste a bit burnt. The meat was chewy and tasted gamey.

Apparently, they don't take reservations for that even though they give you a box on their online reservation form for requests. Go figure! When we were shown to our seat the hostess was very rude when I asked if there was something by the fountains. I didn't like the setup of the tables inside. We had a table along the wall that had the bench seat on one side and chairs on the other. The bench cushions sunk in, which made eating sort of difficult and the table next to us was pretty close. I think that makes for a somewhat uncomfortable dinning experience.

I ordered the beef carpaccio for a starter and the spaghetti and meatballs (one of the specials). My husband ordered the onion soup as a starter and a mushroom pasta dish. I also ordered a glass of wine while my husband had sparkling water. The beef carpaccio was NOT my favorite. If you look at others pictures on here, it's accurate. It's quite big so if you are eating with a vegetarian you are on your own! It had a weird fried polenta cake under salad and then all of the beef was on top of that. I love when beef carpaccio is served with balsamic, capers, etc... but this didn't even taste that great. My waitress asked me what I thought of it and I said, ""it's big."" She said it's actually only 2oz of meat. It just didn't taste that great and the presentation was off-putting. My husband liked his soup but it was pretty small and he would have probably been happier with a larger bowl (it was definitely a case of size reversal!). They do bring you a basket of bread with olives and 2 types of olive tapenade. The bread was quite good. The spaghetti and meatballs weren't that great either. The meatballs were the best part and had a lot of flavor as there were two types of meat ground together but there was nothing spectacular about the spaghetti or the sauce. I looked for salt at one point but none was to be had and I didn't want to risk offending the chef by asking for some. After the unappetizing starter, I was not that interested anyway and ended up wasting a lot of food since we were in a hotel and didn't have a fridge to take it back to even if I wanted to. My husband said his meal wasn't that great either. The price for 2 starters, 2 entrees, 1 glass of wine and 2 bottles of sparkling wine came out to $180 with tip.
