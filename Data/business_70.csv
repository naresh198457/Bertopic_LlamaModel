The Cadillac margarita was ok but made from a mix.  They had several draught beers here too.

The brisket, baby back ribs, and BBQ chicken were delicious!!! The runner even brought out extra BBQ sauce for us which I recommend since they don't put much on the meat when they serve it.  The ribs were fall off the bone, smoky, and charred. The brisket was tender, and my dining companions favorite thing of the meal.  The BBQ chicken was a little pink which is common for on the smoking process and tasted amazing.

Our service was attentive and a manager checked in with us and thanked us for visiting.  For lunch for 2 with 1 drink each it was about $70 before tip.  We had a lot of leftovers which made it a good value!",0,0,1

The absolute, hands down, most personable, nice, friendly, and understanding manager we have ever met. He chatted with us, made sure that we had everything we needed, and then retrieved a box and checked back in on us when we were finished. Our server, Mara, was so sweet, on top of our needs, and super friendly. She told us all about the restaurant and her great experiences with the team.

Well then, you have found it at Bobby Q.  And even non-carnivores can enjoy themselves.

The moment I got out of my car the seductive scents of smokey bbq wafted into my nose.  Winding through the patio with a bit of a ramschackle look with plants and tin and who knows else (but it's all for show), I enter the inner sanctum:  spacious and with dark walls, high ceilings, big paddle fans, and a bustling atmosphere.  A cheerful hostess greets my wife and I and takes us to our table.

The seating is comfortable, and the lighting is bright enough to read the menus but low enough to enjoy.  Our waitress, Tiffany, is a real joy.  She is very cheerful, checks on us just enough, and gets the orders correct.  She came out in short order and answers all our questions knowledgeably, and soon brings out the first golden nuggets of our meal: complimentary corn bread (they look like muffins without the tops).  They are delicious: very warm, melting in your mouth, moist, and with little pieces of corn in them.  The accompanying butter is hardly needed.

The menu, of course, focuses on meat, but for those inclined towards other proteins, there are other options: grilled salmon and shrimp  for example.  My wife order the baby back ribs with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies.  I got the grilled salmon, grilled veggies and pecan cole slaw.  I also had the ""homemade"" lemonade which came with free refills.  It was refreshing, but a bit on the sweet side.

I first got a side salad.  It was a decent size but basically iceberg lettuce with a few cherry tomatoes, croutons, shredded cheese and a little green pepper topped with red onions.  Warning: if you don't eat pork, they sprinkle bacon bits on top, which wasn't mentioned on the menu.  I got the blue cheese dressing, which didn't have lots of flavor but had real little pieces of blue cheese.

Soon the entrees came out, and they were good-sized.  My salmon was nicely seared and with a slight crispiness outside and very moist inside, served with a light sweet sauce on top.  The grilled veggies were green pepper, onion chunks, zucchini, and summer squash, served with a light vinaigrette.  Very tasty.  The serving size was about 1\/2 cup.  The pecan cole slaw was good sized, with the right amount of mayo, and topped with the nuts (so if you are allergic to nuts, they simply can leave it off).  I wound up taking home 1\/2 the fish and slaw and some veggies to make a lunch!

My wife finished off the 1\/2 rack of ribs that she said just fell off the bone.  She took home some of the generous portion of mashed potatoes.  I tasted them: they were red skin potatoes with some of the skin in there and plenty of flavoring and very good.

While we had a generous meal, we felt for the benefit of our readers to press on and have dessert.  While ""Death by Chocolate"" cake sounded tempting, they were out of it, so we got Peach Cobbler instead. It came in a bowl: sliced peaches topped with a light pastry that was seasoned with the warming spices of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves (it seemed) and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Along with that we received the complimentary mini-doughnuts dusted with sugar and cinnamon.  Those melted in your mouth.  Tiffany gave us both two, but they never made it home!   Oh, and the Peach Cobbler was delicious, too!

Verdict: this is a great place for families and couples and anyone else as it is very welcoming and has great food to suit most tastes.  Except probably not if you're vegan.  I left it with a nice warm feeling all over and the thought that I would return.

Yelpers: there is currently a discount of 10% off the bill if you mention it.",1,0,0

I have found myself at Bobby Q's a couple times now for my husband's work holiday party.  As I'm sure you could guess, this is likely the last place I would consider going, as I don't eat meat and I certainly wouldn't expect a bbq place to cater to my diet. :)  But I have to say it is probably one of the most vegetarian-friendly, meat-centric restaurants I have ever been to - is that a thing?  (Sorry Bobby Q's if I'm ruining your rep)

If you are a vegetarian and somehow find yourself here, you can definitely survive - in fact, you can actually really enjoy your meal. There are a few salads on the menu and also a bunch of great side dishes that you can assemble (tapas-style) to create a tasty vegetarian meal - my favorite combo is their baked potato (sans bacon), roasted veggies (super tasty) and the mac and cheese (seriously good).  In addition to the salads and sides there are several starters on the menu that will work as well as some a-la-carte items.  

The staff there are great and they are super accommodating - no eye rolling when you say, ""I'm vegetarian, can I order a bunch of sides?"" just a friendly, ""Sure, what would you like?""

It's always a little scary to take someone to a place you've never been to but Bobby Q did not disappoint.

We started with their Q rolls for an appetizer. SO good. They are kinda like egg rolls but with brisket and they come with a chipotle dipping sauce that is really good. 

I ordered the brisket sandwich (apparently I was in a brisket kinda mood) which comes with shoestring fries and I ordered a side of mac n cheese as well. I'm not kidding when I say this is some of the best beef brisket I've ever had. It was so tender, not dry at all and it had just the right amount of sauce - enough to give you that rich BBQ flavor but not so much that the meat is swimming in it.
The fries were good but the mac n cheese was really good. VERY rich and creamy. I couldn't finish it all. 
The boyfriend had chicken and mashed potatoes. He said the chicken was good but the potatoes came without gravy. Maybe they forgot it? So those were kinda dull. 
Our friend got ribs and mac n cheese. The ribs looked amazing - fall off the bone type.

We stayed at the table really late - we were literally the last people in the place but they didn't seem to care that we were just hanging out which was cool. 

We didn't go to the bar next door but it was packed and looked like a fun place to grab a drink.

The staff was very efficient and knowledgeable about the menu.  One of my pet peeves is when a staff member has to go and ask someone about a question I have about the menu.  Its pretty obvious the staff here is trained really well.  I had the ribs which were perfectly cooked.  Again though, not the type of place I go for, its also kind of has a upscale feel almost, but definitely not your hole in the wall BBQ place.",0,0,0

Went to the bar\/happy hour while waiting about 40 mins for our dinner table, for a party of 3. The outside bar area patio seating was soaked because of leaking misters. And inside the bar was insanely loud.

Food was good. I had the roasted chicken and I wouldn't order it again...I'd try something else. It wasn't cold, but it wasn't fresh off the grill hot either. Baked potato was delicious, and roasted veggies were great. Corn bread was great. The food definitely tasted home-cooked. Not too greasy, and not too fatty. My meal was $13, almost the cheapest main course option. Nor sure it's worth the price.

I would have only given Bobby Q's 2 stars, but the servers were awesome - they were attentive and fast, and they gave our table an extra bag of mini-donuts for free. I give an extra star for that.

The patio is much like a garden patio at a home with brick walls and plants high enough to block the traffic \/ side street noises.  The indoors has a rustic, yet, elligant patio feel to it with the brick walls and rustic wood ceilings.  The furniture is again, more of a patio feel than a typical bar-b-que restaurant.  The noise level was not too loud that you couldn't hear people at your own table. 

The food was wonderful! Although my husband said their burger was too greasy, that was the only downfall.  My brother and I had the St. Louis ribs.  The way they caramelize the bar-b-que sauce on the ribs is great. They aren't runny with sauce dripping down your hand. The rib meat falls off the bone and easy enough to eat with a fork or picking it up. 

The sides were great. I had the macaroni and cheese which was definitely homemade. Not runny and not too dry. The cheese flavor was not too strong either.

It's obvious from its construction, that this building has been here a long time and the massively tall trees in the parking lot confirm that.  I actually parked in an ""adjacent"" lot next to the main one and had a decent walk to the restaurant's entrance around the corner.  The much larger bar facing the lot is NOT the entrance to go through to access the restaurant.

Before meeting my date here, I took a look at the menu and had a mild sticker shock.  The prices are not unreasonable for a Valley restaurant; but being that we usually eat in $ or $$- restaurants, it was quite a bit more than what I'm used to.  The important question, however, wasn't whether the prices were ""high"", but whether food quantity and quality justified them.

We started out with drinks.  I had the Strawberry q Lada ($9.00), which was quite delicious, with the strawberry and piña colada blending very well together.  While waiting for dinner, they also brought cornbread for each of us with butter, which was also quite good, though had it been hot instead of lukewarm,it  would have been excellent.

My date ordered the half baby back ribs with cole slaw and baked potato.  In her case, this was very much worth the $20.00 ... and I frankly can't imagine what the ""whole"" for $6.00 more would have been like!  For out came what I can only describe as half of the brontosaurus ribs they used to dump on Fred Flintstone's car; an overflowing bowl of cole slaw and a potato almost as big as the half-ribs.  I ordered the ""smoasted"" half chicken and can only say, that presentation is everything.  It didn't seem close to half a chicken to me; but since it was served in cut up pieces and on a large plate, that might be the reason why I thought otherwise.  For sides, I had the fully stuffed baked potato (still huge) and the grilled vegetables, which, I can honestly say, should have been double the amount while the potato could've been half the size.  Since my date picked out the restaurant, it was obvious it was a favorite place for her and her husband.  As the ""newbie"", I was very impressed with the taste and while my plate didn't seem to be overflowing like hers, it was more than enough and worth the price.  Before tip, my tab came out to $27.08, including tax.

Service is prompt, friendly and attentive (perhaps a bit too attentive, when you're trying to talk).  Interestingly enough, once the credit card was run, the waitress, who had constantly been checking on us throughout the meal, left us to talk in peace with only an occasional server interrupting to see if we wanted more water or Diet Coke.  Though the restaurant is nowhere near as big as the annexed bar, it is pretty roomy with dark, wood colors and a very high ceiling.  

DIABETIC ALERT:
------------------------

A glance at the menu will tell you that this place is pork and beef heavy.  There are only two chicken dishes and its obvious by what comes out, that chicken is not their specialty.  A diabetic will have a very hard time eating ""healthy"" here.  The more serious you are about watching what you eat, the more problems you're going to have navigating the menu.  This place should more likely be considered ""a-once-in-a-very-long-while"" treat.  Looking around tonight, most of the patrons had waist sizes that wouldn't surprise anyone coming here.  For the most part, only the wait staff was thin\/proportionate, though not always.  While the food is very good, the staff hospitable and the atmosphere welcoming, this restaurant would probably elicit a big frown on your doctor's face, if he knew you came here ... and probably give HIM a heart attack, if he heard you came here regularly.",1,1,0

I was pleased by most of what I ordered here at Bobby Q. The pulled pork was tasty, the sauce was agreeably flavorful, the baby backs were flavorful, although perhaps a little too tender, I did not have to pick them up to eat them, the meat fell off the bone. They were probably boiled to get this preparation, but they were yummy either way. The potato salad was exactly the kind I like in my BBQ joints. The mac and cheese side was just ok, not bad, but not the best thing on the plate.

They serve cornbread before the meal and it's extremely moist and good - wasn't blown away by any means, but it was your standard cornbread.

My boyfriend also ordered the frozen lemonade which was so amazingly good! If you've had the frozen lemonade cups at a ball game or something of the like - it tastes just like that except better! Comes with a sugar rim.

I'd definitely go here again. The only complaint I have is that it is small (they have outdoor seating, but when we went there were tons of bugs - ew!) and LOUD. Our table was also super wobbly.

I came to Phoenix getting ready to enjoy a conference, catch up with good amigos, eat good Mexican food and of course, In-N-Out burgers!! The latter two didn't happen. However Bobby Q happened. It was the best food I have eaten in a while. The wonderful knowledgeable friend Mark H invited me here. This place is about 25 minutes driving north from Downtown Phoenix. Atmosphere is lovely with available patio seats. The staff were the most pleasant and friendliest! For me, if you want to test a BBQ place, get the brisket and see. They served sweet corn bread which was scrumptious! I'm glad my shyness stopped me from devouring Mark's bread. When that naughty brisket came, initial impression was OK.. There was no charred marks or anything. But once you bite the first morsel, you're transferred immediately to another world...It was the most tender, juiciest, tastiest brisket I have ever had so far. I will stop here. 

Next time in Phoenix, try brisket at Bobby Q you must! I can't thank the awesome Mark H enough for this. To Bobby Q chefs, owner, staff, thank you so much! Keep up the smile; keep up the solid work!",212,144,205

It is almost a foreshadowing of things to come inside.  And when you finally do reach your  seat  your mouth will water and your  stomach will rumble because everything you've  heard is true. There food is that good.
  As far as restaurants go, Bobby Q has the look of an old industrial factory with a touch of western thrown in. The interior is a combination of wood, steel, glass, concrete, exposed pipes, ducts, and wires. At first it may  look like everything was thrown randomly together, but everything fits in a modern organic way. The overall  effect is entertaining. Your eye drifts from one area  of the  room to the  next.
  Now  the food. For lunch I had their combination platter consisting of the ribs, brisket, and chicken. And as expected, the food looked good. It smelled good. And it tasted even better.  It was hot. It was  tender. It was tastey. But what suprised me the most was the chicken. It held it's  own against against the ribs and mighty brisket.

Quite a complete meal that we shared it among 2 people and still could not eat all of it. The Baby Back Ribs were super tender and moist and as a cut each rib, the meat would just fall off the bone. The Catfish was good, would have been nice with some tarter sauce. The sides were average, not great, but not bad. The baked potato was loaded with butter, sour cream, chives and Bacon so that was a winner, the mac and cheese was good but when the waitress said that is their recommendation and the best side, I expected a little more. The Roasted Corn when we ordered expected a ear of corn roasted over a grill, but what we received was an inch of 2 ends of corn on the cob and loose corn kernels in a small bowl which could have been corn from a can.

Salmon Dinner was a generous slab of fish and was well prepared. It was grilled and had a good crisp grilled skin which was very good and it came with 2 sides which my daughter choose the mac and cheese plus vegetables. 

Cornbread is very good and the waiter was generous enough to give us another basket.

This is my go-to spot for West Phoenix (I live in Chandler). Depending on your goal Bobby Q's has it - nice bar, nice restaurant, and nice club on the side.

Club: I've gone to the club twice now on Friday (not sure the hours). Earlier in the night it is rather interesting (in a good way). The way that I describe it as - someone brought in their iPod and put it on shuffle. They play country, hip-hop, rap, alternative, oldies, rock, and disco all in one sitting. This makes for an interesting dynamic as many people who want to dance to Toby Keith's ""I love this bar"" probably don't want to dance to the follow-up song of Soulja Boy's ""Kiss me through the phone.""

Except me of course - I stay and dance to whatever is playing.

With that said, the crowd is generally older. I was boogying down with a lady that was 70+ and having a ball. Later in the night (read: after 10pm) the crowd changes to an urban crowd and has a crowd that is complimentary to that music.",3,0,2

When I asked about a different chocolate item instead, I was told by the waitress that it had peanuts in it (which I'm not allergic to but I know many others are).

I have to say that I cannot argue with the great reviews. The atmosphere is fun and the prices were decent. I ordered the brisket with mac and cheese, BBQ beans, and pecan coleslaw. The hubby ordered the brisket, pulled pork, shoestring fries and roasted veggies. The meats was amazing, so tender and moist. The BBQ sauce had the perfect flavor, not too tangy but not too sweet, and also not too thick. And the sides, OMG sooooo good. The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy, the beans were sweet and meaty, and the coleslaw was creamy, refreshing, and the pecans were a nice contrast. The hub let me try his fries and although they were very small and thin, they had a good flavor and I loved that some were soggy (I love soggy, greasy fries). Oh and how could I forget, they give you cornbread cakes before your dinner arrives. They were very tasty. They also give you mini hot doughnuts with cinnamon and sugar at the end of your meal. They were good, however, a little dry. I think they could have used more flavoring in the dough or maybe some sort of icing to dip them in. My only other complaint is that our waitress was a bit slowing in refilling our water and bringing a box along with our check. I would say that this place definately lives up to the hype and positive reviews. However, living in Maricopa, it takes close to an hour to get to Bobby Q's.

Back home (San Diego), the best bbq place to dine at is Phil's BBQ.  This place is 100 times better than Phil's.  We ordered the ""Whole Hog Heaven"" and it was plenty for two.  Their pulled chicked, brisket, ribs and beef ribs are delicious and came with 3 sides.  The Mac N Cheese (Yummy), the beans (Tasty) and the roasted corn (excellent) were a hit.

Paloma was our wonderful waitress, very knowledgeable about the the manner in which they age the beef, when they cut the steaks, and with what they grill it.  When the steak arrived it was accompanied by grilled vegetables, and a loaded baked potato, which the exterior had been rolled in seasalt while baking.  The steak was grilled perfectly, mouth watering tender piece of heaven.  I would be remiss if I do not mention the rolls of tender Brisket snuggled in a deep fried flour tortilla, it had a wonderful taste of Carne Machaca, so tasty.

Today, the stars aligned and we (wife and son) drove down here to meet Kate and her husband for a late lunch.  This place has always piqued my interest, and honestly, I'm not sure why I never had lunch\/dinner here before.  We drove down and met them at 2pm.

Kate and her husband were already there and grabbed us a table and high chair for our son Bill.  They had ordered Some Q-Rolls (basically an egg roll stuffed with smoked brisket) and some drinks already and offered me up a Q-Roll.  These things were good!  They serve them with chipotle and a bbq sauce.  I could definitely see myself eating a whole order of these things.  

I had read some reviews of this place and it sounded like most people enjoyed the ribs.  Who doesn't like ribs?  I decided to go with the 2 Rib Combo (St. Louis and baby back) which came with 2 sides.  I chose ranch beans and french fries for my sides.  Had a Diet Pepsi to drink.  My wife ordered a brisket sandwich and some mac and cheese for her side.  Pretty much ordered the fries and mac and cheese for our son.  You will have to read Kates review about what she and her husband ordered ;-).  Before they bring out your food, they give you a basket of cornbread.  This stuff was great!  I ate 2 pieces of it and could have ate more.  Anyways....on to the main dishes.  Here is how everything was...............

Rib Combo-  Delicious!  These ribs were so tender they fell off the bone.  I know some BBQ purists will say that ribs should not fall off the bone, but I don't give a shit...these ribs were delicious!  I ate the baby backs first.  They were awesome!  They came covered in minimal sauce so the meat really stood out.  I dug straight in with my hands and would just pick pieces of meat off the bone and savor every bite.  They were delicious and I can see why so many people order them here.  After the baby backs, I got into the St. Louis style ribs.  These were not as good as the baby backs, but they were still pretty damn tasty.  They were cooked so well, that even up at the cartilage portion, there was minimal of it and you could pick through and get every single little morsel of meat.  All that was left on the plate was pretty much bones and a few pieces of cartilage.  These ribs were 5 star ribs!

Sides-  This is where I was a little let down.  I love, love, love some good beans.  I prefer some baked beans, lots of sauce, cooked well done so they are thick, and lots of scraps of meat throughout.  These beans had some meat in them, but they were ""ranch style"" beans and just alright....a little runny.  The sauce was good enough to hold them together, but I have had much better beans elsewhere and would not get these again.  The portion was skimp too!  It was like 5 spoonfuls worth.  The fries were really thin shoestring fries.  They were pretty good.  My son loved them...he loves pretty much any french fry.  They are his favorite food, by far!  The problem with really thin shoestring fries is that they tend to get hard\/cold fast.  They were still pretty good though and I would get them as a side again.  Really big portion of them, too!

My wife gave me a piece of her brisket from her sandwich.  It was legit.  She thought that her brisket sandwich was a little bit too plain\/boring though.  The side of mac and cheese was good.  Really cheesy, Velveeta type mac and cheese.  Decent portion size too.  Not sure why the beans were such a skimp portion.  Everything else was hooked up!  Oh yeah..when you are done with your meal they provide you with some free mini donuts.  A bit skimp (3 tiny donuts for 3 people), but free so I can't complain.  They tasted like a lemon pound cake, deep fried and then rolled in sugar.  I could mow down a dozen!  They were delicious!  I just wish they maybe gave you 3 per person...then we would be talking!

Service was great!  They had multiple people servicing our table throughout the whole meal and everyone was on point!  I think even the manager came by to ask how everything was.  Conversation was great, too.  It was the first time Kate and her husband met my wife and son.  A good time was had by all!

Will I be back?  Yes, at some point for sure.  The ribs were absolutely fantastic, and with the right choice of sides, this is a damn fine BBQ meal and a potential 5 star joint!  It wasn't the cheapest lunch ($63.00 after tax\/tip), but for my first time here, the amount of food,  and the people I was with, it was worth it!   I'm sure I will be back before too long.",6,2,3

It was dark when we headed out and their location put them about 8 miles away from our hotel.  As we headed into the area of town it is in, we began to worry that we had been given bad directions, but sure enough, past the high school here was this crazy, big building housing some of the best bar-b-que I've ever had.  It has a vast parking lot and as noted, is quite large.  Certainly larger than most bar-b-que joints I've been to.  We were greeted promptly and chose to eat in the bar area rather than wait 20 min for a table.  The fact that there was a wait at 7:00 PM on  a Thursday night again says something about how good this place is.  We were seated in a side by side booth near the bar, quite comfortable.  Patrick Buckley was our wait person, and should be teaching hospitality he was so good.  I had the baby back ribs and my wife had the ""Smoasted"" half chicken.  They started us with their amazing home made corn bread, and the meal came quickly behind.  Portions were good sized and the meal left us happy, happy, happy and waddling back to our hotel.  Although stuffed, we couldn't help ourselves and took an order of peach cobbler to go.  And, if that is not enough, before you leave they hand you bag of little home made sugar donuts they call ""Thank Q's"".  All of this and a full bar too.  I highly recommend going to Bobby Q's.

The restaurant had me at the name but it didn't hurt that they made Yelps 100 places to eat list. What does one do when they find themselves in Phoenix for the first time ever? Head over to Bobbie Q, of course. I came here for one reason and one reason only. Baby back ribs. I do love my baby backs. There is a pretty large parking lot to fit all the hungry BBQ lovers in one place. As I walked in and smelled the smoky goodness, the hostess in the front handed my party of three a bag of freshly made cinnamon sugar donuts while we waited a few short minutes for a table. Like a child who's been offered desert before dinner, I gleefully followed the hostess to our table whilst munching on my sugary donuts. Our waiter took our drink orders and I decided on the baby backs with a side of potato salad and mac and cheese. 

After what seemed like a forever of eyeing and sniffing my neighbors meals, our plates came out. The full rack of baby backs were huge. The photo does not do it justice. Talk about a bang for your buck! They smelled amazing as the smokey aroma filled my lungs. I went in with my knife and realized how easy the cut was. There is hours of love put into these ribs because the first bite just melted in my mouth. The best thing about these ribs...they are not overly sauced. You can ask for extra BBQ and add as needed, but the meat is not masked with sauce. I got through about half of the tender rack of ribs before I realized that I still had two bowls piled high with mac and cheese and potato salad. I used the complimentary corn bread with butter to create potato salad and mac and cheese sammies and inhaled my sides. The mac and cheese was so creamy with a distinct sharp cheddar flavor. I wish that the cheese was a little more gooey than creamy, but the flavors where there. The potato salad had good flavor and great textures. It paired really well with the sweet cornbread. Heads up, this place won't do you well if you are on the diet. This is one cheat meal you will not regret. 

The service was pretty impressive. Our waiter gave suggestions and replaced our drinks with new ones before we finished the original. Our food was served hot and when we were tipping over from being too full, he brought out to go boxes to pile our leftovers in. One of the managers was walking around in the restaurant and checking on tables throughout our meal. We gave kudos to the chef when he asked us about our experience. I didn't imagine Phoenix to be known for BBQ, but I was not disappointed with what I got. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating (with a sprinkling cooling system) with big enough tables to feel at ease. As I walked out, another bag of cinnamon donuts were handed to me and I vouched to be back. 5\/5 overall experience!",44,32,48

First the hostess could not answer any of our questions about happy hour.. we asked if it was just in the bar area.. had no clue, sat us in the main dining room and then told our waitress.. Apparently it was one of those restaurants were happy hour is in the bar only (which I really don't understand).. anyway our waitress said she'd give us happy hour prices, but didn't understand that we also wanted to order dinner, (people don't eat dinner in the bar?).. Maybe it was new-training staff day or something.. 

We were given cornbread to start which was good, but just crumbled in your hand.. then my friend got the Poboy Catfish sandwich, not impressed, said it was so freaking dry the fish and everything.. I had better luck with my pulled-pork sandwich.. However, it was a huge mess to eat, which I understand that just how it is, but I had no silverware to try and help.. I got fries on the side and I love fries, eat them all the time.. but these were covered with grease, not just your normal greasy fries but had enough they created a puddle, just too much for me.

Overall the food was okay (say no to the catfish).. I would go back for another pork sandwich but with a side of potato salad instead",2,1,1

First off I was really excited about the mac n cheese since so many people said it was amazing.  I was severely disappointed and agree with another reviewer who said it tasted like velveeta.  I'm convinced that's exactly what it was.  The beans tasted like watered down canned baked beans.  Okay, now that the bad is out of the way let me tell you about the good.

We ordered the Q rolls as recommended and we weren't disappointed.  Both sauces were tasty.  We couldn't decide on what to get so we went with hog heaven to try a bit of everything.  We chose the St. Louis ribs, the beef ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  Our sides were mac n cheese, beans, and roasted corn.  We had to ask for cornbread.

The cornbread was good, on the caky side but still good.  The roasted corn was very good, I recommend it.  The brisket and pulled pork were definitely up to par.  I grew up on both.  They weren't quite my dad's, but still worthy of recommendation.  Both ribs were fall off the bone.  I hadn't has St. Louis ribs before and I wont get them again.  They were on the spicy side, which I personally don't prefer.  The beef ribs were very tasty and I would order them again.

After waiting for some boxes we started to look around at the other tables.  The baked potatoes look awesome, stuffed to the hilt of goodness.  They also had vegetables.  No mac n cheese or beans in sight.  We'll definitely follow suit next time.

All in all we were pleased with the experience.  The main food was done right and the restaurant and atmosphere was great.  The service was definitely to our liking.  The 10% off from yelp was also a bonus :)

We are both huge fans of honey bears and their sauce, although as of late the ribs haven't been fall off the bone.  We are considering buying honey bears' sauce and getting Bobby Q's beef ribs to go without the sauce.",3,0,0

Long version: 

Ambiance: i was impressed with this restaurant as soon as we stepped in. It reminds me of the Lucille's BBQ chain in decor and ambiance - classy yet family friendly, with southern comfort and hospitality. Their menu even has a truck on the cover.

Service: Excellent. All of the waitstaff was attentive and courteous. Our waitress explained the history of the restaurant to us since we told her we were first time visitors. 

When our party of three told her we were planning on splitting a whole rack of baby back ribs, we assumed we would get a large plate of whole ribs and then three plates. Instead, we got three separate plates portioned with 3 equal parts of ribs and the sides distributed evenly as well. Such an unexpected and very much appreciated gesture, considering that ribs are messy enough as it is!

Food: AMAZING! 

Sweet Tea ($2): Refreshing and sweet, but not in excess.

Corn Bread (free): The only thing served that I didn't enjoy. If you like dense, oily cornbread ""patties"", this might be your thing.

Cajun Shrimp ($11): The shrimp is marinated in cajun seasonings and beer and it is accompanied by garlic bread. The slightly alcoholic flavor paired well with the shrimp and cajun spices and the garlic bread was buttery, crispy, and not overwhelmingly flavored.

Baby Back Ribs ($26): The best bbq I've ever had in my life! To be fair, I'm not a huge bbq connoisseur, but the ribs are succulent, tender, flavorful and the bbq sauce adds a tangy flavor. The meat falls clean off the bone.

Shoestring fries (comes with ribs): They are extra skinny and salted to perfection - my favorite type of fries. Scrumptious.

Mac & cheese (comes with ribs): Creamy, cheddary with a delicious consistency. The BEST kind of mac and cheese to accompany a rack of ribs.

Thank Q Donuts: When you leave, they give you fresh, warm cinnamon donuts - and a lot too! They gave us 6 for our party of 3. An awesome touch.

This will be my new go-to bbq joint from now on :)

Tip: If you check in with yelp or foursquare and tell your waitress, they will give you 10% off your entire check. Be sure to tell the waiter before you ask for the check!",7,2,1

On to the food.  Ray suggested the Q-Rolls appetizer, and it didn't disappoint.  They're like flautas made with brisket, accompanied by two dipping sauces.  Simply Amazing!

Ray also recommended the whole hog entree with brisket, pulled-pork and baby backs.  It was large enough for my wife and I to share.  Delicious and filling.  My daughter ordered the half chicken plate, and their fries are superb.

We finished it off with a peach cobbler, and to our surprise, we were presented with a bag of Thank-Q's (accompanying our check), which were freshly made dough balls coated in cinnamon & sugar.  Very good!

1.  The huge mega fight this weekend is a hoax.  
2.  Bobby Q is the REAL DEAL for the style of BBQ it is.  I have eaten at BBQ all over the USA.  I know there are different types for each different region too. This place is very fantastic.  

The cute server Megan did a fantastic job explaining the menu.  She was on top of the drinks and asked us if we needed anything at the right time is seemed.  Very happy with the Megan.  Great job kiddo.

The food was really good.  I am not sure if Bobby Q is a certain style.  I have to research that a bit.  We ordered some little rolls that reminded me of taquitos and some onion thing too.  The onion thing was good.  The little rolls were out of this world.  They came with a BBQ sauce and a chipotle sauce too.  There were six and that was perfect for the three of us.  

We ordered a platter that Megan explained to us.   The platter came with two types of ribs, pulled pork and brisket.  I got the side of veggies.  The others got beans and mac and cheese.  I requested a vinegar base BBQ sauce because that is what I love.  The other guys got a molasses based sauce.  

Food tasting time.  I sampled the brisket first and holly f n sugar jiminy Christmas batman.  That brisket was very good.  I moved on to sample both of the ribs styles we ordered and they were awesome.  Falling off the bone.  The pulled pork was great with my vinegar based sauce too.  The cornbread was really good too. 

The meal was really good.  I am impressed and can not believed I lived close to this place and never tried it.  I like this place and recommend it to anyone.  Please remember food is subjective and likes are different.  We have seen a good boom over the last handful of years in BBQ here.  They are all different styles too.  Texas style, Memphis style and so on.  Like I said give this place a try.

3\/3 Stars: BEST BBQ I have ever had! Everything was soft, smooth, and melt in your mouth! The brisket is a MUST TRY! And make sure you get a burnt end!!! I've never had a better bite of brisket than that burnt end. Even after I ate the burnt end my mouth was watering for more. The mac & cheese was extremely creamy and delicious. The mash potatoes were also extremely creamy and delicious. It's very rare that I like mash potatoes without gravy but this was amazing! There wasn't even bacon bits on the mash potatoes and it was still delicious! Pulled pork was so soft it almost had the consistency of the mash potatoes. Ribs fell off the bones and were delicious. Fried chicken fillet was very crispy and juicy and was covered is delicious gravy. The only thing that wasn't for me was the BBQ chicken. The Sunday family feast could feed more like 2 normal people. The free mini doughnuts at the end were hot, fresh, and delicious as they fall apart between your fingers as you pick up the super fresh sucker that was fried probably 10 seconds before it got to you. Simply put, food here is amazing and was worth the $40 taxi ride there from the JW Marriott Dessert Ridge and the $40 taxi ride back.

Well, we finally did.  Long time Phoenicians will remember this as the old Bobby McGees with costumed, singing waiters.

It's a rustic-looking, galavanized tin building with lots of tangled plants growing around it under what is one of the last stands of eucalyptus trees in the valley; it's cool - makes you feel like you are some place else.

I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in.  I didn't know what to expect, and the decor is more elegant than I would have expected, yet with shabby chic touches.  Some tables have chairs on one side and banquettes on the other - something different.  It's very pretty.

The menu is pretty standard for a barbeque place.  I went straight for the baby backs (half-rack, $16.00), my favorite.  Hubs ordered two meats ($17, I think) pulled pork and beef brisket.  Our waitress was nice, but a little unpolished, very valley-girl, yet helpful and attentive.  She plopped a basket with two round pieces of cornbread and whipped butter on our table - delish cornbread.  Beer comes with a frozen glass - a nice touch. 

He ordered a wedge salad - generous helping of chunky blue cheese over ice berg lettuce with bacon and onion strings.  

Sides are standard - shoestring fries that aren't really shoestring, beans, mac and cheese, pecan coleslaw that we almost tried.  We both got the fries and beans. Beans have a little bit of meat in them, and a bit of zip, but are nothing outstanding.

The ribs, however, were superb.  I put my fork in between rib one and two and the first bone basically fell on to my plate.  I had to nibble the meat off only a couple of the bones - other than that it melted off the bone.  The flavor was perfect - the meat flavor comes through the not too sweet, not too tart, smoky sauce.  

Hubs thoroughly enjoyed his pork and beef as well.  The sides were so, so - we will try different ones next time.

We were too full for desert, but received two little - fritters or donuts (couldn't understand the valley-speak) in a paper bag to go.  Fished them out and ate them - little bits of heaven right there.

We will definitely be back for ribs.  It's a very pleasant, dressy casual restaurant and, a plus, it's on the west side!",2,0,2

The place is a bit hard to see from the road, and if you are not careful you will drive right past it.  The parking lot is a good size with plenty of parking, provided i was there for an early dinner so this may not be true during peak hours.

The entrance to the restaurant is on the side of the building.  inside there is a small bar and a nice dinning area.  You can see the chickens on the rotisserie in the back, and the smell makes you instantly hungry.  We were seated near the back and our waiter (Riley) was quick to greet us and make sure we were doing good.  Not knowing what to get Riley made a few suggestions for us to think about before taking out drink orders.  Most of us got the Bobby Q Amber Ale and one Strawberry Lemonade.

We decided to order the Whole Hog Heaven and a second order of ribs.  While we waited for our meal we had some of their fresh complementary corn bread and enjoyed our cold drinks.  Food came out in the right amount of time, not too long or too fast.  

All of the food was delicious and went well with the beer.  During our visit the staff was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.  Drinks never went empty and we had wet naps before we asked.  To finish everything off we got free doughnuts at the end.

We had q rolls and queso dip to start. I already knew I loved the q rolls, and while I liked the dip, it wasn't stellar (to me). My husband liked it though. 
My toddler got chicken tenders with fries and seemed to enjoy it, though she liked the bread from the queso dip more. 
I loved the Mac and cheese again, though my mother said it's not as good as her sister-in-law's...which I haven't tried, so I still love this one.

The time was around Thanksgiving. They offer smoked turkeys that are pretty much ingenious. One, they're smoked - so literally half the cooking is done for you. I can't stand putting an entire raw bird in an oven and waiting for it to cook for 234 hours. Well, I've never really done that, because I think I wouldn't like it much, as I hate waiting while I watch people poke, prod, and baste a raw behemoth and then put it in the oven for 234 hours. 

This thing was done in I think 2 hours. 2 hours!!! Brilliant. And better yet - it tasted phenomenal. The spice rub was so complementary to the meat it needed no sauce to make it a tasty experience.

The ratings and the reviews are all true. The best! My friend and I were in Phoenix for the weekend, and as soon as we checked in our hotel, we both were hungry and graving some BBQ. I personally was not expecting any good BBQ places nearby, we almost settled with a mediocre place at the Westgate shopping center! Glad my friend stumbled upon Bobby Q's. With over 1000+ reviews and still holding a 4.5 average rating, I came in with high expectations. 

My first thought when arriving was this place was pretty hidden, there is plenty of parking, the restaurant is big, and best yet, it smelled great from outside already! We were a little worried it was going to be busy and would have to wait a bit for lunch because of its popularity, but we got greeted and were seated right away! 

Our server Hunter greeted soon after and introduced himself and told us about Bobby Q and now they smoke their meats. He was extremely helpful and friendly and checks in on us frequently since he knew this was our first time. My friend and I each got the or own 3 meat combo which was only $25 and came with 2 sides! I chose the brisket, baby back ribs, and pulled pork with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. We also ordered their blonde ale beer, which was good refresher. 

We waited for our food, and were given corn bread. Which were amazing!! We had to stop ourselves before we got full from them. Our food came quicker than expected, and we were not disappointed. There was definitely more food than I was expecting. There was going to be leftovers for sure. Having the first bit was heaven and knew immediately this must've been the best BBQ I've ever had. Way better than the Wood Ranch here for sure. My favorite was the spicy BBQ that our server Hunter gave us. It had a little kick without it being to spicy. My friend and I enjoyed our plans until we were too full, which we barely ate half our plates. We were more than happy to have it for leftover dinner. 

Before leaving, Hunter gave us complimentary donuts, which were a great touch, but we were way to full to have any, so added it on to our leftover bag. 

Overall, this place was delicious! Service and food was excellent!  I will definitely have to stop by here when I come back to Phoenix.",1,2,2

Started with some great warm cornbread. Perfect size for a pre-meal snack...and just the right amount of sweetness. 

I ordered the 3-meat combo, for only $3 more than the 2-meat...great value!  I weigh in at 315lbs...and I didn't even GET to the 3rd meat - way too full. I got brisket as one of the meats - honestly, tasted like it was right off the smoker...that's NEVER the case in BBQ joints, it's always dry and flavorless by the time it gets to the table - not here folks, may as well been eating it right from the pit. Very impressive. 

Sides: hats off to the Chef, FINALLY...a BBQ place that has crafted their sides to be as good as their meats. And a special mention...the mac & cheese had great flavor! I also got the corn...tremendous. Can't wait to come back to try the other sides...

Energetic atmosphere, great staff, and tremendous food at a good value.

We came by in the early afternoon on a beautiful Saturday and there was zero wait which is perfect because we were starving. We had the choice of sitting outdoors or indoors but chose the latter because not only was it warm out but I saw customers sitting outside swatting flying bugs.

We ordered the whole hog heaven which is a platter where you choose two ribs, two meats, and three sides for $48. With the help of our waitress we decided to go with the baby backs and beef ribs, brisket and sausage for the meats, and the mac & cheese, ranch beans, and the shoestring fries for the sides. While we were waiting, we received complimentary cornbread. Moist, fluffy, buttery, and semi-sweet... these cornbreads were the best I've ever had! I'm sure they are SO bad for your health though but I could only live in the moment!

- Baby back ribs: May sound like a boring choice but nope. These were smoked to perfection and the meat fell off the bone. I was very impressed.
- Beef ribs: If I had to pick a favorite meat of the meal, the beef ribs would be it. These are finger-licking good with loads of meat, and even some bone marrow too. Just divine. Absolutely to die for. LOVE!
- Brisket: The first bite I had of the fatty brisket sent me to meat heaven. Succulent and explosive in taste. The leaner parts of the brisket was a touch dry and needed some extra barbecue sauce to fix that though.
- Sausage: Robust in flavor with a nice peppery kick.
- Mac & cheese: I'm not usually a fan of mac & cheese but these are great. I ate spoonfuls after spoonfuls. 
- Ranch beans: Smoky and savory. Love these beans. Again, best I've had. My favorite of the three sides!
- Shoestring fries: I'm generally prefer thick-cut fries but these were an exception. Impeccably fried and perfectly salted, these were very tasty and fun to pick at. Simple yet awesome.

After our incredibly satisfying feast (yes, we had leftovers for the next day!), we were given freshly fried cinnamon sugar doughnuts on our way out. They were amazing! OMG! The first bite of everything at Bobby Q was seriously like a party in my mouth. Every. Single. Thing. From start to finish.

Let's face it, when it comes to BBQ everyone has a different take, and I don't like the overly sweet, globs of sauce thrown on at the last minute, in spite of claims it been smoked for hours. I'm not that big on loud country music and I don't want to go to a Ho- Down. I'm hungry; I want real ribs with meat on the bone. Good portions, albeit, I'll order the full rack of St Louis style ribs next time. The Rib's here do fall off the bone; they have a sultry smoky flavor. Corn Bread that is probably the best you can get and Beans, we'll I might work on those, but I come for the Ribs. Bobby Q is easy to see with its big sign visible from I-17, but might not be the easiest to find the first time, once you drive into the private parking area, I feel better. Safer, it's good to read there is security, but I haven't noticed them. Then again, I go for dinner.
This is the only Rib place that makes my mouth water; the Rib's are deeply smoked and taste like someone cared because they have a passion for RIbs. The service has been just right, every time I've been there, and not too long waiting for the check. I don't mind spending time in a restaurant, but when the plate is clean I like to go.

Then I started reading the small print. Does not include tip, tax, $3 set up charge, etc. I decided to go there so I called. I told the girl where I was staying, lots of one way streets, etc. and asked for directions from my hotel. Lots of um's and ah's and she then asked me to wait until she got someone else on the phone. I almost hung up and then another dizzy girl picked up and she started stammering and stuttering without any clear directions, until she told me to wait until she got someone else on the phone, and I said, ""never mind"" and hung up. I went to the front desk at the hotel and the woman there gave me clear directions in about  2 minutes. I was on the phone with the two dingbats for about 15 to 20 minutes. I drove over and it took about 5 minutes to get there. I walked in and the restaurant was packed, so I went into the lounge to see if I could order in there. As I was walking about, I received ""hard"" looks from the guys on duty there, bouncers I guess. I looked at the jerk, turned around and went to the reception area and asked one of the young ladies how long it would take for a table for one. She said about an hour and a half. I asked her if she was serious and she said ""yes"", so I left. When I got back to the hotel, I tried to order take out without success. Even though it was before 9PM and the order form said that they delivered up to that time, they said they were not delivering. I gues it was because it was New Years Eve. When I went to the office to look for another restaurant, I met some UConn fans, and as I was talking with them about Bobby Q, they said that Bobby Q wasn't that great when compared to a few CT barbecue places or some Southern places they visited in Charlotte during another bowl game. The famous cornbread did not live up to its rep, so I felt better. Then, they asked if I wanted to try some of their food. They had a bunch of leftovers, that they weren't going to eat, and I had a microwave in my room. Like them, I wasn't impressed with either the food or the famous sauce.

Bobby Q's has always been known for its bar. The night life, has always been it calling card; now that has changed. 

Last night I took my wife there for an anniversary dinner we started off with a few drinks. Bar staff were friendly and attentive. My wife had the Chocolate martini, that's a desert before dinner.  We had reservations at 7:30, and we were seated at 7:32. The place was packed, so when you go, get a reservation. We started with Cajun shrimp, good serving, and it was a short wait for the appetizer. Good quality corn bread was brought out with our appetizer. We really wanted to try the prime rib. I researched, and found that Bobby Q's has been voted the best, and they are right. Prime rib was tender, and you almost don't need a knife. The flavor was outstanding. I like a lot of people like horseradish, and they have the creamy type, and fresh ground, and it is fresh. When you bit in, and feel the heat in your nostrils.. That is fresh. The other side were as good, and the pecan coleslaw was outstanding! One person I talked to about Bobby Q's said it was a bit pricey, but the quantity and quality of food you get is worth it. Our server (I wish I remembered her name) was great. She was there when you want her, and not when you don't. Desert was apple cobbler, tart apples, crunchy crusts, and good vanilla ice cream; Granny would be proud. 
The only one thing that was not to my taste, and this is not the fault of the restaurant is the noise.. A lot of people drinking, eating, and talk tends to do that, but the swap of that food for a little noise, it's worth it..

The first time was amazing. The ribs were great and the service was alright. I left feeling positive that I found a new favorite restaurant. Today was the polar opposite. I ordered the steak sandwich and it was horrendous. I don't know what it was about the flavor but it started to make me really really sick. So much so that I had to get up and go to the restroom because I felt that I was going to vomit. Thankfully I didn't, I stopped eating the steak, which if you take out the flavor issues, it was cooked properly, and the texture was spot on. 

Another thing which I found quite unprofessional was that the plate wasn't wiped.  It's not a huge deal but if you are a good restaurant you should show that when a costumer first sees the food. I got a mess of meat splatter and grease. I know it sounds trivial but the little things count. We eat with our eyes first, and it can totally change our experience from positive or negative. 

Am I going to go back? Maybe, $18 for a piece of steak, garlic bread, and mushrooms is a steep price to pay for something that makes me sick.",0,0,0

Ordered the big sample platter $35 i think, and it was enough for all of us. 2 different kinds of ribs, 2 different kinds of beef, and slow roasted chicken plus 3 different sides. The food was great. You could argue that other places make a single type of BBQ better but as a whole sample of BBQ, it doesn't get better than this. The portions of the side dishes could be bigger. We got there before 6pm and had no wait... once we left though, there were lot's of people waiting.

Their bar was rockin'. They have happy hour 'till 6p. Apparently this is the spot for drinks after work. Lot's of hot looking women. I will definitely be back, either with the family or with friends for the bar.

After reading the bad reviews I noticed a trend... they were written mostly by out-of-towner's that compare this place to joints in St. Louis and such. If you're some kind of a BBQ snob, of course you've had better... get over it. The BBQ is better than you're going to get at most full service restaurants that happen to have BBQ on the menu. As for those that complained about occasional bad service... have you seen the wait for a table after 6pm? Obviously they're doing something right. People have bad days sometimes.",1,0,0

All I'm able to find is a Lone Star, Black Angus, and Outback Steakhouse.  Boo.  I notice the Bobby Q off the I-17 and look it up on Yelp.  Pretty good reviews, and they serve steak!  So off we go.

What we ordered:
Strawberry Qlada & Mudslide on the Rocks
Q-Rolls
Wedge Salad
Ribeye Steak (with cole slaw and potato salad)
Prime Rib with Shrimp Chimichurri (with roasted corn and ranch beans)

My Strawberry Qlada was delicious (I like the coconut on the rim of the glass), but the mudslide was missing an ingredient (easily fixed).  The Q-Rolls weren't anything spectacular, but they did taste good.  We shared the wedge salad, which they split it for us and I was thankful!  It was enough as a starter, and it was also very good.  

The ribeye was amazing!  When it arrived, the bf asked for steak sauce, but after taking a bite of the steak, he decided that the steak sauce was not necessary.  It was so juicy and flavorful, I was a little disappointed I didn't order it for myself.  However, my prime rib was also juicy (not as thick a cut as Lawry's, but pretty good anyway!) and the shrimp was also nice addition.  The sides were all very good, but I loved my roasted corn the best!  

I realized there were two things missing from our dinners after we left the restaurant.  The ribeye should have come with cornbread and the prime rib should have come with a jumbo baked potato.  I don't think I could have eaten the potato, but I would have liked to have tasted that cornbread.

Our server, Smitty, was EXCELLENT.  He was friendly and attentive, and he made sure we were well taken care of.  He definitely made our overall dining experience a positive one.

We'll definitely come back again.",0,0,0

First off I love the atmosphere and decor of the place. Upscale bayou? can that exist? seems like they were able to do it. Plus its nice and dark and comfortable.

One thing I recall is how great the service is EVERY TIME i go. Three different visits.. three different servers.. top notch each time.

Food!

Appetizers

Wings:
Delicious! These are smoked, fried, and then sauced. I hate(strong word on purpose) baked wings. I thought I was going to hate these but the combo of the smoked then fried works amazingly. It allows them to only flash fry for crisp. This keeps the wings juicy and plump but with the fried crispy skin that wings should have.

Brisket Fire-Pie:
Don't bother :\/ I knew this was risky but I had a pizza craving. Normally BBQ pizzas have way to much BBQ sauce. This was the opposite it had very little sauce.. so little that it had no flavor impact leaving you wondering what that funky after taste is.

Cornbread:
Strong corn flavor.. not overly sweet. Could feel the grease\/butter levels killing me not so slowly. But was good to the taste buds.
-----------------
BBQ

Pulled Pork:
Nice smoke flavor and good moisture content without being overly fatty. Not the best I've had but no complaints.

Brisket:
Same feelings as the pork. It was good and executed properly but certainly not the best I've ever had. None of the BBQ was overly salty but some of it was to far on the other end of the scope and could have used some more salt. There was no real bark on the brisket which was a little disappointing.

Smoke Links:
I didn't care for these at all. They were to fatty for my taste and needed more... something in your face. I think everyone agreed these were the our least favorite items.

Baby Back Ribs:
Very tasty ribs but surprisingly not my favorite out of the three offered. These are usually the safe best for best ribs at whatever place your at. There was something out of whack with the meat itself. It failed to really pick up the smoke flavor maybe? They were moist and tender and fall off the bone. But fall off the bone on the side of smoked to long.

Beef Ribs:
Surprisingly lean for beef ribs. Since they were so lean these could have used a little more time in the smoke unlike the baby backs. Beef ribs take a much longer time to break down to perfection.

St Louis Style Ribs:
YUM! Best ribs on the menu. Next time this is all I will order in the rib category. Flavor was great., meat was great., still a little over done but it took nothing away from them. I would come back for this alone.
-------------------

Sides

Mac & Cheese:
Delicious but they went the fake cheese route. It is hard to make good mac and cheese the old fashion way. Its hard in small quantity let alone restaurant quantity. I would rather have them understand this and serve it with primarily fake cheese and be tasty then try and do from scratch and serve me curdled cheese fail.

Pecan Cole Slaw:
Also sexy! Crisp, cold, refreshing, and not soggy. The nuts were a nice addition but if they could have somehow brought it out more in the dish it would have been ever better.

Potato Salad:
Mmmmmm. This was great and a tie for best side dish with the mac and cheese. Be warned.. This is HEAVY. Its probably 90% mayo but its potato salad.. its not healthy don't try and make it healthy. They did it right. It took a year off my life and I loved every bite of it. Its the bad years anyway! Creamy, perfect amount of mustard, great seasoning, lots of fresh dill.

Beans:
Interesting.. Sweet but not grossly sweet like some. Smokey but almost to a crazy level. When I tasted this I honestly felt like I was eating something with a liquid tobacco smoke flavor. It also had a lot of what was probably the BBQ beef in it. Not sure what I thought about this.

Planned Return Order:
Wings
St Louis Ribs
Mac & Cheese
Potato Salad
Pecan Coleslaw

Get these if nothing else and I would be shocked if you didn't leave grinning ear to ear.

Pros:
Great Service
Great Atmospheric
Acceptable Great to OK dish ratio
10% off for yelpsters!

Cons:
Awkward Location
Awkward Parking
Pricey

For those still stumped by the ""how can fall off the bone be bad"" the best test for ribs done correctly would be ribs tender enough to pull apart with your teeth but ones you can pick up and hold by a bone and not have fall apart. If you pick up ribs by the bone and the meat stays on the plate and the bone comes up clean its been neglected. I know this sounds crazy to most but when you have enough ribs done properly you will taste and appreciate a rib that was on as long as it was supposed to be and no longer.",3,2,3

Although overwhelmed when the platter arrived to our table, the boyfriend and I found ourselves quickly working our way through it. We had enough leftovers to stuff one person senseless. 

Do yourself a favor and opt for the baby back ribs and the st louis ribs. You get more bang for your buck this way instead of going for the beef back ribs which they will only serve you two of with the Whole Hog.

1. Brisket - Average in flavor.  Nice and moist, but the only seasoning was the sauce (sauce was good...sweet Carolina style).  Needless to say I drenched the meat in sauce.  Overall, I found the meats to be smokeless and pretty bland. 

2. Ribs - See above.

3. Cornbread - Very tasty sweet cornbread.  My favorite.

4.Mashed Potatoes - They nailed this side dish.  Smooth and creamy, with a peppery overtone.  I wish I would have just ordered a plate of this as my meal.

5. Grilled Corn - Tasted more ""burned"" than ""grilled"".  I didn't even finish it (which is unheard of since I often think about the kids starving in Ethiopia).

6. Frosted Lemonade - I think I had 4 glasses before I passed out from sugar overdose.  These things are REALLY good!

6. Dessert donuts - tasty, need more of these.

7.  Service - Excellent, no complaints here.

We had the baby backs, sirloin steak and prime rib. Also baked potatoes, coleslaw and corn (buttery roasted corn shaved off the cob). And of course the corn bread and donuts. Everything was DELICIOUS! I was skeptical about getting the prime rib because at many places it can be really fatty and you end up not getting much meat. Not here! The waiter (Josh) assured me it was a lean cut of meat, and it was! Very tender and flavorful. The steaks were perfectly cooked and the ribs were tender with not too much sauce. (The ribs were not ""mush"" like other reviewers have said.) They also treated us to a piece of yummy banana cream pie as a birthday treat (the crust was thick and nutty) - tastefully presented with no annoying restaurant staff choir. It was very nice. 

All that being said, the outside of the building and the inside don't match. We used to go to Bobby McGees so I did sort of expect the old Bobby McGees atmosphere - with old bathtubs and mismatched furniture... it was a goofy, fun place back in the day. Now the interior is just nice. Not that that's bad.

All I can say is meh. The food was extremely bland from the cornbread to the cloe slaw and even every meat on the sampler platter everything lacked any kind of flavor. This was extremely suppressing based on all of the raving reviews this place has. Maybe the cooks had an off day. There were two exceptions though the Mac and cheese was hands down the best I have ever had at a BBQ place and the Q rolls were amazing. Service was okay, but there was one thing that really made me uneasy about the place while eating I was watching the bar back cutting limes. First he wasn't wearing any gloves which is gross seeing that those limes go straight into drinks. But he then cut himself on the slicer, I could tell by his expression, he looked down at the cut and then continued to slice more limes. This really disgusted me so I decided to tell a manager. She came right But when I told her what had happened I really felt like she could care less. When we were finished talking she didn't even go remove the limes from the bar but went off to do something else. The food was definitly a dissapointment especially for the $50 price tag but again everyone has an off day, but I definitely won't be back because of what I witnessed and how little was done to fix it.",0,0,0

I was pretty hungry being on the plane all day, so I figured I would order a ton of food. For starters, I ordered the Q Rolls and Cajun Shrimp. Of course I had to try their cornbread they give out for free. I went with two orders of the three meat combo which includes pulled pork, brisket, ribs, sausage, and chicken.
The Q Rolls are definitely the few highlights of the meal. They were meaty, greasy, and a satisfying crunch on the outside. The queso dip that comes with it makes it even better. The cajun shrimp were Ok, but Im a dummy thinking arizona is going to have good shrimp. The cornbread was really moist. I was only going to have one bite, but ended up having half of the entire piece. Now for the meats. Dont get me wrong as I highly critisize the meal. This is much better than Rudy's or Dickey's (gross). But I was expecting something on the same line as Lockhart, TX (which I foolishly continue to expect when going to so claimed 'amazing' barbecue joints.) THe ribs were fall of the bone (not my favorite style, although some people like that). The pulled pork was soggy. The brisket had some good points, but the bark was soggy (they probably use foil to speed up the cooking process). The sausage was OK, but nothing special. It certainly could have been spicier. The chicken totally took me by surprise. It was moist, tender, and had a nice smoke to it. Normally I wouldnt order chicken over the usual trinity, but they do a good job. All the meats had this sweet taste to it, and didnt have much of a strong smoke flavor (besides the chicken). The BBQ sauce on the table just added to the sweetness. 

The sides were all crap, expect the mac and cheese. That was actually pretty good. Everything else lacks any real flavor or craft. For dessert, they gave us some in house donuts. I like the idea of this, but they are arent that spectacular. My friend wanted coffee, even after the waiter said it as horrible. It was probably the most watery coffee Id ever tasted. I know coffee is not something someone should order at a BBQ joint, but at least you know ahead of time.

I imagine people who think this place is amazing either eat bbq from dickeys or have never visited Texas. Either way, I wouldnt come back here again on my own time and would advise anyone you can to go to Little Miss BBQ instead. Thats how BBQ should be.",3,0,1

When it comes to BBQ I find it, like others, hard to get quality BBQ. If I do venture into something new trying to find that diamond in the rough I have 3 staples to sample: Baby Back Ribs, Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket. I also judge beans and some carb. 

I ordered the staples with beans and Mac & Cheese. I wasn't given an option for wet or dry BBQ. I had to ask as the bartender was walking away to make mine dry and put it on the side. 

The meal started with a very moist and greasy corn bread basket. The greasy texture made me use a fork just to get it anywhere close to my mouth. 

Moments later my dry BBQ arrived and the server started walking off when I had to ask for BBQ where I learned there were 3 options: regular, spicy or a third that I don't recall. Nice to know that NOW. Thanks bartender. 

The ribs looked good but pulling apart showed they were not smoked at all. Just a HIGHLY salty rub and grill time. The pull apart can be achieved by many alternative means. 

The pulled pork was sweet, quality pork, but the exact same texture as what I get out of my crockpot. There was no bark, no sign of a smoke ring, nothing to indicate this was BBQ. 

The brisket is the only reason I gave this place 2 stars. They gave me 4 slices of what I would call Prime grade and perfectly smoked. The brisket showing a solid smoke ring and bark and it barely held together which is well beyond many other joints. 

The Mac and Cheese are almost exactly like Kraft Blue Box, so not original at all. The beans however were al dente and smoky sweet. Again, nothing special. 

To top off the epic failure in service, there was no wet nap offered or within sight. Really?? I just wanted outta there and to let others know, order a steak or prime rib to go.",1,1,1

I've also had their food at other catered events and it was equally awesome then, too. I've impressed that a BBQ-based company is so accommodating of vegetarian diets and that their vegetarian food is actually really good!

We had a Mexican meal catered for our wedding. Our guests raved about the meats and I really enjoyed the enchiladas and guacamole. The servers were good, the food was excellent, they went the extra effort to match their buffet display to our wedding colors, and the cost was far more reasonable than most wedding meals. If it hadn't been my wedding, I would have stuffed myself silly on the food it was so good.

I've also had the barbeque meal catering at a different event, and it was delicious! The servers were so accommodating as soon as they heard I was vegetarian (offering to grill up some other fare for me). The mac & cheese and biscuits were awesome.",2,1,0

Bobby Q is a very large old fashioned looking restaurant. I don't know how old it is but to me it looks a hundred years old with Giant Old Trees shading the parking lot. As you walk in you do get hit with an aromatic BBQ aroma. 

We were quickly seated and our server gave us a fast run down on Bobby Q. We learned that everything is made in house and the meats are smoked with mesquite wood. They also start everybody out with what I recognize as Johnny Cakes with soft whipped butter.

I had the BBQ Pulled Chicken Sandwich with Pecan Cole Slaw. The Chicken was falling apart tender and laced with sweetness but not too much. A small amount of skinny fried onions were added to my sandwich on a soft grilled roll. The coleslaw was drip free and fresh and crunchy.

My husband had a much better value item called the lunch sampler plate with 3 meats and a side. He enjoyed everything. I tried a taste of the brisket and for me it was too succulent and fatty but for my husband who likes fat he thought it was just right. My husband ate the macaroni and cheese I have to say it tasted like processed cheese. I didn't like the macaroni and cheese but I know most people do like this style.

I would say Bobby Q's is more like Kansas City style than anything else.  They drown the sauce all over the meats, in which hides the true flavors of the smoked meats.  I have heard about this place many times, and finally gave it a try since my co-worker raved about this place, and said it was voted as one of the best in AZ.  In which, I respectfully disagree BIG TIME.  That honor would go to Little Miss BBQ in Phoenix.  I would say even Rudy's, Joe's, and Famous Dave's is far superior.  So let's get into my review.

I came to this place on a Saturday afternoon with my wife and my brother.  We noticed the building off the I-17, it felt older and had a BBQ smell about it, in which I enjoyed.  The dining room was dark and  had an older feel to it.  We decided to sit outside.  One thing that I did notice is the chairs are very old and falling apart.  I had to move some chairs around cause a few of them had BBQ stains on them.  Anyways, I'm at a BBQ joint, so I don't let that stuff bother me, it's almost to be expected.  We ordered the Hog Heaven and fried chicken dish.  The Hog Heaven consisted of half a rack of spare ribs, 2 beef ribs, some pulled pork, and prime brisket.  It also came with 3 sides in which we ordered shoe string potatoes, mac and cheese and a baked potato.  There was also corn bread for the table.  My wife enjoyed her fried chicken dish, but thought the sides were a little bland and mashed potatoes could of used more butter and salt.  My experience  with the Hog Heaven was just ok.  When enjoying BBQ, I normally don't like ribs completely falling off the bone, and the pulled pork was completely doused with sauce, and the brisket was extremely tender.  I'm not trying to be a BBQ snob, but I like ""competition style"" BBQ.  Ribs should be tender, but hold up.  You should be able to take a bite and not completely fall off the bone, and the same with brisket.  It should be able to pull it apart and be tender and moist on the pallet.  The brisket completely fell apart and was too covered with too much BBQ sauce.  We were served two beef ribs, but one barely had any meat on it, (See Picture).  For 50.00 for the Hog Heaven, I truly didn't feel it was worth the price.  The sides were ok, but how hard is it to screw up fries, and a baked potato.  The mac and cheese was good though.  Overall, our experience was ok, nothing to rave about, but I'm glad I had a chance to experience Bobby Q and see what all the fuss was about.

In conclusion, I'm more of a sauce on the side kind of guy.  I truly enjoy BBQ and enjoy the smoked flavor and the tenderness of the meats.  The sauce should be on the side and help accentuate the meat, not completely covering the meats.  Why smoke BBQ for 6 to 15 hours if you are just going to ruin the flavor?  In the area, there aren't a lot of great BBQ places, but I would give this place another shot, I would just order the sauce on the side.  I love's Joe BBQ in gilbert, but I've had a bad experience, where the meat was a little dry, so I would give this a try again.",5,3,1

They came off the bone clean, were very tender, and had a nice smoky flavor. The pulled pork rivaled the ribs, and may have actually surpassed them in taste. The brisket was tender, but was lacking the flavor of the other two meats. It also seemed a little off in color as it was as it was much lighter than most I have had. Mac n' cheese was my choice of side and it was deliciously cheesy. I could devour bowl after bowl of that goodness. Also worth a mention is the donut they bring you after your meal.

The baby back ribs were good, but I feel like there wasn't enough meat and the meat didn't come off as easily as I hoped. The mac & cheese was BOMB, but my favorite was the corn.

Look out Joes BBQ!!! (And I love Joe's) When Bobby Q's opens this fall at Stapley and I-60 you are gonna take a hit.

Given the opportunity, we will revisit Bobby Q's when We're on that side of town.

(Kudos to our very pregnant and excellent waitress today, 15% tip to her and 15% tip to the baby. My wife just had her first Chemo treatment for breast cancer and is rapidly losing her hair, the great food and service really cheered her up today and she really needed that. Thank you!!!)",0,0,1

In any case, Bobby Q is a good BBQ place to go to in phx. Other than being in such a random location, the food is what you'd expect. I'm coming all the way from Gilbert and honestly there is one other BBQ spot in Gilbert, I'd also recommend.
I personally enjoy the ribs and fries at Bobby Q's though. I'm not a big fan of their pulled pork but that may just be me. I did like their mac and cheese and of course their check-in special! The little donuts at the end are also a nice treat.
The reason I am not giving them 4 stars is because my friend seemed to have gotten food poisoning after eating here. I am sure they keep things clean, but somehow something got through.
Again though, I'd still recommend this BBQ joint. Not too shabby, but not really WOW either.",0,0,0

I have definitely found my new favorite carnivorous dining place. 

My friend Don S. checked in here one day and I asked him if he was clubbing because I had been to the lounge with my cousins before but didn't know much about the restaurant since it had changed from Bobby McGee's back in the day. He laughed! Told me they have an amazing burger! Say what? Bobby Q is a five minute drive from my house! How did I not know this? 

I went last night with my son and let me tell you, one of the most pleasant dining experiences of my life! I ordered the smokehouse burger. It is 50 cents more than the regular burger and probably a hundred times better because it has bacon! Haha. I love my meat still pink in the middle and when I ask for something m.rare I would like it m.rare and preferably closer to the rare side. The chef hooked up my patty perfect! One of the best burger I have ever had! My little boy ordered the mac off the kids menu (love kids menus), and he loved it so much he ordered up a second helping! Sean our waiter was so kind and helpful and playful with the boy. It's so much more enjoyable when the staff is good with kids. Laura, who must have been management, came out to check on us mid meal and was also super sweet. She brought me out a sample of the brisket. Melty and delicious and bursting to the brim with flavor. She also told my son that if he tried the brisket she would bring him desert on the house! How cool is that?!? Of course he tried it, but more importantly he loved it! Then came.... Death by Chocolate! Its like an ice cream sandwich with brownie book ends! And so large that I only let Buddha tackle one part of it. 

I cannot wait to come back and try more off the menu! Oh did I mention that they give you free donuts at the end of your meal? I mean who can eat donuts after this kind of meal! But they are just as tasty the next morning! YUM!

So impressed!",11,6,10

Well....in a word...""underwhelmed"".  Should probably be one star.  It was extremely busy for a Sunday evening which I guess is a good sign and they seated me right away (party of one) so thumbs up there.  I ordered the wedge salad to start and what I got was a very cheap iceberg lettuce head with a sliced tomato and some cold greasy onion straws on the side.  See what I mean?  The menu made it sound like it was a specialty of the house!  Their ""homemade blue cheese dressing"" was more mayo than anything...couldn't taste any blue cheese in there.  Seriously, worse than a chain restaurant and a few dollars more expensive too.  The St. Louis ribs were an item that is particularly reviewed on yelp so I went for those with a baked potato and macaroni and cheese.  Taste was good, not spectacular but the real problem was the temperature...pretty close to room temp.  I knew I had been had by all the advertising for this place...more hype than substance.  The waitress asked how everything was and I started to say it was just ok and elaborate the problems but she quickly whisked away to another table.  I could tell she was working to the max so I let it slide.  Overall, a thumbs down.  There are a few other BBQ places in Phoenix so I'll look there next.",0,0,0

I've been jonesing all week to come check it out, but I figured I'd wait until my wife got into town. Well, I finally got my chance and I was giddy as a school girl. I was actually able to make a reservation through OpenTable on the Yelp app, and I'm sure glad we did. Upon our arrival at 5:30 the place was already packed, but by thetime we left at 7 there was a hoard of people flooding out into the street--and for good reason! Enough jibber-jabber--on to the food! I ordered the Three Meat Combo and that comes with two sides and some of BQ's Cornbread.

Sides:

Mac and Cheese- This might easily be the creamiest, most decadent Mac & Cheese I've ever had. They use something similar to Velveeta Cheese to coat it, and I'm not slamming Velveeta. It's so rich I couldn't finish it. 3.75*

Pecan Coleslaw- I'm very picky about my slaw; I don't want it too creamy, sweet, or bitter and this was absolutely perfect! I also loved the crunch you get from the little pieces of toasted Pecan they add to the top--I'm definitely adding that to my slaw the next time I make it. 5*

Cornbread- Excellent mix of a Northern\/Southern cornbread--it has the cakiness and slight sweetness if Northern, and the crust and stone-ground corn like a Southern; I could eat these everyday. 5* 

Meat:

St. Louis Ribs- These might be the best St. Louis Pork Ribs (other than mine) that I've ever had! The meat had a nice ""tug"" to it, but was still so tender, smokey and delicious! 5*

Beef Brisket- Juicy and flavorful this brisket was quite good--my only gripe is I wish it had a bit more smokiness to it. 4*

Pulled Pork- Another excellent job by BQ! Juicy, smoky and porky (just like me!) Everything you could want in Pulled Pork and then some. I piggled (sic) the whole lot of it! 5*

Dessert:

Sugar-Cinnamon Donuts- They give everyone at the table these tiny little donuts that they make fresh up front and they're fabulous; they had me at ""Cinnamon"". I guess you can just walk in and order a dozen for $3 if that's all your craving, too. 5*

Service & Ambiance- Good service from our server, Jessica. She was on top of things without being annoying. BQ is located in a building that looks like something you'd find in the middle of nowhere. The interior is mostly brick and wood causing the noise level in there to be deafening by the end of the night. They also keep it a bit too dark for my liking, but the decor is swell. 4*-service\/3.5*-Ambiance

Value- The meals here are not a bad value, as my Three Meat Combo cost $22, but it's more than enough food for 2 people. Even my piggy self couldn't finish it--but guess what's for breakfast?! Snooch to the Nooch! 4*

I'm about to make a bold proclamation: I think BQ has *the* best BBQ I've ever had. I don't make that statement lightly either--after all, I have a reputation to uphold. I think this was easily the best meal I've had here in AZ, and that's saying something. I can't wait for my next visit to the Valley of the Sun so I can visit BQ again. If you ever find yourself in Phoenix, I highly, highly recommend making your way here--just make sure to make a reservation!",17,13,16

Initially, we had a minor situation with the menus each having different prices. The manager was very gracious and offered us the lower-priced menu.  Very professional and very friendly. 
LeeAnne was our server and she was a 10.  ‼‼My girlfriend ordered a steak sandwich. The steak was grilled to perfection with a glazed caramelized sauce that brought out the steak's flavors. It was thick and juicy and so flavorful covered in grilled mushrooms served with onion rings so tasty I ordered one to go.
Their potato soup is almost a meal in itself. It is so flavorful with cheese and bacon and chopped onions and potatoes I could've eaten another bowl instead I got one to go.
Bobby Qs gives you a small bag of homemade donuts to thank you for enjoying their restaurant. Give it a try for sure. 
Second review:  treated friends today to Bobby Qs for burgers and steak sandwiches. Kyle served us and he was beyond on top of keeping us satisfied. Actually I was the one who got treated today.

I was able to get a 3 meat platter for $25.00 and stingy is not something that resides in this place's vocabulary.

Lesson #3: the meat fell of the bone (Great BBQ is removed from the bone, not fall off the bone. Kansas City BBQ Society rules)

Not only were we more than impressed, it's definitely now on the list of must-have BBQ, even if it is a 45 minute drive away from us!

First off, I was looking forward to the cornbread since so many people have commented on it.  It was right on par - I even caught my picky 8 year old licking his plate to get all of the crumbs, which is a first.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese, my husband had the sausage and brisket with mac and cheese and fries and my son ordered the mac and cheese as his entire meal (notice a theme).  Soooo many people have commented on their mac that I made sure to mention it and we all ended up ordering it and loved it.  Even though it was absolutely fantastic, that wasn't the highlight.  My pulled pork sandwich was the best I have ever had and I finished that thing off without it ever being put down.  The meat was fall-apart tender and the sauce was a perfect blend of flavors for me (oh look, now I'm salivating again).  My husband loved his sausage and brisket and is already working on figuring out what he is going to order the next time.

Then there's the staff, everyone was extremely friendly and made you really feel welcome.  Our server (Victoria?) was very sweet and perfectly attentive.  Overall though, the place just really made you comfortable.

Bobby Q is a great place to go for good barbecue in the Valley with authentic meats and extra touches to make everyone happy. They have a funky location off I-17 so you need to exit and drive the frontage road to find the place. Once you arrive, you will not only smell the smoke, but you will enjoy the unique decorations and friendly atmosphere. The restaurant is huge which is good for groups.

The baby back ribs were just amazing. Sweet, smoky goodness falling apart with all the fight long cooked away. They also serve brisket egg rolls, fall apart cornbread, and super cheesy mac and cheese. The Q Rolls were a special treat since the flavor of the meat survives the deep fryer and is a very unique item. The bag of fresh mini doughnuts at the end of the meal is a nice touch and a tasty ride home.

Their location is a little tough if you have to fight traffic on a weeknight, and there is really not much else around. Prices are a bit high, but you are paying for good barbecue. I really like this place and am glad to have it on my trips to Phoenix!",0,0,0

My elderly Aunt and her older sister and another friend makeup our dinner group. We were greeted and seated right away. There were two walkers in the group but no problem as the aisles were plenty wide and there was room to store them nearby.

Ashely was our server and while she was taking our beverage orders I mentioned ""Yelp"" for our discount, very nice! She also gave us seperate checks without a complaint,a very professional and a delightful person.

My Aunts had never heard of Yelp and thought they would have to exclaim ""yelp""! to get the discount, very funny!!

I orderd the onion block which arrived quickly, the only better one we had tasted was the one from Tona Roma's now closed on Bell Rd.

I ordered the St Louis Ribs and they were sensational. I have had ribs all over and the ""smokey"" quality was the best and the amount of sauce perfect. The fact that they were hanging off the platter was very nice as well. My sides were a baked potato and grilled vegetables. The potato was large and piping hot, I ""hot potatoed"" myself twice, just the way I like. The veges were generous and delicious.

Two of the ladies orderd the Baby Backs Ribs and the comments were very positive. They ordered a variety of sides which were all well received. 

One misstep was that a side of Mac and Cheese was received instead of the Pecan Slaw. No problem, the young man who brought out the plates returned with the desired slaw and more of the popular corn bread within a minute.

All in all, a great meal! All of us took heavy boxes home and the ""Thank You"" donuts were cute.",1,0,1

The atmosphere is casual with slightly higher-than-normal ambient noise\/sound level. Dishes are large and can be shared. 

Cornbread is served prior to appetizers and entries are brought out. The bread is fresh baked, but in my opinion, slightly dry. It's okay if you're using butter though. I had the Smoked Sliced Beef Brisket with Mac & Cheese and Shoestring Fries for my two side dishes. The brisket was probably one of the best I've ever had. Piping hot, super juicy, and tender (fell apart on my fork as I was picking it up)... With just enough sauce so that the meat wasn't swimming. I liked how they served both mild and hot bbq sauces on the side so you could have more sauce as needed and to the spice level you prefer. The Mac & Cheese was very creamy, but nothing extraordinary. It felt very heavy. The shoestring fries were your typical thinly cut fries that are crunchy, but could use a little more salt. Towards the end of the meal, ""donuts"" are given in brown lunch sacks. They resembled beignets in the shape of donut holes. These donuts were very sweet and oily, but had a nice crunchy outside and soft inside.

Over all, I was most excited about the brisket (next time I come back I'll definitely reorder this dish). The donuts were a nice surprise, but overly oily for my tastes. I would recommend a reservation, since when I went the restaurant seemed quite busy. Not too shabby for a bbq joint in the southwest!",0,0,0

-Complimentary Donut Holes

Bad:
-Beef Ribs, tough, small

Although I love all-things beef, the beef ribs here are a disappointment.  The portions aren't nearly worthy of the price tags and the only reason they serve you the butter-saturated corn-bombs is because you're technically paying for them.  I don't even think the pork ribs are smoked...

 First of all the building itself is very southern style and includes a trough like waterfall on the back patio with a unique water fountain that is really fun. 
 While waiting to be seated I asked about a fryer like contraption which was for their COMPLIMENTARY churro like donuts and was surprised with two to start our dining experience!
 Love that the manager himself sat us and attended to us a couple times, for customer service oriented was the impression I received, as well as the fact that everyone including our server introduced themselves. 
 Scott was kind enough to offer some suggestions as well as provide another COMP that being their cornbread muffins. O.M.G they are seriously worth the trip  in itself. Just a bit sweet and buttery with a slightly crisp top.

 I ordered the St Louis style ribs with a side of spicy BBQ sauce and baked potato. They truly fell off the bone, super flavorful from the mesquite smoking and the sauce while not unique was very good. The baked potato was good, cooked just a bit too long, however hubby had the gravy which I used a bit for the potato and it was amazing. I suggest asking for the baked potato, if not going for mashed, to have with gravy.
 Hubby had the fried chicken and side of fries with gravy on the side. The chicken was EXTREMELY moist and the batter once fried was light and crunchy. We have concluded however that unless it's KFC or a restaurant in the South we aren't going to get much flavor from the batter itself. However that's what the gravy is for and it was extremely good, I believe sausage based minus the actual meat. The shoestring fries were good but not specially seasoned like we get at our favorite Tucson BBQ joint. 

 We were going to order the mud pie for dessert however they were sadly out. 

Truly amazing even with the minor drawbacks, I would done here monthly if we're in Phoenix..",1,1,1

The mac n cheese was just like store bought Velveta... nothing special... nothing great. 

The pickle was good...  tea wasn't bad. 

The peach cobbler... the crust tasted like it had onion powder in it.. really off putting. 

So... it was edible.. but.. it wasn't cracked up to what I thought the place was going to be after reading all the wonderful reviews.  Nice atmosphere... but... the BBQ wasn't anything special.  there are several smaller BBQ places around Phoenix which are much better.  Sadly... even Famous Dave's was better than this place IMO. 

So... 1 1\/2 -2 stars....  I had much better.

Let's start with the positives (I'll apologize in advance for jumping around). We ordered the calamari appetizer ($12.50); we both enjoyed it. Hubby had the three meat combo dinner ($26) with pulled pork, beef ribs, and chicken. It came with 2 sides, he chose baked potato & beans. He liked it all and the few bites he shared, I liked too. I ordered the 10 oz prime rib dinner($26). It came with 2 sides. I wanted a side salad, so I got one side and $3 up charge for the salad (which she told me up front & I was fine with). The blue cheese dressing is great. Some of the lettuce was brown though, so that was a little off-putting. The prime was just so-so & I would not order it again. 

Now for the rest of the not-so-great part of our dining experience. It is rare that hubby and I get to go out alone together these days, so we were really looking forward to having a nice dinner out. Our server was a little over-zealous at first. It was our first time there so we were taking our time going over the menu. We ordered the calamari appetizer and asked for a few more minutes, again. She brought 4 warm pieces of cornbread to the table. She comes back a couple minutes later & this is where one thing that really bothered me, happens. I have my little plate in front of me and as I'm about to put a piece of cornbread on it, she takes it, puts it on a dirty plate from someone else's table - as I was saying, ""oh, I was still using that"", and she says, ""oh here, you can have it back"" and set it back down in front of me! I said, ""no, you can take it"". She didn't even offer to bring me another one. Now, I've been a server before & even when I was inexperienced, I would have NEVER done any of that. Very unprofessional. 

When we placed our order (this was right before the plate incident) things came out in timely fashion, but then it was almost like she disappeared. I didn't like the mashed potatoes, something tasted a bit off - like they used milk that wasn't good or something. It wasn't until I was about finished with my prime that she came back to check on us. I asked for a baked potato instead, and she was back in a flash with one. 

So overall, hubby was satisfied with his food. Me, not so much. Service, lacking. And, for probably the worst part of it all...about half hour into dinner the lounge area starts playing heavy club music. Not only is it competing with the country they have playing in the restaurant, but you can feel & hear the bass so much that it literally made us feel so irritated that we decided to take the rest of our food home. It was not a good dining experience for us. We probably won't be going back.",0,0,0

I love prime rib, and this really hit the spot. The horseradish was not that spicy though. Still tasty (we get both) but I was hoping it had more of a kick.

Cole slaw was delicious as usual, but I didn't see any pecans.

I like how versatile the table and booths are. They can easily be arranged to accommodate various sized groups, and just the fact that you can control how close you are to the table is always a plus in my book. I've been to other restaurants where it feels like you're a mile away from the table if you want back support. So it's great that this is not an issue.

Complimentary cornbread quickly arrived. Flatter than most corn breads it is packed with flavor. Tad oily but it was warm, moist and absolutely delicious.

As soon as we finished the bread our entrees arrived and we were shocked at the quantity. Could definitely feed 4 adults.  The St Louis Ribs...OMG! Yummy. Fall off the bone tender with excellent flavor. My boys who usually don't care for ribs ate half of the ribs.  The baby back was also delicious and less fatty. The pulled pork and brisket were also excellent although the ribs were definitely the highlight. Mac n cheese was incredibly creamy and perfect for the kiddos. Corn was a mix of slivers of Cobb and corn kernels in butter. Can't go wrong with that.

We couldn't finish our meal but that wasn't the end...they give you a brown bag labeled with ""thank q"" on it. Fresh hot, light and fluffy cinnamonny sugary goodness that tastes like fresh churros but with a mini donut texture.

10% off with check in only sweetens this place. Thanks Bobby Q for a delicious meal.",4,2,2

Ordered hog heaven, thinking it would be sufficient for 2 people - - easily could've fed 4. The meat separated from the bone so well that we skipped the knives. We might even have skipped the fork too because it was quite delicious. The most memorable part was the corn bread. I normally hate corn bread because it's like rolled up dust balls sprinkle with corn essence. Not the ones here. This page turned me into a believer of corn bread and the Arizona charm. 

Baby back, St Louis, pulled pork and chicken ranked from favourite to least favorite. Chicken was bland and feels similar to what I would get at Costco. Pulled pork was soft and moist, but the essence came from the BBQ sauce. The ribs though. You can't go wrong with the ribs.",0,0,0

Ambience was great and a tad dark with a bit of a rustic feel to it. Too bad it was cold outside that night or we would have eaten out on the patio. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of potato salad. Before that came, we started with a complimentary corn bread which was one of the best corn breads I've ever had. It was warm, sweet, and almost cake-like in texture. Pork from the sandwich was moist and not stringy at all (which is often the case in a lot of BBQ places). The flavor itself was smoky and there was just enough sauce so that the taste of the meat still took center stage. Potato salad was great too and had just the right amount of mayo. 

Once we had finished our meal, we were given a bag of complimentary mini donuts to take home. Wow, free cornbread AND donuts? I'm completely sold! I've tried a good amount of restaurants since moving to Arizona about 2 months ago, and Bobby Q is definitely in my top 3.",0,0,1

Saw this places' sign from the freeway and it looked intriguing. Not much on sweet style bbq sauce or brisket because I'm biased  (Raised on Eastern North Carolina style chopped pork) but this place was off the hook!

Walked in the door and told there was a 1 hour wait so we decided to wait. Found a spot at the bar so we decided against waiting and ordered our food from there. We started off with these apps they call Q-Rolls and they claim they're ""World famous"". Well, they deserve that title as far as I'm concerned. Bbq brisket rolled in pastry shells like taquitos with chipotle and bbq sauce for dipping. Mercy!!

For my entree, I had the St. Louis and baby back ribs with roasted corn and tater salad. The meat was super tender and falling off the bone. The waiter offered to bring 
me more sauce but it was super delicious just the way it was. Not a big fan of tater salad but this was great so I'm a fan of theirs. 

My wife had the fried catfish and same sides as me and she was well satisfied, She really don't like Bbq but she liked the taste of mine a lot.

DERN!!! I forgot to mention the cornbread! This is what bbq should be served with. Last, we finished up with the bread pudding. My wife said this was the best she ever had so that's saying something, Bread pudding is her favorite dessert and she never likes anybodys but her own.

They serve tea that comes in these cute little boxes and they give you a select variety. They also give you home made cornbread with butter. 

I ordered the two meat platter which came with two sides. I ordered pulled pork and the baby back ribs. The ribs were probably the best I have tasted. I balanced the meal out with their grilled veggies and Mac and cheese on the side. Needless to say I was in the clean plate brigade that night. 

For dessert, you really need to try the mud pie. Very generous portion to either share or just feed that sweet tooth for yourself.

It's a pretty neat location.. They definitely  nailed down-home, country vibe that they were going for. 

I wouldn't say the food was sub par by any means, but it didn't knock our socks off like the authentic, southern eats we're accustomed to. Sweet tea was off, mild BBQ sauce was WAY to sweet. Meat was okay, but nothing amazing. Service was decent. Mac n cheese was money.

It used to be the old Bobby McGee's themed restaurant, and I used to go on dates with my daughters when they were just little girls. It was dress up time with Dad, and they really enjoyed meeting the various servers that acted out their various personas. 

The last time I was here was a few months after they remodeled this place, and turned it into Bobby Q's. The food wasn't that impressive then; therefore, I never made it a point to return.

Due to an accident on the I-17, we had to make a detour on Dunlap to escape the traffic. Instead of having to endure a prolonged wait for dinner, we opted to give this place a try. I forewarned my wife that I didn't think that this place was any good, but we would give it a try anyway.

And we were about to be quite pleasantly surprised.

Riley, our server, greeted us with such enthusiasm and made compelling statements  about how amazing this place was. #89 in the country as far as BBQ joints are concerned, and over 1100 reviews on Yelp. 

His statements were received with some trepidation by yours truly, and in my mind, I was saying to myself - we shall see!

My wife ordered the Wood Fired Top Sirloin Steak, and I ordered the 3 meat combo (Pork, Brisket, and Chicken). For our drinks, we ordered the sweet tea.

The tea was just wonderful. Not too sweet and not too tart, and had zero after taste. Just the way the both of us like it. 

We were provided with fresh homemade cornbread that was just pure evil! They were absolutely and ridiculously delectable. You could just taste the sweetness, along with all the calories and the carbs! A caution sign should accompany these babies.

In spite of the myriad of people eating here; especially the two large parties that apparently were part of some spring training tour group, the service was prompt and efficient. 

Nary an empty moment went by without Riley continually checking in on us and apprising us of our meal's status.

Not too terribly long afterwards, our meals were presented to us.

My wife really enjoyed her Sirloin Steak, and she was quite impressed with the roasted corn that came with it. And the generously lavish heap of shoe string fries made a great accompaniment to her already delicious meal.

My 3 meat BBQ combo was quite heavenly. The smoked meats were very tender, and the sampling of the various BBQ sauces provided just brought out their flavors even more.

In the middle of us enjoying our meal; Renee, the manager stopped by and checked in on us as well. She was engaging and quite friendly. She even helped clear our table as we progressed through our dining experience.

And when we were all done, Riley spent a few moments recapping our experience.

We had nothing but great things to say about the service and their food. Both were thoroughly enjoyable!",13,10,17

I would like to apologize for your catering experience. We pride ourselves on our food and take negative reviews very serious. I've shared your review with the owner and the kitchen manager.

Jason Gilliland
Restaurant Manager

I wasn't sure how I felt about accepting a free meal - that was really not a goal when I wrote the first review.  In fact, my first thought was why should I waste my time on doing this food again?  But - I was very impressed with Jason's email and decided to give it a shot. He wasn't asking me to change my review - he was aksing for a chance to prove how good they can be.  If it was terrible, he was running the risk of me updating with an even worse review.

My roommates and I all had the day off today, and around lunch time we were discussing food.  We were definitely in the mood for BBQ.  I called Jason, and he immediately set up our reservations for dinner tonight.

Complete breakdown on the experience - 
The room was nice!  Actually, the place was MUCH nicer than I expected a BBQ place to be - but not so stuffy we felt underdressed.
Our server was Ashleigh - she was 100% on point tonight!  From her brief rundown on what Bobby Q is and what to expect, to menu descriptions, keeping our water and iced tea full, checking back at perfect intervals and - my *wow* moment of service - when she dropped off the moist towelettes, the packages were pre-opened!  Sounds silly - but when you have BBQ greasy fingers, those packages can be a bitch!
The food - holy mother of wow - this was the same place as the last review?  The food was made with the same recipes in the same kitchen??  The only thing that tipped me off was the cornbread - still over the top amazing!
The three of us split the Cajun shrimp appetizer with garlic toast points.  While it did not have the level of kick I've come to expect from BBQ shrimp, the flavor was incredible.  Adding in the rosemary was a dash of genius, and the 6 shrimp were perfectly cooked.  This is a recipe I'd LOVE to have!
Wedge salad - HUGE!  In addition to the iceberg, tomato, bacon and bleu cheese, there was bacon.  Not just the baon bits - but big chunks of Meat Candy.  The blue was one of the richest and creamiest I've tasted.
For meats, we had brisket, rib eye, St. Louis style ribs and beef ribs.  Across the board, each was fantastic!  Just as the AKC is looking for the ""ideal"" of each dog - the meats we ate tonight could be held as the ideal against which all other meats were judged.  Each of the four was a perfect example of what that meat can become, when prepared perfectly!
The cole slaw does have good flavor - and I adore the fine shred they use.  So now it's two thumbs up for flavor and texture.  The mac and cheese was incredibly rich and creamy.  The baked potatoes - well, they are well prepared baked potatoes.  Either they're done right or wrong - not a lot of middle ground - and these were right.
I aldo enjoyed the featured beer - the Bobby Q Amber - which is brewed by Sonoran - so that was double local goodness.
I'd love to be able to review the peach cobbler - but we had already given up and filled boxes with leftovers to be tomorrow's lunch.  None of us had room for another bite.
Then Ashleigh brought the donuts.  Damn donuts!  Perfect, warm and soft, cinnamon sugar fried rings of perfect!  I knew I was full.  I knew I shouldn't eat anything more.  And I am so lucky she only brought one for each of us...otherwise I'd still be there eating more and more and more of them!
Fantastic dinner - all of us were incredibly happy from beginning to end with the entire experience.
Thank you Jason - if you wouldn't have reached out, I never would have known what I was missing!
We will definitely be back!",8,5,7

We went on a weeknight, and, true to my review, I went whole hog, (no pun intended), and ordered a 2 Meat Barbecue Combo plate - the sausage link, and beef brisket. My boyfriend, ever steady, ordered the Prime Rib. 

Now, I don't really eat red meat. I mention this in a lot of reviews, and that mention is usually followed by ""...but this time, I did, and I loved it."" So, I guess I do actually eat red meat now. Wacky. Thanks, Yelp, for contributing to the decay of my health and the fatty deposits inside my arteries. Do you even get fatty deposits in your arteries? Don't mind me, I'm just flaunting my lack of basic anatomical knowledge on the internet. Anyway, the beef brisket was awesome, and the sausage link was truly one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. Really! I loved it. Tasty and smokey and sweetly tinged with barbecue sauce. The corn and the shoestring fries are still hanging out in the ""delicious"" zone, and my boyfriend once again wolfed down his prime rib like a champ. He also tossed out a compliment to his side of macaroni and cheese, saying that it was ""really good."" From him, that is a ringing endorsement.

Our server was sweet and efficient, and not at all obnoxious. A+, Sawyer! You were great.

The little bag of Thank-Q doughnuts was adorable...we didn't get those on our first visit, and, even though we were completely stuffed, we appreciated the gesture and somehow found the digestive strength to scarf them down on the way home.

The pulled pork was extremely juicy, giving you that gratification when you bite into it. Two thumbs up on their meat. Nothing spectacular about the mac & cheese and fries though. 

Service was great. I was with some friends who have never been here before, and the waitress patiently explained the menu. She also made some good recommendations to them.

It is certainly not blue collar BBQ as its not cheap which means its food not everyone can enjoy. That is the magic of BBQ! I lacks that  ""wear the shirt you dont mind getting messy"" feel which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. 

Otherwise the meat is expertly smoked (you can smell it on the drive in which is key), the flavors are amazing, ribs fall right off the bone and of you so much as breathe on the meat it falls appart for you. 

The endless cornbread is really a nice selling point for me now as its so moist and yummy.

Next was the wedge salad and yummy. Caleb (the rockstar) split it without us even asking.   the chunks of blue cheese and the crispness of the iceberg were awesome. You could hear the couch from the lettuce. The crispy onions on top were a bonus.

High ceilings with obligatory (this IS Phoenix after all) yet interesting leaf-looking fans, huge wood doors (non-functional) and unique and interesting antique pieces definitely added to the overall feel of the place for me.  I like places with some character.  Though the contrast with the more modern and trendy tables, chairs and centerpieces on the tables along with the high-energy model-slim all-in-black with plunging necklines waitstaff was odd for me.  I mean, pretty is pretty, but I'm looking for tasty food and a warm welcome, not warmth anywhere else if you know what I'm saying (that's what places like Hooters were made for, no?).  I'm a bit more low-key when I dine out, though I must compliment the attentiveness and overall service.  My iced tea glass was never empty and ""to go"" boxes (with Thank-Q donuts) were promptly brought when requested (eyes always bigger than stomach).

Now - the food.  Definitely the place to go when you're craving really tender meat. The brisket is divine and they had me at pulled pork. Seriously. Meat roasted for 18 hours and I didn't have to do it myself? Heaven!! Now everyone seems to rave about the mac & cheese, but personally I am in love with the ranch beans - with pieces and shreds of brisket and pork in it. I was surprised at how tasty it was. I'd do takeout just for that.  The spinach artichoke dip was a bit high-fat for me and I had to stop after a few bites though my dining companion was happy to finish it off. Tasty but heavy.  The peach cobbler was not my choice, but I did have some and it was ok for what it was but it didn't wow me.

We were very pleased with all the meats we sampled and the Yelp rating didn't let us down.

We had about a fifteen minute wait after we checked in at the host stand just after 8. The waiting areas were crowded and many people were waiting outside. I think a buzzer\/text system would save some young ladies' voices and annoyance of the guests because when a table became available, the hostesses would yell out the name of the party at the top of their lungs while walking through waiting area.

We were served by Hunter and he did an excellent job of handling being triple sat with a total of 12 guests by treating the multiple tables as he should and serving all of us as one party of 12. He gave us a brief background of the restaurant also informing us that all the meat is smoked for over 20 hours using mesquite wood. The recommendations for food and beverage were solid. During the meal, my daughter did drop her fork on the ground and we requested on three different occasions for a new one and it was never brought to us.

For drink, I started with the Bobby Q's amber ale by Thunder Canyon Brewery which the caramel and malty flavor was an excellent pairing with the barbecue. Along with the warm cornbread to start, we were recommended the Q-Rolls ($10.50) which were a great preview of the meats to come ahead. The brisket was tender and moist wrapped in a crispy shell with a little kick added with a chipotle dip.

For entrees, my wife and I split the Whole Hog Heaven ($48) which was way too much food for two. All four of us could have split this meal. They were out of sausage that night so we went with the pork to go along with the baby back ribs, St. Louis ribs, and brisket. All of the meat was smoky, tender, and juicy. No tough, dry meat here. The sauce was pretty standard and served in a small pot which eliminated the sticky, messy bottles. My daughter and her friend split the Southern Fried Chicken ($14). I didn't get to taste any of the chicken, but they finished everything, which usually isn't the case.

We passed on dessert as everyone was stuffed, but the bag of doughnuts was a nice parting gift which I finished pretty much the whole bag later as a late night snack.",3,1,4

Our server Amethyst was great! So attentive, made sure we were never thirsty. My dad had a Bacon Wrapped Hot Dog and loved it! I went for the Steak Tacos that were hot off the grill and amazing.

In Arizona, they call it Bobby Q.

Well, maybe not all Arizonians call it that, but a good number of them do. When I reached out to some AZ Yelpers to find out where I can find some serious BBQ in Phoenix, almost every person mentioned Bobby's name. 

Bobby Q is a huge place that looks more like an upscale steakhouse rather than a BBQ joint. The inside is dimly lit and has a fancy, upscale decor. They also have two big bars and a banquet room. 

Right when our party of four was seated we received some delicious house made cornbread with sweet butter. After devouring the yummy cornbread we ordered two appetizers, their Q-Rolls and their Fire Pie Pizza topped with beef brisket. The Q-Rolls were similar to those pigs in a blanket everyone loves as a child.  Instead of mini hot dogs, Bobby stuffs the little flaky pastries with juicy beef brisket. The Q-Rolls were incredible alone but when dipped in the chipotle sauce that comes with the app, it gave the rolls an even more fabulous taste.  The beef brisket pizza was good but not great. They put lots of cheese on the pizza but not enough Bobby Q sauce or beef brisket. 

For dinner I ordered their three meat combo with pulled pork, beef brisket and St. Louis spare ribs. My fiancé ordered the Prime Rib with Chimichuri shrimp dinner. My dinner was big enough to feed at least two people. Every meat was phenomenal. The pulled pork and beef brisket were both juicy, tender and incredibly flavorful. The St. Louis spare ribs were falling-off- the-bone tender and had a nice smoky flavor. My girls Prime Rib was also really good but her shrimp were burnt, rubbery, and had almost no Chimichuri sauce on them, which upset her a little bit. Once your dinners are brought to your table, they also bring out two big containers filled with warm sweet Bobby Q sauce and spicy Bobby Q sauce. Both of these Bobby Q sauces were great but since I'm a huge fan of spicy I preferred the spicy sauce over the sweet one. My dinner came with three sides while my girls came with two. These are the sides we got.
Mac and cheese (we both got this) 
Pecan Coleslaw
Loaded Baked Potato
Roasted Corn
All of these sides were great but my favorite of the bunch was the Mac and Cheese. I don't remember what my other dinner companions ordered but I do remember they all said they loved what they had.
To wash down all this great Bobby Q, we all had huge glasses of their house made sweet tea, which was super sweet and delicious.

Even though everyone was full, we all decided to share a slice of their Sub Zero Banana Cream Pie for dessert. This pie was served ice cold and was more like a piece of banana cheese cake than a regular banana cream pie. This pie had an amazing banana flavor and was topped with lots of caramel sauce. To our surprise, after we finished the pie, our server brought us some home made complimentary cinnamon sugar donuts. These little things were wonderful, I just wish I would have been a little less full so I could have enjoyed them more. 

The service and prices here were both great. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. Since it was our first time there he really helped us out by making suggestions and telling us what their most popular dishes are. The prices were very reasonable seeing that you get so much food.  

If your a fan of BBQ then I guarantee you will be a fan of Bobby Q. If you ever visit Phoenix you have to check this place out.",11,9,10

That's the greeting I received when coming home from a terrific UYE organized by BBQ lovin' Deb L.  And at that point, if my stuffed self didn't already know it, I knew I had just eaten some damn good food.

Upon arriving, I had a deja vu moment of being there before...a long time ago, sipping a virgin strawberry daiquiri (I told you it was a long time ago), and thinking I was all that.  Yes, it was Bobby McGee's at one time!  So flash forward 25 years, and I'm having a strawberry lemonade ""adult"" beverage, which was quite tasty btw, in the company of 20 fabulous Yelpers!

We were given corn bread pretty quickly, and it was devoured pretty quickly.  A little on the crumbly side, but delicious nonetheless.  Because my husband could not join us, I went with the 2-meat combo (brisket and pulled pork) so there would be some left to take him.  Yeah, that's my story.  I was a happy eater to find I could order my meats sauce free!  The brisket was good, but a little too fatty.  The pork was really good, however; adequately seasoned and smokey.  I tried the spicy sauce on the table, and found it to be just right, just a little kick to it.  For sides, the mac and cheese was creamy and not lacking in sauce.  Yum.  The roasted corn was really really good.  If corn always tasted that good, I would move to Iowa.

Our service was great and they were accommodating for our request for separate checks with a 20% gratuity.  Our service was actually good enough, especially given a party that size, that I tipped extra.  And I did refrain from eating all of my meal, so that I could have a nice lunch the next day when my husband refused my offer of the leftovers.  Only problem was he didn't refuse.  And I went hungry the next day, wishing I had eaten all of my meal when I had the chance.",7,7,7

Honestly when we drove past this restaurant to get to our motel...we were busy making fun of their name. That is until we found out that they made Yelp's 100 Places to Eat and we found ourselves waiting 50 minutes for dinner. Not laughing anymore. I highly recommend making reservations because this restaurants get very crowded. Thankfully this did not affect the service at all! We were taken care of from the minute we walked in, to the minute we walked out. 

Their menu has a little bit of everything so you're bound to find something that interests you. We started our meal with their Spinach Artichoke Queso Dip (with garlic bread) but honestly you don't even have to! Their house corn bread is delicious with their butter and can easily count as an appetizer with all the free refills they give you. With that said, the artichoke queso dip was also quite tasty. I just prefer my artichoke dip with chips rather than bread. The bread was just a little too buttery for me which made the appetizer feel very heavy. For our entrees, we ordered the Three Meat Plate (brisket, sausage, ribs) and their Jumbo BBQ Potato (all the usual fixings and brisket.

We absolutely loved the BBQ here. We've tasted some of the best bbq in Texas and I have to say that you can find some of the best right here in Phoenix, AZ. Everything was tender, fall off the bone delicious. I especially loved their brisket and my husband thought their sausage was great. I loved their BBQ sauce too. I even liked their sides! Their Mac-n-Cheese was rich and decadent, their pecan coleslaw was tangy and refreshing and their roasted corn was a little too smoky but that is purely a personal preference (less smoke is better for me). As for my Jumbo Potato, it was stuffed to the brim with all the fixings and very satisfying. We were absolutely stuffed after this meal. 

Our meal ended with some fresh house made donuts covered in cinnamon sugar. It was a great finish and we really appreciated all the effort put into excellent customer service. The managers were all out and greeting guests as well as cleaning tables! That was really nice to see. Anyways, I never thought that I would find a good BBQ restaurant in Phoenix but I was wrong!

Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix.  My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about the Hog Heaven special.  In fact, my puppies mouths are watering too.  Decent prices, giant selection.  One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate.  
 
If you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.

Let's break down the good points, first. Very nice staff and clean restaurant. I would roll around naked in their cornbread and ask to be buried with the mac & cheese. The meat preparation of the ribs and the pulled pork was really nice.
However.
The sauce sucks. Both the regular and the spicy are thin and lack flavor. You can taste the ketchup in the sauce and little else. The onion brick was cold and greasy and the shoestring fries were limp and flavorless. This is the first time my husband has been to a bbq place and not basically licked his plate clean. He left over half of his brisket sandwich. Unheard of. 
The meal was pricey and mediocre. This is far from the best bbq.",1,0,0

What I liked:
-loved the cornbread!!!
-3 meat plate, great mix of chicken, ribs, and brisket. Ribs were nice, tender meat off the bone, great sauce and pit-smoked; excellent value for 20 bux!, 
-loved the roasted corn as a side
-unique dessert, complimentary mini donuts
-young staff, very friendly; for single guys, some of the staff are eye candy

Why no fifth star:
-the server, albeit friendly, did forget our wine orders, so I had to knock a star off.

The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, so amazingly good. The more sedate flavors of the sides were a good counterpoint for the intensely savory ribs. We shared desserts -- the chocolate overload was good, and the peach cobbler was not overly sugared like it usually is in most establishments. I like it better that way because the taste of the fruit comes out more, although apparently the others preferred sweeter.  My only gripe was the lighting: on our table, the spotlight-like fixture above me shone harshly on me while keeping the others in comfortable darkness.

First appearance, it seems like the old place, with changes of course. The first thing that struck me was that all the Super Heroes were gone....those were the days when you could come in an have Batman (or if your lucky,...WONDER WOMAN) serving your food.  But like all things, we have to grow up.

Ever since El Paso BBQ closed down on 43rd and Peoria, I have been looking for good BBQ. Well, lo and behold...at Bobby Q's, I FOUND IT!

Start off with the Q rolls (which is a beef brisket rolled in a tortilla and then deep fried) and go right into your 2 or three meat platter. OH YEAR! The brisket is great, the pork is pulled perfectly, and all the meats are tender, juicy and flavorful!

Kristi indulged in a traditional chicken fried chicken and I will be darned if it was not the best I have had in Arizona! 

I had to force down the macaroni and cheese, which was also cheesy and flavorful, but I managed,

As we were leaving at 9:45 PM on a Saturday, the lines were already opening up for the party scene on the bar side....so it shows that even though its no longer the Bobby McGees I grew up with, it hasn't lost its lister for the night life!

I have been 3 times now. The first 2 times I had great service. This last time I was here for my birthday dinner with a friend. Our service was weird, it was multiple people but no one around when we actually needed anything. Our food took a very long time too. The table who sat next to us were seated and got their food before we received our 2 orders. Although it took what felt like forever for our food it was great like I expected.

By the time we were able to leave it took quite some time to get our bill, pay and even ask for a box all while servers were rushing around past us to help other people but no one to really help us. Once we were finally leaving I realized that we had waited so long that 3 couples had already been seated, eaten, paid and left at the same table next to us all in the time it took us to order an appetizer and a meal for 2.

Yup. That's my boyfriend, the most perfect man for taking me here, and buying me the best BBQ I've ever had, ever. Period.

Service was perfect. Adam was extremely attentive. Great personality. He even brought me a cole slaw sample because I was inquiring about it, but didn't end up ordering it! Needless to say, we were so impressed that we left a 50% tip. Seriously, Bobby Q and Adam are that good.

Vibe is perfect. Decor is amazing. Indoor\/Outdoor seating. Food is fantabulous. Service is impeccable. Oh, the best - when you pull into the parking lot, before you even get out of your car, you can smell the smokey meat goodness. All of their meat is smoked\/cooked for 24 hours before hitting your mouth. That means that all the meat is fall off the bone perfection.

And the extra bonus - the moistiest corn bread before your meal and the sweetest cinnamon sugar doughnuts after your meal. What more could you ask for?!

But...

My family and I are rib lovers, and in no way shape or form did Bobby Q make the grade.  

The waiter touted them as smoking ""all of their meats"" for over 18 hours.  I almost fell of the booth, because you smoke meat that long either it's going to get bitter from the amount of creosote building up, or at the very least it'd be overcooked (well, perhaps except for pulled pork).  Ribs can tolerate about 5 hours.  His hyperbole was obvious.  Perhaps some people get really excited when they hear this line, because it's supposed to sound impressive.    

I ordered the St. Louis style spares, and parents ordered the baby backs.  All of the ribs were overcooked and mushy (""falling off the bone"").  The spares were actually better cooked than the babys, which isn't saying much.  Interestingly enough, the babys were very fatty, in fact my Dad was spitting out pieces of fat.  Spares were not as bad (go figure, given it's usually the other way around).  We are not ""fat shy"" but this was really excessive.  The rack was not trimmed properly.

The ribs tasted smoked, although not an overly pronounced smoke ring.  Definitely not smoked 18 hours.

People freak about the Mac & Cheese here, but it's really nothing special.  Creamy and they certainly use processed cheese (which isn't always bad), but nothing more.  I really liked the beans - not too sweet.

In short, I could see how the other offerings on the menu may be good, and given the ambience and service another experience with different food may give better ratings, but ya gotta do your ribs well if you are going to call yourself a BBQ restaurant.

Once again, the lack of good BBQ in Phoenix continues to amaze me.

As a side note, we had leftover ribs.  I came home with my parents and was about to take them in the house.  My parents said, ""you really aren't going to eat those, are you""?  I said, ""probably not"".  Into the trash they went.",0,2,0

OK, we were west of the 17 freeway, so I suppose that counts as ""near"".  In any event, since missing out on the UYE the previous week, I was happy to visit this new-to-me BBQ spot for a very late lunch\/early dinner.

We were seated immediately, and started off with a couple of Blue Moons while perusing the menu.  It was extensive, with almost any type of BBQ combination you can imagine.  I did not take the time to review it all, because I only had eyes for one thing.  Brisket.  To sandwich, or not to sandwich, that was the only question.

We ended up selecting two BBQ platters - one with smoked BBQ brisket and the other with smoked pulled pork.  Each came with two sides - we chose mac n cheese, pecan cole slaw and potato salad.  Hey, wait, that is only three sides.  That is because we got two, count 'em TWO orders of mac & cheese.  Enable my bad habits!

Look!  Corn bread!  Warm, moist and topped with a healthy ball of butter.  It was probably a good thing we were only given two pieces.  I could have eaten a LOT of that...

Our meals arrived quickly, along with a carafe of spicy BBQ sauce (that went very well on the mac n cheese, I might add).  While the portion sizes weren't huge, they were still impressive.  It was immediately obvious that my friend liked my brisket better than the pulled pork.  How did I know this?  1) because it was OhSoVery good and 2) It was quickly disappearing from my plate without any effort from me!  Of the sides, of course I liked the mac n cheese the most - while it was not the oh so decadent Fleming's version, or the gooey cheesy version from Scottsdale BBQ, it still hit the spot.  

* We did make one strategic error.  While writing this review I noticed the Yelp Review Discount offer of 10% off the bill.  Too late to help us - but not too late to help you!  Go, eat, and ask for your discount!",6,6,6

I did the 3 meat combo beef ribs, st louis, and brisket with sides of mac and cheese and roasted corn. The sauce on the meat was perfect not too sweet and not too overwhelming, they do give you a jar for added sauce and a option to add their spicy sauce (highly recommend). The meat falls right off the bone and melts in your mouth like ice cream. The mac and cheese was so good it had melty cheesy hearty goodness to it. And the roasted corn was ok, due to im a corn on the cob type of guy. The concept of the restaurant may look deceiving, but once you walk in is like walking into a 4 star restaurant. It gave the presence of comfort with immaculate service. Even the manager that was working both Wednesday and Thursday even recognize us and gave us that welcoming feeling.

This was my first time visiting this place after smelling the BBQ every time I pass it on the freeway. I was so excited to try the food so I checked out there menu online and notice that it was expensive but within reason for bbq. A friend and I arrived at the place, got the menus and I notice the prices were more then the online price. Anyway I ordered the brisket sandwich and mashed potatoes and my friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and Mac and cheese.  We also order there Q Rolls which is brisket wrapped in flour tortillas and deep fried.  The Q Rolls were good, they gave us 6 rolls that were about 3 inches long $12, my brisket sandwich $14 with one side had more bread then meat. I was very disappointed in the serving size for the price. Not even a 1\/2 pound of brisket. They gave me more mashed potatoes then sandwich.  As for the taste, it was ok. No real flavor on the brisket and the spicy bbq sauce was not even spicy and was too sweet. I wished I've taken a picture of my food but it wasn't even photo worthy.  Our total bill for the Q Rolls, brisket sandwich, pulled pork sandwich with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes came out to be $47.

So we were going to be in Phoenix for a few days for my son's birthday. Bobby Q was one of the restaurants that came up as a recommended place to eat. I was told when I looked them up on Urban Spoon that if I mention them that I would get 10% off, so I figure ""hey why not?"" I mention it to the waitress when we arrive and when we get our bill and nothing was done. Though 7 or 8 bucks really won't make or break me, if they think coming out a few bucks ahead is worth having that advertised on a site like this then I simply think that's a foolish way to conduct business - draw people in with a deal and then back out on it. That being said I did like the food there. It wasn't the cheapest meal but it also wasn't outrageous (I think about 70-80 for my wife, son, and I). We went with the one offer that was like $40 for a couple of different types of ribs, sides, and other meat products. We were honestly quite full and agreed our health would take a major hit if we were to eat like that on a regular basis. Pretty cool décor in the place.

And we used to go for special occasions to ""Bobby MaGees"" which is where BobbyQ's is now located (says something about the quality of my restaurant experiences as a young fella)...And as cheesy as Bobby McGaees was...i kind of miss the pirate serving me my dinner (and the salad bar in the bathtub).

But i do like what they have done to the place. Cool interior. Casual but with a nice upscale feel. The patio seemed really nice (didn't sit out here).

We tried a variety of things. A burger, a pulled pork sandwich, brisket, baby backs etc...

I think the standout were the ribs. VERY good...very tender (but not overcooked), good sauce.  I enjoyed every one.Everything else was just ok. Like on par with Chili's (which isn't saying much). 

The sides were pretty tasty. Corn (roasted and then taken off the cob for you) , mashed potatoes, cornbread...all pretty good. 

Dinner for 4 (2 kids, no booze)...50$.

But a 5 star place? Maybe in the context of other restaurants in the Dunlap and I-17 areas (next to crazy Mitch's Furniture barn.) But not in the broader context of PHX.

I would definitely go back for ribs...but not a place that will go into the normal rotation.

She made sure we were attended to and had a great personable conversation with us. The food was amazing as well. We had the pulled pork sandwich and the BBQ chicken sandwich which were both perfect. We are from the east coast towards the south so we have had our fair share of BBQ and this was by far the best we've had. The mac and cheese was great and we both got it as our side. For dessert we got the death by chocolate which once again was amazing. To top it all off they brought us little donuts as an end of the meal treat and they were so good we had to force them down as we were so full but they were just so amazing! We were checked on once again by two gentlemen who were hosting and both were amazing and made sure or experience was good. Both were extremely personable.

Location & Aesthetics - Located just off the I-17 somewhere I believe in the Glendale area of Phoenix.  Lots of available parking in an enclosed private lot. 
The place has a rustic look and feel to it.  Very spacious inside, clean including the bathrooms, and well lit.   

Menu - menus were quite extensive though my wife and I already knew what we wanted as we had a chance to review their menu online before meeting our friends there.  Menu was self-explanatory and easy to find what one needed, not too overwhelming.

Service - The staff was very friendly.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and was shown a large table to accommodate my wife and I including our friends who had two boys with them.  
I did have a gripe with the table we were seated at as it was a bit wobbly and thankfully my wife noticed too.  It wasn't too bad to shift our meals around so no loss on the ratings.  
Before the meals are brought, they do serve some cornbread with butter in the meantime and though I didn't try it, my wife said it was tasty, delicious, and not too dry or too greasy.

Food - I ordered the full rack of baby back ribs with vegetables and roasted corn.  Initially when I first saw the full rack of ribs I thought I wouldn't be able to eat it but I surprised myself.  My ribs was well cooked and was practically falling off the bone.  It was soft, tender, and juicy and you could even taste the smokiness to the meat.  The roasted corn was well seasoned, more than enough and came in a bowl.  The roasted vegetables that I ordered was lacking and only consisted of a few vegetable that looked like it was about a tablespoonful.  (-1)
My wife ordered the three-meat dish and it was so much that we had to take a bag back to the hotel.  She did comment on how well and delicious it was. 

Rating - 3\/5.  The restaurant loses another star\/rating based on a small issue.  
After the bills were brought to the table and the waitress ran my credit card, I asked if I can use my Yelp coupon and she stated that I couldn't do so as ""the card had already been run"" which I don't believe.  I couldn't see why she couldn't cancel it and re-run the card with the coupon. (-1)

My girlfriend was just wearing a one-layered sweater so she didn't really have an option to change. As a result, apologies were given and as the waitress handed us napkins, she smiled and told my girlfriend ""you still look good though."" Everyone at the table had an easy-going personality, so we just shrugged off the situation.

Now onto the actual food. To the recommendation of my friends who have been here a handful of times, I ordered the fried chicken with mac & cheese and thought it was a great dish. The breading had a great crunchy texture and every bite of the chicken was tender and moist. The biggest recommendation we had was to try the beef brisket, so my girlfriend got that. We both shared our plates with each other, and I thought the brisket had a great smoky flavor to it. The beef was so tender that you could easily slice through it with a fork. Although the mac & cheese tasted really good, I felt that it was a little too heavy for my own tastes. I can't complain about any of the other sides because they all tasted great and were seasoned well. 

My girlfriend still liked the restaurant because the food was great and the décor\/layout of the restaurant seemed nice. Having been to many barbecue restaurants dispersed throughout California, I thought the restaurant was fairly priced and the food was top-notch. By the time we got to our check, I asked my girlfriend if she was still wet, and she said ""yeah a little."" It would've been nice if management stepped in and gave us a cookie to turn her frown upside down, but our waitress was probably too embarrassed to tell the manager anything. Would I come again? Probably, but I'm not sure when because I usually only eat out for special occasions or social gatherings.",1,0,0

SO this is solely based on my palate.  I was starving after drinking my glass of wine at the bar.  I ordered the Grilled Top Sirloin with a 1\/2 Rack of Baby Back Ribs.  Sides were baked potato (they forgot my sour cream and were so busy I didn't have the heart to ask for it..so that's on me), pecan coleslaw and potato strings (what was I thinking with already having the baked potato?)  

Anyway, things arrived and the plate so full I didn't know where to start so move things aside and attempted to cut my steak.  It was cold.  It was also SO tough it took a number of tries for me to cut it.  My husband offered to cut it but I was determined!  The one bite I finally got off was tough and chewy.  The smoke flavoring overpowered it.  So I was done with the steak.  I then tried the ribs.  The meat fell off the bone and was extremely tender.  I did find them tasty but could only eat a couple due to the salt content.  Too salty for me.  I'm not sure if it was the sauce or if they use a rub, but it was overwhelming.  The pecan cole slaw was ok...I expected better.  It needs pineapple  :)    I didn't eat the fries as they were cold by the time I got to them.

Thankfully there was plenty of cornbread on the table which was amazing.  I wish I would have ordered some to take home. 

Would I go back?  Yes, but to try some other items like maybe Bob's Salad.  Sounds really good.  I don't think I could eat the meat again because of the salt and overly smokey flavor.  
The donuts at the end were evil...so maybe I'd go back for cornbread and donuts with a side salad. lol

My BIG complaint is our servers when bringing the receipts were really flustered.  I had two servers arguing behind me about things being wrong.  That is unprofessional and unnecessary around your customers.  I held my tongue but it was difficult.  If you have problems with your receipts...take it away from  your customers to sort it out.  I have no problem reiterating what I had and you can ring up a new receipt to get it clear and most people at our table would have felt the same way.  Again, DO NOT ARGUE in hearing distance of your customers.  It can ruin a nice evening for us.

Anyway, many of the friends with us loved their meal and I know Bobby Q's is a favorite for some.  Unfortunately I am not one of them.",0,0,0

We were told the meat was smoked for 14 -18 hours by one waiter and 6 hours by the bar tender which we were a little confused by. We ordered the family meal so we could taste multiple items from the menu......we were not impressed at all. The meat did not have a smoked taste to it at all. It tasted like the meat was boiled and maybe  smoked for an hour. Very disappointing. The bbq sauce takes like a cheap sauce you can got at the grocery store. The mac & cheese tasted like they made it with the kraft cheese that comes in the plastic. Yuck.....The best part of the whole meal was the donuts at the very end. I do not  recommend this restaurant if you are look for some bbq. We will not be returning.,0,0,0

Their sauce oomph is somewhat mild along with its sweetness and to me that is a blessing.

The vibe seemed family-friendly but still quite lively. It's a spacious restaurant with plenty of room for large parties and there's also a full bar so you can order from their drink menu or have them make whatever you want. 

Our table ordered baby back and St. Louis ribs, brisket and sausage. Entrees come with sides so we got a few of them. The sides were ok, nothing special. The BBQ was pretty good. The brisket was almost too soft though, crumbling into smaller pieces as we picked at it. But it tasted good, smokey and flavorful. My favorite, surprisingly, was the sausage. And it was perfect with their tangy Carolina BBQ sauce. We also ordered appetizers, spinach dip and these brisket-filled egg rolls. Spinach dip was good that came with really garlicky garlic breads, so that was good. And the brisket rolls are their most popular appetizer for a reason. 

The food was good but it was really the service that impressed me. Even with how busy they seemed the food came out very fast. Our server, Julie, took the time to explain things to us and was very attentive and patient. The icing on the cake is that they bring out donuts for dessert! Warm, sugared donuts.

One of the few places in Arizona that serves Beef Ribs. Cannot over-emphasize this point..better than Claim Jumper..not even close. Beef ribs have twice as much meat as pork ribs but are much harder to find in restaurants. 

They smoke all their meat on site and everything is super fresh. Melissa & Sawyer were fabulous and I really appreciated the 10% off for using YELP. 

The only downside is that because we sat close to the chicken rack in the back near the kitchen we wound up smelling like a campfire. However we didnt really notice this until after we left and went back to the outside. 

The cornbread starter and donut pastry ender was absolutely unexpected and refreshing.

There is always a long wait, but the staff was able to help us find a table at the patio. I think the patio is better than inside because it's spacious, and there are mist to cool the temperature off. We ordered Hog Heaven, fried onion rings and couple drinks for four of us, and we couldn't even finish all the food. 

Corn breads are delicious and just like the ones I had in North Carolina. It's not too sweet, outside of corn bread is a bit crispy and inside is soft. When you placed the butter on the top of corn bread, and the butter just melts right of away. This combination added extra flavor to corn breads. 

Whole Hog Heaven: beef ribs, pulled chicken, baby backs, prime briskets, mac & cheese, meshed potatoes, roasted corns. 

Man o Man, They are so delicious. briskets are moist and tender. you don't need to add any bbq sauce. Prime briskets are great to eat by itself. I like to eat mac & cheese after having briskets. M&C here are really good with a slide sweet taste in it. 

- Baby backs were cooked so well and the meat fell off the bones easily. 
- Pulled chicken was juicy and didn't have the dryness that chicken breasts usually have. 
- Beef rib is delicious and still attached to the bone, some people like it roasted so the meat would fall off easily. However, for me, I prefer to chew the bone. very yummy.

We've wanted to try Bobby Q's for years, ever since we saw it reviewed and featured on Check, Please! Arizona (local PBS station show where Arizonians share and review each other's favorite restaurants). We were in Glendale For Glendale Glitters, and as I always do, I searched Yelp for restaurant options nearby with a lot of reviews, and high reviews. Bobby Q's was just 5 miles away in Phoenix, so the stars finally aligned! 

The restaurant was busy, as expected on a Saturday night, so we opted to try the outdoor seating in lieu of the 20-minute wait for an indoor table. The hostess assured us that it should be comfortable when she saw our hesitation, that there were plenty of heaters to keep us warm (hey, 45 degrees in AZ is cold!), and it was perfect. 

Victoria, our server, was welcoming and helpful, my mom, husband and I ordered our drinks and meals, the sangria was good, as was the corn bread. We ordered the Q Rolls, and it took longer than expected to recieve them; however, they were delivered with an apology for the tardiness, an explanation that our ticket went missing (they were crazy busy), and we were told they were on the house for the delay. We all looked at each other and said wow, great service! By the way, I will dream about those Q rolls, wrapped in crispy spring roll-like shells was the best, and most tender, beef brisket I've ever tasted -- the juices ran down my hand while eating. 

We found ourselves ordering drink refills, and people watching while we fell into a conversation lull, before we realized it'd been a while since we had finished our appetizer. The food was delayed due to previous ticket issue, but was so incredibly good. My mom and I each ordered the stuffed potatoes with pork, mine with veggies on the side, which I was impressed were cooked kabob style on a grill (too many restaurants treat vegetable sides as a boring after thought), we also ordered a side of sautéed mushroom and onions that I nearly wanted to swim in because they were so flavorful! The ribs my husband ordered were tender, and their spicy barbecue sauce was a great pairing. He said the Mac and cheese was ""so good,"" as was the roasted corn he ordered, and the pecan coleslaw my mom ordered. Our eyes all lit up with the first bite, and I said, ""we're definitely finding reasons to come back here"" (we live an hour away). 

Donny, the manager stopped by and apologized for the delay, and offered to buy us desert. We are so impressed by the level of customer service we just received! Not enough businesses take care of their customers like this anymore. The food was so good that we would have gone back regardless, but the positive, and proactive, customer service we received drive me to write this review, and want to tell my friends and family about this place. 

I've tried and cooked a lot of barbecue, we have a Texas sized semi-professional smoker at home, my family is Southern, and I grew up on North Carolina barbecue, this is THE FIRST time I've ever eaten barbecue outside of NC (most certainly in AZ) that I can rave about, and that I will make a point to seek out again. 

My only disappointment was the Q-Lina sauce -- I understand barbecue is regional, and as personal and touchy as religion and politics to some, but the traditional NC barbecue I grew up with didn't involve tomato\/ketchup\/sugar based sauces. This is in no way a deal breaker, as I loved their traditional and spicy barbecue sauces for the sweet tomato concoctions they were, and will stick to those in future visits. 

Thanks to Donny and Victoria for taking care of us as first timers, so glad we have left overs to look forward to, and can't wait to return!",0,0,0

Bobby Qs is one of the best BBQ joints that I've eaten at. 

Reservations: Open Table or you can call in. We were running late b\/c of the 101 closure so we called in and they were willing to push our reservation back for us. 

Parking: Two private lots. They even have a guy standing outside to direct you to the second lot if the main lot is getting full. 

Drinks
Ordered the Bobby Q seasonal draft beer and my friend ordered a drink the waiter recommended: some mixed drink that came in a pineapple. Both were good. My friend really enjoyed the novelty of the pineapple. 

Food - Both Entrees 5 Stars
We ordered the two ribs combo and chose St. Louis and Baby Back ribs. The meat on both was fall off the bone tender. I think I prefer the St. Louis ribs though. They seemed to have a little bit more flavor. The spicy and regular BBQ sauce that they served on the side was excellent for dipping the meat in. 

We also ordered a 14 oz. ribeye steak. The aged steak was also really tender.. the kind of melts in your mouth deliciousness. They didn't season it with very much so it is an excellent steak if you enjoy the unadultered taste of meat. The quality of meat here is indisputably excellent. 

Sides:
Mac N Cheese(5*)- MUST GET! The cheese was unbelievably creamy. I'd recommend that everybody choose this for one of their sides... so good that you really don't want to share. 
Shoestring fries (4*)- good crisp fries to dip in the bbq sauce
Roasted corn (3*) - my friend really liked the roasted corn.. i thought it was just roasted corn.
Mashed potatoes (2*)- tasted a little too processed, too smoothed... I think I would have liked a little gravy but at the same time it was too salty and galicy.   


Service: (4-5*) Just the right amount of attention. 
Our server Daniel was really attentive and had some good recommendations, e.g. the drinks and mac n cheese. They were also pretty good about keeping the water glasses full. I guess part of the goal of the restaurant is to have the manager visit each table... which she did. It was very brief but I guess it shows an extra level of service?  I'd also say the service was excellent b\/c I forgot my hat and they set it aside for me at the hostess area to be picked up the next day.

Little weird: On the check the pre-calculated\/recommended  tip amounts were 18%, 18%, and 20%. I just found it odd that they didn't include the 15% mark and they included 18% twice. 
 
This place is a little pricer... but well worth it if you got the cash. 

P.S. Apparently there is some club\/lounge in the actual restaurant. The decor, candle lighting and everything was right... the only detraction was the loud music and bass that could be heard through the wall. It wasn't unbearable but if you're here on a nice date you might want to request to be seated away towards the left side of the dining room.",4,0,1

The Mac 'n Cheese has always ranked at the top of my lists as the very best ever!  The pulled pork and brisket have always been excellent, but this last time I tried something different - a burger!  Yeah, I know, this is a BBQ joint, why would anyone get a burger?

Well, I am glad I did!  Like the Mac 'n Cheese, this burger is now at the top of my list!  It was sooo... damn... good!!!  The ""Perfect"" burger was just that  - perfect!  I ordered the meat medium and that was how it came out. The meat was amazingly tender with incredible flavor. It would be really hard to find better.  Maybe the only burger I've ever had better was at Carver's Steak house where they made my son a Whiskey Peppercorn burger that was not on the menu.  At Bobby Q's, I could only eat 1\/2, and the next day my reheat was still amazingly good!

We also tried their beef brisket flour taquitos that were insanely delicious as an appetizer!  Later that evening we went to the Yard House at Westgate and I tried their famous Vampire Tacos - they weren't as good as these beef brisket taquitos at Bobby Q's.  Thumbs up to Bobby Q's.

People love the cornbread here too!  Baked in cast iron, it has an incredible crust.  Still, personally, I liked the Old El Paso BBQ Company's cornbread, but they no longer exist here.

I got to say - I love this place!  Fantatstic food and service that always delivers!!!  We left with about 10 complimentary cinnamon sugar mini donuts they make fresh and hot right there.

We had several questions for the waitress regarding use of soy as an ingredient or cooking oil.  She had to keep going away to ask and the answers coming back were vague and not very helpful.  Not acceptable in these times.  Many people don't care, but soy is an allergen and one of our group has an intolerance.  We expect better of highly rated restaurants than to use soy as the cheap go-to ingredient in most of their menu.  Barbecue sauces can be made from real ingredients like cane sugar, tomatoes, vinegar, spices etc...   Ingredients like soy and corn syrup are a cheap sellout in my view.  With better ingredients and staff training this could be a really good restaurant.  If soy doesn't bother you, go for it.  The fresh donuts at the end are a great touch (soy there too).",1,1,1

The hostess was very nice (Paloma) and quick with getting us situated and fed. The food was good, not what I expected for the price though. 
   Both mine and my boyfriends meals were a bit on the bland side not having much flavor. We had to put salt and pepper on everything, the Mac n cheese tasted like the Velveeta box kind and the ""grilled veggies"" were not grilled and were just blah, however their cornbread was DELISH! and melted in your mouth! Sooooo good! Now the catfish and ribs my boyfriend ordered were VERY TASTY and the ribs literally fell off the bone! But the steak I ordered was just ok, I had a better one at Red Lobster?!

Nothing will ever be as good and I live too far away to get to enjoy this pure heaven again in the near future so now I am deprived of amazing BBQ.... All because of Bobby Q. 

I just left another BBQ place (this time in Atlanta, Georgia) and due to my now high standards for BBQ I must say I was severely disappointed :( I am currently sitting in the parking lot of a mediocre BBQ joint with extremely high reviews from the locals lamenting over the loss of Bobby Q to my boyfriend. 

I forgot to mention in my last review that not only was every single item that we ordered from the menu spot on but Ann, our waitress, also gave us mini funnel cake like donuts to go... ON THE HOUSE. I mean come on guys... No one does that!! 

To sum thing up... I have just been across America and back... Literally... and Bobby Q is the only restaurant that had such a lasting impression on me that I just HAD to come back and write an update for. My only question for them is CAN YOU OPEN A LOCATION ON THE EAST COAST PLEASE!!!!!",0,0,0

Our server was Alexis and she did a really great job. Great positive energy and made us feel very welcome. She was on point with our food and follow up on our needs. Excellent customer service!!!

The appetizer we tried was the Q rolls which is a brisket spring roll with two sauces. They hit the spot and were super tasty. The cornbread was a nice touch as well with a little butter and then with the bean sides for the meal. 

We ordered the Hog Heaven meal which the description states it is great for yourself or to share with someone else.....Hmmm no this is enough for you, your friend, and another friend lol. 

I was expecting small portions so you get a taste. You get to pick two of the three rib styles. These are not just one or two ribs. You get a half rack of two different styles of ribs. Then you get three meat choices plus three sides. These are all regular portions not small mini portions.

I am a big guy and really enjoy BBQ. Between my wife and I we did not finish this meal there was enough left for a whole other meal.

The food is smoked on site and you can taste the nice smoke flavor in the meat which is tender and juicy. The ribs have a lot of meat on them with just a touch of crispiness on the outside. The meat was fall off the bone tender. The brisket was so moist and tender it was incredible. The sausage is absolutely home made! You can taste the difference in the sausage and texture. The chicken is super tender and again full of moisture even the chicken breast was juicy. 

The pecan colesaw, ranch beans, and the mac & cheese were all super tasty sides!

If you are in the area I would highly recommend stopping and checking out some amazing BBQ.",1,0,0

I'm still hoping, but have not found it yet.  Fair warning, I'm hard to please when it comes to bar-b-q'd brisket.  In Southern Texas, the pit master starts cooking at 10PM to have meats ready for lunch the next day.

I've heard a lot of good things about Bobby Q from family members.  Was able to stop for a Saturday lunch today.  Ordered the two meat platter with cole slaw and potato salad.  

Nice attentive waitress brought out some cornbread muffins.  I grind my own corn meal and cook buttermilk cornbread in a cast iron pan I've had for twenty years.  Tough to compete with my cornbread.  These muffins have blenderized corn kernels to give them a little flavor.  They were the classic sweet cornbread.  Sweet with a little bit of canned corn taste.  Oh well, I came for the bar-b-q.  

Sliced brisket and sausage was served on a platter with sides in small bowels.  Oh no!  There was sauce drizzled on the brisket and sausage.  It's almost heresy to put sauce on good bar-b-q.  Definitely an insult to the pit master.  

The prime brisket was very tender.  Brisket is a tough cut of meat that has to be gently cooked for a long time to coax out the tenderness and flavor.  Even then it has to be cut across the grain to be tender.  These thick slices were amazingly tender.  There was no smoke ring.  Tender bland brisket.  The sauce was the star of this plate.  Crash and burn.  

The sausage had grill marks on the sliced sides.  Reheating on the grill did not help the flavor.  It was a little spicy, but had very little flavor from smoking.   Again, the flavor was from the sauce that covered it.

Cole slaw had chopped pecans on top.  Nice touch as I love pecans.   If the pecans were browned in a little butter, it would have helped a lot.  Otherwise, pretty plain cole slaw.  OK, but not special.

I've had awesome potato salad.  This Bobby Q's version was OK.   Good, but not anything to write home about.  

So, I continue to be a disappointed Texan.  Guess I'll have to invest in a smoker.  

Go to Bobby Q's for good service, quality tender meat, and good bar-b-q sauce in a nice atmosphere.",0,0,0

If not, you missed out BIG TIME!! Bobby Q took Bobby McGee's out and I'm still depressed about it over a decade later!! Bobby Q, you do not impress me much.

Like many others, I do not understand the hype or the love of this place at all, whatsoever, NOPE, not now and I never will!!! Their meat is ""moist"" alright, to the point of no texture and you could feed it to a TOOTHLESS infant!!! I like some texture and a lot more smoke flavor!!!

I especially do NOT like the donuts they serve after your dinner. They are greasy and mush much like their meat. My young kid said they made his ""stomach sick."" Their cornbread is good, but I make mine from a boxed pre-mix and add a can of creamed corn and a small can of drained green chili's (only the 3 ingredients) and I like it BETTER!! 

I give them two stars only because for lunch they have a good deal. You can get a brisket or pork sandwich with a side for $9.00.

I still nibbled on my husbands potato salad, but I am such a fan of it that I could not resist. They also have cornbread here before the meals, now I do not like cornbread so it did take me a couple visits of my husband telling me to try it before I actually did, and now I am mad that it took me so long and look forward to it every time!!

I have seen this restaurant on a MUST try in a list somewhere but forgot the name. So I decided to enlist Yelp for help when I was in the Arizona area for Spring Training this year. What strike me was the 1300+ yelp reviews and the 4.5 stars rating. I knew I had to bookmark this. Reservation was easy as I did it on open table (4:30PM on a Monday).

My bf and I arrived earlier and sat at the bar. That's when I learned the hard way that Arizona has a law that prohibits selling alcohol to anyone with a vertical ID, even though they might passed the age of 21. (Yes, I'll be renewing my license this month as it expires next month). Oh well...

The full party arrived and we were led to a table for 6 in the back. We were promptly greeted by our server, Riley. He made us feel welcomed with his friendly attitude and provided us with a great recommendation for appetizer, the Q-roll! Everyone enjoyed it and it set a good note for the rest of the evening.

All the ""adults"" except me got the Bobby Q Amber Ale that went really well with the BBQ, while I got the frozen strawberry lemonade. It was delicious! They served us complimentary circular shaped cornbread before our main course, that was really good too. This is coming from someone that doesn't blink twice for cornbread. Then our order of the Whole Hog Heaven and a rack of the St. Louis Style Ribs came. That was the perfect amount for our group of 6 adults. We only had 2 ribs left and everyone was stuffed! To top off the amazing meal, our server gave us a bag of homemade cinnamon sugar donuts to take home. Overall, I was so glad my choice for dinner was a success!

Parking: A big private lot. There are spaces reserved for to-go orders.

Atmosphere: Outdoor patio, bar and dimly lit indoor seating. 

Good for: Dates (not really for first dates unless you don't mind eating BBQ), catching up with friends, small and big groups (family, friends, celebration, birthdays, etc.)

Service: Super friendly and accommodating. Right when I entered, the hostess was smiling and ready to help. Our server was awesome!

Food: Amazing. Don't even need a knife, it just melts off the bone! Whole Hog Heaven for groups of 4! Try the Amber Ale or the frozen strawberry lemonade.

Setting: 5 stars-Great decor, lots of televisions, dim lighting, and just a comfortable feel.

Staff:  5 stars- Our waiter was awesome. I am very frustrated with myself for not remembering his name. He checked on us often and really took care of my party of 8. The manager also walked by and checked on us. Class act all the way around. 

Food: 4.5 stars- The food was great. The sides (French fries, potato salad, Cole slaw, Mac and cheese) were awesome. Each side could not have been any better. As for the meat, it too was very good. The problem I have is I compare everything now to the barbecue spot Little Miss Barbecue.  The meat (pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and ribeye) was moist and flavorful. Better then Little Miss? No, but it was darn good. I really would love to give the meat a five but that would not be fair to Little Miss. For dessert, we knocked out the bread pudding and their complimentary mini donuts. The bread pudding was not on their menu but it needs to be. It needs to be their go to dessert. It was amazing!!!!! Loved it!!! LOVED IT!!! The donuts were so fresh and a real treat.

The bouncer gave me a funny look when I approached, obviously I can't wear jeans here! But then I explained that we just wanted to dine in the restaurant and he was more than happy to let us in. They also have a full bar, some good craft local beers on tap and decent cocktails. The atmosphere is really cool, inside and out in the outdoor seating area.

The food was outstanding! Not only did we LOVE our food, we met a regular that was hilarious and had schtick with our bartender\/waiter. She was very funny! Oh.. and that was some quick service indeed!


There is a nightclub attached to Bobby Q. My friend and I did venture on over to check it out, but it was definitely NOT our scene or music. Very Vegasy. So, maybe skip that.. unless you are 23 and like Vegas clubs.. Or are like us.. and blog about traveling and check out things we would not normally visit. Or - if you want to dance off your meal, maybe? No.. wait.. I don't think you should do that. The food is really fantastic and should get to stay cozily in your stomach until it's good and ready to part ways.

It has a rustic look with upscale charm. I sat on the patio and was nervous the noise of the expressway would annoy me. That exact opposite happened. The fountain with the trickling water and the ebb and flow of cars combined to make me feel peaceful and relaxed. The place is incredibly clean as well. 

For the meal itself I ordered Q-rolls to start. These were like beef brisket meeting an egg roll.  It was served with a chipotle sauce and bbq sauce. It was easy to eat and very tasty. The crispy dough outer shell complimented the flavor in the beef. 

For dinner i ordered the 2 choice option. Beef brisket, of course, and the baby back ribs because sever said they'd be one of the best i would ever had.   To be honest, i have had better beef brisket in Tennessee. By all means it was excellent but a tad dry compared to some of the juicy fatty brisket from those hillybilly towns off the  main roads. The server did not lie about the baby back ribs. My grandmother's ribs compete with these and that says a lot to the quality and taste. WOW!!!!!!  Wonderful!!!!!  I also ordered the ranch baked beans. Very flavorful. It has beef and pork in them. Some of the meat was stringy so texture was odd but flavor is great. 

As for the service.....OUTSTANDING!!!!!  Hunter was my server and his knowledge of the menu and ability to give tips enhanced my experience. He was friendly and had just the right amount of chattiness. The manager, Cameron, was also extremely attentive. I felt like i was in the fine dining section of a cruise ship. They both teamed up to make sure everything was perfect throughout the night. 

I look forward to returning here to try more of their fabulous menu items!!!!

Our family of 5 (all adults) ordered 1 hog heaven ($44) which included 2 ribs (we chose St. Louis and baby back),  2 meats (chose sausage and brisket), 3 sides (chose veggies, corn, and fries), and corn bread.

Pros:
- great service. Drinks were refilled before we even came close to running out and food was served within 10 minutes of ordering. The manager also came by to see how we liked it.
- open decently late (10 PM)
- Meat was FANTASTIC. Fall off the bone tender; no knife needed.
- Sauce on the meats were delicious. The perfect degree of sweet and not at all sour.
- CORNBREAD. Best I've had. Good enough to be a dessert.

For the most part, I've avoided barbecue since moving to Arizona, but my friends wanted to try out Bobby Qs, so trying out Bobby Qs we did.

We sat on the outdoor patio which was warmly lit and welcoming. Our server was incredibly friendly, which only added to the good vibes. Although not barbecue, the southern fried chicken caught my eye. I got it with creamy mashed potatoes and a delightful (maybe yogurty?) mac and cheese on the side. The cornbread that came with it was also heavenly. Though they are round and slightly more difficult to handle than the regular square ones, they were delicious and moist and there was more than enough butter that came with them.

My s\/o got the pulled pork platter with roasted corn and shoestring fries. We traded our mashed potatoes and roasted corn because I absolutely ADORED the roasted corn. Perfectly buttery with such a good roasted flavor. Just thinking about it makes me hungry.

I am a total potato salad guy and this potato salad hit the spot. Perfect blend of ingredients. The Mac and Cheese was just otherworldy with the amount of delicious cheesey gooeyness that it was. All in all I think I gained 30 pounds just from eating half of the meal.

Even if you don't order a dessert, they end your meal with some homemade mini doughnuts (yeah I spelled it out)! It's a perfect treat even if you have to take them home to eat them. Heat them back up before you do.

It took about 45 minutes for our food to come out and the server kept apologizing for the wait and said  it was being ""cooked to perfection"". Which was ok since we ordered it WELL DONE.

We were upset because it took so long we were hoping it would Atleast Come out properly.. My boyfriend cut into his and it was slightly pink.. So he gave me his steak but both steaks weren't the way we asked... We told out server and he didn't offer to take our steaks away until a manager came by and the manager said we were gonna get some new steaks... They brought out the ""new ones"" but it was clearly the same ones just put on the grill longer... 
No flavor at all and very tough to bite into , if we're spending $20-25 on a steak we have some decent expectations.. My boyfriend and I didn't eat much of the steak the manager had to take a second look deciding if he should take the steaks off.. They gave us 9$ off..

I was with three of my sons who are 12, 9, and 3. My little ones had the mac and cheese. It was super excellent. 

My older son had the pulled chicken BBQ sandwich and I had the pulled pork. I ordered the coleslaw for my side since I like it on my BBQ. The pecans in the slaw are a stroke of genius. 

Cornbread is served that is very good while you are waiting for your meal. We also got the QRolls for an appetizer. My boys loved them. I thought they were OK. 

When you leave they give you a little bag of cinnamon donuts that are made in a little machine up front. The idea is cute but the donuts aren't good. They were actually kinda gross!

At the end of the day it is all about the sauce and the sauce was very good!

Ambience:  for a bbq place.  The interior has a fine dining steak house feeling to it with a southwestern dining on the outside seating area.  A good family friendly restaurant.

Service: Definitely has a welcome feeling to it. Waiter was good, but the manager was better and more considerate.  Our food came out on a timely manner ...but when we ask for bbq sauces, it took a while.  However, the Sauces was worth waiting for....

Food: Complimentary cornbread was great! It was soft, moist, and had a cake texture. It would have been better if was hot instead of room temperature.  We order the artichoke appetizer... The bread stick was perfectly toasted with garlic herb butter, but the dip itself was too heavy cheesy.  As for the bbq... I wished it was hot.  It was lukewarm, but not hot enough to bring out the full bbq experience.  The meat was smoke very well that left no greasy fatty taste, but the sauces is the best part.  All the meats was overly cooked so it did not stay intact very well. In the end, everything tasted like pull pork.

The patio was soooo pretty they had string lights everywhere. I love the ambiance. The inside was pretty too, but we kinda got stuck in a corner near a sink? I would have probably preferred the patio.

The service was great, and the food came out fast. The server welcomed us first timers very well, and talked about the awards the restaurant was won which was pretty cool. 

We decided to split a three meat plate and an extra side: baby back ribs, pulled pork, brisket with mashed potatoes, ranch beans, and macncheese.

The meat were very tender and the bbq sauce was good, I added a little bit of the spicy bbq sauce (not really that spicy tho). I felt like the bbq was soft and tender but it was also a little bland? I don't know maybe there was too much hype on this place that I set the bar in my mind so high? It was good but I thought it would be so much better. The sides were pretty good too especially the mac n cheese. Oh and I ordered the frozen lemonade which was nice (wasn't too sweet), felt like I was drinking a margarita ;)

First of all, they warm you up with free cornbread whilst you decide on what kind of grilled flesh you'd like to consume; it's served with a side of butter but TOTALLY not needed...the cornbread is warm, soft, and buttery as it is. 

On to the main stuff - promove if there's just two of you dining would be the Whole Hog Heaven deal for $38: pick from two meats off of a list of four (the ladyfriend and I picked the beef brisket and sausage), two rib selections out of three (we rolled with the beef ribs and St. Louis-style), and three sides from their list (went with grilled veggies, mac and cheese, and shoestring fries). The brisket had that wonderful, beefy flavor - tender and moist on this particular occasion. Sausage was sausage; nothing spectacular. The beef ribs were good; they were decently sized and definitely meaty. However, we enjoyed the St. Louis-style ribs; these too weren't the pinnacle of ribdom, but these were also tender and delicious. As for the sides: grilled veggies - good, wish we had more; shoestring fries - they were fries; mac and cheese - too cheesy.

Why five stars? Great service, great deal for the amount of food we got, and, as many have noted, WARM DONUTS BEFORE YOU LEAVE. We didn't know about that part until we passed on dessert and received the check. If you feed me a good meal for a good price and give me a fresh treat at the end...well, you're a winner in my book.",0,0,0

Do not visit this place if you are on a diet.  
Seriously, you will gain 3 pounds before you get back to your car.
No amount of good intention will save you.
 
And do not expect to enjoy this amazing BBQ restaurant if you are a strict vegetarian.
I mean, whut fer?

I read a few ""reviews"" for Bobby Q that made me wonder why the writers chose a very well known down-home style BBQ emporium, and then expected that the experience would mimic a Chez Souci foo-foo eatery. Huh? 
Whatever!

First off, make a reservation before arriving!  
Everybody in Central AZ knows this awesome joint, so you will not be lonely.
 
Or, if you enjoy having a few drinks before dinner just show up, leave your name at the desk, and taxi on over to the Adult Beverage area. 
Lots of fun folks to talk to while waiting, so its painless. 
They serve appetizers at the bar, if you need a head start. 

Crazy crowded it was - a tour bus with 49 people pulled up as we arrived. 
Even so, we were seated at a table within 40 minutes.

Another warning: 
If you are having a main course dinner, remember that the hot chow rockets out of their kitchen in 5 minutes flat (being a rotisserie and pit BBQ place, most of it is ready and waitin'). 

The servers are all super friendly and most efficient. The warm corn bread and butter hits your table immediately.

What's waitin', you ask? 
Well just about anything you ever saw Barbecued, that's what. 
Incredible slabs of ribs. Fantastic pulled pork. Amazing brisket. Chicken like you wish Mom could have made. Corn served country style (you'll see what I mean). 
 
The huge stack of food (for any meal ordered) will blow your mind and stretch your belt. Even if you arrived hungry as a bear, you can expect to walk out with a plate of leftovers (and house-made corn bread).
Believe me on that.

Yep - you will get messy (they provide wet naps) and will have to deal with some degree of consumption guilt on the ride home.  
BUT ITS WORTH IT!",0,0,0

If I were on death row, my last meal would be from here. If I were ever going to get married, I would  have them cater for me. I never went to Bobby McGees unfortunately, but I have been eating at Bobby Qs since it became Bobby Qs. I have never had a bad meal, nor have I seen anyone else not enjoy their meal. I have never had bad service, or even mediocre service. The food and service have always been excellent, above average, wonderful. 
I can't say how many times I have been here over the past many years. I used to go at least once a month as it was me and someones date restaurant for a long time. Every time someone visits from out of town, I bring them there. They always request to go back when they are visiting again. I've brought dates to this place, they have always loved it. When I talk to someone else about Bobby Qs, and they've had it in the past, they always say they love it too. I even met someone from out of town that said they go all over the country to eat BBQ and Bobby Qs had their favorite ribs of anywhere they've ever been to!  I've been to going away parties, birthday parties, tons of stuff, and I've still never met anyone to complain about this place. 
The only complaints I've ever heard is of the club. Who cares about the club? This is about the restaurant, the food, the service. Not some dance club where some teeny bopper got in a fight with her boyfriend so they had a bad night so they are going to complain about Bobby Qs. Come on now! 
Try the amazing, phenomenal food that Bobby Qs is!! The cornbread is great, the nice donuts they give you as you're leaving are delicious and the spicy bbq sauce is my favorite. I like that they sell their bbq sauce so I can have it at home too! It feels comfortable inside as well, the decor is nice. The outside patio is a great spot when the weather is nice. My dad lives 1800 miles away and is always asking me if I've eaten there recently and to take pictures of the outside water chains so he can replicate that at his house.",2,0,0

Instead of staring @ each other all weekend we alternate weekends and plan something for us to do.  Budget of $100.   No complaining!   

This was his weekend.  I'm one of those wives that loves a surprise\/hates a surprise.  With that in mind I had great anxiety over the adventure ahead of me.  We start off with major construction going on our off ramp.  So we got a little side tracked and wound up going through some stranger parts of Phoenix.  I couldn't imagine a restaurant here so I was really starting to wonder what he had planned.  Then all of a sudden closer to the freeway there it is.  The most glorious signage I had ever seen.  Bobby Q's.  Fantastic.  He's gonna feed me and then the night will really begin. 

We head into the restaurant and everything is so cute.  It helped so much that tonight we could finally WANT to eat outdoors if we wanted to.  It's so much cooler.  We were told that it would be about five minutes.  We turned around, sat down and then our names were called.  Not bad.  I immediately notice the comfy little love seats and some of the tables.  We were not lucky enough to grab one of them but next time I tell you, my butt will be in one of them, or outside.  Tiffany came over and explained everything.  Which was great.  I love when wait staff knows their shit.  As a diet coke fanatic I will gladly let it pass that the competition is served in their restaurant.  I oped for the peach iced tea and had four more glasses after that.  At $1.75 how can you beat that.  And its not artificial tasting at all.  This was good.  Hubby had a beer that was specifically made for the restaurant.  BBQ Amber.  Good.  Went well with the meat.  Tiffany (who in my opinion is the epitome of what a wait person should be) immediately brought us some corn bread (to hold us over) and it was so good.  So GOOD.  I frosted mine like a mini cake with that butter and was all over it.  YUM.  When we put our drink order in we put an order for the Q-rolls in.  Before I was done with my first glass of iced tea - the appy was out. Think a smaller version of a taquito with beef brisket inside.  So awesome.  Good, just good!  I ordered the three meat combo (go big or go home) chicken, brisket and baby back ribs.  Chose mashed potatoes and corn as my sides.  Done and done.  Pic to follow.  I picked up a rib and it looked like the flintstone quarry.  Clean.  Not a lick of meat on it.  Where was the meat?  Oh on my plate.  It slid right off.  Not a touch of fat anywhere on it.  Melted on my mouth and was so good I was having trouble sharing.  The brisket was phenomenal.  The chicken with a touch of the spicy bbq sauce was run out on to the freeway and play good.  DELISH!  Do you get what I'm telling you here?  Hubby's meal was just as good.  Mac and cheese was great.  The corn.  O EM GEE the corn.  The little corn coins.  So cute and so damn good.  More peach iced tea.  At some point hubby used the term ""meat mayonaisse"" to describe the ribs.   He says that the fat on the ribs (which was minimal) melted in his mouth.  

The manager came over to check on us and what a doll she is.  I'm so mad that we didn't get her name.  Dear Manager - thank you again for the delish meal, the unexpected treat after and the great time we had on our date.  We will bring everyone we know there, we will suggest to everyone that they go there.  It was a real treat.  

To summarize - great place, great drinks, great service, great food, great manager, great dessert.  It will be our go to restaurant.",3,1,4

I'm from California and we don't really have any BBQ there, so I like to indulge a little when I travel.   Last month I was in Ft Worth, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, and New Orleans.    People there  said I had to try the Salt Lick in Round Rock (outside of Austin), and it was ""ok""... I thought at the time.. ""ok, it's above average""... I thought maybe I didn't really have a taste for it. 

New Orleans Jambalaya can't be matched... I'll leave it at that.  I didn't try the gumbo at Bobby Q, I just thought I would be disappointed after New Orleans a couple of weeks ago.   Brisket was unbelievable, also the best I've ever had. 

I tried the 3-meat combo and had chicken, St. Louis ribs, and brisket.   All were over the top, the brisket especially.  The ribs were very large and very tender.. probably the best I've ever had (anywhere). 

Mac & Cheese is supposedly their specialty... it was good, but I've had better, it wasn't that memorable but I didn't leave any behind either.  Baked potato side ... I wasn't happy with it, seemed under cooked or something.   I usually have a salad at least once a day, but I didn't try it at Bobby Q, I assumed it wasn't their thing. 

Ambiance was excellent but I opted to sit in the patio, it was a beautiful night, but what a mistake.   It was only occupied by a work-party or something and they were rather ripped, drunk, and to the point of talking about what it's like to travel in the south as a gay man, etc... kind of crude and I wasn't interested, neither was anyone else... higher class places would have asked them to leave. (I dinged the score for this).  After the crowd had it's fill of drinking, they turned to smoking... Oh My ... Yuck... haven't seen that in about a decade... One nice thing about California... smoking is fine, as long as it's 200 feet from anyone else.  The patio has a cover that is low and curved at the sides, it held the smoke in like an airship.   After 20 minutes, I was really gagging and it made the food taste awful.   Smokers... I know you like to light up after dinner, but you don't smoke ""during"" dinner.  Why is that?  Makes the food taste nasty? Yes... it does... learn to be considerate and take it outside for people that are eating and paying as well.   Took any desire for dessert away, I just wanted to leave at that point. 

If not for the smoking (which should really be banned in the constrained area), and the mediocre sides I would have given it 5 stars.   As it is, solid 4 (meat was that good).",2,0,0

I had the Q rolls which were out of this world and my entree was the 12oz sirloin. The steak was wonderful and the sides were delicious. I had the Mac and cheese and ranch beans.

I went in last Friday for lunch and the place looked great inside. Very classy interior and our server Jo was incredibly nice and provided us with great service (always refilling our drinks and asking if we needed anything).

I ordered the 12oz sirloin steak which was delicious, as were the mashed potatoes that I got on the side.  My friend ordered a full rack of ribs (half St Louis, half baby back) and I tried some of it....and I have to say it was incredible. The meat was nice and soft and just melted in your mouth.

I really can't think of any negatives about this place, especially when they brought 4 complimentary mini donuts to us on our way out.

I didn't get a chance to come last year but I made it a point to check it out this year. I was able to make a same day reservation for Saturday evening through the yelp app and I'm so glad I did because the wait was going to be about an hour otherwise. We waited less than 10 minutes to be seated. 

Our server Tiffany was great, we told her it was our first time so she took the time to give us history on the restaurant and she gave us her recommendations. The corn bread was so yummy and moist.

The sides could have been a little bigger, we devoured the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and flavorful. 

I usually prefer baby back ribs over the St. Louis but in this case we agreed the St. Louis were better. The pulled chicken was my favorite, it wasn't the typical chicken covered in bbq sauce. It had some other flavor I can't describe but it was amazing! We walked out of here stuffed, I almost needed to be carried out. The home made donuts at the end were a nice touch, even though I was full I couldn't stop eating them because they were so light\/fluffy and bite size.

I love me some good bbq, and had heard good things about Bobby Q, so it was time to give it a try. It being a summer Tuesday night the parking lot was busy, but not packed and we were seated right away. The restaurant itself was doing a good business. I enjoyed the interior. It was one of the most, dare I say, upscale bbq places I've frequented, though it's not upscale at all. 

Our server came by quickly and introduced herself. She asked if we had ever been there before and when we said no she got excited and told us all about the place. We each ordered a beer and decided what to order. We settled on the Whole Hog Heaven Feast to get a sample of a few things. Our Whole Hog included St. Louis & Baby Back Ribs along with brisket and sausage. For our sides we went with the ranch beans, corn, and mac n cheese. We weren't able to polish off the whole thing, but we came close. 

I must say that these were some of the best ribs I've had in a long time! They were perfectly cooked, easy to remove from the bone, but not fall off the bone, and amazingly the pork stayed together. I slightly preferred the baby backs. I wasn't as big of a fan of the brisket, but then again I am generally not a fan of brisket. To me, the best bbq is pork. The sausage was good, but I wouldn't go and order it as my dish. We got some of their spicy bbq sauce on the side and thought it had a good flavor. You could feel the heat, but it wasn't hot or overpowering and didn't linger. 

Of the sides we agreed the mac n cheese was the winner, though the beans were flavorful as well. The mac n cheese is certainly cheesy! Corn is corn. 

I know I really liked this place because as I was eating I swung my legs like a little kid who can't touch the ground with their feet. Signs of a happy camper.

This place is the real deal, and SO much better than the crappy chains like Dickey's.

I came in for lunch last week and got a cup of the ham and bean soup to start with.  It was yummy!  Delicious broth, plenty of thinly sliced ham.  I also ordered the sampler lunch of baby back ribs, barbeque chicken, and spicy sausage, with a baked potato as the side.  The ribs were heavenly, I didn't even bother to pick them up because the meat just fell right off the bone so I used a fork.  Perfect with zero gristle.  The sausage was pretty good, a little dry but nothing to frown about.  The chicken was okay, but barbeque chicken isn't really my thing, I only ordered it for variety because I didn't want three pork dishes.  The corn bread that comes on the side is pretty good, it's very light, somewhat sweet and falls apart as you pick it up.  The baked potato was alright.

Coming for lunch here is definitely the better deal,  the three meat sampler was maybe $12 (sorry I can't remember for sure) and came with one side plus cornbread.  The three meat sampler at dinner is $21 with the same amount of food except you get an extra side.  Pretty criminal if you ask me.  So even though the bartenders at dinner are really lovely, I'd rather come in for lunch and pay half the price for the same amount of food.

As a bonus they also give you a paper bag of fresh mini cinnamon-sugar donuts with the check, although good luck finding room for them!",3,0,0

I was waited on in some way by at least 5 different members of their team, at least 1 of whom I believe was the manager. Everyone smiled and made eye contact, and they all seemed genuinely concerned that my needs were being met, and that I was getting what I wanted. I was immediately greeted with a smile when I walked in, and smiled at the entire time I was there. I really did experience 5 star service.

The ambiance was casual, rustic, and interesting in its own way. 

The bartender came right over (you guessed it - with a big smile) and when I indicated that I had not been in before, she immediately explained about the lunch menu and the various options in just enough detail. She left me to fill my drink order while I considered my choices. 

I decided on the Platter Sampler, which allowed me to choose three kinds of meat, a side and cornbread. I figured that this would give me a chance to check out more than 1 item. Of the sides, the roasted corn was the most appealing to my tastes. I also ordered their shoestring fries. I don't have the capacity to consume large amounts of food, but with that long a drive, I wanted to try lots of things, even if I couldn't finish them.

A few minutes later, I overheard a couple of gentlemen at the end of the bar ordering meatloaf. Wondering how I had overlooked that, I studied the menu some more, but didn't see meatloaf anywhere. When I asked, the bartender indicated that they periodically have off menu specials. Since I had come so far, I ordered the meatloaf (only $9.99) to go.

My food came out very quickly, and there was a lot of it. Portion sizes were generous. I had opted for a combination of Brisket, St. Louis Ribs, and Spicy Smoked Link Sausage. 

The roasted corn was not corn on the cob, although the dish was topped off with two slices from the end of a roasted ear of corn. The off the cob corn had kernels that looked like they had seen fire. The juice that the corn was in had a good solid smokey flavor to it. I had anticipated and would have preferred roasted corn on the cob. To my personal tastes, it wasn't great, but it also wasn't bad.

The shoestring fries were perfectly cooked, thinly cut, skin on, and nicely salted. It was a HUGE order that came out in a little pail. I could have made a whole lunch out of the fries alone! I hardly put a dent in them.

Turning to my platter of meat, I was somewhat disappointed overall. 

There were several slices of brisket. It was extremely moist, almost mushy as if it had been cooked in liquid, and there was no smoke ring. I've lived and eaten all over the country, including Texas and the Carolinas. I have had good smoked brisket, and this bore no resemblance. It was more like pot roast or meat you would find in stew, with no smokey flavor. In fact, the corn had more smokey flavor than my brisket. I would not order the brisket again because I think this must just be the way they have decided to prepare it. Maybe lots of people love it. Maybe they've never had better. I didn't like it.

The sliced link sausage was missing the usual coarse texture of sausage, with the textures of fat and lean. The mouth feel was as if it has been boiled, or in liquid at a sufficient heat to cook the fat out of it. That left the texture sort of like moist cardboard. The flavor coming through wasn't bad, but the effect was like nicely seasoned boiled cardboard. (It took me the entire drive home to figure out a truthful way to describe it.) Perhaps this batch had just been sitting in warm moisture too long. I'm going to go back and read through the reviews again to see if I'm the only one who experienced this.

The St. Louis Ribs saved the day for the meats. Except for being a bit fatty, and a general lack of smokey flavor, they weren't bad. Not great, but not bad.

The good news was my take-out meatloaf special. I swear my portion of meatloaf was nearly 2 pounds! It was also tasty! It wasn't what I expected as it had more pungently savory ingredients than I am accustomed to in meatloaf, including a degree of heat, although not excessive. It was topped with a generous portion of golden fried onions, and accompanied by a huge serving of skin on mashed red potatoes! The only downside for me was the gravy, which I am grateful came in a separate container on the side. I'm not a fan of tarragon or thyme or whatever it was loaded with. Lots of people at the bar were eating it, but I didn't notice whether or not they used\/ate the gravy. Simply a matter of preference I guess.

Please consider this review with a grain of salt. I've traveled and eaten extensively, but I'm not a critic. I just know what I like. You may love what Bobby Q's has to offer. The only thing that I am really sold on is the wonderful customer service. I'll also throw in that they appear to have lots of regulars, and that lunch appeared to be a bustling affair with no lack of diners.",1,1,1

The play on words for the restaurant's title was what caught my attention but I came into Bobby Q with my sister and boyfriend since we were craving some good BBQ. 

We ordered the Cajun Shrimp appetizer to start. The shrimp is sauteed in beer; this was the standout factor for me in this dish because I could actually taste the flavor of the beer, which complemented nicely with the Cajun seasoning and butter. 

We ordered the Full Baby Back Rib BBQ Platter to split 3 ways. You can choose from a list of sides such as mac and cheese, shoestring fries, ranch beans, mashed potatoes and pecan cole slaw. We decided to get mac and cheese and shoe string fries. I was expecting to be given additional plates to pick off the rib platter but our waitress was kind enough to have the kitchen split the dish on 3 separate plates, with a portion of mac and cheese and shoe string fries on each plate. Right when I started cutting my ribs, the meat fell cleanly off the bone. The 22 hour smoking process yields amazing results because the meat was moist, tender and just plain heavenly! The BBQ sauce was tangier than most but was delicious. My sister even loved the ribs and she's not a huge meat person. 

Lastly, what made the experience worthy of the 5 star rating was the service. The service was PHENOMENAL! Our waitress, Kessa, was informative on the restaurant's history (they used to be Bobby McGee's!) and their smoking process (the meat is smoked for up to 22 hours). In addition, the manager\/restaurant owner personally came up to our table to see how we were enjoying our food. Our waitress was also sweet enough to bring us a half dozen complementary cinnamon donuts to end our meal!",4,3,2

Well, I was not disappointed.  The pork was tender with great flavor, overflowing off the bun, creating a sticky BBQ mess (which is just the way I like it!) I went for the ranch beans instead of the fries, and while you don't get a lot, they were very good.  I skipped the corn bread and little dessert donuts (didn't need the carbs) but everyone else loved them.

You guys know your stuff and I do trust Yelp when it comes to searching out new places.  As I've said before, I am no bbq afficianado, I just know what I like.  It was a weeknight when we went so it was not super busy.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  I noted that there was a large bar area and thought that this place was probably a hoppin joint on a Friday or Saturday night.  

Our server was very pleasant and helpful.  I asked what she liked on the menu and she told me her favorite was the brisket but she recommended I try a combo.  I got brisket and ribs.  I started wih a salad which was tasty and fresh.  My meal arrived shortly after and our server was correct, the brisket was so tender it just melted in my mouth.  It had a nice flavor.  Now, on to the ribs....yet again, melt in your mouth, tender and flavorful.  My daughter was happy as a clam with her chicken strips.  So, why only three stars?  Well, I don't usually disclose things like this but about an hour after we got home, I made several trips to the comode.  I never have issues when I eat, ever.  Something did not sit right with me or something was not good.  Was it the salad?  Don't really know but it lasted for two days.   Suffice it to say that, if that happend to you, would you be leary to give a stellar review and go back soon after?  

Bobby Q's has a nice atmosphere, cozy and warm.  I loved the music that was playing......blues and old soul.  The service was great too.  The other issue that I had was the location.  If I did not have a GPS, I never would have found the place.  It's set back off the road and the signage is very small.  

Maybe I'll give it another try in a year or so.....when the two days on the comode is a faint memory.",3,5,3

I made a reservation (they get an extra shout out for being on Open Table) and it's a good thing I did. 6:15 on a Wednesday and the place was packed and many people waiting to be seated. We were promptly seated thanks to my reservation. 

Our server came by to take our drink order and asked if we wanted any appetizers. Knowing what we would most likely be in for food wise, we skipped the appetizers and went right to dinner. 

To drink I ordered sweet iced tea. $2.00 I love this stuff and order it wherever, whenever I can!  

Though we skipped the appetizers, we did order salads which were really great, $5.50. Ranch house salad, my favorite type anywhere. Crisp lettuce, cheese, tomato, red onion and ranch dressing. Simple and delicious! 

My friends split the Whole Hog Heaven platter. They could choose two kinds of ribs, two meats and three sides. They ended up ordering double ribs and double brisket. There was so much food that four people could have easily split it. $48.00

Being a prime rib fan, I had to go for it. I ordered the smoked 10oz slab $26.00. It was outstanding! I was a little afraid the smoked flavor would overpower the meat...Not at all. It was just right. My entree came with two sides so I had mac and cheese and potato salad. Both outstanding! 

Dessert was tempting as mud pie was available which I would normally go for. There just wasn't room after all that food! We did however receive a complimentary bag of mini doughnuts. Served hot and dusted with cinnamon and sugar. Delicious and just right. You can take those home if you want. 

Everything about our evening at Bobby Q was outstanding. We were taken very good care of by our server and management checked on us a couple of times. Special shout out to one of the managers on duty Donnie. He was very friendly and went above and beyond to make sure we were enjoying our evening. Nice touch!

Ended up here for a friend's birthday. The restaurant is big and airy and laid out well. They can pack them in but not like sardines. The tables are nicely spaced out and for such a big place, it has charm and is comfortable. The hostess desk rocks - friendly and efficient. We had a reservation for 7pm on a Wednesday, in the summer. I can only imagine how busy it gets on a weekend in prime season...so plan ahead and make a reservation. And GPS how to get there, if you've never been or are new to the valley. Running on the frontage road near I-17, it's easy to end up on a wrong street. Then again, once you've been here once, you'll never forget how to get back. Follow your gut instincts...

 The prime rib looked so delicious that I had to order it (great prime rib is harder to find than you'd think). But everything I tasted was out of this world:

House Salad (I love this kind of classic salad! For a perfect dressing - combine the dijon and herb vinaigrettes)

Corn bread (ask for honey with the butter)
Prime Rib (medium rare, naturally)
Brisket
Mac and Cheese
BBQ pulled chicken (I have never liked BBQ chicken before eating Bobby Q's - DELISH!)

It was a taste bud bonanza.

**They were out of the Mississippi mud pie (which I am such a fan that not getting to sample theirs could plummet a rating but everything was too good for anything other than 5 stars). So we sampled the cobbler - yum.

The service was friendly, cheerful, competent and pretty much perfect. 
**I will mention that as a group of adults, our meal came a little quicker than was ideal. But Bobby Q's is popular for a reason and the service is so competent that knowing that, I will just order a little slower\/staggered, when I return with adult friends. 

Families with kids - you will not have any problem feeding your kids in a timely manner. I imagine the service is perfectly paced for families.

And as if all that isn't wonderful enough, they give you a bag of the best cinnamon dusted mini donuts to take with you!!!  They are as good of donuts as Cafe du Monde serves beignets. Only problem, I couldn't eat another bite.

So diners - here's my final tip - store the bag of donuts in your fridge, overnight and then reheat in the microwave (still in the paper bag) for 30 seconds. Have with your morning coffee. You're welcome.

My son and his dad got the ribs again and when they came with my order (the chicken) I was very very very disappointed. So bad that I was trading it for just a bite of the rib.

What can I say that has not already been said in previous reviews.  We knew to arrive early on a Saturday (4pm) with reservations for 4:15.  It was just starting to become busy with about 50% tables filled.  Our server was AJ.  Very knowledgeable and attentive.  Made excellent recommendations. We started with those little Q-rolls.  A meal could be made of those alone but we restrained ourselves.  Egg roll type dough wrapped around BBQ beef with Chipotle and bbq dipping sauces.  Yum.  
    My family had beers.  Not a beer drinker myself but they have a good selection.  I had the frozen lemonade which was excellent.  Only change I would make would be to leave the sugar off the glass rim because it falls off and makes everything sticky.  Not enough paper napkins at the table to dip into the water glass to try to clean up the sugar mess.
   Main meals were outstanding.  Between the 3 of us we had sausage, brisket, fried catfish, and 3 orders of baby back ribs.  All were fall off the bone, tender and flavorful.  The catfish was a crispy breaded boneless fillet, perfect size. Extra BBQ sauce was brought to the table by AJ.  Spicy and mild.  Combining the 2 brought on an extra depth of flavor.
   Our sides were cole slaw, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, ranch beans.  All were excellent, especially the mac and cheese which had a nice little kick to it.  At this point we decided if we didn't stop, we would need help getting out of the restaurant.  But we could not leave without those little bits of heaven, hot donuts.  Fresh off the donut machine they are a perfect ending to the meal.  Did I mention leftovers?  We took enough home for all of us to have 2 more meals each.

My wife liked the cornbread. But overall was just okay food wise when considering the main attraction is the BBQ itself. Again service was awesome and she was tipped well for that and not the food. Ambiance is good but I tend to rate places on food and overall experience and the meat brought it down. Much better BBQ places around but perhaps just none in this area.,1,0,0

Going to a restaurant does not simply means putting your butt on the chairs and eating what ever they give you. It also means enjoying your meal and satisfying your taste. 

Bobby Q just has everything it need to be the best Phoenix steakhouse. The price is not too bad if I compare to what I enjoy when eating here. My friend and I ordered the Two Rib Combo which includes two sides. We want to share, so the staff put on two different plates for us. We finish our lunch with ice cream. We decided to pick Death by chocolate, but the guy recommend me to pick Miss Mcgee's Mud Pie. That was delicious.

We came there pretty early, only three tables have people. But when we left, they were all full. Such a popular and crowded business.

When my group got there, we were served very fast and they took our orders.  Service from the waitresses was GREAT! 
Pros:

One great thing about this place is that they serve limitless CORNBREAD!  For a hungry team, this is amazing, especially before your food gets there.  

Now to the food.  The FOOD is great quality.  I loved the flavor of the ribs and bbq sauce.  The mac-n-cheese wasn't the best, but it was good.  I would say the spare-ribs were better than the beef ribs here.  
What was also nice was that they let us split checks which made it a lot easier for us to pay.  They waitresses also gave us complimentary doughnuts which is awesome.  

CONS:
When I went here, the portions of the meals weren't what we were expecting for the price.  A few of my teammates ordered the two rib meal and they didn't get much food.  We had to ask if there was a mistake because there was such little food for the price.  The manager(?) came and apologized and said they ran out of ribs?  I don't know exactly how valid this excuse is, but whatever.  I think that for an establishment such as this, it should have been a bit more prepared considering we did have reservations.  This is probably the reason why I am not giving them a full 5 stars.  I know the experience might have been different under different conditions.  Hopefully next time, our experience might be a bit better food quantity wise.",1,0,0

This restaurant is very inviting.  Open  yet cozy and the patio is nice too.  They bring you hot corn bread when you sit down that is to die for.  They bring butter with it but I think it is already drenched in butter.  Very rich and delicious.  Not your typically dry corn bread by a long shot.

My husband and I ordered the 3 meat combo that comes with 2 sides.  We ordered the short ribs, pulled pork and ""Broasted"" chicken with Macaroni and Cheese and cole slaw with pecans.  The ribs were are absolutely our favorite.  Best ribs we've ever had.  The pulled pork was equally good and the chicken was great too although we would have liked a piece of white meat.  As someone else stated, they bring their two sauces in warming containers so that the sauce is warm and doesn't cool your meat.  The spicy sauce was our favorite and we used the entire container.  My husband said the mac-n-cheese was the best he had ever had.  It was good, I'm just not an expert on that dish.  I liked the pecans on the cole slaw.

My son was with us and he ordered the cheeseburger off of the kids menu.  The adult menu claimed to have some sort of fantastic burger and he was not happy that we made him get the kids burger.  Until it came.  They do not skimp on the kids!  His burger was huge, hand formed, and absolutely delicious!  He kept going on about how great it was so I had to have a bite.  Grilled deliciousness.

The fresh made donuts they give you on the way out are a nice touch but I was way to full to even comtemplate trying one.  My husband and son said they were great.

Only disappointment-Shoestring Fries.  I like big steak fries.

Good Q flavor is a fairly subjective thing.  That being said, well-cooked meat should be pretty objective.  The meats I had here, I wasn't real excited about.  

There's ""falling off the bone tender,"" and then there's mush.  I found ours to be of the mushy variety.  The mouth-feel was pretty weird.  We had the baby backs, pulled pork, and brisket.  There was not much outer crust, and that's what held what flavor the meat possessed.  Under that was lightly-flavored mush.  The baby backs had potential.......

Sides we had:  pecan coleslaw (""we ran out of pecans"") - I liked it because it wasn't of the sugary-sweet-and-gloppy southern variety, and I could actually taste the cabbage.....mac 'n' cheese - ton of very creamy sauce that was on the bland side.....beans - pretty good, and I'm not a fan of BBQ beans, usually.....roasted corn - very buttery.....corn bread - flat disks that were of the crumbly-and-not-too-sweet type, as opposed to the cake-disguised-as-cornbread kind a la Marie Callenders.

Manager visited our table to check on the sevice and food. I appreciate it when staff makes sure we are enjoying our visit. 

Food: Exceptional bbq!!! Prime brisket was juicy and tasty. Baby back ribs were very tender and falls off the bone but still has that chewy texture that releases more flavor. Sausage is sweet and garlicy. A perfect pair for something starchy like mashed potato or rice. Beef ribs are tender and the fat around it is full of smoky goodness.

Take out was quick and we were out the door in 15 minutes, despite a packed house. Service was very friendly too.

I'd recommend the brisket and baby back ribs. My boyfriend said the St. Louis ribs were just ok. The sides were equally delicious! The mac and cheese + cornbread (complimentary) were my favorites!!!

Compared to Phil's BBQ, our party agreed that Bobby Q's is much tastier.

My suggestion is to stick to the ribs - or brisket if that's your BBQ of choice - but I highly recommend the full rack of ribs.  I'm sure the steaks and burgers are good, but if you want a steak you go to Dominick's; if you want a burger you go to In N Out; if you want ribs you go to this place.

Every (literal) thing was delicious from the homemade pecan cole slaw to the light barbeque sauce (which acts as showcase for the food, rather than ""hiding"" behind the sauce at Bobby Q's). 

Our waitress Cristin took a real interest in telling us what special things the owner had collected and curated in his travels while developing his own barbeque style. The staff very much love working here and have a lot of respect for the food and for the patrons enjoying their food. They were so sweet and considerate to have given us beignets to bring home for our game night. 

We are from out of town but I cannot highly recommend Bobby Q's enough, and we will DEFINITELY be returning next time we are in Phoenix.

But a friend suggested I try this place for great BBQ so last week I took the 17 minute drive and was absolutely knocked out on a number of levels. 

The service of this establishment is superb. It is one of the best managed restaurants I've ever patronized and the staff, from the bartender to the server all operated at a very high standard. 

Now as for the food, one night I had their St Louis style ribs SANS the extra sauce ( I am a dry rub guy) and they were superb. Not fatty at all, tasty,  and the meat fell off the bone. Good fries and a very nice pecan coleslaw. Buy the chicken tender appetizer? OMG! By far and away the best I have had anywhere in the country!

Last night I enjoyed the fried chicken which is actually a butterflied breast of chicken - also excellent. The friendly gentleman sitting next to me at the bar had their prime rib and LOVED it. It looked AWESOME!

A big shout out to the manager Taylor who handled a minor issue ( my bad, not Bobby Q) in a MOST professional way. If in Phoenix you absolutely MUST go and if you're coming in for only 3 or 4 days, I would absolutely recommend you place Bobby Q on your list as those restaurants you simply cannot overlook on your trip to the desert.",1,0,1

We are in town for a week from Southern CA for a baseball tournament for my son & looked to Yelp for a top BBQ joint in town that we don't have in our neck of the woods.  We hit a grand slam choosing Bobby Q.  From the minute we sat down, our waiter Tommy (who was fantastic), told us the history of the place, made recommendations for us & was very attentive the entire meal.  The cornbread muffins were delicious.  We ordered the Q rolls & spinach artichoke cheso dip as appetizers.  The Q rolls were AMAZING - highly recommend.  The spinach dip was very good, especially when I asked for tortilla chips instead of the bread that comes with it.  For our meal we got the big ""Hog Meal"" I think it was called.  You get to choose 2 types of ribs (a full rack), we got a full rack of baby back, 2 types of meats (1 lb), we chose brisket & pulled pork & 3 sides but we chose 4, coleslaw, mac n cheese, fries & roasted corn.  BY FAR the best meat was the baby back ribs.  The bones were just there for looks cuz that meat FELL OFF THE BONE.  They were so good.  The pork was tasty too, brisket was our #3 favorite but very tender.  The coleslaw is delicious, my son loved the mac n cheese & fries & the corn was smokey yummy tasting too.  At the end, when they bring the bill, they bring these SINFUL homemade donuts with the check.  OMG!!  They were so good.  I had to get a second little bagful on the way out.

One of my husband and I's favorite date spots. We always prefer to sit at the bar. I love the warm atmosphere. Makes me feel like I'm in a real BBQ joint somewhere in the South. I have never been here when it's not busy. There is typically a wait, but usually not for the bar. (Pro-tip and part of why we are ""Bar People."")As you walk through the front door, you are not only hit with the delicious smell of BBQ, but something else... Cinnamon? YES! Right behind the Hostess stand, you will notice a few of the girls making fresh, home-made, cinnamon and sugar covered donuts. They place them in cute little paper bags and they come with every meal. Even when you think you are so full, you couldn't stuff anything else in your belly... they hand you these melt in your mouth, warm, fresh out of the fryer, donuts. And you will finish them. Trust me. 

But let's start at the beginning shall we? Guest's get a complimentary basket of their home made Cornbread after they are sat, always nice, but I try to save as much room as possible for the good stuff. I have never gone to Bobby Q's without first ordering the Q-Rolls to start. The BBQ Version of a Taquito. A white tortilla, filled with Smoked Brisket and served with a chipotle dipping sauce. These little babies are the best ""Taquito's"" you will ever have in your life. The chipotle sauce is a bit sweet and compliments not only the chipotle but the Brisket very well. 

As for dinner, my husband and I always share and rarely come home without a to-go box. Our Favorite dinner to order is the Pick 2 Wood Fired Barbeque Platter. The Sliced Beef Brisket and the Smoked Chicken are my favorites. The Brisket is so tender, you can cut it with your fork. (That goes for any of the meats really. No need for a knife here unless you get a steak.) Drizzled with their House, Home-made BBQ Sauce. Perfectly sweet and tangy. The Chicken with its smoky, smothered in BBQ Goodness its juicy and tender. We have had the ribs, the pulled pork, and the sausage. Pretty much anything under the Platters section of the menu... we have had it, and I have yet to leave feeling unsatisfied. As far as sides go... I don't care what you get as long as you also get the Mac & Cheese. This is a MUST!! So creamy and decedent. It's hard to finish sometimes. The best Mac I have ever tasted. 

And there you have it. The best BBQ this side of Phoenix. I dare anyone to say different. Ok... I need to mop up my keyboard now and head to Bobby Q's ASAP. See you there!",17,12,16

But alas!  I have found BBQ, very good BBQ here in AZ, at Bobby Q's.  We ordered a platter of beef ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  It was properly 'Texas' sized too!  I can't even tell you how tender the beef was because my description will not justify it.  I will tell you, the VERY thick, juicy and tasty meat literally fell off the VERY large bone when simply picked up from the plate.  The pulled pork was just as good but that's not hard to mess up.  The real BBQ gauge for me was in the brisket.   And again, I must confess, no description of mine will get even remotely close to how heavenly it truly was.  It far exceeded my expectation and I'll just say, the bar I set was very high!  So, I'm a fan of this BBQ as long as it stays as is, where is.

I use that place as the baseline for the best bbq I have ever had. Well, Bobby Q went as close to that level as ANY place I have been to since. The ambiance when you walk in sets the mood for carnivorous meal you are about to encounter. I went with the 3 meal combo, St. Louis ribs, Beef ribs, and the coup de gras sliced beef brisket. The St Louis and Beef were the damn near the best I ever had. I typically ask for the sauce on the side, so I can taste the meat and carefully add the sauce on my own, but this time I forgot. Regardless, it was cooked perfectly and sauced just enough, so the meat was still the star of the plate. The meat came perfectly off the bone and with the sauce was amazing. Herein lies why they didnt get the 5th star. The sliced brisket, although tasty, lacked the nice smoke ring and was cooked a bit too long. Again, it was still delicious, but I couldnt give the 5th star because of that. Also, the mac n cheese, which they say is very popular, was starchy (mind you I dont mind cheese) but the that was lacking in the taste. I washed it down with West Coast IPA from tap so that was a plus as well! And of course, complimentary to the meal was cinnamon sugar mini donuts, 2 per customer that came out with the bill.

Great decor. Fast and friendly service. And most importantly good food. Go on Sunday's and they have special called Hog's Heaven at a discounted prices ($28). It comes with 1\/2 pound each of the following: Chicken, Brisket, St Louis Ribs, Baby Back Ribs and two sides. More than enough food to feed 4 adults and 4 children. 

The brisket was my favorite. It was melt in your mouth good. I would have preferred if they did not douse it with BBQ sauce as I like it on the side. It was still good. Ribs were off the bone delicious. These were my kids favorite. The chicken was moist. For the two sides we ordered shoe string fries, they were OK, nice and crispy and the grilled veggies. 

When you leave they give you complimentary donuts, which are freshly fried in the front. They have a cool looking mini fryer. They were yummy according to my kids. I did not partake in those as I was stuffed. 

I will be going back to this place again fo-sure. 

BTW there is a bar with a dance floor on the other side of the restaurant for those of you who are interested. Look they were just getting ready for the night crowd when we were leaving.",1,1,1

The grilled corn, coleslaw and mac and cheese went perfect with the BBQ. I liked the memphis more than the baby back (they were a bit on the dry side), and the chicken was super juicy.

However, the boyfriend and his family are fans and we decided to go eat here this last weekend for the boyfriend's birthday. This night also happened to be the same night of the ""Phoenix Hurricane"" so we were happy to see the power was on, but boy were they busy!

Something I have always found helpful: ""Never eat at a restaurant that's not busy.""

We had to wait for almost an hour for a table for 6, but we knew that going in and just waited on the patio. I don't know if they are always that busy, but it seemed the waiting area could definitely have more chairs or space for that term of wait. And if the weather happens to not be so agreeable, like that night, they could use a bit more coverage so patrons aren't getting soaked. 

Anywho - onto the meat - literally. We were sat and started salivating over the menu - all sounded and looked good (I order via Yelp photos). We each ordered something different and there was a lot of sharing going on. One in our party was happy to hear they still offered the Crab Legs dinner, so take note if that's your fancy. We ordered the Rotisserie Chicken meal with (2) sides: mac and cheese and a loaded baked potato. Everything was delicious and satisfying and was plenty of food - I could have probably taken some home - and all for $13. In my opinion, this place has great prices. I expected, with the look and feel of this restaurant, to be a bit over-charged but I was pleasantly surprised. 

Boyfriend ordered the Brisket meal with (2) sides, and dang that meat was tasty! We loved how it came with sauce on it, unlike a lot of these places that are serving you sauceless, dry meat and you have to add it yourself. We also asked for extra and we loved how they brought us our own 'jugs' of regular and spicy (we used up all of the spicy) sauces for the table. 

I cannot remember our server's name, but she was awesome. The definition of what service should be in a busy, family style restaurant. We had a lot of requests for her and she was being asked for this and that left and right by almost every member of our table and she handled each one with patience and grace - I was impressed. And I am rarely impressed by servers lately. 

If it was pouring, and half of the city's power was out, and we had to wait on the patio for an hour for a table - I would still come here and eat again. I am actually looking forward to it. 

OMG those donutsssssssssssss. Make sure you get some.

I highly recommend the St Louis style ribs. All the ribs are cooked for 10+ hours so they fall right off the bone and melt in your mouth.

Another gem of a find from Yelp while staying in Phoenix. Again, out of the way, from where we were staying anyway.  Another place smack dab in the middle of a neighborhood. Another place with friendly service, amusing barfly regulars, and good food.  If it weren't so hot in Phoenix, I'd have a crisis about living arrangements!

Happy Hour in the bar was great: $3.00 large beers on tap and 1\/2 off appetizers. We shared some hot wings which were very tasty. I wanted more of those, for sure.

After about 3 or 4 beers, we went with the Whole Hog Feast. The name alone is awesome!  For 36 bucks we got:
-Baby Back Ribs
-St. Louis Ribs
-Pulled Pork
-Beef Brisket
-Mac N. Cheese
-Cole Slaw
-Baked Potato
-Cornbread

Um, hello?!?! This was so much food and it was all good!  The cornbread was sweet and had great texture; meat was tender and flavorful, mac n cheese was rich and creamy. A little spicy bbq sauce on the side to kick everything up was a nice addition. Mouth is watering a little now just typing it out!

Atmosphere: The exterior is quite deceiving. It looks like an old, big shack. The interior is gigantic and cozy. It is clean and organized. There's a pretty bar area, a doughnut station, and lots of tables. They have a separate area with another bar that I think is used for private parties or probably weekend nights. There were some cool decorations on the walls all over the place.

Service: It was great!!! Our server was so knowledgeable. She was friendly and personable, and she had fantastic, flawless makeup! Lol. A manager came by our table to see how we were doing during our meal. It added a nice touch knowing that they cared.

Food: Delicious! Cornbread? Yes! I ordered the grilled shrimp with macaroni and corn. The shrimp was cooked to perfection! And the seasoning was great. It was also great on the corn. I probably could've just eaten corn as a full meal and been happy. Hehehe. The macaroni was delicious, but it was as good as my mother-in-law's. Lol. My co- worker really enjoyed her meal - pulled pork and coleslaw. We split a dessert - the mud pie, and it was good, but we were hoping it'd be on par with the rest of the food. It wasn't, but it didn't take away from the meal. The best was probably the doughnuts!!! They give out free mini doughnuts. They are fresh and sooo wonderful!!! Don't forget them on your way out!",8,5,7

One thing that I didn't really like was that the tables were too close to each other giving people no room to move their chair if they had to leave. We sat all the way in the back by a wall and it was very uncomfortable and if you try moving the table forward to have more space then you'd already be touching the other table that's in front of you. 

We ordered our food and the guy took down our orders and he brought out the corn bread that came with our food. The corn bread was the only thing I really liked about this place. It was so soft and once you put the butter on it it just melts and when you take a bite it just melts in your mouth. So good! 

However, I didn't like my food. I ordered baby back ribs with a side of Mac and cheese and fries. First of all, the ribs tasted weird, not like any other ribs I've had, it wasn't that good, I didn't even finish it. The only the I liked about the ribs were how soft it was, other than that, I wouldn't order it a second time. Fries were good. Mac and cheese, not my favorite. I didn't really enjoy my meal at all! 

Another thing, we had ordered potato soup which I'm assuming should come out before the main meal, they guy forgot to bring it. I'm sorry but I'm sure you're supposed to be writing stuff down so you DON'T forget to bring? People need to be more careful. 

Everyone I was with had ordered rib eye steak and said it was pretty good so you should probably order that instead of ribs. 

And the only thing that was pretty sweet was the guy brought us more corn bread to take home.",2,1,0

We came at around 12pm and there wasn't a line, and we were seated at a large table. The waitresses were very nice, and brought us water once we sat down. We saw the fresh mini donuts being made near the front of the door and they kindly gave us some before our meal; the donuts were dusted with cinnamon sugar and they were delicious! The donuts were soft, warm, and perfectly fried. After the donuts, we decided on the Whole Hog, which was quite a lot of food for three girls. The whole hog came with St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, three sides (which we ordered shoe string fries, mashed potatoes, and corn), BBQ chicken, and brisket, as well as cornbread. The cornbread was buttery and delicious, and it tasted great with the whipped butter. The bbq was honestly the best I have yet to have! The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, and the meat had a good fat-to-meat ratio. Of the meats, my favorite was the smokey St. Louis ribs, which were less saucy and contained chewy tendons (if you're into that like I am). The mashed potatoes was also super buttery and smooth, and tasted almost like a dip. Also, the waitress brought two pitchers of BBQ sauce, one spicy and one original, so be prepared to drench all the meat in even more sauce. 

After the meal, the waitress was super kind and brought us another round of donuts!

Upon nearing the building on foot, I was impressed with all of the outside seating available, complete with an outside bar and several TV's.

We were promptly seated, as it didn't appear very busy for a Saturday evening.  The hostess and waitress were very friendly and knowledgeable.  Soon after ordering our drinks, we were given two pieces of cornbread, which were tasty and not just regular square, dry cornbread that comes from the box.

Soon after we each ate a piece of cornbread and had consumed some our drinks, we couldn't believe it when our order arrived so quickly!  (I've had to wait much longer at Dairy Queen for food).  I got a half rack of St Louis-style ribs, which were very good, but a little more expensive than other places charge, but worth it for the quality of service and cleanliness of the restaurant.  The macaroni and cheese didn't disappoint us. It was very cheesy and pleasing to the taste buds. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they give a ten percent discount when you check-in there on yelp, which is always an added incentive.

After finishing our meal, we were given a couple of ""Thank Q's,""  which are their freshly made small doughnuts that are a nice little complimentary dessert.

Last month we took our newborn son for his first visit :) We love that the manager always walks up to your table to make sure your visit is going well. They also have response cards (usually on the table, but not always) that you can fill out with when you were there and how your server was. That definitely shows that they really care about the service they are providing. Though it's almost always very busy, they have great service and the food comes out quickly and hot. Speaking of the food.. My husband is obsessed with their ribs and spicy BBQ sauce (he always asks for his own BBQ sauce bottle to have at the table) He also loves their burgers and swears that the Mac n cheese is the best in the world. When I go I get the steak sandwich. It's juicy steak cooked to perfection on garlic bread with sautéed mushrooms, au jus sauce, and fried onion strings on the side, incredible. But in saying that.. I always try to go on Saturdays because they have a steak and crab special for $18. Their crab is to die for! They place a candle on your table with a butter tray above it that's perfectly melted and warm. I also love their shoestring fries.

Louis ribs, and brisket. Wife ordered brisket, pork, and St. 
Louis ribs, she had the mac and cheese for her side. I could not decide on potato salad or cole slaw, our waitress brought me both! All the meats were some of the very best, the brisket better than any I have ever had. Ribs were good, have had some close, but not quite as good as Bobby's. Chicken was very moist and tender. Corn bread was very good, came with whipped butter but did not need any on it, it stood alone like a champ. The only item that was not absolutely best was the pork. It was good, just not over the top like the other choices. Their potato salad is the BEST, we always measure the salad against MIL's, and this was close. Cole slaw was standard fare with chopped pecans, not a big chopped pecan fan, so I didn't really care for it, was just standard old cole slaw, nothing ""special"".

As soon as we were seated, our server came over with a friendly greeting and a basket of warm cornbread.  She recommended the Q Rolls which are flour tortillas stuffed with smoked brisket and deep fried.  5 rolls per order - served with chipotle ranch dressing and bbq sauce.  The perfect combination, moist brisket inside a crispy tortilla shell.

Hubby prefers the St. Louis ribs and I had the baby back ribs.  The ribs had a nice smokey flavor and the meat practically fell off the bone.  Each bite was a a mouthful of heaven.

We chose the mac and cheese and the pecan salad as our sides,  The mac and cheese was nice and creamy.  The pecan cole slaw was okay.  Basically coleslaw sprinkled with chopped pecans.

Service was great!  Our server was very attentive.

They were out of sausage so we split the brisket, pork (my favorite), and ribs (his favorite).  It was so nice of them to provide us with 2 plates with all of the meats split so we could sample everything. I also tried the mango margarita which was fabulous and the perfect bite and sweetness.

Bobby Q hit the spot. We started with the hot wings--all drummettes--kind of standard hot wing fare. 

We all shared the ""whole hog"" platter which consisted of 2 slabs of ribs and 2 different bbq meats. They ran out of baby back ribs (booooo...) so we got the St. Louis ribs and the beef brisket and sliced bbq pork.  All very good stuff. The meat was tender and flavorful. I particularly liked the brisket. The waitress said that the ""whole hog"" would feed 3-4 people so we ordered the fried catfish as well.  I guess she meant 3-4 HUGE people, because it fed 6 of us and we still had leftovers (4 guys and 2 girls). The catfish was also good, not overcooked. We shared 4 sides: mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, grilled veggies, and roasted corn. The sides were quite satisfying, but not outstanding. 

We all ordered the fresh lemonade as a beverage--good but too sweet so I had ask for unsweetened ice tea to balance it out. Again, we were all too stuffed for dessert.

Being that it's location is right off the I-17 we'd pass Bobby Q's many times & often thought it was a dive due to its location. We were pleasantly surprised as we walked in & were greeted by two friendly hostesses & a nice ambiance. Both my son & I were dressed casually. I looked around and noticed some guests were dressed up, while others were casual like us. I immediately felt comfortable.  It was a busy Sunday about 7:30pm. I requested a booth as I wanted to enjoy mother\/son conversation over a nice dinner. The restaurant's interior is a rustic western theme with a bar in the middle, dining patio in front & separate dancing lounge connected to the back.  Everything was very clean and orderly like a well oiled machine. Our server was professional, friendly and quick. My son ordered the hamburger with cheddar cheese from the regular menu which came with shoestring fries & I ordered the Rib Eye with roasted corn and mashed potatoes. Both of our meals were prepared according to our liking and tasted sensational! Prior to our entrees, the server brought out 2 warm pieces of round cornbread with butter. It was delicious! We wish we would have saved room for the banana cream pie, next time for sure!  Towards the end of our dinner the manager came to ask how our dining experience was, it's nice to know this business cares about their guests!

It is located not too far from my employer; however, I had never visited previously. Having lived in Atlanta for 12 years I enjoy barbecue, but have not found too many places in Phoenix that it well. My initial experience with Bobby Q was via catering at a work function. It was very good, especially for catered food and I added it to my mental list of places to try, but continually forgot to actually go. A few work friends were having a happy hour get-together and again I passed it up. Finally I went for lunch and was suddenly said that I have missed prior opportunities to go. 

I sat at a table in the bar area and the service was good. I had the sweet tea, which is a requisite for any good barbecue meal. The menu had several good looking items, but I went with the pulled chicken sandwich and a side of mac & cheese. The sandwich was excellent and I would put it right at the top of the Phoenix barbecue list. While the sandwich was great, the mac & cheese was phenomenal and I would rate it as the second best I have ever tried. I envisioned myself as David Blaine shackled into a phone booth filled with this mac & cheese and I had to eat my way out to survive. I win that battle my friend. I win that battle 9 times out of 10. And the doughnut things on the way out? Yes, please!

I will most definitely be back. I may go with the chicken again or try another tasty item from the menu, but whatever I get it will come with a side of mac & cheese.",4,2,1

The interior of the restaurant has a darker, vintage vibe to it and the outside patio is beautifully lit and adorned with a waterfall and misters for those infamous Phoenix summer days. The food experience was the fun part. We opted to for the Whole Hog which is a selection of three different meats of your choosing and three sides. We had the pulled pork,  the sausage, and the brisket. By far, the sausage there is the best sausage I've ever had.

Almost immediately after seating us at the booth at the bar (the wait was 50 minutes for a table vs immediate for the bar), the waitress showed up to greet us and get our drinks, and soon after brought us their oh-so-delicious cornbread.  We were set on the Whole Hog Heaven, which was a choice of 4 meats and 3 sides, but seeing that it was only me and my boyfriend. our waitress (I feel terrible for not remembering her name) suggested the Sunday special called the Family Platter which was for $33, you get a little less meat than the Whole Hog, 4 pre-chosen meats: chicken, brisket, pulled pork, and baby back ribs, and 2 sides.

Less than 10 minutes after placing our order, our food was here with an extra helping of spicy BBQ sauce.  It was marvelous.  The mac and cheese was the creamiest, cheesiest, most delicious mac and cheese my 10 year old self could ever ask for.  The shoestring fries were miserably thin, but I'm just biased being a fan of steak fries.  The brisket simply melts in your mouth.  The pulled pork does too, but only as much as pulled pork can.  The chicken was a lot better than I expected and I hate ordering BBQ chicken.  Oh but those ribs, the meat just fell right off the bone.  We were starving walking in, but stuffed after polishing off everything but the ribs.  My boyfriend, who had every intention of eating all of it right there and then, took a bite of the ribs, announced that we were going to take it home.  It was that good.  And that much food.  My only regret was not getting more cornbread.  But I can't really blame them for not offering considering how quickly they brought us that sheer amount of food.

In a nutshell, great, quick, and very accommodating service (the couple next to us wanted rotisserie chicken without any BBQ sauce.  Baffling, I know), delicious food, and tons of it!  But be sure to make a reservation.  Oh, and have I mentioned those cinnamon-dusted donut bites?  Bobby Q, you've ruined me forever.

Ranch beans are delicious but could be served hotter. The corn bread is yummy and moist. The potato salad is creamy and very flavorful (you better like dill). The brisket was moist and tender but the sauce was a little bland for me (I like more heat). The baby back ribs were over cooked. In fact, I didn't like the ribs.

I have often dragged my wife on BBQ treks for hundreds of miles. With that being said I have to begin by saying that Bobby Q has EXCELLENT BBQ. Tender, smoky and chock full o' flavor. I have been here multiple times and have never had anything that disappointed me...until last night. An event so treacherous and diabolical that it prevented me from rating them with 5 stars. The horror!

The in-laws were in from the East Coast and we decided to take them there for dinner. Everything was smashing and up to par as usual until dessert came. Now I have to go on record as saying that I always loved the heaping pile of scrumptious peach cobbler that they serve on the dessert menu. So much so that I convinced my table of 6 to order 3 since they are usually large enough to share and stunningly delicious. Every time I go to Bobby Q I finish off my meal with it and love to complain to my wife as I waddle out of the building (in the grand tradition of glutinous American excess) that I ate too much and my belly hurt. I was looking forward to lamenting my fate yet again last night. But alas, I was in for a shocking turn of events and was dubbed a deceitful liar by the entire table. 

To my horror when the cobblers arrived, they were measly, sickly, ill-prepared portions and a pale shadow of what they were on previous visits. We were plagued with three bowls of undercooked (as in practically raw) peaches that tasted like they were straight from a can and a soggy, undercooked thin square of ""crust"" sitting on top as an afterthought.  This flavorless absurdity could only have been more demeaning if it were capable of speech and threw dated insults at us. It literally looked like they dumped half a can of uncooked peach slices in a bowl and threw a wet piece of thin white bread on top. All three servings were like this. Now on EVERY occasion in the past the cobbler was gigantic, actually was cooked and warm, had a delectable FULL crust and tasted like it came out of Gramma' Cobbler's oven fresh. To this peach cobbler bizarro universe doppelganger I spit at thee and thine preparer. Bah I say. BAH.

Of course, we complained to the waitress who was nice but said she didn't know that it was any different from normal.  She went back to whoever prepared them and came back saying that the preparer said ""they're the same as they always were"" which either proved the preparer's incompetence or their willingness to shame the establishment with a bowl full of cobbler-like lies. Our waitress even said she talked to the manager who went back to speak with the preparer...but said manager never came out to either see the imposter cobblers or speak with us about it, which rates as quite poor customer service.  Overall, it left a dark mark on an otherwise belly -bustingly deeeelicious visit. Shame on you Robert Q, shame. 

So, I will still eat at Bobby Q. as their dinner fare IS fantastic (assuming there are no more obvious but blatently denied changes such as with the cobbler), the environment is cozy and the staff are (generally) quite pleasant. However,  I will be wary about ordering the dessert in the future and about the quality and integrity of their customer service skills. I would advise you to use the same caution.",4,2,1

As you walk up, the smells are incredible and you are greeted by very friendly people. I ordered the 3 sampler of pork, brisket and sausage. The sausage was smoked to perfection - very good. The others seemed on par with any other good bbq sampling - not disappointed but not blown away. Certainly worth a four-star, but not tickled plenty as a 5 star - bbq rarely is.

The veggies were grilled well and not too overly cooked.  The shoestring fries had enough crunch and saltiness.

The brisket quesadilla was huge, very meaty, and the meat inside was perfectly tender. The beer fries, oh the fries!

I've had some small martinis for $10 before...so this was just...whoa.

I had the pulled pork and mac and cheese. I will admit that the pulled pork was a bit dry, but a little extra BBQ sauce and that's an easy fix. Plus the BBQ sauce was delicious, so it gave me an excuse to use more! Win. 

The mac and cheese was, for lack of a better word, luscious. Creamy, cheesy and everything good southern style comfort food mac and cheese should be.

The real winner here for me was hands down the cornbread though. I'm a huge cornbread fanatic, and theirs was true southern to the core. Well done Bobbby Q, well done.

My boyfriend's favorite food is BBQ-anything so I left the ordering up to him (and the choice was easy): Whole Hog Heaven - 4 meat choices plus 3 sides. Settling on St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, BBQ Chicken, and Brisket, with sides of mac & cheese, coleslaw, and beans - he was as giddy as a kid on Christmas. I was pretty hungry too - and I had to admit the smell of BBQ wafting through the back kitchen door had my taste buds excited. The meal did not disappoint to say the least. The ribs were literally falling off the bone, the chicken was cooked perfectly, and the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender. All 3 sides were the perfect addition, however I do have to say that the coleslaw was my favorite, especially paired with the brisket.

The mashed potatoes are great, make sure you get extra gray cause that's the best part.

Finally went off the beaten path (literally) and tried Bobbie Q's after years and years of driving right by it along the I-17. If you're anything like me, you thought it may have looked a little questionable from the freeway. Old perhaps, run down, neglected? Let me assure you, none of these are the case at all. Once you navigate the side streets to find this hidden gem, you are sure to be pleasantly surprised just as we were. 

Prepare to be greeted at the hostess station inside a beautifully kept up and clean dining room. You may notice the donut machine just behind the hostesses making fresh little donuts which will be warm and waiting for you on the way out. Once seated, I highly recommend you order the Q Rolls, as stated at the beginning of the review. The beef brisket wrapped up inside them is out of this world good. Great dipping sauces too. 

For the entrees, we had a loaded baked potato with shredded chicken, a pulled pork plate, a brisket sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich. Aside from one small complaint of a little bit of extra fat in the pork plate serving, everything else was excellent. Didn't notice the fattiness in the pulled pork sandwich I had half of, so I'm guessing it was just a fluke. The half a brisket sandwich was outstanding and the potato with chicken was also very good. Tons of side dish choices too; sure to be something for everyone.

As for the service here, the servers and managers don't appear willing to let anyone get out of there unhappy. They pride themselves on having happy (and most likely return) customers. Just look at their current Yelp rating; that's not easy to do! We had two different managers come over and check on us at two different points during our meal. Our server took great care of us, even hooked my mom up with extra cornbread. Totally made her night. And to all of the guys out there: ice cubes in the urinals when it's time to relieve yourselves. How many places can claim that? ;-)",1,0,1

I do not give 5 stars unless it is truly deserved. ;) I'll be honest, I first went to Little Miss Barbecue today but I didn't want to wait in line and not even know if they would have what I want to order by the time I get to the front so I looked for a highly rated bbq restaurant close by.  I wasn't excited to drive 15 minutes more but I decided to take a chance and I am so glad I did. Bobby Qs is amazing BBQ! The ambiance is impress a date worthy. The food is delicious. Our waitress was so nice and her service was on point. We ordered the Q rolls as an appetizer and a three meat combo with mac & cheese and potato salad. Every bite was delicious.  So I had to try the banana cream pie for dessert. It was all to die for. I wanted to call ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"" or ""DDD"" and tell them they missed one! The St Louis ribs are perfectly seasoned, fall of the bone, smoky deliciousness. The brisket was juicy, thick cut, with just the right amount of bark on it. The pulled pork is tender and delicious.

The food was delicious.  I ordered the brisket platter, of course, and it was super yummy.  I got a big fat helping of tender brisket and two sides.  I chose the pecan cole slaw and the mac and cheese.  We also got cornbread with our meals.  The cornbread is really yummy, but strangely shaped into little disks.  The cole slaw was very good, with a great sweet flavor that was enhanced by the crunch of the pecans.  The mac and cheese was literally rib-stickin good.  It was the super thick and creamy kind that makes me weak in the knees.  The barbecue sauce served on the meat is fairly minimal, but they bring you plenty of extra so you don't have to worry.

The service was really above and beyond, at least 3 different staff members came to check up on us and everyone was SO friendly. (A certain resort in Sedona could learn from the people here!). 

The strawberry lemonade was super sweet and after you've stuffed yourself on delicious, moist BBQ, they give you 4 donuts in a bag with your check. Great idea because a bag of beignets certainly makes paying easier, though the food and service were so good, paying would never be a burden here.

For the love of everything tasty, this place was the BEST barbeque place I have ever been to (aside from a place I loved that went out of business in San Diego).  After reading all the reviews about the appetizers and entrees, I pretty much already knew what I wanted to order before even sitting down at our table.  

Our waiter, Lorenzo, couldn't have been better with his service and sense of humor.  The feel of the interior was a mix of casual and modern yet not too overly countryfied...there weren't dead animals hanging on the walls staring at me as I ate or hides either.

The group of us ordered the Onion Block for our appetizer.  I am not an onion person, but am a fan of the Bloomin' Onion at Outback.  But I can tell you right here and now that the Onion Block at BobbyQ's was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G-L-Y delicious!  It had the perfect crispy consistency, but what made it was the BBQ ketchup that it comes with.  I could have ate the sauce by itself.  The 6 of us ravaged it.  

For our entree, my husband and I went for one of the winning combinations, particularly the BBQ chicken and prime rib.  We decided on the ranch beans and the Mac & Cheese (after the reviews) for our sides.  I went to ask for an order of corn bread (3 for $1.50) but Lorenzo told me that he would bring us a basket for all of us.  So, I am not sure if that is something that is included, kind of like chips and salsa at Mexican food joints.  

The chicken was absolutely juicy and had the perfect amount of sauce and the prime rib was also juicy and melted in my mouth (we ordered it cooked Medium).  First, the Mac & Cheese was so very creamy and tasty that I had to stop myself from eating that and get back to the meat.  But the ranch beans tasted like so many others I have tasted, not bad though.  My friends and I, who also ordered the M&C, noticed a hint of jalapeno (not spicy, just the taste).  We asked Lorenzo and he told us they have two types of melted cheese in the kitchen, one being the cheese they usually use for the M&C and then this pepper jack\/jalapeno cheese they use for other dishes.  He had said they must have accidentally used the wrong one and that it hadn't been the first time it happened.  This was so not a problem, b\/c that jalapeno taste was actually what made it, I think.  I'll have to request it next time.  

The desserts didn't impress me much, but I knew from the reviews, we'd be getting free donuts before we left.  I loved that touch!  Mark my words, we will be going back more than once.  I'm sure we will take our in-laws and my family to give them the chance to taste BobbyQ's deliciousness!!!!!",4,1,4

The sides are well-prepared, including traditional cole slaw; corn; beans; potatoes.  For appetizers, try the sauteed shrimp...perfectly cooked and garlicky.

Okay, that might be a stretch.  I've lived all over the West. As a consultant and general contractor, I've been able to travel around quite a bit in the Central and Western US. Everywhere I went, there was always something wrong about the Q.

I stepped onto the Bobby Q ""campus"" (big property) and was immediately 'greeted' by beautiful shrubs and trees. The exterior is intentional, laid-back, and I love it. It sets you at ease so you can get ready for some great food. It reminds me of the roadside shacks we'd stop at on our family fishing trips in Texas. 

When you walk in the front door you're greeted by people who have ""tenure"". Some of the wait staff have been with the owner over 20 years. Now that's a testament to good business.

If I wasn't so hungry I would have stopped at that first bite knowing I had reached the apogee of barbeque gastronomy.

We always struggle trying to find a new restaurant  to add to our short list of favorites. BobbyQ made that list longer last night.

We arrived at 7:15 on a Friday night. This place was hopping. There was parking readily available so I thought we would get in right away.  There were at least 40 people waiting for seating when we approached to hostess stand. She very kindly took my name and told me I would be seated in 1 hr and 15 mins. After having a light lunch, that was a long wait. So, I asked about the bar seating and was told find a spot and its yours. I hovered around the bar and found an open patio bar spot with 2 seats open. It was perfect. Plenty of space, no jockeying for elbow room. No talking over our neighbors. Absolutely perfect. Our bartender Chris was very attentive. I told him we were newbies and on a busy night he told us the story BobbyQ. He told us his favorite foods and got us some water. Said any of the 3 bartenders would take our order. 

We picked the whole hog heaven,  lots of food for 2 people, but allowed us to try 2 styles of ribs, 1\/2 rotisserie chicken, and brisket. Also 3 side dishes for $48 bucks. There was so much food, we brought 80% home. 

The service: we were immediately served the complimentary cornbread. We ordered 2 strawberry lemonade and they were great. I thought I would be charged 4 bucks each but for these speciality drinks but they were 2.50. I pay that for a Coke in most places.   Settled in our seats and within mins our food arrived. And it was impressive. We enjoyed our dinner and asked for to go boxes. We packed our food and the store manager appeared ready to pack our boxes in BobbyQ shopping bag. He also brought the complimentary cinnamon donuts. Hot and yummy, we loved it. Thanks BobbyQ for a great Friday night! We will be back!

I ordered take out but their little after dinner doughnuts were a nice twist to bbq.  And the cornbread was certainly better than average.  My favorite part comes when we speak of the macaroni&cheese.  Who and how in the world did someone in Phoenix learn how to make mac n cheese like this ?!  I was skeptical when I looked at it because it was an off-white color.  But it was creamy and full of rich flavor.  I ordered the smoasted chicken and drizzled some of that bbq sauce on it.  It was well cooked and the bbq sauce was high quality with a little zip and long lasting good after taste.  Strongly recommed the sauce (on the smoasted chicken) and mac n cheese. 

Your mouth will water when we talk about the peach cobbler.  It's not the best I've had (3 places I've tried around the world have been better) but it's a B+++++.  The crust is almost candied and melts in your mouth.  The flavor is NOT too sweet or powerful to the point where you can only eat a few bites.  It was well put together.

To top it off, the person who answered the phone and took my order (and my money) had her customer service skills in high gear.  She made me want to return because I felt like I was being taken care of.  Big smile, plenty of suggestions on whether I wanted her to include an extra cornbread or a couple extra doughnuts....at no charge.  Very accomodating so I had no problem living her a nice sized tip.  She made the experience enjoyable and I will be back time and time again!!!",1,0,0

The service was stellar.  Honestly, I had forgotten what good service was like after moving to Arizona, and then I came here and was shocked.  The waiter was friendly and the manager came out and talked to us for a long time and even brought us some mac and cheese on the house!  Good service always equals a returning customer with me and I was impressed that they took the time to make you feel welcomed and happy. 
The mac and cheese was outstanding.  It was rich and creamy and the cheese had just enough flavor YUM!  The shoestring fries were also very tasty.  The meats here are very delicious.  They are slow cooked and tender as can be.

We've been having major bbq cravings for a while so we decided to research the top bbq places in Phoenix. Bobby Q came up as one of the top picks on Yelp so we decided to give it a try.

We were seated immediately, which is a pleasant surprise because we came around dinner time on a Saturday evening. Our server was Tommy, who was on point with everything from his food\/drink recommendations to fixing our wobbly table.

Scott and I ordered the Whole Hog which came with three sides of our choice, two ribs and two meats.

We ordered mac and cheese, beans and vegetables for our sides. The mac and cheese was soooooooo good! It was creamy and super cheesy but not overly salty. The beans were also delicious, it had a unique flavor and it came with plenty of meat in it.

For our ribs we ordered baby back and beef ribs. The baby back ribs were highly recommended by Tommy and they were our favorite!! They was so tender and very well seasoned... I couldn't stop eating them! I wasn't a fan of the beef ribs but Scott liked them. I thought the beef ribs were a little too tough.
For our meat choices we ordered pulled pork and beef brisket. These was also very tender and well seasoned. 

For drinks we ordered a spiked Arnold Palmer and their amber ale on tap. They were both really good!

OH! and the cornbread. I cannot forget to mention the cornbread. We've been to many places that serve cornbread, but these are my favorite! We had to get seconds...to bring home :D !

At the end of our meal, Tommy brought out 6 freshly made cinnamon sugar donuts to go...and I salivate just think about them. 

They brought two sauces to the table, one original and one spicy. The spicy sauce was good, but not spicy at all, and the original sauce smelled too sweet so I avoided it. 
I would have to compare the spicy bbq sauce side by side with Phil's in San Diego to make a fair comparison. But the meat quality at Bobby Q's is definitely better.

I'd say that Bobby Q's is the overall best rib place we've been to so far. Great food, great service, great drinks + donuts!",1,1,0

Then it changed with the times and became Bobby Q's BBQ.  The hubby and I had to try it after all our times there in high school, college and beyond.

My real complaint was the ribs. The baby back ribs were good, but a little overdone. I couldn't pick them up without them falling apart. Personally, I think they should be firm enough to hold together when you cut them and pick them up. But if I give the bone a firm tug, it should come out. It's a fine line and easy to cross. Bobby Q crosses the line, but all in all it's a very good BBQ joint. Given the competition in Arizona, it's easy to see why they are so successful.",1,0,1

You really feel like you are in another state and the food it's so picture perfect that my family\/friends back home their mouths are dropping because we don't have this back home an if we do, it is not the same.
The q-rolls with the brisket is one of my favorite appetizers to get and I heard it's something new they just added to their menu. I've never was fond of brisket because it always tasted so dry, but, Bobby Q's its amazing. The brisket is so juicy, slow roasted for at least 18-24 hrs daily, and taste of the bbq on it is simply just delicious!

The salad was good also and I gave it a 3. I liked the chicken but felt it only deserved a 3. Not bad but I have had many examples that were better. That's why my overall score for the meal is a 3.

I didn't expect a feast, and wasn't disappointed. the portions were what one would expect from a tasting platter: 4 or so small ribs, several forkfuls of pulled pork and 3-4 pieces of brisket. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the slaw. That thing had me pleasantly chowing down for more time than any of the meats I chose. 

How was the meat: the pulled pork was EXCELLENT. It was tender, juicy, and had just the right amount of BBQ sauce. The brisket was a bit on the lean side, but had enough help from the great house BBQ sauce to push that one through. When you got brisket that had a bit more fat to it, it would just melt in your mouth (that's the way brisket should be!). The ribs (St. Louis-style) were as good as everyone on here hypes them: the meat can be pulled off the bone with little to no effort. I don't recall how smokey the ribs were, but I liked them regardless and noted that the house wasn't trying to use rib-meat as a thinly-veiled vehicle for BBQ. The ribs were lightly sauced, and the strength of the preparation was, in no way, not masked by said sauce.

For dessert, my table order a 1\/2 order of the banana pudding, and a full order of the mud-pie. We *loved* the banana pudding (it's more like a banana custard atop a pecan-crumb crust), but couldn't find it in ourselves to enjoy the mud-pie. Our waitress was gracious enough to take the pie back and bring us a full order of banana pudding! What a gal!

Most dress casual, others put on a cute dress if they're in the mood. Do you! 

They're also extremely accommodating. On my second visit, we squeezed in a quick dinner before my flight.

Next came a a 50\/50 order of beef ribs\/brisket with roasted corn and baked beans, a 50\/50 of brisket\/baby back ribs with walnut coleslaw and mac & cheese, and a pulled chicken sandwich. 

Long story short, orgasms ensued. The beef ribs I had, were fall off the bone tender, smoky, slathered in perfect amounts of sauce, and just so so so so damn juicy and cooked like they said they do it. The meat just fell off when I bit into it, and the bbq sauce was so sweet and perfect. I would dunk all the food I ever eat for the rest of my life in this sauce. Probably the best ribs I ever had. The brisket was delicious, fork tender, not dry at all (close to the best I've ever had). The beans were porky, smokey, and flavorful, and the roasted corn was so so deliciously roasted.

Finished the night off with a peach cobbler, which was pretty much illegal. Ice cream melted into a deliciously cinnamon nutmeg concoction of sweetness and cobbler, the most perfect grandma-made style cobbler 
I've ever had. Not too tart, not too sweet, just perfect.

They have outdoor and indoor seating, and a dance club setting.  It still retains some of its vibe from when it was Bobby McGee's, just modern.   To be honest, this change in format was the best thing that happened to Bobby McGees, because it was starting to feel stuck in the 1970s.  Bobby Q's is just plain awesome.

And Kansas City BBQ is in my blood. That being said... This place has some amazing food. I had the St Louis Style ribs and the sliced brisket and it was amazing. Smoked and grilled to perfection. Just the right amount of bark on the brisket. Delicious ribs that almost fall off the bone. So good that I'm salivating thinking about it a day later.  

We also got the Barbeque Egg roll appetizer and it was delicious. The wrap for these rolls is a puff pastry that is fried around their delicious brisket. Dipping sauces are both wonderful. I really enjoyed the nice sweet smokiness of their regular BBQ sauce. The chipotle ranch is also quite good.

No complaints from anyone at our table. Southern Fried Chicken looked amazing. My wife got the pulled pork sandwich and let me taste... It was really good.

I just don't think you can go wrong here. The only downside is the price. You can easily drop $25 per person here, but it's money well spent on a damn fine meal.

Based on a recommendation, I ordered the two meat combo, brisket and pulled rotisserie chicken.  For sides I got the corn and a baked potato (not a traditional barbeque joint side necessarily, but it sounded good).  The brisket was soft, chewy, fatty - way too much so for my taste.  I was enjoying the chicken until I encountered a bone - that was the end of the chicken for me.  The corn was very tasty, and oh yeah - the cornbread - that was the best part of the meal!   In my opinion, the baked potato had been pulled from the oven about fifteen minutes too soon - it had yet to reach that fluffy potato interior that is so desirable about baked potatoes.

The corn was greasy, the fries were average string fries, and the mac and cheese was good (according to my wife since I think typical mac and cheese is too bland).

Yes, it was good. But, at least 75% of the cheese was Velveta\/processed cheese. It was smooth even when cold, real cheese doesn't do this.  But, again tasted very good.  Just don't exaggerate about its contents.

Thursday night at 6pm, they were busy and the speed proved that. 30min for two medium rare steaks. They were also still prepping the coleslaw due to them running out, which I received at the end of the meal.  Come earlier than 5:30pm!

Now, the Q-Rolls are absolutely awesome! Flakey, tasty and unique. Get them!

We ordered the 12oz Sirloin. Server stated 60 day aged in-house. It was super tender, flavorful and beautifully prepared! Seasoning very tasteful. If you like your steak well done, they you just burn your money away.  Medium or medium rare only!

When you step out of the car you instantly get hit with the delicious smell of smoking BBQ! The building has that roadhouse feeling but a more family atmosphere,  the inside is very nice and clean, dim lit and once again very nice atmosphere.  I ordered my favorite BBQ dish, the pulled pork sandwich w\/ mac n cheese as my side with a lemonade.  The wife had the beef brisket and the BBQ chicken with the pecan coleslaw and mashed potatoes as her side. While we waited for our meals they brought us some delicious corn bread that must have been freshly made, it was warm and sweet. So moist you could cut it with your fork and eat it like a pastry, leaving you wanting more after the last bite. Our food came shortly after we finished the cornbread so it had to be between 5-10mins from when we gave Autumn our orders. The smell was devine and the food presentation was very nice, not like your typical BBQ joints, it seemed a lil more fine dining, the quantities are more controlled , not just slapped on the plate in mass amounts. I first dipped into the mac n cheese and I'll tell you I could have stopped right there and not have tasted another thing and I would have left a happy customer, best mac n cheese I've ever had!!! Next I took a bite of my pulled pork sandwich and it did not disappoint. The bun it was served on was fresh and warm, the pork was succulent and smokey,  sauce was sweet and tangy which complimented the smoked pork.  The wife and i sampled eachothers food and every single bite was fresh, succulent, savory and absolutely delicious.  Hands down the best BBQ I have ever eaten!!! The only thing I can complain about is we don't have a Bobby Q's over here where I live in Diamond bar, California.
P.S. 
My wife says, she thinks there should be a Barbie Q in California, we will have to make Phoenix a regular trip until then though.",2,1,1

The food, ambience, and everything was great, but what really set this place over the top for me was our server, Anthony.

So if the staff over at Bobby Q's ever reads this, I just want to let them know how impressed I was with Anthony's service(enough to toss him a $10 tip on a $20 check, it'd be more but a starving student can only give so much haha). He was not only attentive and helpful but was very friendly throughout the night. Coming by at the most opportune times to offer us water refills, extra sauce(warmed sauce, fancy!), and even suggested different items on the menu that he thought we'd like better(which we did!) Such a great guy and really made a huge difference in our dining experience.  So if you ever get the chance to stop by Bobby Q's, ask for Anthony and toss him a huge tip as a thank you after you have one of the greatest dining experiences of your life!  Haha.

All that aside, the food at Bobby Q's was great as well. We got the three meat combo with Beef Ribs(great), Baby back ribs(my personal favorite), and beef brisket(a tad bit dry, but still good) with Mac and cheese(amazing!) and shoestring fries(also good) as the sides. Everything was great, and the fact that we didn't have to wait an hour like at other BBQ places was another huge plus as well. The food came quick, was piping hot, and they even split it onto two plates for us because I was splitting the food.

At the end of the dinner, they gave us some cinnamon donuts to-go with our meal, which was the real cherry on top of everything. Loved this place, will definitely be bringing friends here for BBQ nights, and I could go on for days about the great service from Anthony.",3,1,1

It was so good I ate two of them straight out of the fridge the next morning for breakfast. The side dishes are awesome, especially the mac and cheese and roasted corn.

This place is jam packed on a Friday and Saturday night, but I will say their service is pretty responsive and fast to get the food out. I only got salad so I'm not going to get into the food part since it will be biased. However, the night got turned upside down when I initially got my check and saw they charged me 15 dollars for a 12 dollar salad! Side note, this place is way pricier than I expected a BBQ place would be. Anyways, I told the gentleman about the salad upcharge and he seemed like he didn't believe I was overcharged and he was like "" let's look through the menu together."" Hello I'm not a little kid, you don't need to be condescending. Anyways, he saw that I was correct on the price and he changed it, blaming their system for generating that amount. I wonder how many people got overcharged for that salad without anyone saying something?? I still wonder if they even updated their system... anyways, not a huge issue until I got overcharged at the club\/bar portion AGAIN ON THE SAME NIGHT!! This is when my nostrils began to blow smoke out of them... we went into the club which basically to get in you have to sign your name on a paper, get your picture taken, your photo id is scanned, and donate an arm and a leg(jk about that part), never seen that in my life, so strict for such a run down club... then we go to the pay section and find out it's 12 dollar coverage fee!! For a ghetto club, are you kidding me... I give them my card, and they act all quiet and don't tell me anything, all of a sudden they don't give my card back the guy escorts me downstairs without informing me what was going on... I was low key thinking I was going to be an interrogation room not knowing what I possibly could have done wrong. He still has my card in his hand and gives it to the bartender and then leaves still saying nothing to me. Worst security escorter ever! Then I get my card back from the bartender and I ask what is going on and he tells me that they don't take card at the front so I had to go down to the bar to pay the cover... I then look at my check and find out I was charged 30 dollars (15 each) for the cover when I'm told it was 12 each at the front!! The bartender apologizes and says he will get us a drink on the house... FYI the drink was the worst crap I've ever had in my life... at this point I wanted out and talked to security about my experience.. he says that I probably won't get a refund but I can go talk to the general manager. Literally the general manager finds out we want a refund(after only being there for 5 minutes) and he doesn't even bat an eye before saying of course, give these girls a refund. I want to thank him for being an intelligent person, but I hate to say that his staff are complete dim wits who should find a new job or receive better training on how to treat people.",0,0,0

I was surprised about the overwhelming amount of positive reviews, so I had to check it out for myself. I'm not from the South but I know when great food is great, and this place is good, but not great. The St. Louis ribs are better than the baby backs, which are a little too sweet. The mac and cheese was nothing to write home about -- it almost tasted from the box, but not as orange in color. Two friends who had the beef brisket said it was OK but too mushy. I got the peach cobbler, which was mediocre (and seemed like it had been microwaved hot). It's a far way to go for OK bbq, in my opinion. 

Most of us at the meal thought this place was fairly expensive as BBQ joints go. It was $17 for a two-meat sampler, and apps were about $7-8.",2,1,1

Everything started out great.  Our server was on top of it.  Her name is Shay, and girl, you are just a SuperServer.  She is five stars.  She is excellence in itself.

The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty good, casual yet upscale bbq joint.  They nailed that.

One thing to note is that all the meats are smoked for over 20 hours.  Sounds good!  We own a smoker, and the longest we had smoked anything was 8 hours.

For the appetizer, we ordered the Q rolls;  Tortilla wrapped brisket deep fried and served with chipotle sauce.  YUMMY!  Delicous!  If I come back, I will order these again.  The cornbread everyone raved about was alright..

For the main entree we split the 3  meat combo;  the pork, brisket, and sausage.  For the sides we had mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese.  Sure glad we shared.  It was alot of food.

This  is where it falls for me.  Maybe I went on an off day; but the meats were disappointing, especially after hearing they have been smoked for 20 hours. It was not flavorful or delectable or anything, just meat that was edible.  Even drowning it in bbq sauce didn't make it anymore appetizing for me. The mashed potatoes were very very BLAND.  I salt and peppered them to death trying to flavor them a bit.  The mac and cheese was very creamy, and was decent, but...I make tastier mac at home, thought not as creamy.  Its sad for me to convey this; I really was not satisfied with my meal.

Now the doughnuts they provided at the end of the meal was fresh and good.

Because it is not really obvious from the street, we overshot Bobby Q and had to do a turnaround in quite a sketchy strip mall a couple of blocks up. Half expecting a total dive we were pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant itself nicely appointed.

Before we even ordered our food a tasty basket of cornbread was brought to the table. We ordered a sampler plate containing 3 different meats - pulled pork, brisket and St. Louis ribs as well as a BBQ chicken sandwich. We couldn't decide on which sides to select but when our server brought us a sample of the mac & cheese to try our minds got made up in a hurry.

On the sampler plate the St. Louis ribs were terrific, the pulled pork was not too bad but the brisket was kind of dry. Fortunately the server had brought large containers of 2 types of BBQ sauce to our table so we were able to moisten the brisket with the sauce. The chicken on the sandwich was moist but I found the sauce a little too mild and sweet.

The service we received was friendly and attentive and the little doughnuts in the to-go bag was a nice touch.  Overall, worth a repeat visit if we are in the area. 3.5 stars.",2,2,2

My first visit, I went with a tried-and-true classic, and something most people could probably agree is a barbecue bellwether: pork ribs.

Along with the ribs, I had their slightly disappointing lemonade (their beverage selection is quite weak for a barbecue place) and the beans on the side.  The beans were at an acceptable level of quality for a good barbecue place.  The ribs, however, shined.  Melt-in-your-mouth tender, these ribs were smoky and tasty, and the meat just falls off the bone.  You don't even need to pick these up; you can use your fork if you wish.

Of course, I couldn't issue a verdict on a place like this after just one visit.  I went back, and this time for the smokehouse burger cooked medium rare, with shoestring fries.  I don't usually order burgers at barbecue places, but I heard good things about this burger.  And boy, did it live up to expectations.  I am not usually a fan of barbecue sauce on my burgers, but this one really worked.  Part of it was the crispy onion straws, and part of it was the fact that the cook was very close to the mark on the meat temperature.

The meat wasn't particularly lean, so it is a burger you can probably order medium and still have plenty of moisture left.

The fries were also tasty, and were a perfect complement for this burger.

Now, one thing I am not a fan of is the ambiance.  It doesn't seem to have that rustic feel that you usually expect from a barbecue joint; this place seems just a tad too upscale, if that makes sense.  But I cannot deny that they make some great food here.  One could make the case that, despite their horrible moniker, Bobby Q serves up the best barbecue in the Phoenix area.",2,1,1

Everything was excellent.  The St. Louis ribs were the best ribs I have ever had.  They were extremely tender and had a nice flavorful bark on the  outside with dark grill marks.  Their BBQ sauce was equally awesome and the kind I like -- a bit more on the sweeter side, less on the vinegary side.

We shared their brisket quesadilla off of the HH menu. It was very large and quite tasty. Brisket was very tender. They make their own guacamole which is served along side the quesadillla along with salsa and a bbq sour cream.

I had their Burger and it was 5+ stars!  It was a mouth fun fest from start to finish. The meat was smokey and very tasty.  Well done, but I was OK with that. The sides of Mac and Cheese were some of the best I've ever tasted and their seasoned fries were awesome!

My friend had their pulled pork sandwich and it was 2-3 star rating. It was bland tasting and needed lots of their BBQ sauce for flavor. Their coleslaw was also missing a flavor punch, so he added some hot sauce to help it out.  The donuts were ""meh"" a little too greasy and needed the tons of sugar.  Why make them if they are just ""meh"", your cornbread is much better!

This is not only THE best BBQ you can get in Arizona, but the service and ambiance are second to none. 

We shared the Whole Hog feast and had enough left over for a late night snack. The cornbread was the most amazing, moist, sweet corn cake I have tasted. Beef ribs?  Amazing, tender, juicy, beefy. Baby Backs? Fall off the bone and meaty, Pulled Pork? Juicy, smokey, melt in your mouth. Brisket? Full of sweet smoke and seasoning. I got an order of burnt ends to take home and the knocked my socks of with the seasoning and smoke - YUM!!!

The manager came by our table and chatted with us for a bit about our meal. She gave us a little history on how Booby Q's came to be. Later, our server came by and informed us we could pick any dessert we wanted - compliments of the manager. We picked the mud pie - again THE best I've ever had. At this point in the meal we were not surprised by the amazing-ness of the dessert. Wow! Hard to find service and attention to the customer like that anymore.

As a regular, I not only go there for the food, but because of the people.  I have known these servers and bartenders for years, right up until they get shopped and fired.  That's right folks, my meals are usually almost ALWAYS ruined by some idiot shopping a beloved server or bartender of mine and I have to sit there and listen to Joe Shmo ask moronic questions like (no joke) ""can my daughter have a beer?  She's sixteen....what's the legal age to consume alcohol?""  Now as a former secret shopper myself for a LARGE company, here's a few words of advice, train your shoppers, a want ad in the newspaper is ridiculous.  If you care THAT much about customer service, let your customers be your shoppers, because I can spot these idiots when they walk in, and most of them LOVE the idea of judging a young person and making them sweat for their job.  Shame on you.  Secondly as a loyal customer, the way I was treated by your shoddy excuse of management when having an allergic reaction to peanuts in your dessert was appalling.  Here's my assessment as a former shopper:

1.) When I asked the wait staff if the chocolate dessert had peanuts in it, they seemed sure it did not, but nobody could be sure because it wasn't printed on the menu.  Upon having two bites of the dessert my mouth immediately swelled up and I had an allergic reaction.  Ciara and Toni were very concerned and attentive, offering water and even a concoction to help me purge the food if needed.  They both kept a watchful eye on me while making sure to not neglect other patrons.
2.) I asked to speak to a manager to merely suggest for the second time (this happened before with their banana dessert) that as an establishment, they should protect themselves by listing peanut ingredients on the menu.  The manager replied that usually when someone has an allergy they tell the server and then the server tells the kitchen, thus making me the customer feel like it was a failure on my part to notify and announce my allergy to the entire restaurant upon my arrival.  Sitting there astounded, I asked if I was indeed hearing what I was hearing, and she glossed over it, thanked me for the feedback, said they were going to reprint their menus at some point, offered to call ""someone""I'm assuming an ambulance, and pat me on the back and left.  Really?

So here's the deal, the food is good, the servers and bartenders are the best.  Pretty much everyday they work in fear of losing their job, and I can't support that.  They remember what you drink, how you like your food prepared, your name, and that's not something you get in chain restaurants, but the regulars, the ones who you could count on to support the place, they've slowly disappeared, and I'm headed that way myself.  Unless you've been sitting at your spot, enjoying your meal only to have it RUINED by some jerk shopping your friend and one of many favorite bartenders or servers, you don't know what sick is.  Getting a job in today's economy is difficult enough, but these people treat the mostly 20 something employees like slave  workers who are fortunate to be breathing the bobby q air.  I can't fathom going in to work everyday wondering if it's my last.  Finally, when a regular has a concern like PUT PEANUTS ON YOUR MENU, it's not just for the patrons benefit, but your own, and you failed to see that, instead you shrugged me off and couldn't get out of my presence fast enough; I know when I'm being patronized, don't forget, I can shop you too, and you failed big time, as in you'd be fired.  Good customer service is what Pita Jungle did where they asked me for my phone number or email address to discuss further (turned out to be pine nuts that were most likely cross contaminated).

So in conclusion, when you look around and wonder where all the regular money was that you could always count on coming in every dY at the same time, it's probably at the Black Angus, one of your former regulars is now a regular there, people can go there and grab some food and a drink or two without witnessing the torture you inflict on you're employees.  Shame on you.",7,1,2

We got here very late, so they were about to close the kitchen. However, the lounge\/club was about to open. They told us that it would be loud, once the club opened up. We didn't mind it and decided to stay.

I went over on a Friday afternoon and sat at the bar. They had the lunch menu and their dinner menu and I noticed the lunch brisket was only around three dollars less expensive then the brisket platter. The bartender said that the dinner platter was a better value so that's what I went with. I opted for the fries and the coleslaw as the two sides. I have to say the brisket was amazing. Not only was it very tender but it was not at all dried out like so many other places that I have tried. Even people from Texas would be impressed.  My only minor complaint was the fries could have been crispier. I also have to say that I really like their ice tea as well. 

There are so many interesting options on the menu I deafly will be coming back to this place to try them out.  

I haven't been to Bobby Q's for a few years. The last time was meeting up with friends from work for a going away party. They had a special room in the back for us. The appetizers we had were very good.

This place has really nice atmosphere. It would be a great place to bring somebody for that first date. Service is also very good. When I was finished the bartender gave me a fresh iced tea to go. That was greatly appreciated on a hot day. 

Their busiest day of the year was Father's Day. I was there at about 2:30 pm and the wait was between an hour and a half and hour and 45 minutes long so I didn't stay but I knew I would have to come back soon. And I'm glad I did.",10,7,7

For our sides, we got the mac & cheese and the ranch style beans. The beans were good and the ribs were just ok. The mac & cheese was definitely not up to par. The brisket had so much fat on it, it wasn't even edible and I had to drown the pulled pork in bbq sauce to eat it.

Minutes after we were given our food, they asked if we wanted boxes, and then came back a few minutes later and did the same thing. Not good service. Also - I was excited about the free mini donuts they give you to go. But - they're so bad, they're not even worth eating.

The food tasted every bit like they did. I could really taste the smoke flavor with the sausage which they filleted open to soak up the flavor. I can tell you that it tastes like they use pecan and mesquite wood for smoking.

The sampler included ribs, bbq chicken and beef brisket.  Each were perfectly cooked, seasoned and super tender.  Of course I would recommend getting a little extra bbq sauce on the side, my preference was the hot which I loved!

They finish the meal off with a bag-o-donuts.. basically sugared doughballs.  Nonetheless they were very tasty and a nice, different take on a dessert for a bbq meal.

It was also nice that the bartender didn't scoff when I asked him to switch the tvs to ESPN (who wants to watch the news in the bar anyways?).  Not only that, but he put it up on all the tvs and raised the volume.  I had a really great lunch there and will be returning soon.",2,0,1

We also got the fish fry special.  The fish I have to say was done pretty well.  It was a crispy batter so it wasn't overly soggy with oil.  The fish (cod) was pretty fresh tasting.
This time the cornbread wasn't as soft which I liked better.
Tried their banana pudding dessert.  It was different than what I was expecting.  The pudding was a lot thicker than I would have liked but still tasty.  The crust though was yummy.  It was a walnut-like crumble.  Very similar tasting to the inside of baklava.

I've eaten BBQ all over the country, and I can't say Bobby Q is ""as good as it gets"", but they are pretty darn good.  Almost 3 weeks ago Mr. M and I met up with Tim S. and his family to give this place a try.  

Right away I was impressed with the friendly service, and the hostess was helpful when we needed to add a high chair to the table.  Our server was Kanisha and she did a great job and was on point with taking our orders, making sure our drinks weren't empty, and bringing us togo boxes and the check when we were ready.  

We wanted to be able to try a wide variety of items so we started with the Q-rolls ($10.50), which are absolutely delicious.  Brisket wrapped up like an egg roll?  Heck yeah!  Those disappeared quickly.  We also started with their house beer, which if memory serves is an amber ale and that was a nice, easy to drink beer.  Really enjoyed that as well.  The smaller one is $4.95 and the larger one is $6.00, so the moral of that story is, go for the big one!

I ordered the BBQ chicken\/prime rib combo ($34) which came with 3 sides.  I chose the loaded baked potato, mac & cheese, and the ranch beans.  Mr. M ordered the 3 meat combo ($25) with pulled pork, brisket, and some ribs.  

I thought I would waddle out of the joint stuffed to the gills, but we actually had so much fun talking that I didn't eat nearly as much as I thought I would.  Here's what I thought of the food:  Prime rib, chicken, and ribs:  Excellent!  Brisket: very good.  Pulled pork and ranch beans: really nothing going on there.  Very little flavor in the pork, and the beans tasted syrupy and had no BBQ flavor.  The other sides we had were very good.  I could OD on the mac & cheese.  Nicely done.

The I-10 shooter couldn't even stop me from getting to my barbecue beef ribs and buying chef Mark H. a drink.  I was greeted by a lovely hostess and waitress named Jessica.  I got seated at a large booth, ordered a drink, and my beef ribs.  The drink and food appeared quickly.  The Bobby Q experience is simply the best.  The whole staff is just plain awesome.  Various people came by to bus plates, ask how I was doing, and see if there was anything they could help me with.  It was a great meal with some serious cornbread and mini-doughnut dessert.

I started with the Cajun Shrimp appetizer and the flavor was spot on.  The shrimp were juicy and delicious and it comes with like garlic bread sticks to sop up the wonderful juices in the bowl.

The inside is very nice with dark lighting for a nice setting. We were there today about 2 o clock so it wasnt too busy but I can vet this place gets packed! They do have a bar and they had a nice fire oven that you could see chickens being roasted through the glass. 

We tried the Q rolls for an appetizer and they were very good with the chipotle ranch dipping sauce. For an entree my wife tried the pulled pork sandwich and I had the sampler with chicken, brisket and ribs. Both dishes came with a side. We tried the mashed potatoes and gravy and the mac n cheese.

As we walked up I was a little surprised at how dressed many of the people were.  They looked like they were going out clubbing.  Turns out, there is a night club\/bar attached to the restaurant.  Seems many of the club goers had dinner then moved on to the club.  The club in no way ruins the dinner experience and you can never hear the music or even know the club is there.  The food was very good and the service was excellent.  We were a party of 9 and we were assigned 2 waiters.

If you are Gluten Free all of their sauces are GF and they have a GF menu.  Only bummer is that they don't have a GF version of their cornbread.  The meats are tasty, tender and juicy.  The sides are all generous portions and good.  All 9 people got different items and no one was disappointed.  For the non-meat eaters there was a good selection of seafood.

It was well seasoned, they used incredibly soft, super fresh, potato rolls for the buns, and the order came out hot. The french fries were crisp and well seasoned. 

The pulled pork that my wife had was good as well, however it was a little on the dry side, and probably could have used some more barbeque sauce. The macaroni and cheese was really good, and some of the creamiest I've ever had. As a starter, they also bring out cornbread which is hot, fresh and soft. It was quite excellent.

Bobby Q's was on our way back from our weekend trip up north and it was around lunchtime so we figured we'd get something from there to go so we could eat it back at home. The menu was easy to browse through online. I called and placed an order for the three meat combo which would be ready in 15 minutes.

There are two areas in this restaurant. The front is for dining in while there is a separate back parking lot and take out entrance. Service at the counter was friendly and they even offered me a drink while my order was being put together. 

The smell of BBQ in the car was mouth watering as we drove back home. I ordered the combo with baby back ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. For sides I had the roasted corn and coleslaw. The meal also included 2 pieces of cornbread and they gave me some extra BBQ sauce.

All the meats were very tender with smoky flavor. My favorite of the three was probably the pulled pork, followed by the baby back ribs. The brisket was good and they included fatty and lean pieces, but the memory of the superb brisket from Little Miss BBQ still lingers in my memory as one of the best I've had.

The sides were excellent. The roasted corn also had some smoked flavor and the coleslaw was crisp, tangy and refreshing.

Overall it was a good meal and I do like how they have more convenient hours and better atmosphere than Little Miss BBQ. I will be back for more BBQ!",18,11,20

We came here on a sat so it was ridiculously packed! We couldn't find a single parking so we had to park somewhere else and walk. The hostess told us the wait would be 30 mins but it was less than that. 

We were seated and our waiter was super friendly. We already looked over the menu when we were waiting so we ordered pull pork sandwich with mash potatoes and my friend ordered two combination: brisket and baby back ribs with Mac and cheese and shoe string fries. For dessert, we went with the sub zero banana. The food came out super fast! The portion sizes were huge too! We shared our plates and omg it was so delicious and flavorful! The meats just fell apart and was cooked to perfection! The mash potatoes went well with my pulled pork sandwich and it was creamy! Mac and cheese was very creamy too and so good. The shoestring fries was just normal fries. We thought it would have some kind of seasoning on it like garlic or something. Now for the dessert. I thought they should've put more bananas on it because it really brought out the flavors. The crust tasted like an oatmeal cookie. Overall, the dessert was just okay and nothing to get excited over. I def want to try their mudslide next time! But It got 5 stars because our server was fantastic and the food was delicious!

-The Service
My first time at Bobby Q, the Server greeted us (My Girlfriend and I) with an awesome attitude. She explained that their signature ribs are smoked for 22 hours, and a brief history about the company. There's usually a Manager circling around to make sure everyone is satisfied.

-The Food
My Girlfriend and I always order the 2 Rib Combo, I get the St. Louis Style, She gets the Baby Back. Believe me when I say, the meat literally and I mean literally falls off the bone with no effort at all! The sauce tastes amazing and they're not stingy with it. One of the highlights is the cornbread. Now, if you know me at all, I used to hate cornbread. But Bobby Q has changed my mind. The cornbread is very tasty and you can actually taste the real corn.

-Atmosphere
Kinda gives you a feel of an indoor picnic. They have unique seating. I personally like seating in the booths facing the TVs at the Bar. They usually have sports games on (NFL, MLB, NBA etc...) I believe at a certain time, it changes into a Night Club, which I have yet to try. I haven't tried their drinks yet, but I'm looking forward to it.

I would recommend Bobby Q to anyone I know. No matter how busy they are, they make sure their customers are happy. And they do get pretty busy.

Young lady mgr asked about our experience, but her cool brusque manner said she wasn't really interested.
For the two of us, a hefty $68 lunch, granted it was a lot of food and was very good!
Just loved the complimentary cinnamon twists which is why we came in there in the first place!  Will pickup a couple of dozen for next breakfast potluck.",0,0,0

Building is very cool, like an entrance queue to a ride at Knotts Berry Farm. Dig it. 

For a Wednesday night, this place is super busy, which is a good sign. Even better when I can get a table immediately because I don't care where I sit! 

Being a KC native, I'm very skeptical of BBQ west of the Rockies. I haven't had anything to knock my socks of anywhere in the Southwest. The menu here is huge, which is also a drastic departure from any BBQ place I've ever been to. Prices are definitely on the higher side, too. 

Ordered Q-Rolls to start, based on our server's recommendation, which were actually very good. Brisket wrapped in puff pastry, I could easily eat a manhole sized plate of these things. Awesome. I had the brisket platter. Brisket was good, definitely delivers, but not in my top 10 brisket adventures. With the excellent ranch beans and so-so mac and cheese, it was solid, but not worth $20, as portions are on the smaller side. Others at my table said the same about their ribs and chicken, too. 

Spicy sauce was served in a stainless pitcher, and was very forgettable. Good BBQ sauce is tough to find anywhere (especially since most, even Gates as of late, are just HFCS infused sugar shit these days), but Bobby's sauce was neither spicy or tasty. 

Beer is served in actual pint glasses (which I haven't seen in years), not the 12 oz. ""pint"" glasses we've all become accustomed to. Nice touch. 

Service was OK. Food came out reasonably quick. Manager checked in with us 2-3 times, which seemed a bit odd, but nice to see that leadership is engaged at this place. Or maybe our server was in the doghouse, unclear!

We basically decided that, while we dug the building, the service was decent and the food was OK, there really isn't any reason to come back since the value isn't there.",0,0,0

Tried two sauces - regular and spicy, which came to us in two small carafes for pouring. Sides included corn bread, roasted corn and ranch beans.

This was my first time here but according to my bf this place is pretty good and he talked about it so many times that I thought I actually been here before. Well I finally got to try it.

I ordered the Platter since I really wanted to try more than just one type of meat if this is the only time I get to try it - so with the platter you get to select three types of meat plus one side. I ordered the beef brisket, bbq chicken (I requested the leg and thigh since I'm not a big fan of the breast) and sausage with the pecan cole slaw as the side. It also comes with corn bread. 

They served us all the corn bread in a basket first and it was the softest corn bread I've ever had but it had a soft buttery taste - kind of just melted in your mouth - I really liked it. When my platter came I was somewhat disappointed because they gave me ribs instead of the sausage - but it was alright because I ended up really liking the ribs. It wasn't a lot of meat but the flavor was good. What I really really liked was the beef brisket. It was the softest beef brisket I have ever had. It was amazing because it was so easy to chew and the flavor was also very good. The BBQ chicken was okay - I liked it just because I could request for dark meat pieces but it didn't really have that strong of a BBQ taste. The coleslaw on the other hand was my least favorite. It wasn't very tasty and it lacked dressing too. 

The services was pretty good - our waitress was friendly. The place itself was surprising dim - for a BBQ place and one thing I notice was usually when you step into a BBQ restaurant you would get hit in the face with a smokey bbq-y kind of smell however not here. When I stepped into the dining area - I didn't really smell any of that meaty bbq aroma - and not only that but my clothes didn't even absorb the smell of the restaurant. This isn't a good or bad thing - just an observation. 

Overall I really enjoyed my lunch - for 13.99 the platter was fairly priced since everything on the menu (from sandwiches to salads to platters) was ranged around 10-14 dollars a plate.",0,0,1

Better then Waldo's, in my opinion. This used to be Bobby McGee's in the 90's and they would have live band and dancing there. I went there with my wife, mother-in-law and daughter. We didn't make reservations because we didn't know you had to until we had called them that day. At the time, they weren't taking anymore reservations until after 8pm and that was too late for us. It was only 3:30p at the time. The woman on the phone said the wait time was about 45mins, so we went anyways. We got there around 4:00pm and put our names on the list. They said they would call us when the table was ready. I kind of missed the little pagers we usually get at Cheesecake Factory and other restaurants, but personal service is still nice too. So I waited 30mins, checked the list and there were still 2 groups ahead of us. Check again at 45mins and still one group ahead of us. The hostess apologized and explained that customer with reservations would get seated first, which made sense, but I was getting hungry. Finally 55mins in we got seated (near the kitchen door) and was able to order drinks immediately as we looked over the menu. They had some specials, so I got the Prime Rib\/Lobster Tail with 2 sides for $30. I got the Mac & Cheese and Corn I believe. I can't remember what everyone else got, but I know they loved the food. They brought out warm corn bread, which was moist, sweet and great with butter. My wife and mother-in-law loved their alcoholic drinks. I got lemonade which was excellent as well. The meals came after about 15mins. The prime rib simply melted in your mouth. It was delicious. The Mac & Cheese was perfect. Nice and creamy and cheesy, just like how I make it. My wife tried mine and loved it. I tried her bake beans and even those were incredible. The corn was also good, Even the coleslaw that I tasted was very tasty. The lobster, we juicy and I doused it in the butter for another bite. It was cooked perfectly. I tried my wife's Baby Back Rib and they were smokey, moist and incredible with the BBQ sauce. I couldn't believe how good everything was. The waitress came back and forth to our table at least 6-7 times during the meal to see if there was anything else we needed. Very friendly and courteous. My daughter, who's only 2.5yrs loved everything, especially the mac & cheese since she loves cheese. Definitely one of the best BBQ meals I've ever ate. I will probably get the Brisket or Baby-Back Rib the next time I go. If you have BBQ and Steak, this is the place to go. It was definitely worth the wait and the kitchen door didn't even bother me because I was enjoying the food. I forgot a couple things. i forgot to mention the appetizers. They give you a lot for the appetizers. We got the BBQ wings and Artichoke\/Spinach dip and it was fabulous. some places will give you 5-6 wings for appetizer, but we got like twice that amount and it was delicious.

The service was great.  Very attentive and efficient.  She was right on with the drink refills and did everything with a smile.

My brother had the pulled pork sandwich and managed to finish it, but just barely.  His girlfriend did the same.  I decided to try the sample platter consisting of sausage, ribs, and chicken.  I was not sorry.  The sausage was very tasty but wasn't overpowering.  The chicken was done with plenty of flavor and not at all dry.  The ribs were great as well.

This place came up at the top of the search with over 500 reviews, you know we had to see what all the fuss was about. Coming down 27th street we thought Google Maps was getting us lost. There was no way a bomb BBQ joint was next to all these apartments. Well once we passed the last apartment building on the right, we saw Bobby's. The building was not impressive from the parking lot, not to mention we were parked behind the restaurant. I thought rusty shack = good food. I was glad I stuck with my instinct. 
We turned the corner and could instantly smell the smoker putting in work on slabs of ribs and brisket. Inside the decor was modern and clean. After seating we were greeted quickly and with a smile. I could hardly listen to what she saying because my eyes were fixated on the 40 chickens rolling in the rotisserie oven. We ordered the Hog Heaven plate for three of us, while my son had the smokehouse burger. Let me just say this is plenty of food for a family of 4. Four choices of meats with three sides. I highly recommend the baby back ribs as one of the meats. If you have no teeth, you can still chew these. My mouth had an orgasm when I bit into them. They were so tender, there was no knife needed to separate them. The brisket, St. Louis ribs, and chicken rounded out the plate. Mac and cheese side dish is a must! So creamy and the cheese was outstanding. You can tell that time was taken to prepare our meal that came out quickly. The cornbread was oven hot and was perfectly cooked with a hint of crunchiness on the edges. I had the Bobby Q Ale for my drink and it was a solid choice. It was very bold and complimented the BBQ sauce that was all over my fingers. Visit this place in the near future, hopefully your experience is as good as mine.

Me and my friend put candy canes on peoples cars in the parking lot to spread cheer. Dressed in a santa hat and candy cane headband we walked into the bar and ordered one drink. After ONE drink the bartender told us he wouldn't serve us anymore. Mind you ONE and he took my friends second away. We weren't acting weird or anything!! We were talking to people around us handing out candy canes. We took the receipt to the manager and asked her why the bartender felt like he  didnt want to serve us.

One of the listings that came up was Bobby Q. Based on the name and description as a BBQ restaurant, we were a bit unsure, but decided to trust the fantastic reviews. 
The service- Our server Amberlee (please forgive if misspelled) was pleasant, knowledgable about the menu items, and sooo attentive. Our iced teas never got lower than half full and she was always near if we needed anything. One of the managers even came to the table after we got our meal to ask how everything was. On a scale of 1-10 for service, I'd definitely give a 10. 

The food- In one word, WONDERFUL. Amberlee brought out corn muffins right after she took our order, which were not only moist but super tasty. When our prime rib arrived, mine was the 10oz end cut and his was the 14oz medium rare, we were astonished by the portions which were MASSIVE. The meal came with two choices of sides- mine were the loaded(bacon, cheese, sour cream, butter and chives) and roasted corn(corn on the cob roasted on the grill, then the kernels are shaved off and sautéed in butter) while my boyfriend had the mashed potatoes with the white gravy on the side as well as the roasted corn. Everything was perfect- the prime rib was seasoned just right with creamy horseradish and au jus and the sides complimented the meat perfectly. 
Once the plates had been cleared, Amberlee returned with a bag of complimentary doughnuts to go. We were so stuffed, but truly appreciated the gesture. The check was approximately $55 for both meals and two iced teas which wasn't bad for what we got. Not only great food, but fantastic service. We are planning on returning and telling all our friends how wonderful Bobby Q is!",3,0,0

We also got corn and macaroni and cheese as sides.  I wouldn't recommend the corn - its very buttery and overcooked.  Mac and cheese was better, but mostly because its nice against the salty meats.

We also started with the Q-rolls(?) which was beef rolled in pastry material.  The sauce it comes with made it quite tasty as well.

I also realize it was a 'lunch portion' - but for the prices I wanted more bang for the buck.  The only side I tried was the mac n' cheese, and have nothing bad to say about that either.

My wife and I have been here several times. We love the food and the atmosphere. The service has always been great too. 

I wish things could have gone differently tonight, but the way everything was handled was truly professional.

We ordered our food and the bus person was clearing out our table. Well, he accidentally dropped the plates and sauce basically exploded everywhere under the table. My legs were drenched in sauce and my sister's new pair of shoes were stained. My sister had to run to the bathroom to see if they were ruined.

The bus person was very apologetic and so was our server about the incident.

The restaurant manager came up to us after my sister returned and she was also very apologetic. She offered to replace the shoes, she comped my sister's dinner and even threw in free desert. She even got my sister's food replaced because she was waiting in the restroom trying to clean up while her food was getting cold.

Bobby's claims it was voted the Best BBQ in the US, although I'm not sure of their source? Nevertheless, I'd have a hard time arguing, as it definitely sets the bar extremely high. We've been here several times and have never had a bad meal. In fact, virtually everything we've tried on the menu seems to be done correctly. 

The pulled pork, which is my preferred way to eat BBQ, always manages to impress me with its flavor. For sides, I've had the mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese, which is far superior to that low-grade sludge they try to get away with dishing out at all of these other places in Phoenix. Even their fries are better than you'd expect.

The place is decorated to the point where, if I didn't know any better, I would have wrongfully assumed it was a chain restaurant. But yet, I like that, despite their popularity, they haven't decided to branch out and open up 20 different locations all over the city (and I actually hope they never do for quality and consistency purposes).

I've always wondered if their steaks are equally as good as their BBQ, but I've never wanted to sacrifice the taste of a great pulled pork sandwich in order to find out. And we're always so full after our meals that we've never been able to try some of their desserts. Based on their Yelp pictures, it seems like many people are in the same boat.

But, like all business owners should know, it's the little things that go a long way. The complimentary cornbread you receive before your meal is both unique, yet extremely well done. Oh, and that's not all. On your way out, you also get treated to a little bag of their homemade donuts, which you can often spot being made whenever you first walk in. I've said many times that it's little touches like that keep customers coming back - and it most definitely works. It's not rocket science and I'm amazed that other restaurants have failed to adopt this well-received approach.

Easily the best BBQ experience in all of Phoenix and a great all-around business!",14,2,14

Of course the french fries were tasty and mashed potatoes tasted like butter which is always a winner in my book.

I think it was because I moved from Florida, where BBQ is delicious and cheap, and I was reluctant to ""splurge"" on pulled pork at a place like this.  

The ambiance is fantastic, you feel great walking in.  The last star was left off for service, which I wasn't a huge fan of.  We were attended to just fine, but I wasn't a fan of our waiter's demeanor.  He didn't seem to know the menu well, which is a shame because it isn't huge.  I kind of felt like he was reading a script, emphasizing the whole ""smoked for 18 hours"" thing, which rubbed me the wrong way.

But aside from the waiter not being invited to my Christmas party, the place was great.  The food was really delicious, and well worth the money.  I believe that with an appetizer, any 2 people could easily share any entree.  

I do have to say this - if you go, do NOT skip out on the banana dessert.  OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I am a freak for banana pudding, but this treat is on a whole new level.  It was thick and custardy, cold and delicious.  The best part was the crust, which was almost granola-esque.  I've never had anything like it, and doubt I ever will... until I go back to Bobby Q for some more!",1,1,1

We also found a hair in our mashed potatoes. However, the service is excellent and all the waiters are very amiable. In addition to the feast, they treated us with fresh donuts that were delicious.

It was our first time here, but we wanted to try a new place and after seeing the reviews (and how many reviews) we had to try it. We were both beyond impressed. There wasn't a wait since it was a Monday night, but I could see it being packed on a weekend. 

We ordered the Q Rolls appetizer and each got a cocktail. My boyfriend said his tasted a little weak but overall they were both very tasty and mine was not weak. I had the Peach Tea and I can't recall what his was. The Q Rolls appetizer was absolutely amazing. I can't recommend that enough.

For the entree, we decided to go with Whole Hog Heaven because we had no idea how huge it was. We got baby back ribs, beef ribs, rotisserie chicken, beef brisket, mashed potatoes, mac n' cheese, and shoestring fries. 

Right after we ordered, two pieces of cornbread came out with a side of butter. This was SO delicious. Shortly after, our meal came out. Let me say again how HUGE this was. I tried to pick up a piece of brisket with a fork and it was so tender I couldn't pick up the whole piece at once. I specifically wanted the baby back ribs originally as they're my favorite and they were easily the best I've ever had. Meaty and tender with an amazing taste. I suggest asking for some extra BBQ sauce for the table but the meats are delicious with or without it. 

There was so much extra that we both have enough for lunch and probably even dinner tonight. I'll be eating lunch soon and can't wait! 

They brought out a piece of ice cream cake for my birthday (vanilla ice cream with chocolate cake and a walnut fudge icing). Delicious but I was too stuffed to eat more than a few bites of it. 

After we paid, they brought us a little bag of these mini cinnamon sugar donuts which I tried this morning with breakfast. Very tasty especially considering they were next-day donuts. 

The service was great throughout the whole meal. Unfortunately I forgot the server's name but she was quick and attentive. Needless to say, we were very pleased and can't wait to go back.",0,0,0

First you get the cornbread, which is my favorite so I started off happy. I had a salad, but two people got BBQ. I know - who gets a salad the first time they go to a BBQ restaurant? That makes no sense. They liked the meats and I think my husband said ""meh."" about the sauce. The baby had mac and cheese which he loved (and I liked) and the chicken was also a winner. 

I have to say - donuts at the end of the meal? Um, no. Ugh, no.They tasted pretty heavy with oil and sure enough after about 2 minutes I had the worst stomach pain of my life. Just say no to the donuts, I beg you. Unless you plan ahead and  know you are going to have a donut and you save some room, otherwise they will put you over the edge, and I am saying that after having a salad!

There was a nice size bar area and people seemed to be having a good time watching the game on the two large flatscreen televisions.  The regular dining area was a large room with several smaller areas off of the large area.  There was a mixture of square, rectangular and round wooden tables and chairs.  While we were there I saw the staff moving some tables together to create dining for a large group of people.  The lighting was low, more like a bar setting, but adequate.  We had reservations, via Open Table & the Yelp app, and were seated immediately.  

Our server was friendly and attentive.  We ordered two Strawberry Q'ladas, a strawberry flavored Pina Colada, off the speciality drink menu.  We got our drinks then he took our order and food was at our table about 15 minutes later.  The drinks were very good, but we both wished they packed more booze.  The cornbread was brought to our table after our drinks but before our meal.  Both grandkids had to have some right away.  Both gobbled down their pieces and probably would have asked for more if they could have gotten away with it.  

The Baby Back Ribs were outstanding; falling off the bone the way they are supposed to be but hard to get just anywhere these days.  I also had the Pecan Cole Slaw and fortunately for me, the pecans were sprinkled on top so I could scoop them off and eat the rest of the really good slaw.  The Ranch Beans were pretty unusual.  I have not tasted anything quite like them.  My wife said they had cinnamon in them but there were a bit too spicy for me so I shoved them off on my grandson, the ""fire eating kid.""  But I enjoyed what I had already eaten.  The cornbread was good but I really liked the super thin french fries I kept stealing off my granddaughter's kid burger meal plate.

My wife had the 8 oz Sirloin Steak and Baked Potato.  She asked that the steak be medium well and it was.  It appeared to be larger than 8 oz.  The potato wasn't as good as the steak; it could have been a little hotter.  It also came with a few thin onion straws that were a nice little surprise.  Before we left, we were surprised with some warm little donuts to take with us.  They were rolled in cinnamon and sugar and were just the right end to a delicious meal.

I asked the server if there was any chance the owners would open a location in Tucson because we would definitely be regulars.  But sadly, according to our server, both the owner and his kids are retirement age and the likelihood of a Tucson location appears to be extremely slim.",2,0,0

I was so impressed at how wonderful everything tasted and how great the service was. 
Manager even came over to each of the tables and interacted with us, offering us refills and confirming the food was to our standards! 

I noticed the table next to us, had an uneven table which wobbled a little, and the staff switched it our immediately and made sure they were comfortable.

Our waitress was good and quick, though she didn't come back for a loooong time at the end and we all were ready to just go. But they were busy, So I understand. 

My 3 star review is on the salad I got (I know right, who gets a salad at a BBQ place, this dummy does) I got the Avocado Club Salad with Brisket. For Avocado being the first descriptive word i was expecting a TON of avocado in this salad, I was soooo excited for all the avocado I would be consuming, unfortunately there were maybe 5 or 6 very very veryyy small pieces of avocado in the whole salad (trust me I searched that salad bowl over) not even a half of an avocado...so maybe just call t the Cobb salad and be done with it? The brisket was cold and salty. The ranch dressing was extremely watery.

The ribs took less then 15 minutes from order to table. The plate was impressive and the ribs were excellent.Other then size of the bone I couldn't tell them apart.  For me general rule for ribs is that if they are ""falling off the bone"" they are over cooked. That was the case here, but the ribs were so tasty I was able to overlook that. They have two choices of BBQ sauce, spicy and mild...they were both similar in flavor with the spicy having a little more kick.

I was very impressed and changed my review to a 4. 

Ill start off with the decor of the restaurant. I really liked it and felt welcomed. It felt like a more upscale BBQ joint. 

We first ordered the Q rolls. These were simply amazing! They are brisket wrapped in tortilla then deep fried and accompanied by BBQ sauce and a chipotle mayo. 

We also got homemade corn bread while we waited for our entrée
. 
We then had a 3 meat combo.  We choose pork, brisket, and sausage. When it came to the actual BBQ I thought it was good, but not blown away great. I thought the sausage was over smoked and I'm not a fan of chopped brisket. I like my brisket cut into long pieces. The pulled pork was solid but again nothing blew me away.  I liked the man n cheese but honestly thought the garlic mash pataoes were a lil tasteless though. I added a lot of pepper to give them some taste. 

Overall Bobby's was a great place to eat. The service was outstanding, our server was Shay. The Q rolls were amazing and the food was solid. I really liked the personal customer service after my wife's review. So the only thing keeping me from a 5 star rating is the actual BBQ.

They were so good we impulsively ordering a SECOND rack of ribs, only to realize that we were too full to continue soon thereafter.

The Q-Rolls stuffed were amazing as well, especially with the chipotle dip. Imagine a buttery pastry wrapped around smoked brisket, and you get the Q-Roll. If you had to get one appetizer, get this.

I visit Bobby Q on 7-19-2011 after reading the good reviews about this place, so I want to check it out myself since I'm from Texas.  I ordered a Whole Hog Heaven for me and my hubby with bottle of wine, and for my daughter I ordered the pull pork sandwich.  Alright people, the barbeque was ok and for the people who have dentures this is place for them.  The ribs, meat melt of the bone alright but it's too mushy.  I can't even pick up the bone because the mushy meats just melt in the tray.  Good bbq ribs, meat should attach to the bones when you break it and melted in your mouth when you eat it that's call good bbq people.  Their pull pork was good and their corn bread was delicious seriously, but the brisket was too dried and the meat is brownish like old meats.  After tasting the brisket I just stop eating my dinner.  Lucky I had a bottle of wine.  Good brisket supposed to be little char on the outside, pinkish inside, and juicy.  Barbeque sauce normally served on the side because the good briskets meats are juicy and tender; therefore, the sauce doesn't need to poor all over the brisket.  Our server was alright doesn't know much about wine though, but I can't complaints because I'm not at fine dining.  The ambience was ok, music ok, but menu little greasy and some bread crumbs in it that's not so ok to me.  The price is very cheap.  Quantity is beyond my expectation but need to work on quality of foods.  For three of us the bill comes to $86.37 including tips.  I hope this review help some of you, thank you!",0,0,0

Nice smoke flavor, but had a steam-table quality to the meats (like they had been sitting in a warmer for a while). No bark with the pork and no smoke ring on the brisket, which made me wonder if the meat was really smoked for 18 hours as advertised. However, the sausage had nice snap, good spice, and smoke, so at least that was legit...unfortunately, a real BBQ joint needs better brisket\/pork (did not try the ribs) to get a high rating.

The food was good. I really enjoyed the Q-Roll stuffed with brisket and served with their chipotle sauce. I sensed that the portions would be large, so my partner and I shared the 2 rib entry (St Louis & Baby-back). The rancho beans had their own distinctive flavor without the beans being over-cooked. The same could be said of the steamed veggies. Corn bread is served with every meal and presented in a nice round Pattie; and it taste liked corn BREAD as opposed to cake.

All 3 ribs tasted good (baby back, st-louis, beef). I would have hoped for more smoke and more of a rub (we ordered them dry with sauce on the side). Of the three, I think that the St-Louis were the best.

We also had brisket, pulled pork and chicken. All three of these need lots of smoke (in my view) to be a success and there just was not enough. The brisket was not sliced and had no barque. It was more of a ""pulled"" format in small pieces. It tasted a bit dry and lacked smoke.

Overall, it's OK but not great. I'm stuck between going with 2 or 3 stars on this because the sides weren't all that fantastic either (mac & cheese, fries, grilled veg, ranch beans). However, it is still decent BBQ if you stick to the right items (ribs).",3,2,0

After I went to Bobby Q's I actually looked at some the reviews from fellow yelpers and man I am sorry I missed out on the roasted corn, I am going to have to try that next time I go!  Our server's Melissa was a good, but she got tractable, like we made bets to see how long it would take before she came back to our table to check on us, it was about every 10 mins. Now don't get me wrong I love good service, but there is a difference between being pushy and good.

Like I have said before, Im a visual person and when I saw on the drink menu that yummy looking drink called Strawberry Qlada, I knew I had to get that, when it came to the table, it was just as beautiful in person, pinks, red, white, pineapple & cherry garish, it was a delish drink!

The round corn breads were a sweet surprise! I love me some cornbread! And with the whipped butter, what could be better, other than drowning them in hot bowl of chili! 

I ordered the 8oz center cut top sirloin with mac & cheese, ranch beans & mushrooms & onions for my steak!   I had asked Melissa if she liked the mac & cheese and she is it was the bestselling item on the menu, oh that's good, but that didn't answer my question lol but I wound up ordering them anyways, and they were good, but it wasn't great! Yes it's made with 5 different cheese, its creamy and it's like eating velveeta mac n cheese, not my fav but if that's your thing, then it's up your alley! The ranch beans were good, it was little peppery and sweet, which is a great combo for me!  The steak was the perfect amount for me! It was cooked to perfection, it was tender and tasty! The mushrooms and onions were sautéed just right, not too soft not to hard!

The food is incredible, especially their ribs, we did the HEAVENLY HOG which is supposed to be for 2 people but TRUST ME you need a third person to finish this off otherwise you will die driving back home due to the most incredible food coma of your life. The hog consists of 4 meats and 3 sides, the meats are plentiful and we got baby back ribs, st louis ribs, brisket, and sausage and sides were mac n cheese, string fries basically thin fries, and ranch beans which were basically pinto beans and some pulled pork inside (i didnt taste any ranch).

Baby back ribs were 5\/5 for sure, super tender and fall off the bone type, one of the best i've ever had. St louis ribs were also 5\/5 and slightly different flavor and has some of that cartilage but i dig that stuff so nom nom. The brisket was very lean and smoky on the sides, which some people like but I was eh about it, I think i just dont like brisket all that much in general unless its slightly fattier than usual so this one was just alright for me 3\/5. The sausage is really interesting in that its a bit dry, but they have this marinade prior to it at least it tastes like it did and has a really smoky flavor which i thought was interesting but overall just decent, 3.5\/5. The mac n cheese is some of the cheesiest\/creamiest mac n cheese you will ever have it was seriously some of the best ever in my opinion and I dont usually even like mac n cheese 5\/5. Beans were fairly standard with the pulled pork, good if you like pinto beans 4\/5. The string fries could be better in that it was fairly standard fries but slightly hard, not really but just if i had to nitpick 3\/5. Overall you get A TON of food for $48 and i highly recommend you have 3ppl eat it despite the menu saying 1 really person could consume this, highly unlikely unless you're a competitive eater. 

Complementary corn bread is given prior to the meal and IT IS THE BEST CORN BREAD EVER its so good that I forget why I used to hate corn bread. Oh right probably because just about everywhere else I've had it it was always dry and bland, but this place is the ultimate exception 5\/5. Also after you pay you get complementary donut dessert and I think they say they bake that in house and its a super light, fits in the palm, a small super sugared donut and its also delish 5\/5.

When visiting a new city, I try to eat things we don't have in Hawaii. Good BBQ is one of them so I'm no expert, but this place was so finger-licking-I'm-on-vacay-screw-my-diet good! Since we only had one shot to try everything, we tried the sampler:

WHOLE HOG HEAVEN $48
2 choices of ribs (we got baby back and St. Louis, I would get double baby back next time)
2 choices of meat (we got pulled pork and brisket, totally would get that again)
3 sides (we got roasted corn, beans, grilled veggies, but the shoestring fries were also very good)

KIDS MENU too! The kids had the chicken strips (which is like the breaded processed kind you get in the freezer), which they absolutely enjoyed because it is familiar to them. The key to a good kids menu is to offer things kids like (not mini versions of the adult food), and they do very well here. (We also ordered the appetizer chicken tenders, which is more like real chicken, real batter and they didn't like that as much.)

BBQ sauce- when asked if we wanted extra sauce, (regular or spicy?) I asked for both. I thought they'd bring little containers but hallelujah they thought of everything-we got little coffee pots of sauce brought to the table. Try the meat first before you drown it with sauce because it really needs no sauce! But I love sauce. I dipped the fries in it, the corn in it, the beans in it, I love good sauce. We (or I) emptied both pots of sauce, but TRY THE SPICY sauce! It's not that spicy and was delicious!

Staff was great.
Bob himself seemed respected by his team.
I loved the atmosphere.
Baked beans were really good.  Great texture.  Not just a soggy mess.
Onion strings were perfect.

The top sirloin I got was very tough, strings of gristle running through it, making it even harder to cut.
I didn't order the filet because I wanted more flavor than a filet usually provides.  The flavor of the sirloin was lack luster.  A good grill flavor but not much to it.
It was cooked perfectly. 

They did so much right but for a bbq place with not so great steak, I really want to go with 3.5 stars.

I'll be back to try the ribs and brisket.  I have high hopes that I will be updating my rating.",1,0,1

For 15 bucks? Whhhhaaaaa? Hell yes! 

These are questions my friend asked, when she wondered if I wanted to go to Bobby Qs the other night. Honestly, I did not get my hopes up, and prepared myself for a rough ride home. Yes, in case you are wondering, I have had some bad experiences with Seafood.

We decided to sit on the patio and were promptly attended to. I ordered a bloody mary, the rest beers. The bloody mary was freaking tasty. Spicy and tasty. 

We all ended up ordering the Steak and Crab special. I ordered a Caesar to start with. The Caesar was good. Nothing amazing, but solid.

Then there came the Crab. Half a snow crab, with an 8oz Steak and a side of roasted corn. As I started drooling, my stomach did a backflip from excitement. The crab was awesome! Not chewy or fishy tasting. The steak was great as well, and the corn was nice and smokey.

The only negative...the server was a bit forgetful at times. Honestly, once the crab and I had our moment...I no longer cared..",8,5,7

I ordered the 1) 8oz sirloin steak with 2) mac n cheese and 3) shoelace fries, along with a 4) frozen strawberry lemonade. 

1) Ordered medium rare. Average steak. There was a vein of unchewable running through it that I had to spit out. It really is quite massive and is the only thing I wound up finishing or even putting a dent into.

2) Waaaay rich. Like eating a bowl of solid melting cheese. Not my thing, but maybe it is yours.

3) Fried breaded onions. Like onion rings, but also like eating oil.

4) Unbelievably, jaw-achingly sour. The waitstaff offered me another to replace it, which was just as sour, but it couldn't be helped.

I've seen the place a million times and love BBQ, but after 4 years in AZ, have never been here! Sucks, because it seems I was really missing out. The place is huge, decor is very sharp and the smokey smell off BBQ throughout the place was a good sign! The service was on point...quick drinks and refills, very attentive and friendly. What a shock! 

Upon sitting down, we received 2 small cakes of cornbread (free) which was a nice filler. I had the BBQ brisket sandwich and my biz partner had the pulled pork sandwich. We both agreed the meat was tender and flavorful. The buns are slightly toasted, so the sauce doesn't get soaked in the bread. The server asked if we would like additional BBQ sauce...I said no, but wished I would have. Although the meat is very tasty, I did find it a little light on sauce (and the sauce is good stuff). After we finished our sandwiches, the server brought 2 little cinnamon\/sugar donuts for desert in a small brown bag (fresh, hot and also free!) Very good way to end a good meal. We both agreed, this will definitely be a place added to our rotation as traveling throughout the city!!!",1,0,1

With barbecue, people's favorite styles are so different and standards are exacting.  Yelp put me onto Bobby Q.  Impressive ratings.  Rare does any restaurant have the ratings that Bobby Q does.

It was a Friday night during spring training.  We tried making a reservation that day, but they were already fully booked.  The parking lot was overflowing (at night you can use the lot next door at the small ""college"") when I arrived.  Loved the smell of smoke as I walked in.  The hostess said 50 minutes.  I don't think it was much more than 30.

Three of us started with Bobby's Amber Ale.  For those looking for heavy hops (IPA lovers) or deep flavor (stout or porter people), it would be lacking, but I liked it.  We also got the appetizer of little taquitos, Q Rolls, filled with barbecue beef.  Those came with two good sauces.  Very good.

For the meal, I choose two meats: pulled pork and brisket.  Both were tender, well seasoned, smoky, a little sauced (and I wasn't compelled to add a lot more), and moist.  Others in the group got: a pulled pork sandwich, ribs, and a salad with chicken.  Everyone thought the barbecue was excellent, echoing my comments of seasoning, smoke, and moistness.  Everyone loved the sauce.

Side: I got the Mac N Cheese and corn.  The corn was excellent with some taste of grilling and well seasoned.  The mac N cheese was good.  Mac N cheese almost always disappoints, and this was better than most, though I didn't love it.  Many in the group went for the grilled vegetables which were excellent.

An excellent meal.  I can imagine a few being disappointed with the crowds, the wait, or the style of barbecue if it's not their favorite.  I've been to a lot of barbecue places that were not nearly as good.  I haven't gone to any significantly better (except my backyard on 4th of July).  So I'm going to say 5 stars, and I look forward to returning to try the spareribs.

Why 5 stars?  Why not 4?  This is a barbecue place.  I'm not going to rate it on the same scale a high end fine dining restaurant.  For what it is, a steak and barbecue joint, it does it as well as any place I've been to.  I wish it wasn't as crowded, but it's popular.  If you crave smoke, you should find great satisfaction here.  The sides and appetizer were 4+.  But the star of the show, the smoked meat, was excellent.  That's what I came for, and that's what they get the 5 stars for.",0,0,1

We knew we could get good food and enjoy a setting that was colorful, eclectic, and maybe even charming in its own special way... if that's not too far-fetched..all at the same time. Once I moved onto college, and others went their separate ways, we all forgot about Bobby McGee's. It would often be a topic that would arise at a dinner convo, ""What ever happened to that one place we used to go to near 27th Avenue and Northern?"" But that was all that ever materialized.

Luckily, I was reunited with this restaurant, now known as Bobby-Q's. It has since transitioned into a Kansas City\/Texas mixture type barbecue, but still a great atmosphere! After a long day of rock climbing, my friends and I were famished and they suggested getting barbecue. Once we arrived, all the memories started flooding back of this place, and I love what it's become. The barbecue is really good! It's actually one of my favorites, I'm surprised to say. Three of us shared the Whole Hog Heaven, which is a major platter where you can choose 2 ribs, 2 meats, and 3 sides. Our selections: the Baby Back ribs, the beef ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket, potato salad, macaroni and cheese, and grilled veggies. The rib meat was tender and ""fall off the bone"" type texture. The  baby back ribs were by far my favorite of the bunch. 

While waiting for our order, our group also shared the smoked brisket Q-rolls with chipotle dip. These were really delicious but kind of reminded me of eating a mini chimi since the phylo dough was so flaky and crispy. There was a small heap of roasted corn served on the plate as well that was super smoky in flavor. 

Even though it is the middle of winter, the patio was still very comfortable since all the heaters overhead were on. There is a metal waterfall sculpture that extends the entire length of the patio so it is very soothing and entertaining to have the sound of ""rain"" behind you as you're eating outside.

The winner of the evening was the moist and plump rotisserie chicken, accompanied by the two sides which were shoestring fries and mac n cheese.

The first clue was that the place slathers it's food in sauce as a rule, not an option.  I have no idea how they can smoke their meats for up to 22 hours without having any noticeable hint of smoke.  And don't tell me that, ""it has a smoke ring so it has to be good""(that's just a natural reaction of nitric oxide).  The brisket was bland, the beef ribs had essentially no meat, the pork ribs had a little flavor, and the pulled pork was downright appalling and stringy and flavorless.  

Sides of grilled vegetables were flavorless and bitter.  The pecan coleslaw was bland, and the pecan part was just a sprinkle of untoasted pecans sprinkled on top, and the ranch beans were very vinegary (a welcome bit of flavor)

I have no idea how this place was voted a best BBQ place in the nation unless it was by a bunch of people that have no tastebuds, in fact, I would rank this as some of the worst I've had in the nation.  

This place needs to up their game, Phoenix has BBQ that is infinitely better and at half the price.  

The service was fine, but the management is a bit overbearing.  When you need to toot your horn about how good you are to every table when they sit, it really shows that you're not that great, greatness speaks for itself.

Bottom line, my family will not return, and will never recommend that anyone else does.

Please search out any small local BBQ pit and get some real food with real flavor.",3,1,1

That having been said, I find myself going to BBQ restaurants on a regular basis because the men in my life live for it. So I got talked in to hitting up Bobby Q. Sure...why not...

The food at Bobby Q is EXCELLENT. Probably the best BBQ I've ever had and as I said, I don't like BBQ very much. Very flavorful, not overly sauced, good sized portions. All around, excellent.

So why the 3 stars? Three reasons.

1) RIDICULOUSLY high prices. It's BBQ, not Morton's steak house. Our party of 4 bill was nearly $100 and there wasn't an alcoholic beverage in sight....

2) Service was not up to par at all. You do not leave the appetizer dishes on the table when you are putting down the dinner dishes. And you don't leave said dishes on the plate after the lady of the table has gone out of the way to stack said dishes perfectly so you can easily take them away. And you don't leave them until said lady has to ask you 3 times to take them away. 

3) Restaurant was dirty. Sorry but leaving tables unbussed all around us just isn't acceptable at the prices you are charging much less at a lower-price-point establishment. 

Bobby Q...get your service up to par, take a good look at your price points, and CLEAN. I'll be back I'm sure since the men in my life love BBQ. I would love to be able to raise your stars!",1,1,0

Bobby Q's is right off I17 and was easy to find for us out-of-towners. The parking lot is huge and when we went it was really quiet.

The interior has a bit more of an upscale vibe to it, not like an old traditional bbq place. The service was good and they give you mini-doughnuts at the end.

We ordered the whole hog platter to share amongst the two of us and it was definitely enough food. I don't think it'd be enough food for three hungry people, but definitely two. We had the brisket, pulled pork, beef ribs and st louis ribs.

The mac & cheese was delicious. It was creamy, cheesy and amazing. Definitely worth getting. The garlic mash potatoes were also very good, but not as mouth watering as the mac & cheese. If I had to do it again I would just have the three sides as mac & cheese, it was that good.

All of the meat was tender - the meat feel right off the bone of the ribs and we could cut the brisket with our forks. It was delicious with the smoked flavour and sauce they put on. Unlike other places they do put some sauce on it, which is how I prefer it. It's not overpowering and drenched in sauce to prevent you from tasting the actual flavour of the meat though.

Price wise it was a little higher than other restaurants (Seems to be $18-25 per person) we had been to, however the quality of the food is well worth it. Unfortunately we were too full to try the dessert, but that's OK because there's nothing wrong with filling up with meaty goodness.",3,3,1

We scour Yelp! all day to find the perfect new place to go out to eat on a Saturday night. On this particular Saturday it was my turn to choose the spot. I was in the mood for BBQ, but was some what tired of the usual places on our list. Well then came Bobby Q's! Coming from the Surprise area it was an easy ride down Olive to Black Canyon Hwy. As stated several times already, the place is somewhat hard to spot as it i set back from the road with limited signage, but we made it into the lot on our second pass. It was about 6:30 and we didn't have reservations, but fear not! The wait we were told would only be about 20 minutes. The time came and went however no open table. The greeter apologized for the delay, but offered for us to wait in the VIP lounge for a drink and free onion block appetizer. We no sooner go our drink and the table was ready! Everything was moved over to our table and away were went to enjoy our dinner. The service was as good as it gets, A+! My wife went for the Smoasted Chicken with sides of baked potato, and roasted corn. I opted for the slow roasted beef brisket sandwich, and a side of mac and cheese. Once the server brought over the onion block, and corn bread we wee set. The onion block was fantastic and big enough for up to three people. The corn bread was perhaps the best I was had in all of Arizona! My wife rated her chicken dish an 8 and sides a 8 as well. When all was said and done...she was STUFFED! As for myself, the sandwich was just big enough to satisfy my apatite, and was delivered just as the menu stated! Deeeeelishous! As for the mac & cheese...have you ever had something so good it cold buckle your knees? Yeah, it was THAT good! No matter what you order from the menu, get a side of mac & cheese! As we finished up the owner himself came over to our table to see how our experience went. The OWNER! Not some manager, but the man himself! When all was said and done the bill came to just under $30. I did not order a Alcohol based drink, only Dr. Pepper, but they too looked top notch from those around us who indulged.

This restaurant has a simple menu, fair prices, wonderful Happy Hour specials and FREE Cinnamon Sugar Donuts for all!!  (Get an extra bag to go!)

You can't go wrong with anything you order here.  All meats, chicken and fish too, are moist, tender, seasoned very well and are very filling.  My favorite side dishes there are the macaroni and cheese (da bomb!), Pecan Coleslaw (yes...Pecan!) and their shoestring French fries, with BBQ Sauce as a dip!  

That's all well and good, but what keeps me coming back is their BRISKET!!  Hot damn!  Lean, tender, juicy and addictive!!  You'll be dreaming of Bobby Q Brisket in your dreams that night!  Their Brisket, Ribs and PRIME RIB (ahhh) are the top three sellers at Bobby Q! 

They have a WONDERFUL lunch menu, but what I like is that they don't skimp on serving size for lunches.  You get a ton of meat and normal size side dish.  You just pay a few dollars less.  That's always good. 

Don't forget the FREE Cinnamon Sugar Donuts at the end of your meal.  Grab an extra bag of them as you leave.  I've also seen people grab a bag of them as they go in as well!  No one there will tell you that you will spoil your meal by doing that so have at it!",1,0,0

How this place has over 700 reviews to begin with is beyond me. Not even Amy's Baking Company has that many reviews and, as you might know, was heavily trolled after it aired on Kitchen Nightmares. They must be handing out money to folks for writing this shit. Or they're planted reviews. What's even more baffling is that it has a solid 4 stars. Methinks something is not quite right, but whatevs. Let's move on, shall we?

This place is truly bizarre. I've been here maybe a total of 3-4 times since it first opened many years ago. It's a BBQ restaurant \/ club-lounge thingy. And as I learned for the first time at happy hour yesterday, it's apparently two different restaurants. At least, that's how everyone acted. My boss had made reservations for us in the Q Lounge for their Friday happy hour. Apparently you can just walk in (provided you're 21) and eat a buffet spread for free. But not until you get past the LAUNDRY LIST of dress code rules. Yes, a restaurant that serves BBQ, near Ghettrocenter, has a fucking idiotic dress code. Seriously some of the dumbest shit I have ever seen. I thought I was in metro Phoenix at a BBQ restaurant, not a Scottsdale nightclub. The list includes asinine things such as: No white t-shirts, no hats, no sunglasses, no sandals, and must be a cougar. I wanted to be like, mo' fucker, do you know this is PHOENIX? We wear sunglasses upon walking up. We wear hats to shade our faces from the blazing sun. We wear sandals, often times fashionable ones, so our feet don't get all sweaty. And white t-shirts? Now you're just acting foolish. Of course, my boyfriend whom I invited, was wearing a white t-shirt, with a nice button-up collared dress shirt (it was unbuttoned), a hat (a nice one, like derby style), and sunglasses because um, to shield your eyes? He was asked to button up his shirt, remove his sunglasses (no shit Sherlock, don't we all once we get inside?), and remove his hat. Mind you, he's a nice dresser, not some hobo with tattered clothes (usually). Had I not been invited by my boss to this happy hour, I would've bounced right then and there. It all just seemed like some giant, corny joke.

Time for a paragraph break. It helps your eyeballs if you break things up. I'd like to point out that the actual restaurant portion does not honor said happy hour. That's right, you must go to the 21+ side with the fun dress code rules to have happy hour, even though it gets insanely crowded with nowhere to sit. Oh wait, you CAN order a happy hour beverage, but you have to get up from the table and walk your ass to the bar. If you order a beverage at your table, it'll be full price.

I will now talk about the redeeming qualities which merited that killer 2-star review. The food is very good. The mac and cheese is the cheesiest, and all of the meat is incredibly tender. A wee bit overpriced, but not awful. They also give you free freshly-made donuts when you leave instead of a damn dinner mint. That's pretty dope. The staff is very kind. Our sever, Alicia (sp?), was very sweet and accommodating. Kudos to her.

Lastly, it's confusing as shit to get into this place. The parking lot is weird, and if you've never been, you'll have no idea where to enter. The Q Lounge vs the restaurant portion. Two different places, remember. Even though...it's...not.

Note: Just don't dress like you live in Phoenix. You might not get inside to the dopest dance club in all of metro Phoenix.",8,15,4

First of all ,I want to thank tommy, Dylan and manager Joanna for exceptional service and attentiveness in making our first visit memorable .
I've tried a lot of BBQ and wherever I travel I try to eat local BBQ . I usually can eat a whole slab myself and still have room for more , but not the case here.
We ordered the prime rib brisket with Mac and cheese and shoestring potatoes  and the full slab of St. Louis ribs with Mac and cheese with shoestring potatoes . We were also offered corn bread  free of charge. The brisket melts in your mouth and is so moist and tender I'm drooling right now. Most briskets ive tried get dry and chewy but not here . The ribs had the right char on the outside but the meat falls off the bone with the right smokiness and moist flavor. It was so meaty and filling I only ate 1\/2 the slab. The Mac and cheese is very cheesy and filling and the shoestrings were addicting.
Asking for a doggy bag, tommy and Dylan added additional cornbread ,xtra BBQ sauce and a bag of fresh cinnamon donuts! Great experience and I'm going back again ! I usually ask for sauce on the side when eating meats to fully enjoy the flavor of the meat Do not drown meat in sauce",0,0,0

What We Ordered
- Beef Brisket with Mac and Cheese and Mashed Potatoes
- 2 Meat Combo: Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket with Mac and Cheese and Mashed Potatoes
- Steak Sandwich with Shoestring Fries
- Catfish Po Boy Sandwich with Roasted Corn

The complimentary corn bread was good! Very moist! The beef brisket was good! The meat was tender but I felt that I needed to add the bbq sauce for it to taste better. The Mac and Cheese was super duper cheesy!! I loved it!! The Mashed Potatoes were really good as well! Super buttery and smooth.

The Pulled Pork (not pictured because my sister was sitting too far) was AMAZING. It was good by itself or with the bbq sauce! I really wished I ordered this instead, like I originally planned. Luckily, my sister let me sample some of hers. :) My Mom enjoyed her catfish po boy. She's really picky so that's telling you something lol. My Sister and Mom loved the roasted corn! 

The only bad dish was the Steak Sandwich but I don't know if that's because my Dad ordered it medium well. He said it was too chewy and had no flavor. His shoestring fries were really, really salty and soggy! He was very upset, to say the least lol.

They give you little sugar donuts, (Thank Q's), at the end of the meal! They were so cuteeee! They were just average tasting but I enjoyed the fact that they were free! I will come back for the Pulled Pork!",4,2,1

Our server Michael was amazing, personable, warm, friendly and very helpful with our ordering and everything else.

On my continual quest for savory smoked, grilled and BBQ goodness, I decided to stop in. I initially entered the ""Q Lounge"" to check out the Happy Hour which obviously has a huge following and offered a HH buffet and numerous drink specials. While interesting and entertaining, I wasn't feelin' it so after about an hour, I wandered back into the main restaurant. Taking a seat at the bar I ordered up a rather potent and tasty Margarita and looked over the menu. 

Decisions....this looked promising. The wonderful smoke aroma mildly permeating the restaurant gave me further hope that I was getting into something good. Opting for the 2 meat combo with brisket and sausage with roasted corn and mac n cheese on the side, I was looking forward to the meal. 

Served relatively quickly, I stuck my fork into the mac n cheese. I was told it had 5 cheeses. It was quite rich with a very Velveeta like palate and a slight tang of cheddar. The corn was truly roasted, cut off the cob and served up neatly in a bowl. The brisket was tender, smokey and amazing. Well marbled, not too lean and not too fatty. The smoked sausage was not overly smoked, well seasoned and with just enough bite (I will have to try the jalapeno variety next time to compare). 
The serving size was plentiful. And I had enough left over for the next day!

It surprised the hell out of me to find out they averaged 4.5 stars. Now, me and Kathy are huge BBQ fans and wanted to balance out our weekend with a meat splurge. We decided dinner was going to be how it was going down...

Again, the stoopid Google Maps app fails us again and has us feeling our way to Bobby Q. We finally get there and got sat down immediately. We got served a basket of cornbread that looked like hockey pucks. There was a crunchy texture on the outside, while the inside was moist and fluffy. It was spectacular, but don't fill up on them, unless you are on a diet and weren't ordering anything else. I'm usually skeptical of ordering brisket, unless I know there was some Texas affiliation. Lots of the Yelpers raved about the brisket and when the waitress recommended it, it was a no brainer. What was difficult was what else to order.

We settled on the the Whole Hog Heaven, after much debate between me and Kathy and interrogation of the waitress. The Whole Hog Heaven is their best feast where you can choose 2 BBQ meats and 2 pit ribs types, plus 3 sides. We went with brisket, smoked sausage for the meats and St Louis ribs and Texas beef ribs. For the sides, we ordered the mac n cheese, roasted corn and shoestring fries.

First off the bat, the brisket was as good as advertised by Yelpers (thanks, y'all) and our waitress. Juicy, moist and tender with a smoke crust gives the brisket an unforgettable experience. Another winner was the St. Louis ribs. It literally fell off the bone and was oh so tender. The sausage was good, but not outstanding and the beef rib was also just acceptable. Against the waitress' suggestion for their ""smoasted"" chicken, I do think I will try the smoked roasted chicken and the baby backs next time. All of the sides were tasty, but the stars were the brisket and St. Louis ribs.

To top off a grand BBQ evening, we were given a brown paper sack of mini donuts that were sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. That's a nice touch. Overall, I give Bobby Q a solid 4 stars on the basis of the brisket. You can have a brisket sandwich and die happily, and yes, its that good! The service was good and the food came out fast. 

I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu. There was a couple next to me,  who ordered enough for a small army. The guy raved about how the Southern Fried Chicken was the best he had ever had. The dude looked like a food heavyweight, so he must have had a few country fried chicken in his lifetime, so I'm adding that to the list.

But, the St Louis Ribs are the reason to eat at Bobby-Q!! These baby back ribs are succulent and the meat falls right off the bone. They have the right balance between rub and sauce. The sweet and tangy flavors are what barbecue is supposed to be. I couldn't find the smoke ring under the rub and the heavy sauce. Sauce-less is not an option. Order an extra cup of the tangy sauce...

The cornbread is moist; a remarkable achievement since most places it's dry as a bone. Bobby-Q's cornbread is excellent and complimentary (Hint, hint to those from Nebraska who believe in charging for dinky little miniature cupcake-sized portions). It's even better with the whipped butter and\/or honey on top...

Bobby Q's serves up authentic dry rubbed meats cooked to perfection, and spicy sauces. Walking in, it feels very comfortable. The decor has always been outstanding for the past twenty years. The attentive service is solid.

But boy were we oh so happy that they were because we ended up finding Bobby Q's. 

Again, sticking to the whole honesty thing, we loved everything about this joint. From the moment we walked in and saw just how charming the venue was to the exceptionally good customer service they delivered, this place was on point. Our waiter even had the perfect balance of knowing when to check on us and when not to. He kept our drinks topped off and was so knowledgeable about everything they had. You could tell the staff took pride in working there.

We shared a dinner combo: ribs and top sirloin with a baked potato, mac n cheese, and roasted corn. We also shared their signature mud slide pie. Everything was good but let me break this feast down to my personal favorites:

The Ribs - I can totally see why they'd be dubbed ""World Famous"" for it. I mean, the meat literally falls right off the bone while maintaining the right amount of tenderness you can only find in a perfectly slow-smoked BBQ.

The Roasted Corn - I've never had anything like it. It's rich with buttery goodness and makes a stance with the char it leaves in your mouth long after you've digested. This is one of those sides that shouldn't even be a side, it's just. that. good. 

Bobby Q's, thank you for being open when all the competitors were closed - you guys have officially left me with a tasteful experience I will never forget.",4,0,1

Before your food arrives you get two pieces of corn bread and butter and at the end of your meal you receive a sugar donut.

By noon the restaurant was standing room only and our server was very attentive and refilled my ice tea three times. The rib meat really does fall off the bone and you can smell the hickory wood and taste the dry rubbed spices with each bite of rib which was mouthwatering and delicious. We asked the waiter to bring extra BBQ sauce so he brought us the sweet and the spicy sauce to sample.

The Good:
-Servers
-Brisket
-Ribs
-Salmon
-Shrimp
-Cornbread (love the corn kernals...please add a few more?)
-Cole slaw (PLEASE add a few more pecans!)

The Bad:
-Pulled Pork (for years it tastes like natural gas grill--sorry, but that's accurate and I am a paid ""taster"")

The Ugly:
-We have not been back, since one visit, our Guest who bought us drinks while standing around waiting for a table was highly over-charged for cocktails!  
Charged $14.00 for a glass of St. Michel Reisling ($7 to $8. for a bottle at any super market)  Also charged $14. for a well-drink and $9. for a bottle of Bud Light!
We should have asked for the manager right at the moment, but as good restaurant goers, we let it go in a busy environment.  

I phoned a few days later to be treated very poorly and found that "" I must be mistaken""
I have phoned about a year later (because I would like to go back but my partner will not) and the prices were lower than we paid that night.
Perhaps this was a dishonest bartender, taking advantage or perhaps prices have since been reduced.
Nevertheless...with an issue like this, you would THINK that someone would care enough to at least be courteous, let alone offer compensation...although, we never usually accept compensation. 
However...Bobby Q's doesn;t care...they are busy enough.

My husband is a BBQ fiend so I tend to make some concessions for him. Bobby Q's was one of those concessions. Thank goodness for that because I love this place. Luckily for me, there are things here I would eat such as the grilled salmon ($17) and chimichurri shrimp ($16). And the sides, good heavens, the sides are so damn good. The only ones I ever get are the sweet, buttery corn and the mac and cheese. Neither are healthy (the corn is extremely buttery) and the mac and cheese is extremely gooey...just the way it should be! I am a sucker for a good mac and cheese and then when you factor in the best corn bread I have EVER eaten, I am a goner. Good lord, you would think I am hungry the way I am writing this review but I promise I am writing this on a full stomach. No, but seriously, if you like corn bread, you have to try Bobby Q's corn bread. It's ridiculous. Then at the end of the meal, they give you these sugary donuts (the granulated sugar) that just top off a great meal. If you go on Sundays, try the Hog Heaven. For $29, you can feed 3-4 people. It has pulled pork, beef brisket, baby-backed ribs, bbq chicken, two sides, and corn bread. I do think the sides are not enough for four people compared to the amount of meat you get. We ordered it last night and had enough meat for 5 people but enough sides for only 2 people. They did give us 6 pieces of corn bread, though. Either way, it is a GREAT deal. 

The interior is very nice with dim lighting for a possibly romantic feel. It seems kid-friendly and we haven't had any issues bringing our almost 3 year old here.

So it's probably no surprise that I've been to most Valley smokehouses to check out their goods.

My latest exploration, Bobby-Q, came after a day of bargain hunting at a clearance outlet at Metrocenter. So much shopping can work up an appetite, and you'll need an appetite since the prices at Bobby-Q are low and the portions are large.

The location might be familiar to many longtime Phoenicians -- it was Bobby McGee's until about five years ago. I have many fond memories eating there with my family as a kid.

While the building got a $3 million dollar makeover, the charm and coziness is intact. It's sort of a cowboy chic with dim lighting, stained concrete floors and a tin ceiling. The seating is comfortable and the service friendly and efficient. If you're in a hurry, you can call ahead; there is a separate entrance for to-go orders.

Everything on the menu is made in house, from the barbecue sauce to the fluffy corn bread. Being an avid home cook I can appreciate these extra steps.

Always wanting to try something new, the Q-Rolls ($7.50) are a take on a Mexican flauta. Filled and rolled with smoked beef brisket and then deep-fried to a golden brown, these looked better than they tasted. The roll's open ends allowed for far too much oil to penetrate the meaty interior, which ended up a tasteless crunch.

A steakhouse classic, the Wedge Salad ($5), is made with a quarter of crisp head lettuce, sprinkled with smoked bacon, chopped tomatoes and bleu cheese crumbles. I can never resist the power of blue cheese and bacon.

The menu includes entree-sized salads, sandwiches and steaks, but my focus was on smoked meats. You can order two or three meat platters, but I opted for the Whole Hog ($36), a choice of two ribs, two meats and three sides.

When the plate arrived, my eyes widened. Huge slabs of Baby Back Ribs and St. Louis-Style Ribs were framed by piles of pulled pork and beef brisket, it's quite the mother lode of meat, so be prepared to share with others.

Going straight to the ribs, I grabbed a bone and it immediately separated from the rib meat. The meat was melt-in-your -mouth tender, and rightly so; they cook their meats low and slow for about 20 hours.

With all of the meat loving going on, it's easy to forget the sides. The Mac 'n Cheese was creamy and gooey and was worth ordering again. Pecan Cole Slaw was good, but I especially liked the toasted pecans, hich provided a nice contrast. Roasted Corn comes topped with a few wheels of corn on the cob. I wish the entire dish were served this way, since the kernels were swimming in a pool of butter.

After finishing this feast, there couldn't possibly be room for Peach Cobbler ($6.50) or Mud Pie ($6.50). But it was a nice touch that the check was brought out with a small bag of hot fresh cinnamon and sugar-covered donuts.",5,1,2

The price is very reasonable as well, especially for the amount of food you are given. The BF and I shared the ""Whole Hog"" platter. We finished it, but only because we're gluttons and don't believe in wasting food. It was enough for at least 3 people. The meat just fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. I also appreciate that it wasn't smothered in sauce. They give you the opportunity to actually taste the meat but give you extra sauce on the side if you want it. We had the mac and cheese - gooey and scrumptious and the corn - roasty. The cocktails were tasty and also reasonably priced. We were there on a Saturday night with a party of 14. I don't know if we had a reservation but we were seated pretty quickly. We could tell that they were busy and even though we were taking up a lot of precious space they never  made us feel rushed. The waitress was a doll! Being a large group we didn't all arrive at the same time, needed separate checks, and needed drinks at different times.

There is a club attached to the restaurant but it is pretty bizarro. I wouldn't recommend hanging out there after your dinner. It isn't a honky tonk but a CLUB club for the locals. It doesn't really fit with the restaurant but whatever more power to them using the space to make some money. Apparently every table in the club is sold out every Saturday night so good for them.

The beef ribs here were falling off the bone tender but relied way too much on the sauce and not enough on the smoke in the meat for flavor.  Overly sweet and no tangy heat that I expect on a good beef Q.  Like some odd mix of St. Louis style meets beef ribs.  I'd give them an 7\/10.  And at $28 I'd expect a 10\/10... Sides were hit and miss.  The whole corn was really exceptional - really a 10\/10, great smoke flavor.  Slaw was ok but the pecans really didn't add and the slaw was lacking something 6\/10.

At Bobby Q's, its more formal; there's a nice ambience, there's a full bar, and you eat with forks and knives. 

The Pros:
The great service
The 10% off by checking in on yelp - yay!
The complimentary cinnimon sugar donuts at the end which are HOME MADE - dayum, those things were awesome
The pineapple drink - its a real pineapple filled with a ton of alcohol but guess what? It tastes like juice...which means its dangerous. Drink at your caution.

Cons
Their sides could be better - The mac and cheese was way too thick and unfortunately, didn't match the rave reviews. 

Another interesting fact - there's a club next door so you can get your grub and then dance it off",0,0,0

Looked like the place was run down and on the way to being washed up when I pulled up into the parking lot.  Turns out that ""run down BBQ shack"" is the look that they were shooting for!

The inside is another matter.  Obviously a BBQ place.  But a very nice one indeed.  Nicer and with more personality than Famous Dave's or Lucille's.  If this is a chain, it doesn't feel like it.  I sat at the bar (as I usually do when traveling).  They have indoor and outdoor seating.  Both looked comfortable and fairly well lit.  And the place is CLEAN; including the restrooms!

The staff i dealt with was friendly and attentive without getting on your nerves.  Obviously experienced and well trained.

I had the baby back ribs with mac & cheese, and grilled vegetables.  The ribs were meaty and tender with an excellent BBQ sauce.  Meat came off the bone easily.  I ate them with a fork with no problem.  The meal came with good cornbread and butter.  The Mac & cheese was creamy and delicious.  And the vegetables were grilled just right without being too soft.

Don't be put off by the rustic appearance of Bobby Q's.  This is a well run restaurant that gets plenty of business.  And they should.  They have a smoker on premises, and smoke their ribs and brisket for the better part of a day.  They also dry age their own beef on premises.  I was told that the rib eye is superb.  But that will have to wait for another day.

To start it off one of the bartenders jumped up on the cooler where they keep clean glasses and is also at the bar top height where people's food and drinks were. Then the same bartender took a container that was used to keep mixing tools and mixed up a drink in it then put it back on the counter and put the mixing tools back in it with out washing it or getting a new container. And then watching how the drinks were mad was pretty bad the bartender consistently under poured all the drinks. Overall it was a great experience except for the bar.

We drove up and parked in the adjacent parking lot, and were surprised that the entrance was on the other side of the building!  But the rustic looking building was attractive on the outside, and when we entered we were surprised at how classy looking the inside was.  We were seated earlier than our 7:00 p.m. reservation on Open Table at comfortable booths that had movable banquettes on each side-- booths are sometimes a problem for me due to my size, but problem solved!  We of course had to order the local specialty draft, Bobby-Q's Amber Ale from Sonora Brewing, and we both enjoyed our pints, accompanied by sweet corn bread muffins, which my wife said were made from Jiffy mix, which we both love anyway.  We then selected the onion block, accompanied by a delicious Bobby-Q sauce for dipping, and we could not eat it all and brought about a third of it home.  Lightly battered and delicious.  We then chose to split the combination platter at the recommendation of our super friendly and attentive waiter, Jason, and he was so right because we even took part of that home too.  The one we chose had both of our favorites on it,  baby back ribs for me and fried catfish filet for my wife.  The catfish was perfect and savory, and the ribs fell off of the bones--honestly, I did not use my knife to separate them, just my fork.  For our sides we chose ranch beans, simmered with pork shreds and delish, and pecan cole slaw, which I don't eat but my wife wanted to try.  She liked the slaw, but the chopped pecans were just sprinkled on top and were not as good as those we have in Georgia.  Jason brought us a box for the leftover onion loaf and a rib, along with a short small brown bag, cut off and imprinted with ""THANK YOU"" on it, containing four little cute fried sugar donuts, a nice touch.  The manager came by near the end of our meal to ask how everything was, and we praised the food and Jason's service.  A beautiful night out and we felt like we were back in the South!",2,0,1

My favorite thing on the menu is actually the fried chicken. It's a HUGE boneless breast that is breaded in a yummy coating and although it is fried, it is not a big greasy blob. It comes with two sides, but they suggest one be the mashed potatoes and gravy. The mash is really quite good. There is a hint of spice in there that is unexpected and nice.  My only gripe is that they serve the gravy on top of the fried chicken and I have never understood why you would drench something crispy in anything that is going to eventually turn everything to a gooey mess.  The flavor is great. Just put it on the side.

The free donuts are a nice touch, but nothing special, so save the calories and get the banana pie\/pudding thing. The crust is made of crushed nuts, which is then topped with a substantial layer of bannana pudding. All of this is then topped with carmelized bananas and drizzled in carmel. YUMMO!!

And if you like their macaroni and cheese (which IMHO) is heavenly cheesy goodness, skip it as a side and order a quart to go instead.  You will get about 8 to 10 side servings for around $6.50 and that is a HUGE savings over the sides price.

It is for sure likely going to be crowded and on the loud side, but it is a super fun environment. The restaurant is really big and it has a great Western theme. 

We were seated pretty quickly with our reservation. It definitely took awhile for us to be greeted and to get our first round of drinks. Our server mentioned that the bartender was really behind so that it might take awhile for our drinks. I felt bad for the bartender and it seemed like they should have had another bartender helping. They had also run out of many of their gins because it was the end of the month, but I felt like that shouldn't be an issue. However, their cocktails were tasty. 

Regardless, our server was super nice and friendly. She was very good and attentive in the beginning and then towards the end it was difficult to track her down for awhile. I think she had a really big party that she was taking care of. 

For starters, we started off with the recommended Q-rolls stuffed with brisket and served with chipotle sauce. These were delicious! They were crispy, not oily, and the brisket inside was tender and flavorful. 

For my entree, I got the fried chicken, with a baked potato and mac n'cheese. The fried chicken was very good--crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The baked potato was good--not overly oily. The mac n' cheese was very good too, but reminded me a lot of stouffer's mac n' cheese, which isn't a bad thing--just reminded me of it. The prime rib that I tasted was also very good--tender and flavorful.

The prices were fair.

Overall, really fun and casual ambience, good food, fair prices and decent service.",2,1,1

The Brisket is moist, not as smokey as it should be, but it's tender and full of flavor.

Even vegetables had a scent of the real fire and had a perfect tenderness. Our fully loaded potato was exquisite.  Just a perfect taste.  Salad- was a house salad. Good tasting but Nothing special about it.

We went on a Friday night and the wait for a table was about an hour and a half. This was a little bit longer than expected, however we figured we would grab a drink and wait. After seeing how large the drinks were that others around us had ordered, we decided on just one cocktail called Shipwrecked. It was large and pretty sweet with a blue raspberry-coconut flavor. Since this was the type of fruity drink I typically gravitate towards, I was satisfied and would get it again.

Their estimate on the wait time was fairly accurate so about an hour & a half later, we were seated at a table on their outside patio. Our waiter was friendly and came by our table immediately. He went over the menu items and suggested some of the meat plates and sides. I ended up getting a Pulled BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side of Mac & Cheese (which multiple servers seemed to be recommending) and my fiancé got a three meat plate with the baked potato and mashed potatoes. While we waited, we were brought out some warm cornbread and butter to enjoy, and a short while later, our food arrived.

After tasting a little bit of everything that we got, I wish I would have ordered one of the red meats instead of the chicken sandwich only because it was so plain compared to the other items. I'm not a huge fan of red meat which I was pleased to see chicken on the menu, but the red meat had the actual BBQ flavor I was hoping to find. All the side items were good; I personally liked the mashed potatoes the most but my fiancé liked the mac and cheese the most. The chicken sandwich plate and side was small enough for one to finish entirely but we had some leftovers from the three meat plate.

After we were done with our meals, we were brought a small bag with some cinnamon sugar covered donuts. I had seen a couple of people making them fresh at the front of the restaurant when we walked in, so this was definitely a nice & unique treat.

Overall, I would definitely be up for coming back here and giving some of the other menu items a try ... 4.5 stars, just not quite 5.",17,8,12

Our waitress (Christen?) started things off right with her friendly and warm style.  When my date wanted to know which sides were best, Christen brought out huge samples of the sides we were interested in.  Our glasses were never empty and our table was consistently bussed.  We chose the smoked wings for an appetizer and since we come from the ""wingland"" (near Buffalo, NY) we were not disappointed.  Big, meaty wings that were slathered in sauce and cooked perfectly.  We opted for small Caesar salads and were surprised.  The romaine was cold and crisp and the dressing was as good as any at many a high-end restaurant we've been to. Cornbread.  Damn, that cornbread was GREAT.  Then entrees:  I had the 3 meats: sausage, brisket and chicken.  Each was perfect.  Smoky, tangy and tender.  The brisket may just be the best I've had.  My date had the prime brisket and raved about it.  I was only offered the tiniest of samples from her but was amazed - that WAS the best brisket... ever.  At the end of the meal we remarked how terrific everything was (especially the cornbread) and asked for a box to take our remaining pieces to-go.  We were surprised when Christen brought out a box with an additional 6 pieces.  I had ordered the Sub Zero banana cream square to-go.  I was asked if it was ok for it to come out a little later, as the manager invited us back to the kitchen to look around and specifically to see the industrial-sized smokers.  That was an incredibly gracious gesture.  I even got some meat smokin' secrets out of him!  Again - a warm, friendly, gracious guy with a genuine smile and offered a feeling of being ""family"".  By the time we got back to the table my huge desert to-go was ready and we were fat and happy.  Christen ended our night with a warm (and strong) handshake and best wishes for safe travels, home.",0,0,0

The barbecue is amazing as well as the macaroni and cheese. I have had many items on this menu but always come back for the brisket. The brisket is very tender and has a great smoky flavor. It goes well with either the loaded mashed potatoes, loaded baked potato, or and in my opinion the best cheesiest homemade macaroni and cheese I have ever had.I would definitely recommend to anyone and will be going back soon.",0,0,0

We found this place on yelp, read the views, and decided to check it out.  The service was great, the waiters were friendly, thoughtful and very knowledgeable, and really went the extra mile in providing my large group with great customer service. 

The food was spectacular, made to order, served hot, and good portions. The ambiance was good as well, exhibiting warmth within a family-friendly atmosphere. 

The only downside to our experience was that we live in California, so we could only visit Bobby Q's when we travel to AZ.

For those wanting some of the best barbeque in the United States, try this place out!",0,0,0

To be honest, I was completely shocked to find this place off the 17 this spring watching Spring Training. Don't let the part of town dissuade you.  Friendly and knowledgeable service, good margaritas, and really good pre-dinner bread.

Growing up in the Midwest where good ribs are not hard to come by, I would put the rack of baby backs I had at Bobby Q's right up there with some of the best I've had.  Will definitely go back when I'm visiting Phoenix again.",4,1,1

My wife and just happen to see a sign saying Bobby Q has the best BBQ in the country. Here is another example of over priced and over rated BBQ!! Not only are they NOT the best BBQ in the country! They are not even the best in Phoenix! I am not sure who they paid for that rating, but they got ripped off. If you are going to say you are the best in the country. you better be the best! And Bobby Q doesn't even come close I am sorry to say. But I will say the rest of the menu is good and the service is awesome!",0,0,0

Went with pick up this time and I got the two meat dinner plate. Ribs and brisket with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The best of the two in my opinion was be Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes were nothing spectacular. As far as the meat is concerned....Holy moly, this place has got to be one of the best bbq spots in Arizona. A bit pricey but worth it. The cornbread and little donuts are also amazing. I would come back here in a heartbeat! If you're in the mood for some good, finger licking bbq, this place is it! Also looks pretty lively inside on the weekends, check this place out if you're in the area, it won't disappoint!",2,2,2

OH WHO AM I KIDDING, I was going to attempt this area anyways. I adore BBQ, and Bobby Q's does it right! My son discovered the sausage to be overly hot, but they did warn us when he purchased, so he ended up eating my meal and I took his. Extremely great things all around... BBQ beans were great, the cornbread was wonderful and did not fally to bits like it did at Thee Pitts Again, and service was spot on. Definitely worth a return trip!",0,0,0

A couple weeks ago, we celebrated a co-worker's birthday here, and although we were outside when it rained, we didn't have to worry about getting soaked. The beers were quite tall, and the food was excellent! Along with ordering the pulled pork mini-burritos and wings, we were also given small sacks of fresh cooked mini-donuts. Nowhere have I gone to, have those been served; you wouldn't think of a BBQ place serving such delectable little donuts!

In regard to the music, I can't say I've been there but did have a DJ friend there recently headline there for a Thursday night. The set up looks good, for being outside of Downtown Phoenix and Old Town Scottsdale.

Can highly recommend if not for the BBQ, at least for the small sacks of fresh donuts!",0,0,1
