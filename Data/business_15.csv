The price is reasonable since there is such a wide variety of different brunch items.  Here's what I would recommend:

Salmon platter - so so fresh - will hit the spot if you want GOOD smoked salmon

Chicken and Waffles - the most crispy yet tender waffle with a prefectly roasted chicken

French Fries - weird to order this for breakfast but you just have to do it.  They are that perfect.  

Bacon - who doesn't love crispy bacon?

Berries - Perfect mix of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries with a vanilla bean cream.  I've ended every meal with this because it will cut the richness of whatever you order and make you feel like you had a dessert.

Any average bistro in France will serve at least as good as this if not better for half the cost. O.k. so we are not in France so you have to pay extra, which I don't mind but it should be really, really good if I'm going to plunk down $38 for an entree and no sides.

First about the food...
We shared the grilled octopus salad, which was very nice. It was the best dish of the evening. The octopus was tender and mild, accompanied with some citrus sauce, rocket, and various peppers and pickled peppers.

My husband had the flat iron steak and fries. I had read rave reviews of the fries but it turns out they are just fries. They remind me of In & Out. We have a local bistro that has much better fries. The steak was good, cooked to order, with carmelized onion puree and some chive butter. Good but not spectacular.

I had the leg of lamb with escarole. Leg of lamb is a pretty big hunk of meat but this presentation was very thin medallions of lamb--about 8 small bites of meat. Yes, it was nice but nothing special. The escarole was fine, and it had about 1\/4 cup of tasteless quinoa. I would have much preferred rich, creamy mashed potatoes. The highlight of the dish was the Hen of the Woods mushroom--fantastic! I would have ditched the lamb and rather had a plate of those.

We were so unimpressed that we decided to go without dessert. Ironically, it was our anniversary and the reservationist asked if it was a special occassion, which we said it was, and the matre d and waiter both gave congratulations but actually, that was the end of it. Have you ever been to any kind of restaurant that asks you if it is a special occassion and then does nothing? Not even a stupid chocolate-covered strawberry. For those prices and that hype, you would expect a little something when you are paying $175 for 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 glasses of wine. Why bother to ask? 

The good thing is that we have always contemplated going to the French Laundry but this changed our mind. It would pain me too much to pay $600 and be disappointed. Again, it was certainly not a bad experience and it was a good meal, but not at the price.",0,0,0

So I used to live in Las Vegas, and as a matter of fact, I worked inside the Venetian so this place was very close and convenient. I loved popping in for a quick lunch or meeting friends later in the day for a nice dinner. Oh I miss you Bouchon!

Bouchon is what I imagine a typical French bistro to look and feel like. Simple items on the menu, done right. Steak with fries, pan roasted trout, blood sausage, etc. Everything delicious. 

Excellent staff, very friendly and accommodating. The restaurant itself is simple in design, however not so simple in workmanship. The details are just right, coming together and creating an incredible atmosphere and ambiance.

- Complimentary pan epi bread - Yum!! We pretty much killed the whole braided roll because it was that tasty with a bit of butter!
- Bouchon French Toast ($12) - I feel like this name is a misnomer for this dish. It's definitely more like a cinnamon apple custard bread pudding. The decadent apparence caught me off guard - it looks like a layered cake! And the first bite surprised me too - but it grew on me as I ate on. In the end, it was an enjoyable dish, but very sweet!! It looked kinda small, but I ended up not being able to finish it, so don't underestimate it. However, I'm not huge on cinnamon apple so I wouldn't order again.

Leading up to the event, the thing I was most excited about after the chance to revel in wordsmithery was being able to return to Bouchon, this time with the husband in tow (which meant I had semi-control over ordering two meals, not just one, which we would then split in whatever fashion I deemed acceptable).

He got the breakfast jardiniere (eggs, brioche toast, potatoes lyonnaise, spinach, fruit, juice, tea, and a pastry -- we got chocolate almond croissant).  I got the brioche french toast and a side of corned beef hash (not on the menu, but they'll make you whatever you ask for here, within reason -- it was $8.50 in case you're curious) and a coffee. 

Everything was great. Eggs cooked perfectly, toast light and fluffy, spinach buttery and rich, potatoes well-crisped (and also buttery and rich). The french toast was quite rich and sweet - I definitely wouldn't have been able to eat a whole serving, but about 40% of the serving was perfect for me. The corned beef was well-seasoned and savory, the potatoes were small cubes, well-crisped -- I'm not sure that the two married perfectly, as I think the potatoes were a little too crispy to integrate just right into the meat, but I still ate all of it. The chocolate almond croissant was crazy good. I have read this recipe in the cookbook, and all the steps that go into making it, and now I can see why it's all worth all that work. If there's an almond or chocolate almond croissant on the specials menu when you're there, get it. 

Service was smooth early on, though it got a little slower as the place filled up (it was surprisingly full by 830am on a Friday), and we got someone else's toast delivered to us, so he went toast-less for longer than he probably should have until they figured it out.

Unfortunately we got a late start and got there about 5 minutes before brunch was over and were told that they were now serving ""Express Lunch"" and had a menu thrust at us to review .  We were disappointed but our lateness was our own fault, so we figured we'd give lunch a try anyway. We were seated near a window and not far from the server station.  The restaurant was about 1\/2 full and 2-3 servers were frequently standing at the server station chatting away.  The problem was that no one ever came by to serve us.  We waited 15-20 minutes and not even a glass of water was poured.

During the 20 minutes we waited, no one else came into the restaurant.  As we walked out the host told us to have a nice day and had no clue that we were the last people he seated.  When I commented to him why we were leaving, he asked if I would like to speak to someone.  Apparently he was not a someone, just a somebody in an over sized jacket. I would have thought that he would have not even asked the question, but instead insist on bringing over a manager.

The good thing about this is that as we walked back through the shops, we stopped at a little bistro that was serving both breakfast and lunch that had excellent service and very good food.  In the end it was a much better experience than I think we would have had at Bouchon, had we ever been served.

Now I'm sure this review comes off as being a bit snooty.

Long version: So my girlfriend, two female colleagues, and I were in Vegas for a conference. We're trying to figure out where to get dinner, and we finally end up at Bouchon. It's a celebrity-chef restaurant in The Venetian. The decor is impressive. The prices are high. The menu is written to get you excited about the food. We were expecting amazing things. The many people on the waitstaff were extremely friendly, so we were even more expectant. We asked that our food - entrees, apps, and sides - be served at the same time. It took 45 minutes for the meal to arrive. And it was so disappointing.

The onion soup and white sausage entree were good, nothing terrible, but for an affected, overpriced French ""bistro"" from a celebrity chef, I was expecting much better than Olive Garden level. Both my colleagues said their main dishes were pretty good but nothing to brag about. One of them also got a side order of $7 ""pomme frites."" They were plain, bland French fries. The fries at Smashburger put these to shame, for God's sake. My gf got the worst of it. The roasted squash was soggy on top and hard\/undercooked on the bottom, and bland all over. The fried zucchini blossoms were inedible oil-sponges. She literally didn't eat them. The salade de tomate was swimming in vinaigrette.

Then, to add insult to injury, a group of five arrogant dudes and one skank in their late 20s came in. Where do you think they got seated? As far away from all other human beings as possible? Nope. Right next to us. And I do mean ""right next."" There was hardly any space at all between their table and ours. Tip to the Bouchon hostesses: when a pack of a-hole guys comes in, don't seat them next to a table with three attractive women and one guy. I knew these guys were d-bags the second I saw them, and I was right. They kept staring over, and sure enough, as predicted, one of the scumbags couldn't resist making a loud, inappropriate comment directed at one of the women at our table. Naturally, this p-ssy never, ever would've done that if he had been there by himself, but surrounded by his fellow scum he was brave.

Nice going, Bouchon. We wait forever for overpriced, mediocre food and end up getting harassed by the sh-tbags you seated right up against our table.",0,0,0

My friend had some type of belgian waffles(bananna maybe) and my other friend had some type an omelet. I forget, I was paying attention to my food. I wasn't even drunk either because like I said we went for breakfast. Pricey food but well worth it in my opinion. The service was on point. The server recommended an excellent wine as well.

My lovely boyfriend reserved a dinner for two at bouchon, since he's a huge thomas keller fan. The resturaunt is located inside the emaculate venetian hotel. The resturaunt was beautiful with a romantic ambiance, dim lighting, with a high class feel. We were seated outside by a beautiful fountain and view of the pool. 

The service was amazing, our waitress was a sweet lady and got our orders in quickly. We were given a complementary baguette formed beautifully resembeling leaves or a vine with butter and a small bowl of pistachios while we waited for our meal.  For appetizer we ordered the Terrine de foie Gras de canard which came with toasted baguettes $25. We also had Foie Gras Saute', a pan seared dish $24.75. This was my first experience with duck\/goose liver, and I must say it is now one of my favorite things to eat. The conard was more so a liver spread, served cold to top the toasted bread, which was tasty. I prefered the seared version, i felt that prepared this way the flavors were much more elevated.  The textures like butter when seared and the flavors amazing. Not a trace of the irony liver taste you'd expect.

For my meal I opted for the Croque Madame $18.95.
A unique play on the rather simple ham and cheese, my boyfriend tells me it's normal for the french. It came on brioche bread, with a fried egg, smothered in their mornay sauce (white gravy) with a side of delicious french fries. It was delicious, comprised of the best ingredients, definitley filling.  But sad to say I'm just not a fan of soggy bread.
  
We finished the night with a dessert to share. A simple chocolate mousse. This was good. But lacked the oohh!ahhh! factor I was hoping to reach. This trip was one directed towards food and we've been cruising around to try things on a long list of amazing places; needless to say, we were happy and stuffed.

Thomas you make amazing simple french food, and you execute them effortlessly. I give you 4 stars, and wait cant wait for round two with different selections. But I must say your foie gras rocks!",4,1,1

I ordered the Burger that they have since we had a girls night out the night before and what serves a hangover better than a burger and fries? The burger came and it was very thick, not sure why it needed to be 2 textbook widths thick. The bun was okay and slightly over toasted for my taste. 

There was absolutely nothing special about my meal except that I love french fries, and they were pretty good fries. I can tell they were fresh but it shouldn't be the highlight of the meal. 

My burger came with thousand island sauce which I appreciated since I'm from cali and currently reside in Boston - meaning I miss In -n -out a lot! 

My friends didn't say anything special about their food either. I believe someone ordered the hash and sausage and the sausage tasted like cornmeal was added to it. My other friend ordered a salmon open faced sandwich with egg and she had trouble cutting her bread- it was so hard.

Service: Horrible. I came with a bachelorette party. Our server was rude to us. He was being impatient. I think it should be expected that when we come with a group this large (16 ppl) it may take us some extra time to order. The server wasn't giving us adequate time and was rushing us. Also there was this negative attitude about the server that just dampened our mood. He made dinner unpleasant. Other than that, they had our table ready when we arrived. Everyone else did a fine job but it was just our main server we all had a problem with. 

Food: Everyone enjoyed their food and there were no complaints. 

- Seared Foie Gras: Great. Wasnt over cooked. It was super simple and placed on a broiche but that created a perfect blend. 
- Muscles:The muscles were yummy too. The sauce was perfectly creamy. Not too intense. The muscles werent chewy. However, the fries that came with it weren't the best. Seemed a bit too dry.
-Mushroom Side: The side of mushrooms were definitely addicting and the side was large enough to share with 3 people. 
-Salmon Tar Tar: I'm not a fan of salmon however their tar tar was just perfect. It wasn't fishy and I really recommend this dish to everyone.

I believe restaurants on the Las Vegas strip are often very overrated. My theory: People are in Vegas to party and have a good time. They often eat at these places while they're having a great time regardless of the quality of the food or restaurant. When they go to write a yelp review, they assume that the high price tag and the fun evening must mean that the restaurant was great. 

Despite all of this, I was pleasantly surprised by Bouchon. It doesn't have that fake night club vibe. The venue itself isn't designed to distract from the dining experience. In fact, it compliments it. It looks and feels like a french bistro without trying too hard. The outside terrace is also a great touch.

No, it was because of our waiter, Paul. Maybe the best waiter I've ever had. Such a cool, laid back type of guy, but so hilarious, and on the top of his game throughout the night. He did everything for us, thought of everything, took care of it all, and all with the greatest sense of humor I've experienced in any restaurant anywhere. He made us laugh throughout the entire meal, yet still met our expectations for the kind of service you would expect in a fine dining atmosphere. 
  
We had a large party, and Paul took care of separate checks for us and waited on us as we took our sweet, large, party-of-nine-time to figure out our bills (we were almost the last people to leave the restaurant that evening). He chose drinks that complimented our meals and opened us all up to something new. He gave us the best entree recommendations. Monkfish and Steak Diane. Just do it. And the mussels. Really do that!

Don't go expecting a fancy-schmancy experience.  Bouchon is the kind of delightfully simple bistro you'd find in Paris or Amsterdam.  (Sadly, like those cities now, Bouchon does not allow smoking...even on the patio.  Boo!)

I recommend a sampling of a la carte items.  My favorites include:
* Oysters (be sure to ask for the fresh horseradish)
* Salade de Cresson (with Roquefort to die for)
* Pate de Campagne (so wrong, it's right)
* Macaroni au Gratin (truffle-infused orgasm in a pan)
* Pommes Frite (fries have never been so French)
* Creme Caramel (and a bib for my drool, please)

I can't get enough of this place; I'm in love.  Let me put it this way, if Bouchon has been a teen heartthrob, I'd have had a lipstick smeared poster of Thomas Keller above my bed.",7,5,7

meal: breakfast
beverage: cranberry and orange juice (they mixed it for me) - the best drink I had in Vegas all weekend (and yes, I did have a lot to drink)
number of people: 4
food: 2 - chicken and waffles, 1 - croque madame, 1 - corned beef hash

The chicken and waffles...wow! So much flavor. I would not recommend if you were hungover because there's so much going on in terms of flavor. The waffles are seasoned with herbs - fantastic on it's own. Add the gravy, maple syrup and grilled\/rotisserie(?) herb-crusted chicken and OMG! 

Croque Madame...it was ok. If I didn't have the C&W (see above) then I would have given only three stars overall. I have to say though...the fried egg makes the dish. Well...that's why I ordered it, at least. Since they ran out of the Eggs Benedict, I figured that this was the next best option.

Corned Beef Hash...paled in comparison to the C&W and the generous pile of french fries that came with the CM. However, it was fantastic as ""leftovers"" that we were able to snack on several hours later in our hotel room. Did not require neither heating up nor utensils. 

I would go back for the juice. Oh and the peach jam. Yum!

I got a seat at the side table after just 5 minutes. Service was superb. Friendly and efficient. Lots of water refills. I asked for extra bread since there's always too much spread and not enough bread to spread it on.

I ordered the foie gras + pate. Looks like they're trying to save costs by mixing it with pork pate. And you can taste it as well. I was pretty disappointed - it was described as such but I was really looking forward to having foie gras and not pate (!). Especially as it was listed at the same price as before but now with pate which I don't remember from before.

Bouchon is Thomas Keller's Las Vegas French Bistro.  Moderately priced food, prepared with style, care and quality ingredients. The service was excellent.   

The atmosphere is grand, the impressive zinc bar really gives the place the character of a Parisian Brasserie.  The feel reminds me of Le Couple.  It's not an intimate place, there's a feeling of activity, hustle and bustle.  It's tucked in a lower corner of the Venetian Hotel so if going, give yourself some time to find it.  

We ordered the salad of greens and warm goat cheese.  The mixed greens were fresh and delicate with a red wine vinaigrette it was superb.  I ordered the salmon as my main course.  It was cooked perfectly and had a delicious crispy skin.  It came with some buckwheat crepes or galettes which were a nice compliment to the salmon and smoked salmon beurre blanc.  We also ordered the Poulet Roti, a generous portion of chicken, nice and tender served with a puffed pastry.  We enjoyed a cote du rhone village which I thought was reasonable in price.  

The french fries or frites are a must try at Bouchon.  I witnessed countless orders of them being served so we ordered some for ourselves.  These golden sticks of potatoes were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  Not a hint of greasiness and with just the right amount of salt. Our cone of fries was empty by the end of the night.

For dessert, we shared an apple bread pudding with ice cream and a calvados sauce. We loved it.  For some reason they also brought us a complimentary dessert sampler plate with a scrumptious assortment of treats.  We managed to finish off those too.

Tables packed too close, and food over priced. While our waitstaffer Rosemary was pretty attentive, and nice, I just felt overwhelmed in a bad way. 

So more breakdown, food: because the only thing which sounded worth eating was the benedict, I went for that. Usually I'll order a benedict. Well the first egg was WAY overcooked. It was almost hardboiled instead of poached. (And I am not being picky, I can make better at home). Only the second one was sort of poached. But by the time I got to the 2nd, it was cold. The ham, was just giant chunks. It would have seemed more appropriate for an expensive place to do thinner slices layering delicately. It doesn't matter what kind of ham it is. Quick back track on the eggs; if the ham hadn't been so hard to eat and first egg hadn't been over cooked, I would have gotten to the 2nd more quickly. Again, sadly I could have made this at the timeshare for $6. 

Also tried bacon, ok portion for price. Bacon made me feel better. Tea wasn't straightforward chamomile, but ok whatever, again upscale tries-too-hard. Side 'mixed greens' was sad small, with onions? And more onions?  I ate it because I paid for it, but bleh. And those mini-pickles were hard to eat and sour. 

Friend got the blueberry muffin, looked good, but way too flaky and messy. Decent prices for those of course.

Service: again, perfectly great, attentive. But packed us in like sardines, can't see the waitstaff asking about what we'd like, have to turn around, crane my neck, etc. After walking down the strip and being racially insulted, it was a pain.  She made a valiant effort (all Stars go to her) with extra jam, friend asked for it for bread. Also table was so small, it was hard to eat comfortably, with all of the large plates.

General, seems they only have daily options, not really solid consistent options, aside from certain things on the menu. The baguette bread was harder than baguettes I'm used to, really really messy. No opportunity to enjoy the bread itself when all we could taste was butter and jam to soften, and crunchy shell.

My tea, bacon, and sad eggs benedict was $38 after tip, not even 18% tip. Just no. So for that price, I have no plans to ever return. This was my friend's wish to go there. 

Side note, the people we sat down next to in the beginning were really nice, but they didn't stay after eating. We immediately got stuck between 2 rude couples. Girl to my right was insanely rude, and kept staring at my friend and rolling her eyes and making snide comments about EVERYTHING, even the waitstaff trying to be accommodating to her ever- changing needs. And the other, crazy talking really loudly about her personal business. I got her full life story. If you want snooty gossip vibe, go for it! More power to you.

Again, I have no plans to return unless I'm sitting at the  bar away from people. I like relaxing vacations. FYI, comparison vibe, I was so much happier near the people we sat by at the M resort buffet.",0,0,0

Dishes were great, just as expected from a Keller brand restaurant. The fries were fried to perfection, crispy and seasoned just right. Croque madame was very good. Fried egg on top and a bechemel-like sauce made it the best part of the meal. Their roast chicken was nice as well.

Located in the Venetian Hotel & Casino, the actual restaurant is located on the 10th floor of the hotel so you will need to access this place by going on the guest elevator. Plenty of security at each entry to the elevator. Was afraid they were going to ask for room key which would be annoying but I guess during the afternoon it's ok.

We thought there would be a long line but we were seated right away as there were plenty of seats available around 11am but the restaurant itself was also busy. You can choose to sit outside but we were conveniently seated near the doors to the outside so we still had a good view. We waited for about 10 mins or so because our waitress finally decided if we wanted anything to drink. Odd because when another group walked in and got seated, they were quickly approached by the same waitress right away asking if they wanted anything to drink. Not sure why we had to wait a while before we were approached by our waitress. Service by the waitress could've been better. The other waiters did much better servicing us as we were approached frequently for refills.

I ordered their Croque Madame which is a grilled ham and cheese sandwich covered in sauce with a fried egg on top with plenty of fries on the side. We also ordered their Beignet to start off with and my wife ordered their clams with plenty of fries also. You will not need to order their Baguette since they start you off with a nice Baguette with choice of blackberry jam and butter. I recommend the Croque Madame. Great dish if you like grilled ham and cheese sandwich. Plenty of flavor and great with the fried egg on top. Plenty of fries too which makes it hard to stop snacking on. Beignet was delicious as it came with both Nutella and jam. You probably wouldn't need it since it's already covered nicely in caramel. Overall food was great here and I would definitely come back.

This was my second time at Bouchon in The Venetian, so I kind of knew what to expect and what I wanted to eat: pastries. Here's what I enjoyed on this trip.

Pastry basket: For $13, you can pick 4 of the listed pastries on their menu including the specialty pastries of the day. The cheese danish was highly recommended to us by another hotel guest and it was delicious - not too sweet. The croissant was light and flaky. Chocolate\/almond croissant wasn't too heavy on either chocolate or almond paste, but just right. The pecan sticky bun was monstrous and definitely on the sweeter side, however, it's kinda perfect with the chewy and crunchy pecans. I felt like I was eating pecan pie.

Beignets: Ok, I was a little disappointed with these because they're not like the square-shaped puffy pillows I expected from Cafe Du Monde in NOLA. These re more like cake doughnuts that were dusted with cinnamon and powdered sugar, but also served with both nutella and a jam. They're still good but definitely put in second after the pastry basket.

Croque Madame: Basically a ham and cheese sandwich covered with bechamel and a poached egg, but this was rich and delicious. Typically, you might not think much of the ham in one of these sandwiches, but each part of the dish stood out: the bread was toasted to be crunchy without getting too soggy from the bechamel, you can actually taste the ham without it just being a wet, cured, salty layers of meat, the egg perfectly poached, and the bechamel wasn't too runny or too thick. I should mention that this was served with a side of frites.

Bouchon definitely doesn't disappoint and I really think pastries are the way to go here. Or if you don't want to sit down and leisurely enjoy, you can always go to the Bouchon Bakery downstairs to pick up a few pastry items including huge macarons. Otherwise, dining outdoors at the bistro is nice. The wait staff is extremely attentive to keep your coffee cup warm and they're personable.

First, and most importantly, the food.  Visited in mid-September 2009. Ate at the bar since I was dining solo.  Started with a vesper cocktail, which was well-made.  Moved on to the soup of the day: roast pumpkin.  It was perhaps more seasonally appropriate to the Northern California Bouchon location, but it was still tasty.  However, I know that squash soups generally turn out OK so long as you don't burn the squash and you use a ton of cream (and it was clear from the coloration of the soup that a ton of cream had been used).  

The main course veered off from my expectations by presenting me with trout amandine that tasted like cat food.  I'm not exaggerating: cat food.  To the restaurant's credit, the bartender realized that something was up and comped an order of fries for me after I had them take the trout away, but the magic was gone and my expectations definitely didn't connect with reality.

Second, the location.  I don't know who thought putting this in the Venezia tower was a good idea, but they should be shot.  With the Palazzo built, the Venezia is now the overlooked middle sister of the Venetian properties.  As a result, you have to really know where this is, otherwise you'll never find it.  And even if you know how to get there, it's still a complete mystery as to exactly where in the universe you are, which is a tad disconcerting.  

Third, the service.  The main bartender was competent but was also saddled with two trainees when I visited.  He also disappeared for about 30 minutes in the middle of the dinner rush on a Friday, and the trainees stood with their backs to the bar for the entirety of that time sampling wines.  Thank goodness for the other bartender (whose name I unfortunately didn't catch), who was very friendly and the hardest-working person I saw during my visit there.  Aside from that guy, the staff seemed a bit full of themselves, which is off-putting in a supposedly relaxed bistro-style setting, and also unjustified considering the quality of the food they're dishing out.",0,0,0

Starters:

Bread with butter, jam and ketchup?!: Bread was shaped like a branch with leaves.. something like that. It was hard but the inside was soft and tasted fresh. The butter was kinda hard too, the jam was pretty good and the ketchup I guess was for the fries to come? Who eats bread with ketchup?

Cheese Danish - Looked like a croissant shaped like a muffin, with a dab of some cream cheese butter on top. This was So Flaky\/Soft and the cream cheese butter lightly spread throughout was perfectly balanced.. This wasn't your ordinary cheese danish (pre-packaged grocery store bought), this thing was Superb!

Croque Madame: Toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce. Served with pommes frites.. Sounded quite fancy for a breakfast dish - In Layman's Terms = Ham & Cheese Sandwich with Egg and Fries! Toast tasted like a really buttered croissant with an airy texture. Ham & Cheese wasn't the oscar mayer ham nor Kraft cheese I use for h&c sandwiches back at home, it was much more gourmealicous! Plus, with the fried egg, more like a sunny side up egg and their white creamy\/frothy sauce, makes an Incredible Sandwich! Fries were served as a generous amount and were plain good. 

Corned Beef Hash with eggs and toast: Corned Beef hash came in shallow bowl with a blanket of overeasy eggs practically covering the hash. I scooted over the eggs to try just the flavor of the corned beef. They were little cubed chunks sitting on top of some pretty tasty juice\/sauce. The cubes tasted and had the texture of ham. The juice\/sauce gave it a great beef flavor but not the usual Real and typical corned beef I'm used to having. Nevertheless, it was Good. The toast were thick and had a buttery flavor and reminded me of a Crouton. Like a Toast Bread Shaped Crouton?!..

I should have paid more attention to the 'bad' reviews before making a reservation here, because many of them rang true for our dinner as well. As another reviewer accurately stated, Mr. Keller should be embarrassed to have his name on this place. We had the gran plateau, escargot, charcuterie plate, sea bass, mussels, and gnocchi. NOTHING deserved more than 2 stars.

There wasn't one person at our table of 8 that enjoyed our dinner. Gnocchi was just flat out terrible. Should have ordered 3 drinks to start with because we didn't see our server for at least two 30 minute stretches.

If I could rate the service less than a 1 star I would. 2 hour dinners are fine if you are being waited on, but the person who we were unfortunate enough to have never even checked to see how our food was! She also proceeded to 'tell' me when I would be 'allowed' to order a drink - when it was convenient for her - what a joke. I was a server for 8 years, and appreciate when restaurants are busy - but there were empty tables everywhere. No excuses here.

The food and service at this location was ok, but not stellar like the Yountville (Napa Valley) Bouchon.  Although I don't consider my visit a complete waste, I would rather spend my money elsewhere the next time I'm in Vegas.

The first sign that this Bouchon was not quite as wonderful as Yountville was the hostess' greeting. I got the feeling that we were just another pair of customers to her. She was not rude, but there was no warmth or sense that she was trying to give us an amazing Bouchon experience like the hostess I met at the Yountville Bouchon.

Our server turned things around a bit and was very friendly and relaxed.  He brought menus and took our orders quickly (but not too quickly), and got us started with coffee and water.  The coffee was perfectly brewed.

I had the white sausage and scrambled eggs with browned butter (beurre noisette) and a croissant, and my friend and I shared some fries.  The white sausage was cooked perfectly, but maybe I'm just not a huge fan, because there was no mind-blowing flavor explosion when I took my first bite.  Haha...this is probably not the most appropriate description for sausages, but oh well.  Anyway, the casing had the perfect amount of ""crunch"" but wasn't too hard or crispy.  Very decent.

The scrambled eggs were mediocre - overcooked, slightly rubbery and a little hard.  I was really looking forward to the eggs because from my other experience at Bouchon, I felt like they did a wonderful job of making simple, mundane food (like green beans) amazing.  These eggs were edible, but just not actually good.  Disappointing.

The croissant was the saving grace of my meal and was light, airy, buttery but not greasy and had a perfect ratio of crispy crust to soft insides. I really enjoyed it.  I would definitely get a croissant again!

The fries were also pretty great as well, although the fries at the other Bouchon were a tiny bit better. I can't put my finger on what was different, but it wasn't glaring and I would still order these fries again.

In terms of the level of service, I felt like this Bouchon was run more like a regular restaurant instead of an amazing one like Yountville.  The waiter was friendly, but seemed to disappear a bit after checking in on us once after our food arrived.  He brought us our check at a good time (no pressure to leave or rush), but we had to wait a while for him to come back to take my credit card.  I understand he was probably busy, so I don't blame him personally. 

However, I was mildly irritated because lots of other staff (4-5 people) walked by and saw me holding my bill and credit card and ignored me. At the other Bouchon, I don't think this would have happened since all of the waitstaff worked as a seamless team and were all extremely aware of any customers with a ""Please help"" look on their faces. There was no sense of ""you're not in my section; therefore you're not my customer"" that I felt here and most normal restaurants. Of course, in the grand scheme of things, this is not a big deal at all, but people go to Bouchon as much for the food as the service, and this visit fell short in both.",0,0,0

Bouchon was a perfect pick for brunch. We started the meal with a mimosa and a peach bellini. Then, we ordered beignets (aka powdered donuts) that came with raspberry jam and nutella. The beignets were perfect. They had a little texture to their outside to give the crunch factor but the inside was perfectly light and cakey. The raspberry jam was delicious with it. Nutella is always good so why not on donuts?

For the main course, I ordered their french toast and Jeff ordered croque madam. The french toast was this perfect little tower layered with apples and custard all on a maple syrup pond. It was very good, but not what I was expecting. I wanted the big pieces of bricohe with apples and syrup all decadently on top. I guess I wanted more comfort than elegance?

Jeff's croque madam came with the biggest side order of fries I have ever seen. I couldn't even see his meal over the fries (although I am short).  The flavors of the sandwich were there, but possibly it had a little too much creme fraise on it.

The highlight of our dinner was the trout almondine.  I am not a big fan of trout, but this one in particular was so tender and delicate that it was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had.  The sliced almonds provided a nice mellow nutty contrast to the trout.  It was one of those dishes that shine without having loud flavors but yet provide a soothing feel to the palate,

Saffron mussels were also decent, with nice creamy mussels.  We found the gnocchi was very doughy and bland - a definite pass.

My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday morning. There was a wait so we decided to just sit in the bar area. We sat at a high top for at least 10 minutes and no one came to our table. So the bartender invited us to sit at the bar and offered to take care of us, which she did!

We started with an order of the beignets. We wanted the special raspberry ones but they were sold out so we went for the standard spiced. They were good but not the best I've had, which was surprising. I expected them to be better. But the rest of the food made up for them!

I had the French toast - which had a seasonal pumpkin flavor with fresh cranberries. This is definitely French-style French toast. It's more like bread pudding than bread so it's very dense. It was melt in your mouth delicious. 

My boyfriend had the croque madame which came with French fries. It was delicious as well. The bread was fresh, the egg cooked perfectly and the ham was flavorful. The fries were thin, crispy and yummy. We ate every bite of both breakfasts.

Once inside, we were very impressed by the decor, but the service was pretty ridiculously poor. We sat waiting for about 15 minutes just for any acknowledgement from the waiter, and another 20 passed before I had to flag down our waiter to keep my girlfriend flipping the table and walking out. Definitely a major problem, especially for an upscale classy place like this. Though he did look busy, the waiter definitely glanced at us and walked away anyways despite the fact we were eagerly awaiting service.

However, apparently someone noticed, because soon enough we were receiving complimentary appetizer and sides to make up for it. The salmon rillettes was creamy and delicious, and went very well on the crostini. It had tasty little morsels of salmon in it as well, and we enjoyed them much more than the bread (which was quite hard and a little burnt). We got the roasted leg of lamb and the CRISPY PORK BELLY for entrees, and they were joined by Mac and cheese, sautéed mushrooms, and braised carrots. The leg of lamb was pretty good, a nice tender cut of meat with a delicious au jus full of flavor. 

The CRISPY PORK BELLY, my god, the CRISPY PORK BELLY. I had to caps it to do it justice. It was AMAZING. Pork belly is one of my favorite dishes, and if a restaurant has it on the menu, my decisions made. But the crispy pork belly here was by far, the BEST I've ever had. The cut of meat was just the right amount of tender, succulent meat, with a plentiful amount of flavor packed fat on the top, with a beautifully glazed crispy skin. The flavors melded unbelievably well, and the vegetables and onion sauce that accompanied it perfectly! I definitely give my highest regard to the chef, and I hope they give him a fat bonus for this fatty pork he introduced to my taste buds. I can only wish that I'll someday figure out the recipe...

We unfortunately didn't eat much of the much appreciated sides, but what we did eat was great! The mushrooms were deliciously prepared, and that's saying something. (I hate mushrooms.) The braised carrots were nice and soft, yet still crunchy enough, and were nicely seasoned. Finally the Mac and cheese were nice and gooey, but with an awesome crunchy crust! 

In short, though our experience at Bouchon began terribly, the situation was well remedied by the managers, and they more than made it up to us with the food!

You will have freshly baked bread as a starter and be careful, because it is so addicting, especially when you are hungry. You will end up ordering few breads more. Apricot jam is not overwhelmingly sweet and butter tastes very rich, glides very easily on the bread.

The bread tastes even more amazing when you get a bowl of french onion soup. The cheese on top of the bowl is so thick and gooey you will enjoy every single bite while chewing layers of savory cheese. 

My favorite brunch menu is Eggs Benedict and they have Pork Loin Benedict and Smoked Salmon Benedict which I got both for my friend and myself. The salad that comes together with Eggs Benedict might taste too bland when you have it by it self. I found it refreshing and I think it is prepared so to clean your palate after having a savory meat. If you find Smoked Salmon to be too salty, adding french fries as a side is another option!

Bouchon is Thomas Keller's attempt at bringing French Bistro dining to the affordable masses, and it works wonders.

I had the Gigot d'Agneau( roasted lamb), while Sarah had an ""Apricot Chicken"" ( not currently on the menu).

My lamb, which was my first, was cooked perfectly. Savory and aromatic to the last bite. The red that was recommended paired perfectly.

I had the trout, and the GF had the scallops. Simply amazing! Trout was filled with a cauliflower and garlic crouton stuffing broiled to perfection. The scallops were amazing. Perfect, juicy, and tender. We shared a side of brussel sprouts that were sauteed and broiled in pancheta and olive oil.

Drank Paul Bara all through out the night.

My wife goes for sourdough waffles or French toast with bacon and mimosas throughout the meal. The perfect way to start the day in Vegas.

Dinner is a wonderful experience and can actually be quite affordable in comparison to many other places we like to go, or you can go all out. Wonderful wine list given that I prefer old world wines in general, and they have a full range of prices so it's not intimidating if you have a budget, but if you aren't holding back you can grab a great bottle. I wouldn't pass up the terrines, pates, and other classic charcuterie if available. I also suggest digging into the oysters. The quality is incredible.

My first experience with a Thomas Keller restaurant and it certainly did not disappoint. I came on a Tuesday evening so luckily it wasn't too packed.

Went with a group of four so we all got a different dish to try and taste as many things as possible. Food goes as follows.....

French Onion Soup- One of the best preparations of french onion soup I've had, if not the best. The broth itself was extremely rich and flavorful and the cheese exterior was crunchy and went amazingly when mixed with the broth and onions. Beware because this dish is very rich and filling so it may be best to share it with someone else.

Pork Chop with brussel sprouts-This is the dish I ordered and I was very glad I did. Pork was super flavorful and paired with the rich sauce and brussel sprouts, the combination was great. Would have liked the pork to be a little more tender though.

Steak and Frites- The steak was done medium rare and was super flavorful. Came alongside a huge portion of frites which were damn near perfect. Great Dish.

Leg of Lamb-My friend got the lamb medium rare and it was pretty good. Wasn't the best preparation of lamb and wasn't as tender as I would have liked, but the flavor was good and he really enjoyed it.

Glazed Pork Belly-This was an appetizer special of the day. The pork came with a tiny portion, but was packed with flavor. Would definitely recommend this if it is a special of the day.

Unfortunately we were beyond full at the end of the meal, we weren't able to order any dessert. Overall I really liked Bouchon and can't wait to try Keller's other restaurants. The reasons that it wasn't a 5 star for me was that it was a little pricey and service was a little pretentious, but other than that I was very satisfied.",0,0,0

This is Thomas Keller's restaurant, which means its good food. But it is NOT fine dining like Keller's other establishment, French Laundry, and Joel Robuchon's. 

Bouchon is casual, relatively speaking. There is no prix fixe menu and there are no wine pairing options. Instead, its a traditional a la carte menu and an extensive wine list. Our waiter was incredibly attentive and helpful, choosing the perfect wine to pair with our orders of Beef Cheeks and Steak and Fries. (They had fancier names on the menu, but I can't remember.)

The Steak and Fries is pretty standard, but unlike many other expensive restaurants, they weren't skimpy on the portion. The Beef Cheeks was a warm and filling dish, satisfying in the cold weather. 

We also had the Macaroni Gratin (glorified mac n' cheese, but very creamy and delicious), Oysters (the freshest I have ever had, they didn't even need a sauce to add flavor), Duck Confit (average, but well garnished with grapefruit to cut the saltiness), and Pear Tartin for dessert (possibly the highlight of the entire meal).

The restaurant is well appointed, it could very well be in France somewhere. 
Our waiter was fine, bit not great. Actually, the auxillary waiters were terrific! 
We started with the EXCELLENT bread- I have not ever had such good French bread with sweet butter(room temp not cold, as many rest serve it. 
We started with a roasted beet , poached pear and mache salad. This was excellent except there were only 2 pieces of mache, not much greenery. 
My husband had the Poulet Roti (roasted chicken). It was quite good--crispy on the outside juicy on the inside---but way too salty. 
I had the Daube de Beef(shortribs with bordelaise sauce. The meat was good but not exceptional-was not that tender. I think they could have cooked it longer. 
We also had an order of fries which were wonderful.
Dessert was profiteroles- so average--ohh so disappointing. The pate chou was tough(stale?), the ice cream and valronha chocolate sauce was great. 
They did not rush us. The restaurant was full.

We ate here Christmas Eve and, I must say, it was disappointing. We arrived for our 8 pm reservation and were told by the hostess there were ""a few groups ahead of us,"" so there would be a wait...which was confusing, since the whole point of making a reservation was to avoid that. In any case, she recommended we have a seat at the bar and they would get us when they were ready. We then waited at an almost empty bar for over 20 minutes (not exaggerating) while the bartender walked back and forth in front of us without taking our drink order. We finally got our drinks right before the hostess came to get us for our table (almost 8:40)...so off to a very bad start, but we figured the food would be worth it.
Wrong. 
We ordered the oysters (which were actually quite good) and the black truffle risotto, which was a special of the night. It was well cooked, but completely underwhelming. My date and I both agreed it was actually quite bland, as if the chef was content to let the truffles do all the work that seasoning usually would. 
I had the braised leg of lamb, which was a squishy consistency I could barely cut with my steak knife. I honestly couldn't finish it. My date ordered the chicken, which by comparison to everything else, was the highlight of our food choices (if I had to eat here again, that's what I'd order). We topped off the evening with a clumsy apple crisp and the brownie bouchons, which were honestly not as good as some of the brownies I've made from a box mix. 
Based on our experience, the ONLY good things about the restaurant were the ambience and our server, James, who, despite the fact our food was consistently coming out 5-10 minutes after the couple next us' (who came in after us), kept us engaged and entertained. 
I won't go back and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

The ambiance was beautiful and the tables were nice and not too close to one another. The wait staff was very attentive and quick to get us drinks and take our order once we were ready. Once we placed our order the food came out fairly quickly. For me, the service was a solid 5-stars. 

Where Bouchon lost the other 2 stars from me was in the actual food. The presentation was very nice but for the price and the reputation I expected better. I ordered the Oeufs Benedict (Eggs Benedict) which is priced at $21 and includes: 2 eggs poached served with Hobb's smoked pork loin, country bread, sauce Hollandaise and mixed greens. The greens were fresh and very nice and the eggs were poached perfectly. The problem was somewhere, possibly on the pork loin, there was way to much salt. So much so that it was over powering. It was in an isolated area of the dish and as I was nearly done with the meal I didn't mention it to our server so I can't say how they would have handled a complaint. I do have the feeling that they would have taken whatever steps to remedy it but as I was nearly finished when I encountered the issue, it wasn't serious enough for me to make a fuss over or send a mostly consumed meal back to the kitchen.

Overall, it was a positive experience but based on all the hype and buzz surrounding it I had expected a bit more. Also, when paying these prices no portion of the meal should be over seasoned or inedible. There are lots of spots in town to get breakfast\/brunch and I'm not sold on a return visit to Bouchon.

If you 've been to the Bouchon in California then the first thing you'll notice is that the deco is exactly the same: high ceilings, art deco furnishing, black and white tiled floor with splashes of tall greens here and there. It is a delight admiring the attire of the servers who are all uniformly dressed in black satin vests over the pressed-white dress-shirts.  The look is accented with a full piece of ankle-length, clean-white clothes secured on the back with an elegant twist.  

The lovely maitre'd whisked me to a table and I was quickly served with the same grain-shaped, freshly-baked bread accompanied by fluffy savory butter.  My server's name was Brendon, a hearty gentlemen adorned with those old-school glasses like in Mad Men.  Having eyes that are always too big for my stomach and with a greedy heart of wanting to sample everything, I turned to him for recommendations.  

Without hesitation, Brandon recommended the foie gras (2.5oz), and decided on the tomato salade to freshen up the palate before we move onto the entrée of the day.  

The 2.5oz foie grais with sea salt came with neatly-stacked and golden toast strips.  To my surprise it was served in a small container where the top is covered with a thin layer of fat.  The server scooped out the surface fat and left me alone to enjoy the dish.  Scooping out the foie gras required a bit of a maneuverer since it was chilled in solid form, but the little pieces of it that fell out of my spoon quickly melted into, for a lack of better word, fat, on my plate.  It is truly a delightful indulgence - a smooth, rich, flavorful piece that fills your mouth.  This dish is best to be shared between two people. 

Tomato Salad is comprised of fresh tomatoes of various sizes and colors are cut in half, tossed in light vinaigrette and plated beautifully on a grand piece of 'melon'. 

All the staff was very attentive and my water glass was never half-full.  The server came around to take away the pistachio shells (did I mention they were warm and toasty when they were served?).

The last dish was the special of the day: Plum sauce with basil infusion and dabs of fresh young goat cheese surrounding the tender....I almost burst into tears when I had this.  Everything was married together perfectly in a joyous dance. 

Just as I thought the dinner was done, Brendon came around and placed a dessert spoon on the table: ""Got something sweet for you."" I widened my eyes in disbelief, wow! Compliment of the house! The dessert was Pot-de-Cream with lemon jelly coating accompanied by two short-bread cookies dusted in fine sugar. My heart leaped up when I had the first scope; like the foie gras, silky smooth and full of flavour.  And for contrast I alternated between bites of the cookies and scoops of the pot-de-cream.

All in all, I look forward to the next time I dine at Bouchone.  If you get there before me, please say hello to Brandon.

Waffles were light and crispy, and savory, chicken was extremely tender, and the mushroom gravy was potent.  This is almost the polar opposite of what Roscoes has become (so so chicken and eggo type waffles)

I going to review my dinner and breakfast experience. Even though dinner can be very good I think their breakfast is exceptional. Pricy, yes, but about as good as you can find anywhere. 

Dinner last night was good but not as good as it has been in the past. The small seafood platter was excellent with high quality raw oysters and clams from both the west and east coasts. Two beautiful jumbo shrimp half a lobster tail and plump black mussels were also very very good. The sauces that accompany the seafood were just ok so I stuck with the horseradish and lemon. The steak frite was disappointingly tough with tough grissly parts and the fries were cold and hard. Sautéed spinach was very good but the garlic confit was not meltingly tender and rich. It had a slight bitter edge. I still ate everything and enjoyed it. The martinis here were good not great missing one of our requests. The house haut medoc Bordeaux by the glass was much better than expected. Great service rounded out our meal.

I must say, breakfast was perfect. Their American breakfast is perfectly executed and I feel it's a bargain. Attentive service again at breakfast was appreciated at the early hour we were there.

The Bouchon is no joke when it comes to their breakfast. Granted, I didn't try all of the breakfast items, but everything that I had from here was very good. From the pastry to the coffee and entrees.

Honestly, I was looking through Yelp reviews to decide what to order and while it didn't help much, I ended up ordering the Oeufs Benedict which was excellent. The taste of Hollandaise sauce with the runny egg on top of the pork loin and English muffin all paired perfectly in your mouth. I could easily order another one if I wasn't full as it's so good. The beighnets were also delicious as they went well with the jam and chocolate. Coffee was of good quality and a good complement to the sweet pastries.

The negatives: I won't go back here, especially if I don't stay at the Venetian. There's no need. The food isn't good enough to make this place an out of the way place to eat. Even if I'm on the strip.

My advice is to make a reservation, not because of a wait time, but because, its a great feeling to sit in the corner tables, and not in the middle, simply because its just more comfortable. They, of course, start bringing you the bread I mentioned in my last review. One nuance I noticed was the bread man was very serious about his table-setting, table-clearing and general discourse in the provision of services. He'd bring bread and have this focused look on his face. I'm always watching people working in restaurants to figure out what their work environment is like. He seemed tense and even perturbed when the main waiter brought us bread but didn't put it on the correct side of our place mats. He gave him a condescending glance after he cleared crumbs from the table with a little metal scooper object. Haha! Co-worker drama at a high end restaurant! But only because he wanted things to be perfect, and I respect the level of artistry put into anything in this life.
We had oysters and after I had a fish plate and she had something I can't remember. The surroundings, the service and beating the rush made this another unforgettable experience.

The food, the ambiance, and service has been consistently good.  And while I know there will never be a substitution for sitting in a bistro in Paris at midnight and enjoying a cafe, there are alternatives and this spot does it for me each and every time.

This most recent visit afforded me a breakfast stop before I headed out to Valley of Fire.  

I sat at one of the high tables across from the bar and ordered: Eggs Benedict, coffee, and for desert, their Crème Brûlée.  During the course of my meal, my coffee (very delicious) was topped off numerous times and they brought over the Pain D'Epi, a bread so simple yet amazingly soft with a crunchy exterior, I died and went to heaven.

I am not a Benedict fan because most of the places I have ordered from use the traditional ham which is dry, salty, and tasteless.  Bouchon uses Hobb's smoked pork loin, which almost looks like shaved meat but it was so tender, savory that the combination of all of the flavors was amazing from the first bite to the last.  It came accompanied with a large frisée salad.

First of all, when we arrived, they told us our table was not yet ready (although we looked around and saw plenty of empty tables), so they sent us to the bar. Actually, 4 out of 6 of our party arrived first and then the other 2 arrived 20 minutes later.  After waiting 15 minutes, I inquired with the hostess who said that all of our party must be present to seat us.  I called the other two who said they were on their way and would be there in just a few mins. Still, the hostess would not seat us.  Then, when they arrived, I informed the hostess, but we still had to wait 2-3 mins before being seated. It was pretty ridiculous at this point. I informed a waiter who was next to the hostess stand and finally he sat us.

Waitress was fine but was handling a bit too many tables at once, imo.  The five others at my table ordered various soups and I had the warm goat cheese salad and my cheese was not warm at all, so I sent it back (note- I can't remember the last time I have sent something back--- maybe 5-7 years ago).  All I wanted was for them to warm the cheese.  Anyway, the waitress forgot about my starter and I didn't get my salad until 20 minutes later, after everyone had finished their soups.

For main course, my colleague and I ordered the Moules au Saffron. It was ok, but about 15 of the moules were not fully open or were closed, indicating not fresh.  There was an ample amount of mussels, so that was ok, i guess, but if you had wanted to share, that would have been an issue.  The dish came with a side of fries and the fries were AWFUL (and I'm a french fry connoisseur).  They were LOADED with salt (as if someone in the kitchen had poured salt on the fries for entire 20 minutes they were warming my goat cheese), and i don't think they were using fresh oil to fry them either because the fries got quickly soft or stale. Anyway, we did not eat them at all- we couldn't they were simply way to salty.

I cannot comment on dessert- we did not order that.  Anyway, I have dined at Bouchon several times but will not come back here for awhile b\/c last night's experience was so terribly disappointing.  Maybe they have become lazy or so franchised that the quality has dipped? I dined in their Napa location last year and it was just fine, and I dined in their Vegas location last year and it was pretty good, but the Vegas one seems to be going downhill each time.  

If they made a few little tweaks, it would get better again.  But, remember, if you order the warm salad, don't expect it to be warm (get the soups instead) and if you order the fries, ask them to hold the salt!",0,0,0

She, of course, ordered a whole lot of expensive nothing, and then had the waiter take her picture  with her unimpressive looking plates.  She wins the award for most vapid person we saw in Vegas that weekend.

Bouchon Bistro is difficult for me to really pin down.  We came for breakfast, by the way, so if you're looking for a review to help you on your quest for lunch or dinner you should keep scrolling.  Bouchon is French, and therefore expensive, but at the same time it was actually really good food.

Our waiter was nice, not super attentive and disappeared briefly but nothing terrible.

Food:

-Chicken and Waffles: My wife ordered this.  She was enjoying it a lot more than I expected she would.  It was some of the best-cooked chicken she had ever had and the waffles were also cooked well and not too sweet.  While I can echo these sentiments to a degree (the chicken had a crisp skin while staying moist inside), I determined whilst eating it that I simply don't care much for chicken and waffles as a dish.  I don't know how or why that is, but it is.

It's like someone looked at Eggs Benedict and said, ""Yeah, I see what you're doing.  But it's wrong, try it this way.""  It was nothing but crunchy, savory, eggy goodness and I enjoyed every second of it.  It also came with a pile of French fries.  Just a pile.  A big pile.

We made a reservation via opentable.com and arrived early. The entrance through the Venetian was a treat! Just spectacular decor inside the restaurant as well, I just couldn't help taking a picture or two. True to its French roots, the interior is antiqued tile, wood and brass. Chalkboard specials and paper menus made the interior warm and approachable. Greeted by a very friendly wait staff, we waited for our table at the bar, where I had one very amazing cocktail. My boyfriend sampled what he called the ""best manhattan in Las Vegas."" 

Russell was our waiter and he was so kind and made everything on the menu sound decadent (which i'm positive it is). Highly recommend the Cotelette de Porc (pork chop) and the Coquilles St. Jacques Poeles (scallops), but what blew us away was the Salmon Rillettes appetizer. I could have licked the container! 

I really can't think of a better experience. You can be sure that I'll be back again next time I'm in Vegas. I also can't wait to try the Yountville location. Maybe someday I'll make it to French Laundry. I'm sure it'll be a religious-type of experience.

I had the Sourdough Waffles.  I don't really understand what all the excitement is regarding the vanilla bean butter.  It didn't taste like anything.  Honestly I wasn't blown away by the waffles either.  They weren't bad but I have had comparable ones at local diners.  

The bf had one of the specials.  I don't remember what it was but he said it wasn't too great and he was still hungry after our meal.

We also ordered the fries to split.  I really only ordered these because so many people raved about it.  Now I'm beginning to think that people were just being sarcastic.  They are just regular fries.  Mickey D's makes them better.  The frozen ones you buy at the store to fry up at home taste better.  We didn't finish them and one of the busboys said, ""No one ever finishes the fries.""

What I did like about Bouchon was the atmosphere.  It was so nice to have brunch in such a beautiful setting.  We sat indoors because it was a little windy that day but I would definitely opt to sit outside if the weather is right.  It looked really pretty out there.

The inside decoration is clean and modernly French cafe vibe.  Cream colored walls, clean white tables, simple black chairs and large black french window panes looking out to the patio dining area.  

After your order is taken, a warm epi bread is placed on the table with sweet creamy butter and fresh cherry jam.

The chicken and waffles come with a vanilla bean butter, a gravy boat and a maple syrup boat.  The waffles are deliciously savory and have a great crunch.  

I also liked the sourdough waffles with strawberries.  There is a slight sour kick and goes perfect when paired with the vanilla bean butter and maple syrup.  

The croque madame was also wonderful.  The brioche bread is toasted with ham and cheese in the middle.  A fried egg, sunny side up, is placed on top and overloaded with sauce mornay.  The side of pomme frites is quite large and quite possibly not a 'side'.

I really had to examine the pics I took to refresh my memory of that dinner, as it was not very memorable.  Let me start with the good:

- a chef friend loved the puff pastry escargot

Shit, I'm at a loss! I just sat for a good 5 minutes scrolling back through pics to put something good down about that dinner, avoiding the obvious ""in good company"" (we were celebrating a friend's bachelor party that weekend, so in high spirits).  But I really was unimpressed.

The carpeting seemed drab, though the lighting was a warm yellow glow.  I got sleepy just looking at the pics of dinner.  I am careful not to say romantic though, cause it didn't feel that way to me... more like ""old.""  Yea, if I was 62 and wanted to enjoy a quiet, civilized dinner with my wife, this is the spot.

Keller has a knack for inadvertently downplaying the excellence of this place as it focuses on ""simple, everyday"" food, and yet it is possibly more impressive than the haute cuisine at his other places specifically BECAUSE of that.

My waiter noticed I still looked hungry and offered another appetizer (at full price, of course.) I ordered the French Onion soup after hearing my banquette-mates exclaim goodness. I should have passed. It was very salty (and far below the high soup standard set the day before by Mon Ami Gabi in Harrah's Paris.)  The salmon came and it was sauteed on one side until crispy. I was surprised at the level of cooking since I had ordered it rare. It was actually still mosit in the center, buy the crispyness seemed to dissipate most of the flavor. The fish itself was unseasoned and a little salt would have helped liven it. Unfortunately, a saltshaker is not an option on the table.

Our wine was a simple Chablis - just a village wine by a well known producer - Christian Moreau. Perhaps $30 in a wine shop - about $85 on the wine list.

Our waiter ignored us and we asked another waiter  to bring them and they were cold. No waiter to be found to ask for hot, a busboy finally warmed them up with some regular coffee.

Seafood are flown daily from the bay area. For those of you that are not from the beautiful San Francisco, this is a great place to sample some of the best freshness this city have to offer. The seafood plateau looks absolutely amazing but even the petit version could be quite a challenge to finish. 

Entrees were all likable. Our server recommended Blanquette de Lotte (roasted monkfish) saying it is one of their most popular dishes. Strangely, I found the monkfish texture a little dry and the sauce rather ordinary. Gigot d'Agneau (roasted leg of lamb) was very tender and flavorful. It is difficult not to enjoy a lamb dish that is cooked to the perfect temperature. The highlight of the night was actually the Poulet Rôti (roasted chicken). The meat, even the usually drier breast pieces, was moist and tender. The skin was perfectly crispy. 

It was a shame I was too full to try their dessert. 

Food was very good overall but nothing out of the world spectacular. Some might even consider the food pretty pricey for what you get but hey, this is Vegas.",3,4,3

So on with the sin city branch.  Went there for Sunday brunch, the decor looked just like the Yountville restaurant except of the pool\/garden view (very nice).  I was sooooo excited because it's been a while since we've visited Napa and I was craving some boudin noir.  But to my disappoinment they did not serve the black peice of heaven.  So I went ahead and ordered my second favorite thing on the menu -- croque madame and my significant other ordered the corned beef hash.  Both dishes were very good.  I haven't tried the corned beef hash before but the croque madame was just as good as I remember it.  Now for the bad part....... the bread, I don't know if it's because the bakery has to also serve the stand alone counter in the hotel but to me the bread was just not the fresh warm delicious piece of carbo-candy I remember.  So for the bread and also for the fact that they didn't serve the my favorite dish, I had to knock one star off vs. the Yountvill location.  But overall the food was still very good.",0,0,0

If you want to skip the rest of the review, just go to Bouchon and find out yourself.  The food ranges anywhere from very good to amazing and the prices are very reasonable.  My trips to Vegas would not be complete without a trip to Bouchon for at least brunch.  

I highly recommend the chicken and waffles.  A Half-chicken served with three waffles, chasseur sauce, and syrup.  The waffles are quite good.  Cooked with bacon and chives, they are crispy on the outside and light on the inside.  As for the chicken, I don't know if you can roast chicken any better than that.  The skin was crisp and the meat was deliciously flavorful and juicy.  If that isn't enough, the savory chasseur sauce on the side combines with the chicken to produce nirvana-inducing results.  I cannot stress how good this chicken is.  

As for the other things I have tried here:

Mussels - Highly approved, very fresh.  Their selections of sauces to go with the mussels are also very good.

Hamsteak - What was I thinking?  (I probably wasn't) The worst thing I've eaten here.  It was okay but too salty for me.

A daily special salmon dish - The sauce was so good that I just wanted to lick the plate after the fish was gone.  

Oh, if you happen to be a fan of pastry, you're in luck as well.  They have great pastries.  In particular, I'm a fan of the creme beignets.  I only had it once (it was offered as the daily special for the day) and these little pieces of fried dough filled with cream and covered in sugar should be illegal.  If that is a little too decadent\/sweet\/creamy for you, then the macaroons, crossaints, and tarts are all pretty good.  If you're wondering how I've managed to try all the pastries, they screwed up our order once, and to compensate, gave us enough pastries to fill ourselves for lunch AND dinner (never mind that I had ordered the Chicken and Waffles as well).  

As for the service, it's pretty hit or miss.  I've had very good service at Bouchon, and there have been times where the waiter conveniently forgets about us for long periods of time and forgets to refill our waters despite walking by ten different times.  It's okay, the food will more than make up for it.",0,0,0

The restaurant is located on the 10th floor of Venetian.   It's pretty easy to find because there are security guards scattered all around in the hallways on the way in.  The outdoor dining area was closed because it was summer and too hot.  It was beautiful though - with fountains and all.  You can see people swimming further back in the outdoor area as well. 

I had the eggs, bacon, potato croquette, and toast.   The toast is amazing.  Perfectly toasted all around.  I'm sure you're asking ""how good can TOAST be?""  Just try it.. You'll know what I mean.  The bacon was nice and crispy.  The eggs were okay (1 poached and 1 scrambled).  Potato croquette is def. worth the try! Crispy on the outside and super creamy on the inside.  The BF loved it. $13

I also had the French Toast with my breakfast.... It is definitely NOT your typical French Toast.  It tasted more like a big bread pudding topped with caramelized apples, bananas, & powdered sugar.  It was way too sweet for the BF but I loved it.  I wish it had more of a pastry texture though.... Kinda tasted TOO much like just pudding - which ended up feeling way too heavy.  There was no way we could finish it.. $13

The BF had the corned beef hash and eggs.  The corned beef wasn't grounded and were cut into cubes. The beef was slightly tough too.. I think cause of the way they were cut up.  I liked it overall but I wish it came with more hash potatoes.  He wasn't too impressed.. But I'm sure he was being picky cause he expected it to be perfect.  $18",3,0,2

Once the entire crew was there, we were seated immediately in a private room (1st star).

I didn't have much of an appetite so I skipped on the starters and picked at the tasty fresh bread, playfully dipping it in the olive oil vinaigrette I drizzled on my plate.  The menu came and I figured I'd order the Croque Madame since anything with a fried egg is DELICIOUS when I'm recovering from a wild night before.  Ironically, I decided to sip on a Pinot (or two) while waiting for my sandwich, LOL.  When the waiter arrived with my dinner, I was like... (wait for it, wait for it...)

""HOT DAYAAAMN, THIS AIN'T YO' MOMMA'S HAM & CHEESE!!!"", oops.. Let me turn down my OAKLANDISHNESS! This really isn't your typical ham & cheese, I was expecting a posh posh portion that was suppose to be plated like some sort of art deco architecture.  Instead, I was bestowed with a behemoth of fries hovering over ham and oozing cheese perfection topped with a sunny side up egg.  Was it as good as it looked!?

THE PLACE
The restaurant environment and vibe is really great. It was homey, it was upscale and it was really clean and organized. It makes you feel like you are in Paris and not in Las Vegas. The place is easy to be found and they have big table for groups. 

THE FOOD
For me, the food is really good. I went there for brunch and they have a lot of different kind of food. As we went there in a big group, we were able to order a lot of different kind of food, thus allow me to taste a lot of them. For me, I ordered the Croque Madame. i have eaten Croque Madame in different places, and this one is the one on top of my list. The presentation is beautiful and the toast is really soft, plus, when you eat and put the food in your mouth, it melts in your mouth and the combination of the toast, the ham and the egg plus the sauce is just out of this world. The corned beef hash is also super great. It blends in your mouth. One of the primary highlights is their homemade. You MUST order the jam. It was not too sweet, but the taste is really soft and nice. I can even eat it with nothing and only the jam.

THE SERVICE
The service is fast, and our server was really nice as she kept on asking us whether we need anything or not and when we asked her to bring something, she did not delay it and always came back with a smile on her face. The service is just extraordinary. They were super friendly and they were also willing to take care of the splitting the bills which are a little bit complicated as there were about 12 of us.

THE PRICE
The price is acceptable for brunch. Although it may be a little bit expensive, but the portion they gave is suitable with the price. Plus, it was located in Venetian. I can also taste that they are only using the freshest and expensive ingredients for the food, so, overall, the food was worth the price.

P.S: At the end, they gave us free 15% discount for the bakery. Superb!",0,0,0

We had reservations but we got there early and hung out at the bar to have a few drinks before dinner.  Be sure to let the host\/hostess know you are here as they may be able to bump your reservation earlier. Bartender and staff were super attentive with providing you a drink menu and if you have any questions. Staff is very good at recommendations and if you don't know what drink you want, they will make something for you. 

As our reservation time was near, we were able to sit at our table early for dinner. One of our work colleagues is quite knowledgeable about wines so he ordered the wine for us. According to him, they do have a nice selection of wines and our French waiter was super helpful in suggestions as well. I think they may have a sommelier on staff too (guy in suit) that also helped make recommendations for us. We ended up ordering 3 bottles of wine for the entire dinner.  *buzzzzzz*

Bread is provided before dinner and as we selected our appetizers and entrees. We got the Grand Plateau seafood tower that had lobster, oysters, shrimps, clams, mussels and crabs. It tasted wonderful & fresh. Wonderful house dipping sauce, cocktail and mignonette comes with it as well. We couldn't get enough as we fought over who would get the last few remaining items on the tower. 

As for our mains, majority of the group got the popular Steak Frites entrée but I decided to try their Daurade (like sea bass) special they were offering that night. Comes with a ratatouille on the bottom. Fish was cooked very well with the crispy salty skin. 2 good sized fillets were given so it was plenty for dinner. 

I was pretty stuffed so I only had a few bites of the desserts they ordered that included crème brulee, this tasty crepe dessert and some French fruit tart. All was very good and perfect way to end the dinner.  

Service was fabulous, they know every little detail, super attentive but not overbearing, they pretty much notice everything when you are eating. All were very friendly and super helpful and made our dinner that much better.

Escorted to table where we met our server who was a simply wonderful woman (if TK's looking - African American 20-something) who really knew her way around the large menu and gave us great pointers.

The Petit Plateau (cold seafood platter - $65) was great - wonderful oysters especially, plus great lobster in addition to mussels and clams.  Nice shared dish for the four of us.

I have the Thomas Keller French Laundry cookbook and have been dying to try his food.  I do understand that he's not actually back there working the kitchen, but with his name attached to it I am going to have high expectations.  Unfortunately our tab was extremely high, our service sucked, and not all of the food was on point.  For the price paid, the food should be mind blowing exceptional, and it just was not.  Had the service and food been impeccable, the price would not b an issue.

First off, we waited forever to be seated.  I mean like 45 minutes when they told us it would be a half an hour.  We were starving.  When I went to the hostess table to ask about the wait, I was ignored by multiple people working the hostess station. 

Our waitress was super passive aggressive.  She ignored me when I tried to flag her down after we had made our initial order, because we decided to add an order of escargot as an appetizer.  I had to ask a busing staff to add it to the order because even though she saw me motion to her, she ignored me and never came back, until much later to say she added it to our order.  I also asked for raw sugar and she forgot and I had to ask her again after waiting a good while.  

There were definitely some high points though, such as the complimentary bread with butter and apricot jam-amazing.  The escargot was delicious, but I've never had bad escargot, or escargot that tasted incredibly different from any place I've ordered it.  This escargot was prepared in a very classic manner with lots of garlic and butter, and topped with puff pastry.  It was excellent and we were happy to sop up the leftover garlic and butter with the bread on the table.

One thing that I was annoyed with was the water situation.  I think it's absolutely insane to charge $7 for water from a spigot in the back that's put into a bottle and refrigerated before serving.  It was not a sealed bottle of water, which I could understand if the price was higher, or had it been sparkling water.  The other thing is she continued to bring our table more water, without asking, and of course we got charged for all three bottles of water brought to the table.  I just find it insane that the water cost more than my coffee, and let me tell you, it tasted just like the nasty water from our hotel room, only chilled.  Do not order the ""flat"" water, it is not worth the insane price tag.

We went during ""brunch"" time, so I wanted to try the ""french toast.""  It's an apple french toast that is more like a french toast-bread pudding hybrid.  It was gorgeous, and the thinly, and perfectly sliced apples on top were tart, sweet and delicious.  The french toast itself was under-seasoned and bland.  I had to actually add salt to it, which I know sounds crazy, but it needed it.

My one friend ordered a mushroom omelet, which was very small and also under-seasoned.  I also thought it would be a french style omelet, but it wasn't.  It came out as a thick, but small, folded in half, American style omelet.   It also came with a huge mound of perfectly crispy bacon that had to have been deep fried, but tasted heavenly.  

Next friend had the special of the day, a ""BLT"" Benedict.  The Benedict consisted of a house-made split English muffin.  It was tiny.  The hollandaise on top was very thin and lacked a full flavor hollandaise should have.  The Bacon was fine, but the lettuce was iceberg.  I was underwhelmed by the pale white iceberg and thought something like butter lettuce would have elevated this dish much more.  The tomato was halved cherry tomatoes.  I think a nice slice of an heirloom tomato would also have been a better choice.  This dish also came with a small side of home fries that were perfect and delicious.  Even with the house-made muffin, I do not feel this dish warranted the $26 price tag.

Last friend ordered the Banana Waffles.  t comes with nuts, but she asked for no nuts.  The waitress asked if she was allergic.  She said no, but I do not like them.  Of course the food was dropped off quickly by someone other than our waitress, and by the time we realized the the waffles were covered in nuts, there was no one to flag down.  We finally asked for the waffles to be switched out, but by the time waffles without nuts were brought out, we were all done with our food.  To make things worse, the waffles were cold.

So, we're glad we followed both the recommendation of acquaintances and our own instincts to choose Bouchon (at the Venetian) for breakfast one morning rather than the buffet at another hotel.  Having enjoyed dinner with at Bouchon in Napa with friends a couple of years ago, we were expecting good things at this Bouchon Bistro.  Our expectations were met.
 
No need to recite the menu as the web site provides a good view of it.  But worth sharing that the smoked salmon and baguette choice was wonderful.  The salmon was perfectly seasoned, the crusty bread top notch and the chive cream cheese and capers the perfect partners.  At about $14 for this salmon selection, we thought it was a good deal as Las Vegas goes, in particular factoring in the quality of the food, the service and the lovely setting.  We also had a delectable almond brioche pasty and some perfectly cooked bacon.  Really good coffee too...and bet you won't find THAT at a buffet!  

As an observation, the pastries here are really, really good...but we think the ones at Jean-Phillipe (pasty and chocolates) just off the lobby in The Bellagio are better.  Unfortunately, you have to stand in line at Jean-Phillipe and seating is at tables lining the public spaces at The Bellagio.  You may not be able to eat the lovely ambiance at Bouchon, but somehow it did make that almond brioche taste even better!  (That said, don't miss Jean-Phillipe for pastries. They ARE worth standing in line for.) 

There are lots of good photos of Bouchon as posted by others to help underscore just how lovely this is.  Light filled from big windows.  On a warmer day we'd be tempted to try the terrace seating.

Did we say ""lovely"" yet to sum up this experience? :-)

We put Bouchon in a tie with Hash House A Go Go (but only the OFF STRIP location)  for the best breakfast in Las Vegas.  Two very different dining experiences, but each really great  ones.  You'd be missing out if you didn't try them both.  Seriously.",1,1,1

Okay so I've been here several times over a span of years. Been to other Thomas Keller spots- other Bouchons, French Laundry,etc. and I am such a big fan of that man. I hope he's there when I dine so I can try to shake that man's hand. 

With that said, I still review it with the food in mind. I'm more critical of chefs I like actually and he lives up to what I enjoy. 

I'm a freak about pates, mention this in every spot that offers it and I can always be bought out happily with that, but it's the other stuff that brings me back.

Everything else was exceptional.

Appetizer- I love the pork belly sausage with anise.This was a wonderful sausage and I really like the dates and vinegrette pair with it.

Main- I've had a leg of lamb with beans dish and a duck breast au poivre and both were executed nicely and cooked right.

Dessert- Caramel Creme and Pot De Creme. Simple and hits the comfort food part of my soul. 

I mostly come here for brunch.

Love the Croque Madame, quiches have been flaky and flavorful, and the mussels served with fries are wonderfully  fresh mussels with a nice saffron wine sauce. The whole thing about his fries being the best- these are good fries but its debatable if its the best...on the other side of the casino is Pinot Brasserie and I favor their fries more. To each their own- there is no ""best"" out there but the ""best"" to each our taste. Chicken and waffles were good but its not FRIED chicken which I looooveee...separate elements each are yum, but together I can't get past roasted chicken...but the chive and bacon waffle is awesome! . 

I have no complaints about service. It is decent and hasn't slipped up much. Still it's not the best and the Bouchon Beverly Hills staff is a lot more friendly and attentive to me....and the Napa Bouchon is the friendliest of the Bouchons. 

This is a recommended spot when people ask me about where to brunch on the strip. I support it by being a Keller fan, I stand by it because it's solid.",3,4,1

On the disappointing side, the plate of olives at the beginning was way too salty and the deviled eggs had shells in them, and not just the inevitable one here or there. If we can trust the soccer mom at the picnic to take the time to wash off the egg shell, we can expect at least that from Chef Keller. We also tried the specialty risotto, with short ribs and marmalade, and they way over did it with the marmalade (overwhelmingly sweet) and the short ribs were unpalatably tough (almost like it was candied). The dish was unbalanced, with no perceptible wine acidity, as advertised. We could only eat half of an appetizer portion. And although the poulet roti, one of the signature dishes, was well-cooked, it lacked character and was a little too salty and otherwise kind of bland. But that was the best thing of the night. 

On a positive note, there are a lot of nice touches - a trickle down from Keller's better restaurants - such as warm pistachios and epi. The Bouchon cocktail was great.

They were definitely much bigger than expected though...we were already kind of full before our savory orders came in!

Since we did a lot of drinking the previous night, we all felt like some eggs.  I got the croque madame, which is absolutely the perfect hangover food with the fried egg and sauce on top, and fries on the side.  Nothing like fried starch and fatty food to get rid of that hangover!  I had a taste of the quiche and the omelette as well, but I liked my dish better!

I have to say I was a bit disappointed by the bellini...it just didn't taste as good as it did the first time I went here.  There's more juice now compared to the bubbly, and it seems like the bubbly they use isn't as good quality.

It was a gorgeous morning as we made our way up the elevators. It's in a weird spot, but super easy to get to from the self parking garages. We were promptly seated on the patio. It featured a really cool little courtyard with a neat view of the hotel, since you're basically on a rooftop terrace in the middle of it.

We were not super impressed with their drink menu and had to ask if they had regular mimosas, for us basic girls. They did indeed but didn't include them on the menu, they only put their fancy drinks on there we were informed. We ordered an assorted pastry basket and some beignets because that's how we roll. We were informed by our waiter that they were established as a bakery so we definitely made a good decision. He gave us some choices and we settled on a cheese danish, some raspberry beignets, a chocolate almond croissant, and a cinnamon roll. The danish was meih, it wasn't traditional, was super flaky, and had a pile of frosting like cheese on top. I quickly moved on to the beignets, they were good but more like raspberry filled donuts, I wouldn't call them beignets, I mean they had granulated sugar on top, not even powdered sugar! The cinnamon roll was good, but would have been better heated. The surprise of the century for me was that my favorite pastry was the chocolate almond croissant. I could have easily eaten three by myself, but I settled for about half, since I had to share with 3 other ladies. The pastries were good, but not amazing. They were delivered with some fresh baked bread. The bread was delicious and I loved that it looked like leaves on a stem, it was easy to rip off a hunk for yourself. 

We moved on to real food! The omelette of the day sounded amazing, but I really wanted some fries so I settled on the Croque Madame. It was delicious and I scarfed it down without complaint. The fries were also great, just a little over salted for my tastes, but I love a good fry.

The first time, one of my fellow diners got the gnocchi, and unless you like French gnocchi, you will be confused and disappointed.  The waiter this time talked one of the people I was dining out of the gnocchi, and she should forever be in his debt.

For starters, we had the cod brandade, which was excellent, their olives, which had a lovely herbal note to them, and the charcuterie platter, which was a little too much sausage, but just wonderful.

We then had salads, with the warmed goat cheese, which provided a nice sweetness to the bitterness of the salad. It had a touch of fennel in the dressing, which also brought a sweetness to the dish.  It was very well balanced for a salad.  

My dinner was the flap steak special. It had the thickness of a filet, but about double the size on the actual steak. It was tender like a filet, but juicy like a rib eye.  A fantastic cut of meat, though the swiss chard bed it sat on was rather on the salty side.

We all had desserts, most getting the chocolate mousse. I personally had the creme caramel, but the table also shared a tarte citron, which was probably the best dessert they offered up.

Service: our waitress was a nightmare. She was sooo stressed out and gave that stress to us to enjoy for the rest of the day. She was so rude and impatient when we asked her questions about the menu. They brought us the wrong food first, and then turned out it was for another table. the last straw was when we gave our credit cards to the server and she came back with one. She put all the bill on one card and said she has no idea about the second one. We freaked out. We had a car rental reservation and we already late. She disappeared for 15 minutes and we didnt even know her name. She finally showed up with our card in her hands. Only god knows where she'd dropped it.

Bouchon provided an accessible way to do so.  My husband and I had dinner here two nights ago for our anniversary.

The space is large but warm and beautiful.  I think the tiled floor is gorgeous.  The restaurant is on the tenth floor of one of the Venetian's towers, removed from the casino, so dining here is not noisy or crazy hectic.

Service was fine; we had a 9:30 reservation and were seated promptly by a serious-faced but efficient hostess.  Our waiter was cut from the same cloth.  He recited the specials carefully but without a smile, which detracted somewhat from our sense of festivity.  Anyhow, whatever, on to the food.

We had the beet salad with apple and horseradish cream, gnocchi a la parisienne (capsules of buttery potatoes and a few vegetables), the spareribs special served with some delicious greens and a cranberry pain perdu (a bit odd) with cipollini onions, and the chocolate bouchon dessert with three ice creams: mint chocolate, vanilla, and hazelnut.  The couple at the table next to ours had the scallop bouillabaisse special and the poulet roti (which the woman raved about).  Other tables ordered huge icy towers of fresh seafood.  The food was beautiful and delicious.  Not transcendent.  Just delicious.

I felt bad enough forcing my boyfriend to take me here, even though his parents forewarned us that it wasn't good. Lesson learned. 

First offense: The drastically sharp change in attitude from the waiter once he discovered we did not want to order appetizers or alcohol. He even resorted to the salesman approach to push more menu items for us to order. I politely declined and he rudely began his a-hole performance.

Second offense: The food was, how do I say, on the grosser side of things? Trout was dry \/ bland, unimpressive and the lamb was so repulsive, as if it had been just sitting all day in the vegas sun light, then cooked until tough and gummy. The flavor actually made me want to vomit and I usually love lamb! The only highlight was the bread. Seriously. Even dessert was just ok -- out of all of the things on my dessert plate, all I enjoyed was the ice cream because you really can't mess up ice cream.

Third offense: The waiter who was completely absent and unreachable during the entire course of our meal--then, he suddenly appears and goes out of his way to grab the bill from under my boyfriend's elbows and to take a look at how much we are tipping. Can we just re-read that and all say WTF?!?! WE WERE ENRAGED.

Fourth offense: The lovely face slapper was that throughout our entire meal and beyond rude service, this very young teenage couple who obviously had hookups and knew someone who worked there had impeccable service and their entire meal (which included a LOT of food) was all on the house. We literally received the exact opposite treatment from them.

Food: I've recently discovered after visiting three French restaurants in Vegas, that I LOVE French food. I love its richness and flavor. The food at Bouchon doesn't disappoint. For hors d'oeuvres, I recommend doing the three cheese tasting. They offer an American and French tasting and both are great. The New York steak is a good entree that is topped with a creamy bordelaise. Lastly, the dessert, for all you sugar addicts, you won't be disappointed! I've tried every dessert offered on the menu and every thing is amazing! My favorite is the Marquise au Chocolat. The creme brûlée is not on the menu but offered as well and is wonderful paired with their late harvest Sauvignon Blanc.

Started off with a clunky server, really scattered and slow. We had to ask for lemons 3 times, asked for a cocktail that never came, we were waiting forever in between courses. It just felt sub-par.

As for food, I will say the salads and the wine were really, really good. The wine list is actually pretty amazing if I am being honest. But that is where the happy times ended. My $44 scallops were totally cold and had sand in them. The steak frites were cold. You read that right, not warm, totally cold to the touch. Which for steak and fries isn't the most appetizing. It isn't appetizing at all actually.  We had to do the unthinkable and send it back to be heated up, and then it went unfinished.

We came here for breakfast around 10am. I didn't expect the place to be so crowded, but I guess it makes sense...it's literally down the hall for some hotel guests. The first thing I noticed was that everything had a very european attitude...including the service. It was a few minutes before anybody came by to get our drink order, nevermind food. Could've been a one-time thing though, who knows. The waiter brought us butter & jam despite the fact that we ordered no bread, or anything else appropriate for it. Staring at it & all the pastry passing by caused us to order a croissant for desert, so maybe that's how they get'cha?

Food:
Quiche of the day: Tomato confit & carmelized onions. My friend said it was probably the best quiche she's ever had. Came with salad on the side...very small portions of each, IMO.
Croquette Madams - I had this, and it was definitely delicious. The entree it self was ""european sized"", but as you can see from pictures above, the side of fries is huge. Both were delicous. 

Espresso:
I guess it's a weird thing to devote so many words to, but at least it's something that's not in the other 400 reviews..
I ordered an espresso before the meal. It came, in the right cup, and was perfectly acceptable for a cup of Illy on the strip, even if it was light on the crema. I finished it quickly, and asked for another, this time a double. The food came before my next espresso, and when it arrived, it was in a cup more suitable for an americano. I know it happens sometimes when you want a double, no big deal, but the espresso wasn't right. It might have just been that it wasn't hot, but it was off enough that I sent it back and asked for another. I even offered to take a single if the barista wasn't confident in pulling a double. After a slightly shorter, but still long wait, my new cup arrived. Same size cup, this time holding what looks to be a single shot. The waiter explained that he made it himself, but he'd be happy to take it back again if it wasn't right. It did taste better than the prior one, and although it still wasn't very hot, I kept it. I don't have it in me to be that guy that sends back 2 espressos. 

The bill was about 50USD, and overall, we were happy with the meal. The food was delicious, and the service could've been better, but it wasn't that bad. Maybe we were easy to overlook it because we were in a good mood, or maybe we were critical because we had other things we wanted to do afterwards.

I never made it out to The French Laundry when I lived in the Bay Area so I've been wanting to try this place ever since I watched the No Reservations: Vegas episode. I thought that it would be perfect to do my 100th review Anthony Bourdain style. I came here with a few of my favorite yelp-izzles. LiLy D, Elnino F, and Angela H made this dinner hella damn fun!

Our server Michael, was awesome. He had the specials memorized and kept us entertained with jokes throughout the night.

What I ordered:

Salmon Rillettes $17.50
Steak Frites $36.50
Sauteed Spinach $7.50
1 Bottle of Cabernet - France 2007 $48

There are no bread plates, so you just eat off the table. The bread comes out warm and was very good. They also give you some warm pistachios. 

The Salmon Rillettes were my favorite dish of the night. It is fresh & smoked salmon served with toasted croutons. I think LiLy might have liked that dish more than me. I also had some of LiLy's Onion Soup and I like that too. I have a bite of Elnino's Endive Salad. 

The Steak Frites was cooked to perfection. It is a pan-seared prime flatiron steak with caramelized shallots, maitre d'hotel butter & french fries. I originally asked for my steak cooked rare, but changed it to medium-rare as suggested by our server. Great suggestion Michael! The Sauteed Spinach was good too. I had a few pieces of LiLy's lamb. It was a little salty, but still good. I had a piece of Elnino's scallop, which was yummy. I also had a bite of Angela's chicken, which was also yummy!

The wine was a good choice. Nice pick LiLy!!

I would not recommend it for an intimate, sexy dinner, you wont be able to hear each other talk.  I was with my cousin so I was fine with it not being sexy.  

The waitstaff were professional, pleasant, and the dinner was well paced.  

The bread and butter were fabulous!  I love creamy good butter, very few places serve it a little soft, so it spreads easily.  

We had:
Salted pistachios - eh, they are nuts, whatever.
Rillettes of salmon - comes in a jar with clarified butter on top to preserve it, it was fantastic.  Good flavor and texture, served with toast, it was a great way to start the meal.
Frisée salad - with hen egg, also delicious, but the frisee needs to be cut smaller, it was awkward to eat.
Mussels- the fries were good, cooked in peanut oil as FYI, and the server does warn you in case there are allergies.  The mussels were just ok.  I found the wine sauce bitter and some of the mussels weren't completely open which makes me worry about freshness.  I didn't get sick, so they were fine, but I didn't love this dish.  I get them at another french restaurant in the wine country in Cali, and there I eat the sauce with a spoon.  I didn't finish my dish here.
Steak - my cousin loved it, and the waiter kindly suggested changing the side from fries to something else, she got spinach and it was very good.  

Overall, with two drinks, two entrees, salad, appetizer, and tip, dinner was just under 200 dollars.  I think it's a very good place for a nice meal, it's not pretentious or snooty, and the food is well made and tasty.",1,1,1

- Spiced Bignet Donuts: really good, better than mini donuts or those donuts you get at the PNE. With this comes the nutella spread or jam...scrape off some of the sugar as it may be too sweet and then spread some jam or nutella.

- Chicken & Waffles: The chicken meat was sooo juicy and tender. Fork a piece of chicken piece and dab it in a bit of gravy sauce...perfecto! The waffles were a mixed batter of bacon and chives....delicious!

- French Toast: not what I expected...it looked like a plate of dessert instead of brunch. This had a layer of cinammon apples which were appetizing. However, the toast wasn't like toast; it tasted more like angel cake. I actually liked the Chicken & Waffles better.

It's a nice dining experience here and in the summer you can eat on the patio that overlooks one of the smaller, more private pools at the venetian (which i did last year).

i ordered the french onion soup, and it was below average. like a 2 on a scale of 10. the cheese was tasteless and too hard. perfect french onion soup has cheese that is melting into the bread and into the soup, but this cheese looked like a slice of kraft processed cheese floating on the soup. because the cheese was so hard and unmelted, it was difficult to scoop it with the bread, onions and broth. sad because the waiter had recommended this.

another dish that has gotten a lot of buzz and that the waiter recommended was the pork shoulder, so 6 out of 8 in our party got that dish. but the pork shoulder was too braised. it was not juicy enough, even when doused in gravy. the root vegetables that came with the pork tasted better than the pork. overall disappointment all around.

Ordered corned beef hash and sausage and eggs (we're not chicken and waffles people unfortunately as the table next to us ordered it and they seemed to like it).  Waited another 10 minutes.

Got the bread, which was good but hard to chew as there was a lot of crust and not much insides.  The raspberry and butter tasted great on the bread.  Almost forgot what we were doing, watched the huge clock on the wall tick another 20 minutes by.

It's like perfection in my mouth. So when I saw that they carried it at Bouchon ala The Venetian, you know that's what I had to have! Better yet, it came in a chocolate form! OMG! 

To be honest, that was the most memorable thing about Bouchon brunch at the Venetian. They recommended a roast chicken and waffles. Call me a snob but I like my chicken and waffles one way and that's greasy and fried from a place called Roscoes in LA. Anything else, no thanks. I opted though to have an omelet because that morning I just had a hunkering for it. DISAPPOINTED! Probably the most uninspired omelet I've ever had in fact.  And although the service was superb complete with like 3 sets of waiters and servers per table (maybe slightly exaggerated).

What I got was exactly what I was looking for and more, bistro style fare served in a great setting, but still laid back enough that I'm not going to knock a slip up here or there. My wife and I sat at the bar after being told that they weren't serving dinner yet, but we could get Hors D'Oeuvres. After a quick glance at their beer selection I chose a St Bernardus Abt 12 (Quad) and proceeded to look at a small menu. We opted to get oysters to split, salmon rillettes, and a croque madame.

When the oysters came out they came with the usual condiments plus one that I was not familiar with. My wife was saying something about how I wasn't going to put anything on my oysters when the bartender interjected saying that the red wine vinagrette was actually quite delicious if used sparingly. I am very glad I took his recommendation. Growing up in New England I'm quite particular about seafood and he might have changed my mind about how to eat oysters. We got three varieties of oyster, which unfortunately I don't remember. Two of the types were absolutely phenomenal, one was average.

The Rillettes aux Deus Salmon were absolutely out of this world. If you're not familiar with rillettes it was similar to pate. Traditionally they would be made using the fat of the animal served, however with salmon they use butter (it's an oily fish, but not particularly fatty) and age them in clarified butter. This was the most jaw dropping part of the meal. I want to immediately make the drive from San Diego to Beverly Hills to get this dish again. If you go for one single thing it should be this. It's a dish that is a little on the expensive side for the amount you get, but trust me on this one.

I had never had a Croque Madame before, so I can't comment on any sort of comparison, but I can say that it was absolutely delicious, oh and served with a pile of the best pomme frites (french fries) I have ever had in my life. If you're worried about spending a lot of money this is the thing to get. It's under $20 (I don't remember the exact price, it might have been under $15) and is a lot of food. 

Bottom line, their beer is too expensive but the selection works very well with the food served. The ambiance is exactly what I was looking for.

Let me preface this by saying I'm a huge Thomas Keller fan and think he is a genius, which is why it pains me that my experience at this restaurant sucked so badly! My gf and I  started off with the Bibb lettuce salad, which was beautiful and very tasty. The lettuce was perfectly buttery and the dish was simple but tasty, although I wasn't the biggest fan of the dressing; she loved it. My friends got the octopus salad, which was definitely the best thing we got the entire night. The octopus was tender, flavorful and perfect according to my friends. I didn't get a complete bite, just a piece of the octopus, but it was outstanding. For entrees, we split three main courses and ate family style, because we all wanted to try different things and save room for dessert. We got the trout, flat iron steak, and roasted chicken and for sides we ordered french fries and the brussel sprouts. To be honest, all five of us were most excited about the french fries, because Anthony Bourdain had gone so ape over it a couple years ago on No Reservations. What a crappy side of fries, one of the worst I've ever had, WTF??!! They were all overcooked and had barely any salt or flavor at all, I totally didn't get what the fuss was all about. The entrees were all mediocre. Definitely not bad or inedible, just entirely unmemorable. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and was obviously a very nice cut of meat, but didn't have a ton of flavor. The chicken was also perfectly cooked, but I kid you not had a subtle banana flavor to it that my friends and I just didn't get either! It literally tasted like the chicken had been sitting next to a plate of old, semi-rotten bananas; I'm sure it doesn't normally taste like that, so maybe we went on an off night. The trout was definitely ""meh."" I've had better trout every other place I've been to and unfortunately just had amazing trout at Gjelina in Venice Beach, so Bouchon couldn't hold a candle to it. The brussel sprouts were also a saving grace as they were perfectly cooked and deliciously paired with the lardon. We were all very disappointed with the meal and agreed we didn't want to waste any calories or money on the desserts, which maybe was a bad call, but oh well. The Bouchon Bakery Nutter Butter is still crack in my opinion and one of the best things I've ever eaten, but unfortunately the Vegas restaurant didn't live up to any of our expectations. The ambiance was nice and I was able to get a reservation a week in advance, so that was also nice. The bread with butter and pistachios that they give you while waiting for your food were also very tasty, but not enough to bump this joint up to a 3 star.

We started out with some Kumamoto oysters on heal shell which were on the small side. They were sweet & slightly briny but not even close in the intensity of flavor to the oysters we get back home from Hog Island (read my reviews). We then got the Terrine de four gras de canard. It was rich, creamy, & just the right amount of saltiness to go with the toast. We had some leftover which I ate with a croissant later in our hotel room...sooo good.

For main course I had the Scottish salmon which was cooked well & the lentils with ox tail was delightful & unexpected. The Boyfriend got the Rib eye steak special with a very nicely cooked steak. The creamed spinach was not too creamed which I liked. All in all, however, it wasn't quite worth its price of $65.

We ordered the French Onion Soup, Eggs Benedict, and the Quiche. 

French Onion Soup: The Comte cheese was absolutely delicious with a rich smoke flavor to it. The flavor of the soup was very rich and yet the soup itself wasn't viscous. Overall, I found the smoke flavor too overpowering to the onion soup and the soup was more salty than I'd like. 

Eggs Benedict: The Hollandaise was perfect, flavorful but not overbearing. The use of Hobb's smoked pork loin was perfect, soft and flavorful.  Other places use Canadian bacon and that tends to be tougher and more salty than I'd like. The English muffin base was perfect! Fresh and soft as you bite into it but there was also some texture and chewiness that was the perfect balance. 

Quiche: It was a spinach quiche that was delicious but nothing mind blowing. The egg and spinach base was a good light balance. The crust was good but was a little soggy by the time I had bites of it (my partner started with the quiche then we traded). 

The mixed greens was a good compliment to both the Eggs Benedict and the quiche as the vinegar based dressing help cut the richness in between bites. 

Overall, I removed a star (in addition to my comments above) because I like my food to be at hot when I get it but it was barely warm by the time I received it. (Not including the Onion Soup). Was it worth the price? I would say so-so with my experience. If it was executed perfectly, I'd say yes, no question about it.",0,0,0

Seating took about 10-15 minutes which wasn't too bad for a Sunday. As soon as we sat down we ordered our drinks (bloody Mary and bellini) and those were pretty quick. The drinks were okay, nothing special. Small and way overpriced (12.50) for the amount you get. We were given some bread and butter with jam. After looking over the menu and trying to pick between the salmon baguette or quiche I settled for the baguette. It is a build your own sandwich kind of dish. When it came out I was happy. There were capers and chives&cream cheese in their own small dish. Then I had lettuce, onions and tomatoes. The smoked salmon itself was slightly oily but sooo good. Instead of making one sandwich I made two open top sandwiches. Very refreshing and light. My boyfriend ordered the omelette Du jour which is the omelette of the day. It was prime rib with mushrooms and cheese. It came with a lot of bacon on the side (you can also choose sausage or ham) and this really distinct toast. The edges were flaky and crispy burnt. I usually don't eat the crust on bread but this one was addicting. The bill came out to about 63 so it's quite a pricey brunch but it's nice to try it once for an experience. They also had oysters and seafood on the menu but they were pricey. I would like to try their dinner eventually.

We put our names down for 6 with our number and was told they'd call us when our table was ready, about 45 minutes. We thought it was a reasonable wait time since it seemed busy. 1.5 hours later and no call, so we go back to the restaurant and checked to see if it was still super busy, and it was NOT. In fact, it was half empty. The hostess ""looked"" and said they called us (total bs), but we never received it. But its ok, we were hungry, we waited, so we were going to give it a shot. I mean, the hostess and her two other hostess friends had to look around and make sure there was actually a table open or a seat available, even then they were debating on a whether to open a table for us. I mean, i guess a party of 6 doesn't fit in your 50 empty tables with no customers after everyone ate and left, your restaurant is dead empty, and you completely forgot about us. Who does that!? Like, hey you don't have a reservation and our restaurant is empty, so we don't know whether we can serve you, but we want to keep our jobs, so we'll try and fit you somewhere in between the 50 empty tables. Thanks a lot ! 

We sat down and looked at the menu and decided to order 3 sandwiches and a salad. 30 minutes later, our sandwiches come out and my friends salad had an interesting interpretation of what a salad was. In my mind, salads usually have lettuce as the base, but this one was more avocado. Probably about 3-5 shredded pieces of lettuce and a giant avocado and filled with chicken and bacon. I guess lettuces are expensive in the humid dry desert. I mean, if it were me, i'd be happy with all the meat, but i'd also like lettuce in my salads. The salad also came without dressing which was even more depressing. No balsamic vinaigrette, so they replaced it with a red wine vinaigrette that was apparently disgusting. Sandwiches were ok, but the plates were filled with some decent fries. If I had to guess, the restaurant ran out of ingredient but not potatoes or fries. 

The service was lackluster and we were left very disappointed. I must also point out that when we entered, the oyster bar \/ mussel bar was also very depressing looking with not so fresh oysters and mussels that looked like they sat there for a decade. Anyways, I'm not going back ever again. I'll just eat at the food court if I want crappy food, at least i'll get good service and a well balanced portion of food. Maybe they'll even serve me lettuce in my salad? Food for thought.

One of the largest servings of French fries I have seen accompany the meal, crispy and flavorful.

It's an excellent restaurant and your taste buds and stomach will thank you for dining here. There many outstanding dining choices in Vegas but Bouchon remains a top choice for cuisine, price, and impeccable service. 

First, the restaurant is difficult to find. It's on the 10th floor of the Venetian Tower. The easiest way is to take the elevators next to the hotel lobby. There's a fancy doorway that leads to the elevators that you can't miss. The walk to the restaurant is beautiful. It's filled with paintings and ornate decorations.

MAKE reservations. The wait is minimal if you do! If possible ask for Gary to be your waiter. HE IS SO SUPER AWESOME. He's been doing this for over 20 years and he's damn good at his job. His recommendations were stellar and his service was the best I've experienced. I came here with a group of 4 so we had plenty to share. If you're a fan of cheese and meats then I highly recommend the charcuterie and fromage plates because they make some or all the meat in house and it is delicious. Especially they bacon wrapped pate with goat cheese . We also got escargot which of course were also ridiculously tasty.

On top of the escargot, charcuterie, and fromage plate, we each also got the onion soup and an entree (steak fries) with the intention of also ordering desserts. Yes it's a lot of food. As I was eating my way through the soup which was the liquid form of the word savory, I was unfortunately not getting full. Side note: The beef jus makes this soup and compliments the sweet onions so well. I had no idea how I was going to continue eating and I really wanted the steak. Like some angel answering my silent prayers, Gary comes by and asks us if instead of getting individual entrees if we instead wanted to share entrees. GARY HOW DID YOU KNOW?! he purposely withheld cooking the steak just yet to make sure we still wanted it after consuming the ridiculous amount of food we ordered for appetizers for 4 people. I've never had a waiter offer to order less food for the sake of my happiness. GARY YOU DA MAN. It also meant we had room for dessert. 

The steak frite was delicious of course. I got to try a little bit of the trout and that was also amazing. I don't think you can go wrong with any dish here. Because Gary saved us, we also got desserts to share! A wonderful lemon tart and creme brulee.

My sis and I decided to grab dinner here during our stay in Vegas this weekend.  She had been here before & loved it, and I trust her judgement.  We arrived around 9:00 and I asked for a table for a party of 2.  The blond hostess looks at me, kind of like she was contemplating whether to seat us or not, says, ""Um okay?"" Then she asks us if we would like to wait at the bar or in the lounge, and I said the lounge, so we proceeded to wait in the lounge.  She did not take down our name, by the way.

As we were waiting, I noticed at least 8 parties roll in after we arrived & get seated before us.  Not okay.  Did we look too young?! Were we not dressed up enough?  

I was livid.  Then I decided that it would be clever to make a reservation for 9:30 right then & there on opentable to see if it would get us seated quicker.  But then around the 10th party that got seated before us & arrived after, I got super pissed off and went up to the guy at the front desk this time and asked him how much longer we'd have to wait to get seated.  The hostess had told us a few minutes and it was now 25 minutes later. He asked for my name, to which I then said, ""The hostess didn't take down our name, and I just made this reservation a couple minutes ago on open table, because I wasn't sure what it would take to get a table."" He immediately said that our table was ready.

The rest of the experience was great.  I LOVED our server. He was so funny and attentive.  5 stars for our awesome server. 3.5 stars for the food. We started off with the beignets.  Delicious, but a bit too salty and I think I tasted alcohol in it.  My sis ordered the trout and I ordered the mussels.  The trout was amazing! It came with toasted almonds and green beans.  Perfectly cooked.  My mussels were good, not great, but good.  Ended the meal with the creme brulee, which was a great choice.

The steak was tender and juicy and cooked just right served with an onion sauce that went well with the steak.  I think the gnocchi was one of the best gnocchi we've ever had.

The mussels with pomme frites were good, but the real star of the meal was the French toast with apple slices on top. It was small at about the size of a muffin but felt and tasted more like bread pudding (as described on the menu). Overpriced but worth it.

The menu says: 
Roasted chicken, bacon and chive waffle,
Tahitian vanilla bean butter, sauce chasseur

My stomach says, ""More please!""  

The waffles have a very very light batter, almost too light.  As you cut into them with your fork they have a distinct crunch as you break the crispy outer edge and continue into the light and fluffy interior that has been peppered with bacon and chives.  It is what normally is a sweet dish and made it savory.  The blend of saltiness and sweet speaks to your tongue in harmony as you lightly dip it into the warm maple syrup served on the side.  I didn't care for the vanilla bean butter but I also couldn't taste the vanilla bean, it was more-so just butter.  

The Chicken was wonderful.  The white meat was a boneless breast cooked to perfection so when you cut into it, the skin crunches and the juices ooze out.  The sauce it came with was nothing to write about except the large bacon chunks in it.  

The only minor complaint would be the price tag.  At $25 it's a little steep but hey, quality over quantity.  It's still definitely worth it.",8,5,6

This French bistro is tucked deep into the Venizia Tower of the Venitian. At one point in the casino, the arrows on the overhead signs point in opposite directions, too, so bring a map.  And prepare for a long walk, whatever you do.  Once, you find it, you indeed feel transported to a foreign bistro, but not necessarily a French one. The Spanish (or Italian?) floor tiles (which are gorgeous) and vaulted ceiling make for a confused but still charming atmosphere. They also offer outdoor seating, which I think must be the reason for the location. Note that it was quite loud despite not being full, too.  Popular with bachelorette parties.

Service from start to finish was outstanding, literally with a smile. My fiance and I were also celebrating our recent engagement, and they delivered a very nice complimentary champagne for her, and a delicious crafted mocktail for me (""temperance"").

Off the bat, the crusty baguette delivered to the table is classic, simple, and delicious. We nearly finished the entire baguette. I had escargot, which came with a fantastic and incredibly garlicky sauce that I could not stop eating; ok so maybe I was the one who nearly finished the baguette. Fantastic presentation, ant the little guys were even wearing tasty puff pastry hats. My fiance had the classic and decadent French Onion Soup. It was absurdly hot, as such soup normally is. But it was also incredibly rich and indulgent. Excellent.

For our mains, we had the mussels & fries, and the roast chicken.  The mussels were outstanding, and I probably could have drank the broth if it weren't frowned upon.  The chicken was a simple and yet elegant preparation, perfectly cooked to provide a crispy skin crust and moist meat below it.

Stuffed from the meal, we passed on dessert, but the menu looked amazing. 

Ultimately, though, the menu and food lacked the wow factor I would expect from Keller.  I realize this is not French Laundry, but his name is on the door for a reason. The menu options were not necessarily what I would consider traditional French cuisine either, aside from the aforementioned soup, escargot, and foie gras.  The service makes up for this, at least.

Let's start with the Sunday breakfast. There were 5 girls and we didn't have to wait long. The food and mimosas were delicious. I had their American egg meal. It was a bit pricey but we knew that going in so the bill wasn't a shocker. 
We left full and happy.

Fast forward about 30 minutes later when I realize I left my sunglasses in the booth. These aren't some cheap sunglasses, they are prescription sunglasses so I need them to see in the hot Las Vegas sun and they were expensive. I called the restaurant and spoke with a gentleman who said he found them and would hold them for me there. 
Since the food was so good we decided to have breakfast there again on Tuesday before our flight home. 

Let's review the food on Tuesday morning. There were 7 of us girls now and not one of us really enjoyed the food that day. I had the French Toast with bacon and it was much too sweet. And the bacon which was really good on Sunday was all fat and oily on Tuesday. 

On the way out I inquired about my sunglasses and they said they don't have them. They looked in a drawer and said they weren't in and they are nowhere to be found. I was upset! I would've came straight back if I thought they wouldn't hold them for me. We also wouldn't have spent another $500 for mediocre food that day. So they told me to try lost and found.
We went downstairs and they didn't have them either. They looked in their log and said that nothing had been logged. Somehow they disappeared or got tossed.

We dined on a Saturday at 7.  It was easy to find (big letters spell out B-O-U-C-H-O-N above an elevator next to the front desk).  The hostesses were friendly and projected nothing but grace and hospitality.  The noise level was what you would expect and want in a bistro, and it was easy to converse across the table.  Table spacing is fine if not generous.  If anything, the noise level helps muffle the neighbors' conversation, and yours from them.  In short, there is nothing about the location, greeting, or seating arrangements that should deter you from visiting.  As an aside, the bar looks great -- beautiful counter, nice stools\/chairs, and attractive wood and mirror fixture on the wall.

Now for the food: stupendously good.  Started with salmon and rillettes, with the salmon presented in a mini-mason jar (or something like that) from which a seal of clarified butter is removed table-side, opening up a truly delicious and generously sized salmon course.  Really quite fantastic.  The fellow next to us said he always orders this when he is in town.  My wife had the onion soup and pronounced it very fine, though frankly I wonder how high can onion soup really fly.  Tommy wants $9.50 for the soup, which seems pretty bold.  Passed on the seared foie gras starter (priced at $29) -- no reason to get carried away.

Had the mussels with pommes frites -- best mussels I have ever had.  Easily 30 mussels, only one dud.  Delicious and piping hot broth.  Fries were very fine, but not really amazing -- I've had better at a few places.  Nice to dip them in the broth.  Wife had the trout, which came with delicious almonds and green beans.  Was a big hit.  Passed on the $48 scallops, which adjoining tables ordered -- looked nice, but $60 bucks (figuring tip and tax) for five scallops and potatoes seemed silly.

Dessert -- ordered three mini-brownies with homemade ice cream on top (three flavors).  Delicious, wonderful, happiness-bringing: I hope to remember them fondly when I'm 100 and getting my dates mixed up.

One odd thing: the waiter.  Nice guy, knew his menu, but a little too casual, a couple of times coming close to the line of I'm-treating-you-casually-because-I-actually-think-you're-a-hick.  He poked me three or four times.  Poke in the side of my arm -- how're we doing here?  Poke in the back -- how's the salmon?  Dude, keep your freaking fingers out of my tendons!  And yet I am sticking with my 5 star rating, because the food was so good.  Bill for  two with starter, entree, dessert, one glass and one half-bottle of wine, and tea\/coffee, including tip, was $200. Worth every penny.  I can't wait to go back, and when I do, I'll ask to sit in the no-poking zone.",2,0,1

That name is Thomas Keller. One of the things that always seems to shine through about his restaurant is the simple fact that he cares. He cares about the food and he cares about his employees. That fact is reflected in every one of his restaurants.

What can I say about the food that the previous thousand reviewers have not. The food is spectacular. I've dined here on a number of occasions and have yet to be the slightest bit disappointed in what I have order. The most recent time I dined here I had the Roulette aux Deux Saumon to start, followed by the Moulles aux Saffron. Let me tell you, the roulette is one of the most spectacular things I have ever eaten. Something so simple has no business being as good as it is. The mussels were nothing to scoff at either. Very delicate, yet flavorful, which was exactly what I was going for after many nights of heavy drinking. 

The service when I came here was phenomenal. So here is my sad little story. I came to dine here by myself as I had an entire day to kill in Vegas before my flight. Often times I feel uncomfortable being a mid-twenties guy eating by myself. I feel that people look at me funny, but not here. The wait staff did an excellent job of engaging with me on a personal as well as professional level. The service was extremely attentive, but not overbearing. They really know how to balance it here. Their intuitiveness is something that I have rarely seen at many restaurants. They seemed to know exactly what I was going to ask for next and already had it prepared. 

Two drinks, an appetizer, and main course ran me about $110 after tax and tip. I feel that price was justified considering what I got out of it. What people often forget about dining is that the price is not just about the food, its about the experience. The experience I had here has only served to solidify that Thomas Keller is my favorite restaurateur. Thank you Bouchon.

Not what you expect when the wait person does not tell you the price but just the specials of the evening.

The food was not spectacular like you'd expect a Thomas Keller restaurant to serve (maybe I just had high expectations) but was still by far excellent.  My husband ordered the steak frites and I thought it was really well prepared.  I had the trout, which also was cooked well, but I felt that I could make both dishes at home almost as good, if I used enough butter.

During my trip to Vegas in March I was excited to go back to Buchon, and to bring friends who had never been before. After hearing me rav about the great food and service, the bar had been set. We had an 7:30pm reservation on a Wednesday night, showed up right on time, and it was packed, not to mention LOUD! I honestly do not remember it ever being so loud here before, we could barely hear the hostess when we were talking to her. 

Our table wasn't ready, and we asked for as quiet of a table as possible, given the noise level. We had to wait about 10 minutes and when we were finally sat down, we had to have been placed at the loudest table in the restaurant- we were a table of 2 in the middle of 3 tables of 6 each. Needless to say, we were not happy, but we were hungry, so we stayed. 

Our waiter was much more interested in the larger groups around us, than in paying any attention to us, so because of that we had no less than 4 different waiters through out the night, one of whom I think was actually a manager. We were served water and bread\/nuts right away, but waited about 25mins for a server (not the one that introduced himself to us) to finally took our drink order. Since we were afraid this new server might not come back, we ordered our drinks, apps, and entrees all at the same time- also worth mentioning, after a long day of flying, we were famished and told the waiter we would like to eat as quickly as possible! 

I ordered an Absinthe (my go to pre-dinner drink any time I'm at a decidedly French establishment). I should've changed my order to wine when the server (now possibly the manager??) asked me to repeat my order (""Absinthe please. ABSINTHE! A_B_S_I_N_T_H_E!!"") 3 times, including spelling it once, and she still looked REALLY confused. 

It took 30 minutes for our apps to arrive, and they still arrived prior to our drinks, which is a big service flaw for me- drinks ALWAYS first, not to mention the crazy wait times. Terrible. The apps were terrible escargot with puffed pastry that was super dry, oily, and flavorless followed by flavorless onion soup. It literally tasted like warm, oily water and the cheese was rubbery.

The drinks finally came (my friend had a glass of Merlot, and then of course my ""Absinthe""), and the Manager lady prepared my drink for me- water, sugar, absinthe- you know the routine. Well, apparently she didn't, because her ratio was way off, and when I told her to stop adding water, she admitted that this was her first time serving\/mixing absinthe. And it showed. 

It was by far the worst drink of my trip, and hands down worst absinthe I've had anywhere in the world. Just nasty. I took two sips and didn't bother to finish it. Had we had a good waiter, or ANY waiter, they would've surely noticed, and asked if there was a problem. 

We finally got our entrees about 1.5hrs after we sat down (An hour after our apps were cleared- no servers checked in with us at all during that time). We were so hungry at this point, that we literally lost our desire to eat. It was just a running joke- you ask for a quiet table, you get the loudest one there. You ask for quick service, you get the worst service ever. 

Then we looked down and realized we never got replacement silverware after our appetizers, so we couldn't eat our $50 entrees even if we had wanted to. Since we had no waiter to check on us, it took another 10 minutes to flag down the water guy to bring us silverware. Such a debacle. 

So by this time our entrees were luke warm at best, and we forced them down. We had such a sour taste after the terrible service all night, we literally just wanted to get out of the restaurant as quickly as possible. 

It took another 35mins once we were done eating to flag someone down to bring us a check, at which point we were so frustrated we couldn't help but start laughing. Luckily we had cash, because we were afraid paying by credit card would take another hour of our night. We paid and ran out of there, totally disappointed by what used to be a GREAT restaurant. I was totally embarrassed as I was the one that suggested Bouchon, and I can guarantee you I will never be back, nor will I ever recommend this place again.

The bread looked like a well-sprouted branch, and the little yeasted knobs that came off of it were delicious with a satisfying crust.

We ordered an array of appetizers and passed them around like a good Asian family.  The table favorite was the salmon rillettes, which were presented in a sealed mason jar opened at our table.  The rillettes were superb, with plenty of salmon character along with lots of fat and moisture.  We spread them on crunchy baguettes.  We also got the small assortment of shellfish, which came with a few varieties of oysters along with shrimp and lobster.  Everything was great - the oysters were fresh and briny, the shrimp sweet and snappy, and the lobster plump and meaty.  The assortment came with cocktail sauce, dijonnaise, and a shallot sauce, all of which were put to good use.  For something green, we ordered an heirloom tomato salad with pesto.  This was simple and lovely with bright, refreshing flavors and some gorgeous tomatoes.  The only appetizer I didn't especially care for was the escargot.  I don't mind eating snails, but these snails were a little bit boring.  They were served with little puff pastries and garlic butter, but somehow the result was unexciting.

The main courses were on the whole less impressive than the appetizers, but they were still very solid.  I ordered the braised beef short ribs special, which came with sweet carrots, potato confit, roasted bone marrow, and sauce bordelaise.  The beef was very good, tender and tasty, and I loved the softened carrots as well.  The bone marrow was fantastic smeared on everything, adding smooth velvet to each bite.  The sauce, though, was kind of overwhelming, deep but rather sweet.  The steak frites was a great, simple dish.  My brother ordered his steak medium and it was a nice even pink, with plenty of juice, and garlic butter on top.  The fries were spectacular, thin cut and crispy on the outside.  My other brother's croque madame and mom's mussels also came with these fries.  The croque madame was delicious but very decadent and hard to eat more than a couple bites of.  This was a fried egg and ham and cheese on toasted brioche, and would have been just right but for a smothering dose of mornay sauce.  The fried egg was a thing of beauty.  The mussels were the only item that I actively disliked.  The broth was fine but the mussels themselves tasted like that overwhelming garbage-like smell that mussels can sometimes have.  My dad's roasted chicken was a high point.  It was moist and juicy, served with caramelized figs, chanterelle mushrooms, pickled ramps, and chicken jus.

For dessert we split the vanilla creme brulee and the ""bouchon,"" which was three little brownies with coconut sorbet, butter pecan, and peanut butter chip ice cream.  The creme brulee was decent, though fairly standard, with a pleasant crackly sugar crust.  The ""bouchon"" was also straightforward but had a lot more sparkle.  The brownies were delicious, with a little bit of crumble but nice dark chocolate density.  The accompanying sorbet and ice creams were also great.

When the meal was over, we were stuffed, with plenty of good food as well as a nice bottle of wine in our systems.  Overall I would say that I wasn't blown away by Bouchon, but I enjoyed our meal and might go back again.  The food wasn't fancy or innovative especially given the price point, but almost everything was precisely executed.  There's a Bouchon where I live and if I'm craving a classic bistro meal, I'll probably check it out.",3,3,4

the vegas team (a.k.a. sesame street) went on a sunday. the service was friendly, and as usual, we enjoyed our meals. despite the steep price-point (considering you can get all-you-can-eat brunch for $6 in vegas), you come to bouchon for great service and well-prepared food. 

here is my recommendation from first to least: 
1. chicken & waffles (mid $20) - probably the best brunch dish i tried on sunday. [even the waiter suggested this is THE popular reviews on ""jelp."" i think he meant yelp.] 

2. salmon baguette ($17) - i ordered this dish. it hit my carb-withdrawl spot! 

3.croque madame (around $20) - toasts w\/ham & eggs, it comes with fries. i'm always in the mood for fries (and they were so good) any time of the day. 

4. corn beef hash (around $20) - i'm sure the quality of corn beef is good, but was a bit too salty for me. the portion is huge though. 

5. beignets ($?) - not sure exactly what they were called, looked like beignets - small round donuts -- came with two sauces, i didn't care for it.

This time in particular I sat outside and throughout the entire brunch we probably only saw our server 3 times.

We were seated and it took about 15 minutes for anybody to even approach us. We saw a male server hitting up all the tables around us except for ours. Finally a woman approaches our table and takes our orders. I asked for a coffee that took a while to get to the table. I decided on getting the corned beef hash with two eggs, which was recommended by our server and although the food came out in a timely manner, I didn't find anything particularly special about this dish.

The best was the salmon roulette which was interesting and unique. The French onion soup was tasty and the broth much thicker\/more flavorful than I've had anywhere else.

The oysters were pretty run of the mill. The frisee salad with egg was good but nothing special. The table bread was fantastic though.

The real disappointment was the main entree - Steak Bouchon for $62. The meat was properly cooked but the quality (and quantity) of the meat just wasn't on par with any real steakhouse. Maybe it's unfair to compare but for $62 at any great steakhouse, you'd get a lot more food and much better taste. The frites were generous in portion though.

After all, I've lived in Las Vegas nearly my whole life and today was my first trip. Being that my heritage is 50% French I feel as though I've been doing myself a disservice of *not* visiting Bouchon. Now that I have been, I will admit, I most certainly want to go back.

Although I was disappointed I am unable to attend their brunch which is served on the weekends only, my friend and I made late breakfast plans at Bouchon on a Tuesday. When we arrived we were told there would be a 10-15 minute wait. I believe our wait was only about 5 minutes. 

We were brought into the dining area which has a large, cavernous feel to it because the ceilings are very high and it is a rather open restaurant. Plus there is plenty of daylight that comes in through the large, glass windows. Overall I enjoyed the feel of the restaurant. The only thing I could comment on negatively was the fact that there was a fine settling of dust on top of the velvet bench cushion I was seated on. However, I'll forgive it, since this is the desert after all.

Our server arrived and offered water, which we both partook of. I informed the server we would be starting with the foie gras (2.5 oz\/$25). It was served up by a gentleman who mumble-bumbled something to us as he scooped the foie gras out and presented our bread. Now, this was my first time eating foie gras so I really have nothing to compare it to, but I thought it was deliciously decadent and had a certain taste of fat\/butter. My friend and I really enjoyed it and noted it got better with each bit of it you happened to eat. We didn't even finish the 2.5 oz container between the two of us.

Our Croque Madames came out and I was pleasantly surprised to see it was quite a large portion of food. After all, paying upwards of almost $20 for a ham and cheese sandwich - I was hoping it would be fulfilling! The best part for me was the amazingly rich white sauce that accompanied the sandwich. It was just fantastic and everything one could hope for in a fulfilling French sauce. After all, sauces are a staple of French cuisine\/cooking. 

As we ate and ate we became fuller and fuller. I left about half of my french fries (which were also very good!) on my plate. I went through about 3 cups of Bouchon's velvety delicious coffee. And lucky for us - our server asked if we would like cups of coffee to go! Hurray! We paid our bill as we awaited our to-go cups.

Chicken and Waffles.  - Glorious.  The waffles have bits of bacon in them and they are amazing.  The Chicken is roasted and not fried.  I have to think that it is better this way because I can't imagine this dish being beat by any restaurant.  You must get this.

French Toast - Looks great but it's not that impressive.  You should try something else.  

Ambiance - I think the restaurant loses a star here.  The decor is dated and the tables too crowded.  There were a couple of single old men sitting by themselves on the small tables and whenever they coughed, I cringed.  Who knows what germs they caught from their respective escorts last night?

Bouchon is slightly hidden from plain sight when walking through the Venetian hotel, so be sure to look out for signs pointing to the elevators. It's located on the 10th floor in the Venezia Tower. Once you find the main hotel registration area just take the elevators to the right and you'll be on your way to a scrumptious culinary journey.

My buddies and I came for Sunday Brunch and barely made the 2PM cutoff. Luckily we got in with a minute to spare and the host was nice enough to prepare a table for our group.

Our meal started off with loaves of bread shaped like a tree branch. I wish the bread was warmer, but it's expected to be luke warm because we got in pretty late. The outside crust was solid and soft on the inside. On the side we had butter and berry jam to go with the bread.

For my main course I really wanted to try the Chicken & Waffles after seeing so many good reviews of it from Yelp. Sadly, they ran out for the day so I went with my second choice: Corned Beef Hash. 

The Corned Beef Hash is served with two eggs any style and toast. The corned beef and potatoes are diced up in perfectly shaped cubes and then the eggs are placed on top covering the Corned Beef Hash. I must say this is probably the best Corned Beef Hash I've had thus far. It wasn't overly salty like other Corned Beef Hashes I've tasted. It was just right and it was perfectly delicious. The corned beef didn't taste much like corned beef, but reminded me of ham instead. This is way better than the crispy mush you get from your typical diner. 

The toast was also very notable because it was extra thick and crispy, but fluffy on the inside. It had a nice buttery flavor infused into it. This went well with my over-easy eggs because I could use the toast to soak up the runny center and juices from the corned beef.

My stomach was definitely happy after trying its first Thomas Keller restaurant. With the other Bouchon being so close to home I can't wait to make another trip out to Napa to try it for dinner.

Food = 5\/5 stars 
The quiche florentine that was an airy, creamy-yet-fluffy, epicurean dream, stuffed so full of organic spinach & cheese that it was more green than custard (see photo). The mixed greens were astonishingly tasty & perfectly dressed. (I know you're saying ""meh, they're typical bistro greens, who cares?!"" but I assure you they're fabulous. Took me a few mins to figure it out but then I saw the magic... the secret was the add'n of the wispiest tips of fennel fronds. Oh, and the raw oysters w\/ mignonette were all fantastic, fresh-shucked w\/ love. 

Wine = 5\/5 stars 
Great selection of reasonably (sorta kinda ok not really) priced ($10-$16+) wines, and not surprisingly, emphasis on French labels. Highly recommend the Chenin Blanc! 

Service = 5\/5 stars 
Sat at bar both times, and saw that we (and every other customer) were treated like their only customers. Super-attentive & they all knew the menu inside out. You could tell the love they had, cocktails were crafted with incredible care & beautiful presentations. 

Very important to note is the 5-star atmosphere here. It's located on the 10th floor, in the Venezia tower (non-main one), away from the casino, away from the convention space, away from the main lobby, away from any other restaurants or bars. In a crazy city where ANYTHING goes & anyone comes (you know what I'm talking about), this is a wonderful oasis of peace & culture... a true Skank-and-DBag-Free Zone... ahhhhhhhh.

When we finally got in, we were offered a table inside or outside. It was too chilly to sit outside, but we got a nice view from where we sat. The bread, butter and jelly reminded me of breakfasts I had at my host parent's home, while I studying abroad in Strasbourg, France. It tasted the same, too. Definitely brought back wonderful memories. And everything just went up from that point. The service was great. The food was wonderful. Cal had the quiche with salad, and I had eggs in white sauce, with sausage. Everything was so creamy and tasty. And of course, we had the famous pomme frites! I really enjoyed the entire experience.

Being outside was nice for the first 20 minutes or so, but it got progressively hotter and hotter and hotter. I stopped asking for water and insisted on cups of ice instead. After devouring my pecan sticky bun, I had the Croque Madame, which came with french fries. When I ordered, the server asked if I wanted truffle fries instead and I said sure. What he should've also told me was that it's a $11 supplement! Okay, fine I'm already paying $100 for brunch so it's not a big deal, but the fries were so soft and tasted nothing of truffles. Sigh.

I actually don't like oysters that much because it tastes way too much like the ocean, but these were sweet and just awesome with the cocktail sauce, fresh grated horseradish, and I believe malt vinegar... of course I had to ask for some tabasco cuz there is no way ima eat them babies without it.

So I ordered the gnocchi instead, which was dry. Even though it was labeled as ""pan-seared"" I didn't expect them to be pan seared alone. There was a tiny bit of sauce near the bottom of the dish but it wasn't nearly enough to moisten the dried gnocchi and vegetables in the dish.

Overall - I had a delightful breakfast which was more than filling.  This is well crafted breakfast food but doesn't attempt to reach the point of artful whimsy I've enjoyed at the French Laundry.  The Venetian provided it's own whimsy when obese hotel occupants wandered out to the swimming pool at 9:30am and then the diners began competing for who could complain the most about the proximity of space heaters.

Ambience - Inside is upscale french bistro with yellow hued lighting.  I sat outside on the palazzo, which features a fountain, gardens and swimming pool.  The other diners were an eclectic mix of french tourists, japanese tourists, some comical new yorkers and yours truly.

Service - Pleasant, attentive and plentiful.  Didn't detect any snootiness and only waited once for the Bellini cocktail.  Everything else was prompt.

Food - Ordered Bellini, Almond Brioche, Croque Madame and tap water.  Bellini was average champagne cocktail with real fruit juice.  It was well balanced and avoided being too sweet.  Rasberrry was a nice topper.  Almond brioche had good flavor with just a hint of sugary sweetness.  Loved how the outside crust was crisp and the interior retained some moisture and flakiness.  Croque Madame was well executed with thick slices of bread housing ham, melted cheese, a perfectly poached egg and a well executed mornay white sauce.  The side of pan frites (french fries) were enormous and delicious.  I couldn't finish even half of them.  This is a serious breakfast, perfect for soaking up the alcohol from your night of revelry.  It prepared me for a day of heavy walking.

It's a huge portion size that makes the $25.50 price tag very worth it. My trick is to first eat the ones that allow me to dig a little hole and reach the white wine with saffron sauce. Then I can eat my mussels AND dip my french fries into the sauce at the same time! Pure deliciousness. :)

I tried some of the croque madame and smoked salmon baguette which were both outstanding. A friend also ordered the special of the day which was a pork belly BLT.

Next course was the special. I had the slow braised lamb shank. It may have been the best piece of meat that I have ever had. The sauce was nothing short of incredible and the lamb easily pulled off the bone with a fork. Have I already said incredible? well... it was.

House bread was an interesting ginger shape. The star of the table though was the jam that came with the bread. It was so fantastic I wish Bouchon sold it in jars for me to take home and get several jars as gifts for my friends as well. I was conflicted by which dishes I wanted to try because they all sounded so delicious. In the end, I shared the special which was an apple crepe with a friend and got Gravlax for myself. Both were excellent. My sister got the mussels - so delicious everyone was fighting to dip their bread into the scarce amount of sauce left. We also got a basket of pastries, of which the croissant and pecan sticky bun stood out the most.

Considering all that pomp, Bouchon is a pretty laid back and fun restaurant.  I arrived in flip flops and jeans after killing my feet in heels the night before and I felt perfectly comfortable.

If you dine here, make sure you order the foie gras.  It's such a wonderful thing.  It's like...you're eating it and thinking...this is so delicious....it's a .....highly caloric cholesterol raising schmear....it's so rich....salty....yum....illegal in certain areas.....mmmmm......  It's served in the same jar that  you can pick up at Bouchon Bakery in Yountville, but in Vegas they serve it with bottomless fingers of warm toast. aaah.  It is so good.

I had the pork shoulder.  It was a frickin HUGE serving and I couldn't get through more than half of it.  Very tender.  Very good.  My husband had the monkfish and he enjoyed it.  I like the fact that they serve on All-Clad at T. Keller restaurants.  It's a nice touch.  We had beignets for desert because after dining on foie gras and pork shoulder, you may as well go all the way on the rich-food meal scale.   I had a French margarita to drink and it is worth trying.

Our waiter was very cool.  Very friendly and unpertentious.  He checked on us frequently.

I hear this place kicks butt for breakfast.  I would definately go back to give it a try.

Bouchon is Thomas Keller's hidden gem tucked on the 2nd floor of the Venetian. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Vegas.

Came here during a bachelorette party because we wanted to take the bride-to-be somewhere special. So fancy that, we found Thomas Keller's restaurant here :)

As a group, we shared the cheese plate. We weren't the biggest fan of it - maybe because some of us weren't cheese people. It was recommend by the waiter. Well if you are a cheese person, then this is the appetizer plate to get & share!

I ordered the Poulet Rôti. I cannot begin to describe the savoriness of this dish. The chicken was baked soft with a crisp layer of skin covering it. Plus to be covered in that sauce & its juice was just amazing. The pears added a nice sweet touch to the dish and the mustard added a bit of spice flavoring.

The foods arrived at different time with 10 minutes of gap in between. I am not sure how it could possibily take so long to prepare dishes like Steak and Frites. Afterall, it's just a Brasserie not some a tradtional French Cuisine. I ordered a special, which is a Braised Veal's Shoulder which was nothing like what the waiter has described. And i quote "" it's crispy on the outside and tender in the inside"". The meat is relatively dry and hard to chew.

Mussels: There were like 50 mussels on my plate.  Usually I don't mind big portions but the flavor of the broth suffered because th mussel taste overpowered the delicate broth.  The mussels were also fishy so I don't know about how fresh they were.  Also there were some that didn't open all the way and some that were dried out and way over-cooked.

Steak:   Perfectly cooked but had a weird gamey flavor to it.

Halibut- okay but forgettable

We arrived at Bouchon at 9:30am.  We were told it would be about a 20 minute wait and they would text us when our table was ready.  We were able to walk around a gift shop a few step away while we waited for our table.  We were texted almost exactly 20 minutes later and were seated at a table for 2.  I was on the booth side and my boyfriend sat in the chair across from me.  
Their champagne cocktails looked delicious, but as much as I love champagne it does not love me, so I opted instead for the Bouchon cocktail.  It was good, but not great, and VERY strong.  I didn't end up finishing it.
The bread service they brought out was amazing.  It was 4 small rolls attached together with butter and jam.  Seriously, I could've eaten this and it could've been my meal and I would've been happy as a clam.  I'm drooling just thinking about them.  
For my entrée I had the waffle with apples pecans, and cream.  It was heavenly.  The apples and fresh pecans gave the waffle a freshness element instead of pure sweetness.  The apples were cooked, but not overcooked and not saccharine sweet.  However, I did find that syrup was totally unnecessary.

We came here for Sunday Brunch and decided to enjoy our meal on the patio outside even though it was 90 degrees. In the beginning it was fine, but as the sun hit high around 12 noon, our butter began boiling in the heat, which was quite interesting. The brunch menu was boring and disappointing. There wasn't anything that jumped out and made us think ""wow, I want to try that"" or ""that sounds goood!""

- Peach Soup: served cold, light, refreshing, tasted like a smoothie
- Beignets: too much sugar coating, a bit dry, nutella & cherry jam sauces were nothing special
- Omelette Du Jour: bland, very simple - a few peppers, onions and that was it, sausage & toast were okay
- Croque Madame: bread, ham, cheese - not bad, fries were thin & good
- Bloody Mary: delicious! nice blend of spices, stuffed olives were good

The service I have much to complain about. For this type of restaurant, I expect good service. Our server didn't seem to care at all about us and had numerous no-no's. The busser was more attentive to us than he was.
#1 - He didn't even tell us the specials, we overheard him telling another table and had to inquire about it to find out. 
#2 - After starting with the beignets, no one changed or cleared our plates or silverware.
#3 - Our entrees came and we finally told them to take the small bread plates away. They proceeded to tell us to keep our forks & knives, which were covered with nutella & cherry jam sauce and sugar from the beignets. Are you serious?!?! Proper etiquette is to bring new silverware, not leave sauce drenched ones to use for the entrees!
#4 - I ordered egg whites, but it came regular with yokes. I asked our server and all he said was ""oh."" Then proceeded to take my plate away. No apology, no explanation, just ""oh."" 10 minutes later, my omelette comes back. I didn't care that he forgot to put egg whites in my order, but the way he handled the situation was unprofessional.

The food was not bad, it was okay, but nothing special. However, the bad service just killed the whole experience. Maybe I had a stroke of bad luck and bad service or should have gone for dinner instead of brunch or maybe I'm too accustomed to San Francisco's fine dining establishments where food and service are set high. I don't think I would come to this location again, but perhaps I'll try the one in Yountville.",0,0,0

Anna R. and I strolled over in the hot sun and arrived around 11 AM. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait. Since we hadn't eaten much the day before, we were practically starving. Luckily they offer seating at the bar, so we gratefully decided to sit there.

We each ordered a Croque Madame -- Anna highly recommended it and the description on the menu made the dish undeniable. I had no other choice. While we eagerly waited, we each enjoyed a refreshing **Hibiscus Cocktail**. Just the right amount of bubbly and lightly sweet for a morning meal. The candied hibiscus at the bottom of the glass was delicious! 

When the **Croque Madame** finally arrived, I wasn't quite ready for what I saw. Beautiful presentation -- a sunny side egg perfectly placed atop a ham and cheese sandwich with thick bread, accompanied by a huge mound of french fries. As I cut this creation open, I happily observed the cheese oozing out from within the folds of the sandwich. I was also very pleased when the egg yolk started running all over the absorbent bread and the rest of the sandwich. HEAVEN. And those fries are extremely addictive and come in a dangerously generous portion.

Service at the bar was excellent. The bartenders checked on us frequently and made sure we were taken care of. My only complaint is that it took around 30 minutes to get our food. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed on Labor Day Sunday, as there were several tables available that were not being used. I was surprised that an establishment of this caliber would not be fully staffed for a holiday when lots of hungry folks would be waiting for a table.

OVERALL: Extremely pleased with the food and service, but I hope they can fully staff all their meals so there aren't such long waits and unallocated tables.

I got lucky arranging a comped room for them at Venetian.  When checking them in and checking out the room ( I've never stayed at Venetian,  enjoyed a weekday jaunt at Palazzo but never hit the mothership ! )  their room was in the Venezia Tower which means it's stones throw from Bouchon. 

 Sadly, my buddies aren't the foodie types (as an example,  my one friend enjoys the coffee shop at the wild, wild west casino -  ok, I like it, too.) but I figured , tough cookies, we are gonna hit Bouchon for brunch and they are gonna like it !!

Saturday brunch at Bouchon after a late nite of Vegas ""activities"" is  a welcome reprieve.  Even though the restaurant was busy ( about  1\/2 hour  wait to get a table ) the overall vibe is relaxing.

We decide to start with some pastries and of course, COFFEE ! We opt to have the server make the selections for us.  A raspberry  coffee cakish pastry, a chocolate croissant, a regular  croissant and the server brought us complementary what I'll call, mini -  beneights .  I went with the croissant - perfect ! tried a little nibble of the others, again, amazing !  and the coffee, I'm not a coffee snob, in fact, basically started drinking coffee when I moved to Vegas, this is definitely one of the better cups of java I've tried.

My two buddies order the same thing( I gave them a glare hoping they might order different items for the sake of variety ) - the chef special omelet ( it had sausage in it - I believe Italian ) I went with one of the other specials - the crab gratin.  My roomie ordered the french toast with a side of bananas.

Sad to say, the only pic taken by my roomie - the gratin. 

The omelet's looked perfect and given the 30 seconds it took both my buddies to inhale them, they tasted good, too !
The french toast -  I'm sorry, it ain't ""french toast"" it's french toast ""inspired"" bread pudding !  It does taste great but my spin - it's a dessert.

The gratin - amazing flavors but very rich.  It has a very heavy cream base to it.  I was completely stuffed but I had to try a lil nibble of the mini-french baquettes provided with our breakfast - I wish I was still hungry because the bread was simply devine.
The service - impeccable.

Croque Madame - ($18.95) - Toasted ham and cheese on a slice of brioche with a fried egg and mornay sauce, served with french fries. Yup, you read correctly - french fries. YAS! A fancy brunch place that serves fries on the side like any classy ass establishment should. NO SHAME IN MY GAME. okay, hyped enough. The fries were bomb, the sandwich was pretty basic but the added mornay sauce was the element that kicked this sandwich up a notch. 

Pricey but worth it, I'd splurge for this again in a heartbeat.The amount of poise and elegance of the space and the presentation of the dishes blew me away.  Our server also packed up the leftover fries to go, thank you, you amazing man.

Loria and I visited The Venetian resort in Las Vegas last year specifically to enjoy Bouchon Bakery, a small stand outside of the Phantom of the Opera Theatre. The first visit made such an impression that our final stop on the way out of the town consisted of my parking illegally in the hotel's covered entrance, leaving her to watch after the car, sprinting to drop a silly amount of money, and then running back with two bags full of baked goods.

While the eponymous bouchon, a dense, rich chocolate brownie bite, the lemon and raspberry macaron, and the eclairs were each delicious, it was the ham and cheese sandwich that really surprised me. It takes something this simple and elegant to really make the point that Thomas Keller is a genius, and clearly knows how to coax maximum flavor out of each ingredient. On a not entirely unrelated note, we repeated the exercise this year, nearly doubling last year's expenditure. The prices are, in some cases, double that of a regular bakery. Food with the precision and thought like that served in a Keller restaurant is worth every penny. Which is my way of saying, visit the bakery, go prepared to spend some cash, and don't look back.

Having enjoyed the baked goods last year, we decided to make the actual restaurant the central dining experience of the trip. Good call.

If you've ever read a Thomas Keller recipe, you'll know that ""precision"" isn't finely detailed enough a word to describe the man's work. When somebody suggests that I cut up a chocolate bar for use in a chocolate chip cookie, and then use a sieve on the pieces of chocolate to make sure that the smaller shards don't end up melted into the dough and change the pale color, you know that you're dealing with somebody who really cares about the smallest details of his food. It shows and I'm grateful.

Bouchon Bistro is a recreation of Keller's casual eatery in Yountville, California. It serves French bistro food, dressed up for a night on the town. Or, in some cases, dressed down and simplified in very elegant and flavorful ways.

The staff was beyond friendly. Our waiter bantered wittily when appropriate, and gave us plenty of space when we needed it. I love a server who pays attention, and this guy was very much on his game. His description of the specials indicated clearly that he'd sampled each of them, which seems to be a dying tradition in restaurants. His first recommendation put us in a quandary: the night's special appetizer sounded amazing, but I've read a bit about the pate and have my heart set on it. In an evening filled with great choices, we decide to do both.

It consisted of pork shoulder, cooked low and slow for the entire day, pressed into the shape of a long, thin candy bar. The pork presse was topped with an apricot preserve and a salad of marble-sized heirloom tomato halves. These parts of the dish alone would have been worth the money. The genius bit, though, was a sprinkling of dried garlic flowers, so pungent and flavorful, with a bit of creme fraiche to combat the acid of the tomatoes. I would love to know what, exactly, had been done to those small flowers to make them so filled with garlic flavor. Whether they were soaked or treated in some manner before drying, or they came from The French Laundry's garden, they were the extra bit that put an already remarkable dish over the top.

As for the pate, I honestly don't remember the details. It had some bacon around the outside. It made me feel very happy for the lucky pig that gave its life for the dish. I remember feeling like it would have been a serious mistake had we passed it up. I will not visit Bouchon again without getting the pate before my meal.

For our entrees, we choose the Kurobuta pork loin and the croque madame. The pork was served with a mustard water and creme fraiche on a small bed of wilted swiss chard and lightly heated peaches. I will admit that, though I do dearly love pork, I have only rarely had a pork loin that I was really excited about. Given how the appetizers went, I was fairly confident that Bouchon's take on it stood a decent chance of turning that around for me and I wasn't disappointed. It was weet, tender, and very delicate. The pairing of stone fruit with pork, a traditional favorite in late-summer, was a nice compliment. I certainly enjoyed it and might even order it again.

The croque madame was, however, all kinds of amazing.

This one was my wife's choice, though we shared both entrees. Here is the menu description:

toasted ham & cheese sandwich on brioche,
fried egg & mornay sauce
served with French fries

I felt though that the dish was under seasoned and nothing spectacular. The steak frites are what trended the rating up. They hit the requested cooking temperature fairy on point and the fries were abundant. The mussels I tried were also fairly mediocre but not a bad dish either.

Brunch- We flew into Vegas on a Sunday morning and went to Bouchon right after checking into our room (around 1pm). There was a 10 minute wait, but that went by in no time. My gf had the Breakfast Americaine which was 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, and a pastry of her choice (we got the sticky bun). I have to admit the eggs portions were tiny, it looked really tiny! The sausage was really good though! The sticky bun was pretty good, it was sweet had pecans all over it. My GF liked her meal overall. I got the Corn Beef Hash with 2 eggs. The Hash was quite good, I got my eggs sunny side up and the were cooked perfectly. When I broke the yolk of my egg and it mixed into the hash, it was heavy but in a good way. The Hash itself was actually pieces of diced meat and not the dog food looking stuff most diners serve. The meal was definitely heavy and would have been perfect if I was hungover! The bread they served with our meal was great and tasted really good with their butter and raspberry\/cherry jam. It was a good breakfast overall, a nice start to our trip in Vegas. 

My GF decided to treat me to a Bouchon dinner for our anniversary. We had dinner at Bouchon on a Tuesday night and we were promptly seated for our 7:30pm reservation. It's a really nice atmosphere, and just a nice ambiance. I got the Steak and fries, and my GF got the Mussels and fries. I had heard about these fries based on various reviews, and how Tony Bourdain loved them, so I was really looking forward to the most hyped fries in the world. I got to say they were good! I couldn't stop eating them, they were pretty addictive, they were salty and crisp. My steak was just ok, I guess I am just not a huge fan of a French cooked steak so I am sure it was my tastes and not the way it was cooked. I didn't really like the butter\/onion they put on it, but otherwise it was good, cooked really well and to my specifications (medium). My gf liked her mussels and went to work on them like a madwoman. There are quite a bit of mussels in that bowl, she liked them and was quite happy with her meal. The service was really really great! I can't remember our server's name but she was really professional and friendly. The bus boy or I should say bus man was efficient and nice as well.

The menu wasn't expansive. Seems like a few items but done well and at a high price point - this place isn't cheap. 

Let's talk about what we ordered:

Croque Madame - the brioche bread was so dry and almost burnt, the egg was over cooked - or too small, either way there wasn't a good amount of yolk. The béchamel was bland and lifeless also they didn't give enough to offset the dry bread. I was having a hard time cutting it and swallowing. It's unfortunate that I've had better. 1\/5

Plate of bacon - there were probably 8 slices of bacon. Of the 8, only 2 were crispy - The rest were soggy. We didn't even finish them. 1\/5

Side of Brioche - the brioche was definitely burnt. I wanted to send them back, but decided not to because I was too lazy. 1\/5

The complimentary fresh baked baguette was good and tasted great with blackberry jam and butter. The homemade blackberry jam was wonderful. Not too sweet and had a great blackberry flavor. 5\/5

Orange juice - it wasn't fresh. Bottled OJ at a price that they charged is so wrong. 1\/5

Make sure to ask your server about the daily specials available.  Our waiter greeted us promptly and took our drink orders.  You are given complimentary bread with some of the best strawberry jam which appeared to be homemade. 
I decided to try the eggs Benedict.  What caught my eye about this dish is that the meat is pork loin and not Canadian bacon.  It's served with a side salad with a house vinaigrette.  

This was one of the best tasting eggs Benedict that I've had.  The English muffin was toasted perfectly.  The hollandaise sauce was nice and creamy and had a great flavor.  The pork loin was a thick slice that also had good flavor.  The side salad was fresh field greens with the homemade vinaigrette which was quite tart.  Almost too tart for my taste but it was good.

I kept raving about their coffee.  I love a good cup of strong coffee and this hit the spot!  Thank goodness there were free refills. Lol!  I probably drank an entire pot of coffee.

My second Thomas Keller restaurant. After we were tired of the buffets, we decided to try Bouchon for dinner. What amazing dining experience. Our waiter was funny and really knowledgeable about the food and wine (""Wine is complex and unique, like women"" extra tip!)

We started with the oysters which were as sweet as fresh Hog Island sweet waters. Then, I had the french onion soup which was to die for--gooey cheese and cooked slowly for just the right amount of time so the soup wasn't too salty. 

One hiccup during my dinner was ordering the fish. Oi. I don't know if this is how French fish usually is, but my fish was a little undercooked. I'm sure Nemo was ready to jump up and start singing. It was clear that I had not touched the fish at all and the waiter noticed. He asked if anything was wrong and I mentioned that the fish was a little undercooked for my taste and that maybe it just needed a little soy sauce (joke- I'm Chinese. I love steamed fish with ginger and soy sauce). He laughed and called over the GM who apologized and said that I would not be charged for my entree. 

No worries though because that left plenty of room for dessert. Our table basically ordered the entire dessert menu. Of particular note was the vanilla bean creme brulee. What a lovely dessert. It had clean notes and did not taste too heavy.

My friend had the LES OEUFS, two eggs, potato croquettes, toasted brioche and country bacon.  I went with the HAM STEAK AND EGGS, featuring a Nueske Farms ham steak, two eggs, Lyonnaise potatoes and toast, nicely presented in an All Clad metal oval baker.  The croquettes (shaped like sausages) were very good and I liked them more than the Lyonnaise potatoes (thinly-sliced and pan-fried).  The ham steak was good of course because it's Nueske Farms and I love their products.  Odd that it was only grilled on one side though...?  The country bacon was not memorable.

When we asked if we could substitute the bread, the server wasn't particularly warm in her response (which was a no).  I wasn't excited by the toasted brioche or the cranberry toast.  Plus, the butter was so cold and hard that it wasn't spreadable.

It all started over dinner the previous night.  We had tickets for Le Reve and a reservation at Bouchon.  The host let us know the power was down but should be up quickly.  No problem, we gave an extra 30 minutes.  We sat outside on a gorgeous night and our server let us know it might be a while.  We could order salads and cold items but that was it.  Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time for an alternative fine dining experience on a Friday night.  I made due with a goat cheese salad (that was missing the goat cheese) but my husband decided he didn't want to order anything and would grab a bite on the way to the show.  The restaurant was nearly empty but our server barely paid attention to us.

As we left, my husband spoke with the manager about our experience and we were invited to brunch in the morning.  The manager on duty was told of our experience and we were treated to the most magnificent breakfast I may have ever had.

We each ordered one item off the menu and a champagne cocktail.  Moments later, a basket of pastries to rival Parisian bakeries was bought out.  Yogurt parfaits overflowing with berries followed.  Champagne cocktails kept coming.  We could not have had better service.

We were told when the gluttony was all over that it was all taken care of.

So of course, when the opportunity for Bouchon Las Vegas presents itself...

The most remarkable difference between Bouchon (Nor Cal) and Bouchon (Las Vegas) is the staff. No, not the staff that takes your orders, brings your food and caters to your dining whims: the folks at both locations are friendly, efficient and supremely competent. 

It's the set of folks at door. Unlike the pleasantries you might be greeted with at Bouchon (Nor Cal), the Bouchon (Las Vegas) entourage might greet you with confusion or disdain. 

During my first visit to Bouchon (LV), I chalked this up as an aberration. But now I suspect that Bouchon (LV) might be hiring from a pool of TAO rejects..or graduates. Which is worse? 

If you can put that first minute of the Bouchon LV experience aside, you will be rewarded.

First of all, service was excellent. Attentive waitstaff, personable and warm, excellent menu and wine recommendations. 

Food was impossibly delish. I got a super fresh salad and a short rib dish that made me think I'd died and gone to heaven. 

Atmosphere was nice - this is where hubby prefers Yountville. He just thinks it's classic TK and I felt it was a little crowded. I get it - bistro, elbow to elbow. I just prefer having some space and privacy.

Anyway, for me what made it beyond special was when we asked if they served a certain desert. Our server said they don't, but she would go ask the chef. She comes back to tell me he'd be happy to prepare me what I requested. What a wonderful surprise - and obviously a classically trained chef to just be able to make a request to order (it was AMAZING by the way!)

It was beautifully presented in this really cool pot with a dipping section, and they were tender and flavorful and overall fabulous.  There were a ton of them and he cleaned them out (we all chipped in a bit).

My friend and I both had the omelet of the day which was broccoli rabe and cheddar.  It was delicious.  It also came with a giant stack of super crispy and very tasty bacon and brioche.  Yum.

Mom had the quiche of the day, which was spinach.  It was very good, too, but didn't come with anything on the side.

My only real complaint is that the beignets we ordered were not light and puffed up beignets but really were like a plate of mini-donuts.  They tasted good and came with strawberry sauce and Nutella, but it was just not what I was expecting.

Our drinks were also very good - coffee, bloody marys, mimosas - and the service was excellent, although we did end up waiting a bit to get our check.  But, the setting was so pleasant that we didn't really mind all that much.  I would definitely return; in fact, I look forward to it.",1,1,1

The chicken is roasted, not fried (as it usually is when it's a chicken and waffles dish), and it's very juicy. As usual, I preferred the dark meat over the white, but you can't go wrong with either here. The chicken is seasoned well, and the skin was delicious (when is it not??). It came with Chasseur (a gravy-like) sauce on the side, which was good, but I didn't think it was needed. 

When I eat chicken and waffles, I typically enjoy the waffle more than the chicken, and it was no different here. At Bouchon, the waffle has bits of bacon and chives in it. And of course it has the crispy, yet light and airy, texture to it. Add to that the Tahitian vanilla bean butter and maple syrup, and you have a winner. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.

My wife was debating between the Bouchon French Toast and one of the dishes of the day, which was a Breakfast Tartine (bread, prosciutto, Gruyere cheese, frisee salad, and a sunny side up egg). Let's just say she should have gone w\/ the French toast. The prosciutto wasn't salty enough to flavor the entire dish, and the Brioche bread did nothing for us; it was just bland throughout. The couple next to us both ordered this dish, and I wished they would have asked us for our opinion before doing so. Our server did a great job of making this sound good, but it failed to deliver. I'm sure the other dishes here are awesome... just not this particular one. If you find yourself in a similar dilemma, go with the French toast.

Other than that, service was great, and dining outdoors next to the pool surrounded by the beautiful building that Venetian is made it an enjoyable experience.",3,3,3

Checking in:
We were staying at the Venetian for my BFF's birthday. I called Bouchon to check how long the wait was since it was a Sunday afternoon. The gentleman told me about 5 minutes or so. When we arrived 5 minutes later (this was about 2PM), the receptionist told us that the wait was 40-45 minutes! She was very rude and acted like she hated what she was doing and didn't want to be there. I politely explained that I had called to check on wait times about 10 minutes prior to our arrival; she responded in a nonchalant demeanor and said ""that was 10 minutes ago"". Running low on sleep and patience, I still managed to brush her attitude off- after all we had a fun weekend. We arrived at Bouchon at about 115 PM, and we were seated at around 135. 20 minutes, not bad. 

Service:
After having waited to be seated, the OCD side of me decided to time how long it'll take us to get noticed and be handed our menu. 3 minutes. Not bad. Sensing the ""busy Sunday afternoon"" atmosphere, we ordered Beignets (sp.) together with our coffee and water to be ""ahead"" and not starve to death while waiting for our breakfast food to arrive. We ordered our real food at around 150 PM.

155 PM: coffee arrives. yay.

2PM: we asked for some bread and coffee refills.

..... Its already 220, still no Beignets (sp), no refills, no bread.  (AND NO FOOD)

230 PM: still no food, no bread, no coffee, but YES beignets. 

235 PM: party right next to us who arrived 20 minutes after we did and had the same server got their food FIRST... WTH?
240 PM: our food finally arrives , but my partner's smoked salmon plate (which does NOT require any cooking whatsoever) has not arrived yet. WTH?


Food:
Biegnets: Yummy, but not life changing. Similar to the one Grand Luxe serves
Coffee: Good.
Croque Madame: heavy sauce, but lacking flavor. Brioce bread was excellent though. 
Bacon: Its really hard to mess it up, right?
French Toast: Hybrid between Tiramisu\/angel cake consistency. Too much cinnamon! 
Smoked Salmon plate: eh.

The food is not bad, but they definitely need to work on their customer service. WHen we asked for an explanation on why our food took forever, the waiter-in-training tried being sarcastic and gave us a snide response. Seriously? Seriously?",2,1,1

We arrived around 11am on a Saturday morning and waited about 20 minutes for our party of 10 to be seated - not bad. (Maybe just lucky though...)

Service was a little bit slow, maybe because we were in a back room with a few other large parties. They seated us even though we were missing a few in our party, which was nice. 

I ordered the corned beef hash, and also tried the omelette du jour and chicken&waffles. Heads up that the corned beef hash was A LOT of meat! And not much else... Tasty but didn't really hit the spot after a long night... chicken and waffles probably would have been a better choice. The chicken was very moist and waffles tasty. Really good syrup too, but it was at $26. Sharable for breakfast\/brunch, but probably not for a full lunch\/dinner. The corned beef hash was $17 I think.

The star of the morning for me was the beignets for sure! They come with a chocolate sauce and a currant (?) compote, both of which went well with the donuts. Really moist and cakey - what I imagine they would taste like in New Orleans!

I also got an OJ with my breakfast which tasted like it came from the carton and not fresh squeezed. Kind of a disappointment for $4.",2,1,0

And it was kinda big in size which is necessary for the demand of people that come here. It's kinda tucked away downstairs in the Venetian but there are signs everywhere so you won't get lost. I loved all the cute pictures on the top walls of random french stuff, very adorable for people like me who appreciate pleasant ambiance.

Now onto the food, I was kinda worried since I'm more of a lunch, dinner person than a brunch person but the menu was pretty good. I had the special butternut squash soup which was simply delicious and fresh. The happy bread that comes complimentary on the weekend with french butter and strawberry jam left me very happy and super full as we could not stop ourselves. My husband had the omelette du jour which he seemed to enjoy with a side of bacon that I helped myself to as well  which was delicious.

Granted, it wasn't Per Se or the French Laundry, but one has to start somewhere.

We had a reservation for a Sunday evening, late enough that we were hungry but not so late that we still couldn't enjoy a later show. We were seated promptly, though strangely we were not greeted for several minutes. The cocktail list is pretty on-par in terms of Vegas pricing, and considering that these are actually well made drinks, as opposed to watered down slushies in plastic cups, this was a welcome change. I do wish that they had more wine offerings under $50 a bottle, because there were essentially none in this price range, however my Bouchon Cocktail was dangerous and fresh, and my husband's Manhattan was excellent.

My husband ordered the steak and frites, and I ordered the scallop special for the evening. The couple dining next to us felt their steak was tough, and although my husband didn't find it tough, he did feel that it was cooked more than he was expecting. The frites, by the way, tasted exactly like McDonald's fries. Not a bad thing, but interesting.

My scallop special was good, though not outstanding: the scallops were well seared and obviously cooked well. The dish came with tomatoes, eggplant and zucchini, which were cooked amazingly, considering I do not often like 2 of those vegetables. The dish also came with some incredibly unremarkable shrimp, whose purpose I couldn't identify, and a savory herbs de provence pain perdu, which was heavenly. I would have been very happy with just the seared scallops, the pain perdu and the vegetables. The shrimp, as well as the broth the dish sat in, didn't say much to me.

For dessert, my husband ordered the chocolate and burnt orange dessert, which we both enjoyed. I got one of the cheaper wines by the glass, and was incredibly pleased with it. I'm thankful and happy we were able to eat here, but would definitely choose somewhere new the next time I visit.",1,1,0

The service is impeccable, the oysters are fresh, and the food is really good. However, I cannot give it that 5th star because nothing about the restaurant's food stands out per se (no pun intended Mr. Keller).

I've been to Bouchon twice and both times I sat at the bar. I also happened to get the same bartender and this guy is so on top of his game that you would think he has been doing this his whole life. He is a courteous chap with a pleasant demeanor and offers good recommendations all around.

The first time I went, I had the french onion soup, the moules frites, and the pot de creme. Each dish was delicious and the french onion soup was especially good. The second time, I had a half dozen oysters (really, really good), duck confit, and pork belly. 

The confit was a bit disappointing though it was cooked as well as any confit I have ever seen yet it was still a tad dry on the inside and a bit flavorless. I wasn't a big fan of the pool of nectarine juice it was swimming in either and that did not make up for the dryness.

I highly recommend the Moules Frites. It is simply a bowl of mussels with a very flavorful white-wine\/saffron sauce and a batch of really good french fries.

The lemon tart was not so great. It was too tart and the texture wasn't anything special. This is something that I know folks can make better at home.

Overall the experience was great. I love Thomas Keller and his creations. I love the service and atmosphere of the restaurant itself.

The raw seafood platter was delicious - oysters, clams, lobster (yum).  But was surprised at the pedestrian-ness of the sauces (tasted like ketchup and mayonaise - when I expected something more interesting).

French fries\/frites - was good, but not as good as I have had at many other places.  Could have been fried again for a more crisp texture - became wilty too quickly.

The salmon was executed well, medium rare and crisp on the outside

Bone marrow - big disappointment.  We were all looking forward to it, but it was deep-fried mess.  It was not served in the original bone.  THe bone marrow was scooped out, breaded and deep fried.  It was disgusting, to say the least and only worse after it cooled down.  Of the six of us (2 servings ordered), only 2 of us could manage to finish it.

We went to Bouchon for my rehearsal dinner, it was actually Holly's idea. The server was one of these East Coast fast talker types, quick with the one-liners and so forth. That part was entertaining, as everyone was just happy to be eating together and it fits the Vegas atmosphere, but I can see how some people would prefer more subdued service (especially considering the amount of dough being dropped).

The B.L.T. (sous vide) was the highlight for me. Not that it was remarkable but I appreciate the process of it being cooked and the presentation. The food overall was great, just not spectacular. I agree with Holly's assessment that the appetizers were not impressive. 

As Holly said the barstaff paid a lot of attention to proper wine glasses throughout the meal, but then they served an after dinner cognac in a little champagne flute type thing. I'm not an expert but I'm pretty sure you're just supposed to serve cognac in a brandy snifter so your hand warms up the alcohol as you drink it. 

The other deal breaker for me was that they served freakin' TAP WATER with the meal. Granted, they asked us before eating if we wanted Evian or mineral water, but when people are spending $1200 on a meal (including drinks) you should not even give them an option for ""Las Vegas's Finest,"" as the waiter put it. The tap water didn't even have ice.

Anyway, we had a great time. As Holly noted, my wife was choking on some steak at one point. The restaurant made sure she was fine and treated us to some excellent desserts to help celebrate our occasion. When you're at a high-end place like this, though, the devil is in the details. You don't serve god-awful tap water, you put more care into the appetizer dishes, and you don't put cognac on the menu unless you have the proper glassware to serve it in.

We ordered the salmon rillettes as our starter, which tasted amazing, but I didn't eat too much of it as I didn't want to fill up before the main courses came. 

Main courses were the roasted chicken with puff pastry tartlette and the top sirloin special. Don't get me wrong, both were good, but not $30+ good. Everything was cooked to perfection, but a little over seasoned however - could be because it's Vegas and the combination of sweltering heat and dry, cold air conditioning that leaves you feeling super dehydrated, the last thing you want is something so rich\/salty. 

The fries were good and dessert was so-so. The beignets were my favorite along with the home made ice cream that came with my bouchons (vanilla, mint chip and orange ginger) - the bouchon, which sort of resembled a cork shaped brownie - was a little dry.

Let me preface my review by saying I love Thomas Keller...his work has been of an interest of mine for years so it hurts that I have to give one of his establishments anything less than a 5 star rating. Hopefully one day it will be able to redeem itself.

My boyfriend and I came here for brunch because 1) we were staying at the Venetian and 2) I've been wanting to try Bouchon for quite some time now.

We arrived around 11:35am and were told that it would be about a 20-25 minute wait before getting seated. That was fair so we went to the bar to grab a menu (I like to be efficient) but I had to wait almost 10 minutes before someone asked to help me. To make a long story short, after we got seated, we waited another 5 minutes before MATTHEW, our waiter approached our table, 10 minutes for my bloody mary, and about another 25 minutes for our food to come out. He never checked on us, I had to ask him to check on our food (conveniently right after that the food came out). For an upscale establishment, I expected MUCH better service. Honestly, the service we got at Carl's, Jr. on the way home was more impressive. But enough of the bad, let's get to the good - the food.

The Bread - I am one to always judge a restaurant by two things: their bread & their dessert (if I make it that far). Their bread was weaved into a wheat-like shape (very pretty) and had the yummiest jam to accompany it. We coulnd't help but take the leftovers home!

The Bloody Mary - delicious, but spicy. There was a lot of flavor, a little more than I was expecting but really good. I had to take it in doses because I think it could have overpowered my meal.

The Chicken and Waffles (my bf's dish) - Very yummy. The waffles had chives and bacon in it. How can you say no to that? And the chicken was very juicy. Agreed, not your Roscoe's kind of chicken and waffles. It came with sides of gravy (tasty but my bf didn't care for it) and really yummy syrup!

The Croque Madame - pretty much a ham&cheese sandwich with a fried egg on top. Tasty, but nothing special but the pomme frites! TONS of pomme frites that were so flavorful with the sprinkles of sea salt. YUMMMM.

Overall, 3 stars well deserved. I probably would have given it 1-2 stars based on the service alone. Probably won't be visiting this particular location again but I will give other locations another chance for sure.",2,0,1

- A mound of thin cut fries (not quite string fries but almost). I was expecting the thick cut pomme frites (as is the norm in France) that I personally don't care for... so this version was such a delight.

I began my dining experience with some rustic bread. Shaped like a branch of leaves, it was perfectly salty but became sweeter as I worked it in my mouth.  I had a Brandy Alexander, a classic cocktail combining brandy, creme de cacao, half and half, and grated nutmeg. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my brother's as he uses vanilla ice cream instead of half and half and goes overboard with the nutmeg. :)

The Beignets de Brandade de Morue appetizer was a bit disappointing.  It consisted of 3 beignets that were crispy golden on the outside and soft in the inside with a mash of cod.  Each rested on a sauce-reduced tomato and topped with a single deep-fried sage leaf.  The dish was incredibly salty.  Our server warned us that cod is a salty fish but I did not expect the taste to be so overpowering.  The acidity of the tomato did not help to balance out the saltiness and the sage had lost its unique herby taste.

I, however, was very pleased with the sweet bread ravioli (appetizer of the day).  The sweet bread is not referring to ""bakery bread"" like I thought, but the thymus and the pancreas of a deer.  It was quite delicious and NOT weird.  The delicate raviolis were sandwiched between a bed of lentil beans and crispy peppery greens.  I did not think twice that I was eating some weird part of an animal. 

For my meal course, I had the roasted duck breast with red rice, cherries, and fennel.  The breast had a wonderfully crisp outer skin that had been finely cut with criss-crossing marks.  The meat below was tender and juicy.  I greatly enjoyed the fennel and cherries and wished I had more cherries for sweetness to offset the savory duck.  The rice was however a bit too grainy.

We finished the meal with the server's favorite dessert.  It consisted of 3 cylinder brownies with butterscotch, mint, and chocolate ice cream on each.  They mimicked the shape of hot air balloons...very clever to match Bouchon's logo.  My favorite was the mint because it tasted different from the traditional mint ice cream that you get from Safeway.  It had more of a ""green tea"" hue and I could definitely taste the fresh mint.  My coworker swore it tasted more like marijuana.  I would have to agree.  Did I just type that?  Yes I did.

The lamb was a little bland and the best part of the dish was actually the beans (and I hate beans usually).

You have to take the guest elevator up to the guest lobby. We went on a Saturday morning around 11, and waited for about 10 minutes. I loved that they can just text you when your table is ready.  Insider tip: there's a pool with lawn chairs around the corner--great place to relax until your table is ready!

We ordered the chicken and waffles, croque madame, and a side of bacon. The bacon was super crispy and yummy! I was a little underwhelmed with our two entrees though--they were good, but nothing special in my honest opinion. Especially given how expensive they were and the the hype, I was definitely expecting something more. I was also surprised that the chicken was more of a rotisserie chicken than fried chicken.

Why 4 stars? You really can't beat the service there.They accidentally gave our croque madame to another table, so had to remake it for us. To compensate, they offered us cocktails--I opted for a almond chocolate croissant instead. When they brought us our croque madame, they told us that they would also take it off our bill given the mess-up. SWEET! I love free stuff! I thought that was super nice of them, especially given they had already given us a free cocktail and a croissant.

I canceled our reservation at the last minute because, in that ever important debate, ""food vs sleep,"" sleep won the first round.  Bouchon gave us the flexibility to cancel last-minute without any penalties.  Nice.  However, ultimately, our stomachs won the battle and we decided that we were more hungry than tired.  So I called Bouchon and asked if we could head over (like, now) without any reservations and, again, they were extremely gracious and flexible and, not only took all of us ASAP but, also gave us a private room without our requesting it.  Now we could be as loud and obnoxious and Miss Piggy as we wanted to be.  

Our waiter was fantastic - sweet, offbeat, patient, helpful, quirky, funny.  Huge tip for him.  The bread was excellent - excellent presentation and warm.  The main courses and dessert - hmm.  Maybe I was expecting a lot more since I've heard such great things about Bouchon (and, of course, we all know Bouchon is owned by the owner of French Laundry in Napa) - but, honestly, the food was TOO DAMN BUTTTERY.  I don't care if this is French food and it's supposed to be fatty.  You know something is wrong when all I can smell in the air, in my hair, in our food, is butter.  Now, my girls and I can EAT.  Oink, oink, baby.  But, because of all the butter in the food, not one of us could finish her meal.  NOT ONE.  That is a downright shame.  I was disappointed by the trout I had ordered.  I've had much, much better trout - even trout prepared in a similar fashion - in Europe, in restaurants that were NOT fine dining establishments, just casual gastropubs.  I can't believe I am saying this but, the meal would have been much better if the portions had been smaller - less butter and less of that buttery aftertaste.  Also, it would have helped if the desserts were at least orgasmic but, alas.  This is what we ate:
- Watercress & Endive salad
- Mixed green salad
- Bibb Lettuce salad 
- Pan-roasted trout w\/ almonds
- Atlantic Salmon with black cabbage
- 2 different specials of the day (scallops, steak)
- Lemon tart
- Dark Chocolate Mousse
- Pot de Crme

The salads were so-so.  The main courses - 'nough said above.  The desserts - good but, definitely not spectacular.

Stopped in Saturday morning before my flight leaving Vegas with wife and in-laws, and tried the following:

Chicken and Waffles - Chicken is absolutely tender with a perfect balance of seasoning on the skin.  Waffles were crisp on the outside and soft\/chewy on the inside, with some type of fruit (raisin?) that added a hint of sweetness along with some herbs.  The waiter claimed it was life changing, and while it wasn't quite THAT good, it was definitely delicious.

Smoked Salmon on Baguette - Wonderful smoked salmon in terms of flavor and texture, and the baguette was perfect.  This is one of the few times that my wife finished her dish before mine (the other being Ippudo Ramen in NYC).  It says something.

Omelette - I didn't get to try this... but I've never seen my father in law clean his plate so  fast before.  It must've been good.  Or he must've been really hungry.  Or the combination of the two.

Corn Beef Hash - For those that are expecting the stuff from a can, you will be disappointed.  This is freshly corned beef, tender and great flavor, not the mushy stuff in a can that people have come to expect and love (which has it's own merits as well).  Excellent dish.

Verdict:  Pastries were phenomenal, location is excellent, service was perfect, food was very memorable (my mother-in-law even wrote us to thank us again for taking them to breakfast, and raved about the coffee and crossaint).  In short - the brunch meal was excellent and worth a trip!

Finally, someone here mentioned that Thomas Keller doesn't keep an eye on the place, however I saw him walk out of the kitchen while I was here and sit down at a table to have breakfast with someone... I would've asked for a picture, but the conversation looked like it may have been an interview and I didn't want to be one of those rude fanboys...

One guest had the Laitue salad, a mix of bibb lettuces and fine herbs and the house vinaigrette. She is very picky and usually likes iceberg and ranch - she ate every bite!
For main courses we all shared. Steak Frites, Salmon and Lentils and Crispy Skinned Striped Bass with Gnocchi, Forested Mushrooms and Black Truffle Mousseline.  Divine. Everything was cooked to perfection and every guest was happy and impressed. Our server Amy D was very knowledgeable, very gracious and the perfect server.

It's possible that I was dazzled because I really never eat at restaurants of this quality.  But if you also rarely dine like this, listen in:

-Our server was adorable and fun, while still being respectful and unobtrusive.  Think about it --is there better criteria for a waiter out there?  He was like the perfect background music, and I'd go back for him alone.  I wish I remember his name --a young 30-something Polish guy.  But luckily there are many other reasons to return....

-The cheese course was perfect in its range and selections.  Great accompaniments not only served alongside (honeycomb, the right breads and crackers), but also to the bread and pistachios at the table.

-A wine list that gave just the right info to make good pairing choices.

-I loved my gnocchi, served with winter vegetables in a mild and yet cohesive brown butter sauce.  It was heavy and greasy, and somehow that was a good thing.  A must-try!

-Sides of pommes frites and mac and cheese set the bar for any future fry or mac 'n cheese, who will lose any battles they attempt.

-Salad perfectly herbed and vinegared, worked great with the warm goat cheese.

-The madiera tasting for dessert!!!  I had good madiera in storage before this.  Now nothing compares.  This may be a bad thing in general.  But that night, it was a very, very good thing.  1989 Madiera!!

-I'm not a big breakfast fan, and I don't like meat or eggs.  (Anyone still reading!  haha)  But I can say that the french toast was excellent despite the egginess.  (It's more like a bread pudding, with apples.)  And the cheese danish was the best I've ever had.

It had won a couple of Opentable Diners' Choice Awards for Best French in Las Vegas and Fit for Foodies. We decided to go for brunch because there were other restaurants that we wanted to go for dinner, and actually, brunch at Bouchon sounded like such a good idea!

We didn't make a reservation beforehand and just walked-in for breakfast. It was around 9:30am, so we didn't expect the restaurant to be completely full with customers. After I did some research for this blog post, I realized that Bouchon doesn't actually take any reservations for breakfast and brunch; only walk-ins! We originally wanted to sit outside at their patio, but we were hungry so didn't bother waiting for it (~20 minutes). So, we were almost immediately seated inside near their patio.

What did we order?
We skipped the viennoiseries and pastries because I wanted to check their Bouchon Bakery out on the main floor of The Venetian (and underneath their clock tower). Hubby ordered Le Burger Bouchon ($19.50) and I had their Tartine du Jour ($17.00), an open sandwich. The topping of the day was tuna salad.

After we ordered, we were given complimentary bread and butter to enjoy during our wait. It was a classic French  baguette but shaped in a beautiful braid! I saw one of the servers holding a long untorn braid of this baguette, and it was amazing. Anyway, the bread was tasty and I loved the texture because it wasn't too hard of a baguette.

For some reason, our order took longer than other customers' breakfast. I have a feeling it was because we ordered dishes that took more time than other simple breakfast dishes (eg. omelette, eggs, bacon, etc.), but I'm not 100% sure why it took longer.

When it finally arrived, hubby and I were both pleasantly surprised at our dishes because the portions were huge! The potato fries were so perfectly cooked: golden brown, crispy, and so incredibly delicious...they got me so excited.

My sandwich was served with olives, fresh lettuce, and pickles along with my huge side of fries. Topped with boiled eggs, thinly sliced radish, and some parsley on top, it was delicious! I hadn't had tuna salad in a long time, so I enjoyed them very much.",1,0,1

The waiter (Michael, who was AWESOME) showed me how to smear it on my bread.  Yum.  The pâté was tasty -- but eclipsed by the marrow.  I had a Sazerac and my wife had a Moscow Mule to accompany -- both top notch jobs by the bartender.

The main courses -- a Lamb sirloin for the lady, and a kilo of mussels and truffle frites for me.  Both were amazing, fantastic, to die for good.

Everyone who worked at Bouchon  was incredibly professional and really added a special touch to everything they did.  Our server- Michael P, who has been at Las Vegas Bouchon since it opened was the most knowledgable server I have ever had.  I don't really want to write about all the special perks they offered my group because I know it was a combination of my friend's hard work in trying to make sure everything was perfect for the bachelorette party, and I wouldn't want people to have false expectations going to Bouchon.

Foodwise-  everything was delicious.  To start I ordered the special of the day- a Foie gras with pieces of duck that was wrapped in a wonton skin and then deep fried.  It was good, but I think I was expecting it to be more foie gras and less deep fried.  It was definitely balanced and for being deep fried, wasn't overwhelmingly salty.  For my main entree, I had the Poulet Roti.  When you eat the chicken on it's own, it's very juicy but perhaps not the most remarkable chicken you could have.  But, when you get the layers of the sauce mixed with the figs and the chantrelle mushrooms it is a ridiculously awesome flavor bonanza in your mouth.  Have I sold you on it yet?  For desert, the Pot de Creme in coffee.  I'm not a huge coffee person, but this was also very good.  The consistency of the pot de creme was really suprising.  It wasn't like a custard, and it wasn't watery like flan, it was very firm without being too firm, and soft without being too soft.  Yes, its probably the most unhelpful description ever, but you just need to try it yourself, you won't be disappointed!

Fantastic place to celebrate a special occassion for ambience, service and most importantly a memorable food experience!

I went here for weekend brunch around noon. Make sure you have a reservation--it'll really speed things up. We ended up waiting 1 hour (when they gave us an estimate of 35 minutes). It is located right next to the Venetian lobby, so don't park at the Palazzo unless you want to walk a lot. LOL, I made a lot of stupid mistakes, so don't be me.

As we got seated, the waiter asked us what we wanted to drink without handing us any drinks menu. If I had known that a small mimosa was $12.50 each, I don't think I would've ordered it. It was very heavy on the champagne, so at least you're getting your money's worth...I guess? 

They gave us a loaf of bread and butter\/orange preserves on the side. This makes me sound super plebe, but I actually really enjoyed the butter. My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict; I ordered the french toast. The benedict was well seasoned and tasty. I appreciated that there was also a side salad since I've been to other restaurants that literally just give you two english muffins and nothing else. But my french toast was way too cloyingly sweet. There was nothing on my plate to break up the monotony of sweetness. I wish the toast also had some other textural component like the outside being crispy and inside being custardy\/soft; it was just......a custardy piece of bread. I always finish my food, but I could not finish my food. Sad.

My bf and I arrived at 12:30pm on a Sunday (during the 4th of July weekend).  Too bad they don't allow reservation for the weekend brunches, we waited for about 40 minutes to be seated.  

We ordered:

Chicken & Waffles - It was amazing!  The chicken was done perfectly, tender and juicy!  The waffles?  TWO THUMBS UP!   

Omelette of the day - The omelette was just OK, Good but nothing special.

The biggest stand out for me was the house bread.  Haha....yup, the bread was so GOOD, especially the raspberry jam and butter.  VERY GOOD COMBINATION!

Service was good but kinda slow.  We waited for about 30 minutes for our food to come out........It was not a very good idea to wait that long especially when you were sitting outside during the day!

My boyfriend had the flat iron steak. It was like butter. It was cooked perfectly and the pomme frites were hot, well seasoned and perfectly cooked. He said his salad was well dressed and tasty. I loved the warm pistachios that are served when you first sit down. 

Our server was nice, but seemed a bit slow. The back waiters however, were not. They were quick to remove plates and replenish our bread, pistachios, and water.

It is beautiful inside and directly outside of it. They're connected to the outside gardens in the Venetian with beautiful flowers and a pool, along with a really pretty gazebo. Just down the hallway a bit is a lounge near their second ""front desk"" that has amazing architecture and design that makes you really feel like you're not in America anymore, but is instead in Europe. They may be a bit pricey, but you're still getting great food and amazing service, so definitely worth the price tag if you're up for paying about $20+ for a brunch.

I've had two items on their menu before and they are both delicious. One is the baguette with smoked salmon and capers. This is my pretty standard choice when I'm not sure what else to get. It is flavorful and the just a good combination always. But if you want something more out of the ordinary, you should definitely look at their Chicken and Waffles. I have never had a waffle that was so meant for chicken! It is not your typical buttermilk waffles. It is the best combination of a savory waffle and chicken where the batter of the waffle has been mixed with bacon and chives! Doesn't that just make your mouth water?!? It was so perfect! So crispy on the outside and perfectly fluffy on the inside. The chicken went deliciously well with the whole combination and they roasted it to a good taste, yet didn't burn any parts of it. The sauce that comes with the chicken was a bit salty so it went well if you were to order some fries to dip into it too. So a definitely recommendation from me are these two items.

They also serve you some bread that are shaped in the most unique possible way. It looks like a bunch of leaves strung together and you basically break off one of the leaves. It is a bit hard since it seems a bit over crispy, so don't expect too much from that. But other than that, the bread is still good and I think is very artistically appealing for the eyes rather than the teeth that you're going to have to use to crunch through the tough to break shell!

It's a mock French bistro located in not-so-casual places (the uber-yuppie Yountville, Beverly Hills, and Vegas), serving very casual dishes often with fries on the side.  Maybe the main ingredient here is irony, often masked from the wannabe-fine-dining crowd of Gen-Y hipsters that cares more about where to be seen than what to eat.  But for those who truly appreciate good food, Bouchon-LV doesn't disappoint.  For those who seek great value, well... you get to pay $38 for Steak Frites.

The restaurant is tucked away somewhere behind the Venetian\/Palazzo casino area (I was in a slightly buzzed bachelor party crowd, so I'll skip the reliable directions).   It definitely has a European feel: high echo-y ceilings, gold trimmings and rails along the dining booths, elaborate moldings and glass on the walls, dark wood with marble tops, large french(duh) doors and absolutely no carpet in sight.  But it's all packaged in understated elegance--like French curse words.

I forgot the name of our server, so let's just pick a nice French name like 'Juan'.  Juan exhibited the #1 rule in restaurant hospitality--lots and lots of fresh bread.  He took note when the first batch of hot bread sticks disappeared in a matter of seconds, and he quickly came back with both arms full of new, pipin' hot bread sticks.  Some might not be too impressed by this.  After all, it's just bread, right?  But it goes to show a lot about how sensitive the servers are to the customer's needs as well as what it means to provide a good dining experience.  When we asked for more of their delicious butter, he gladly responded with 4 more jars and kept bringing more until we couldn't finish it.  Thank you, Juan.

Alright, let's get to the food.  My friends and I had the French Onion Soup, Steak Frites, Roasted Chicken, Roasted Leg of Lamb, Kurobuta Pork Loin, Sautéed Gnocchi and the Sautéed Scottish Salmon.  I'll talk about the first three.

First, the soup.  If you're going to open a French restaurant, you'd better make damn sure you put out a decent onion soup, or Soupe A L'Oignon.  And like in most soups, it's all in the stock.  And Keller does a great job.  It's a simple dish to make as long as you have the right ingredients.  The danger in eating ""simple"" foods like Bistro foods is that you might overlook the depth of skills and ingredient quality if you don't pay attention to them.   I say this because so many restaurants overlook the importance of a good, made-from-scratch base broth.  The broth was rich yet not too heavy.  And the fresh thyme that Keller loves using in protein dishes nicely lifted the beefy note of the soup.  I'm sure there was butter in there somewhere (it is a French dish after all), but the buttery-ness was actually from the cheese.  Oh man.  Good quality cheese can save the day in any restaurant.  The white, gooey, complex profile of the cheese blanked the soup and released the fragrance of the sweet onions as we engaged the soup.  So yea, it was good.

Steak Frites is what meat-loving Americans always order at French bistros because it's cheap and filling (typical American ""meat-and-potatoes).  But being cheap has its price: quality.  The dish is made usually with cheaper cuts of meat (skirt, flank or sirloin).  They're expectedly tough and chewy.  I don't know what cut was used at Bouchon, but it was explicitly ""Prime"" grade.  That took care of much of the toughness and made the steak just chewy enough to be interesting.  But what made the steak was the herb butter and the caramelized shallots.  Again, he used plenty of fresh thyme and I did not complain.  And the shallots... so juicy, flavorful, not too sweet and not too sour.  Making the perfect caramelized shallots should be in every cooking 101 course.  I wasn't all that impressed with the Pommes Frites.  I guess growing up in California spoiled my taste buds for french fries.  They were light and crispy, but just like any other fries, they quickly became cold and soggy.  

And then there was my dish: the Roast Chicken.  I ordered this dish because, in my opinion, this should be the signature dish for Bouchon.  It's one of the simplest (and simplest looking) dishes of all.  But the concept of Bouchon is to take simple dishes and refine them to make them great, and there's no dish that embodies this idea better than Roast Chicken.  The difficulty comes in chicken's lack of complexity in taste.  Fresh organic chicken comes with a robust flavor, but it's often taken as gamy and too pungent.  Keller deals with these problems with a superb brine, elegant chicken jus and earthy wild mushrooms as garnish.  If you ever order this dish, stop and simply take in the fragrance.  I don't know what they do to the mushrooms, but I had never smelled mushrooms like them before.  I'll even say that the mushrooms almost surpass the chicken as the star of the dish.   I wish the skin was a bit more crisp, but overall this was a great experience.",4,3,3

Back to the food though...

This was a meal to remember.  We started out with some briny PEI oysters, the etherial Pate de Campagne, and the decadent Confit de Canard.  Incredible.  I've had mixed experiences with pate in the past, but once I slathered it on my bread, added a touch of mustard and radish, and took a sip of my chenin blanc....it actually made me pause wide-eyed, and stare at my friend across me who apparently experienced the same reaction as a clanging of forks and knives quickly clashed to claim the remainder of the plate.   From that bite, we were sold.  

But there were more dishes to come from the Truite aux Amandes (pan roasted trout with almonds....worth committing a crime for) and the Moules au Safran et  la Moutarde (mussels with saffron and mustard...you'll need extra bread).

We ended up going for a late breakfast and it was simply the best breakfast I have ever had!

I ordered the Croque Madame mainly because of everyone going on and on about the French Fries they serve with it. I mean... everyone talks about them like they are some kind of narcotic and you need your fix to through the day. I waited eagerly for the plate to come to the table, grabbed a few fries, and... they were very good, but definitely not as good as everyone is saying. Maybe I hyped it too much, but I was expecting more.

Seriously though... To be honest, F the French Fries. The real star is the Croque Madame. That has to be THE best breakfast I have ever eaten. Toasted ham and cheese were very good, the brioche was even better, but I think the combination of everything with the slightly runny sunny side up egg and mornay sauce puts this way over the top.

I normally don't like to go to a particular restaurant twice in a single visit while in Vegas, but I think for this place I might make an exception (dinner one night and breakfast in the morning before leaving for home).

I also didn't care for the chocolate almond croissant or the cheese danish, have had better elsewhere. My husband also didn't like his French toast, it lacked flavor and seemed too mushy.

Bouchon was booked for a private party for dinner, so three of us went to breakfast there on a weekday morning. Most of the breakfast reviews we read were for Sunday brunch. Weekday breakfast, ordered from the menu is a different experience, and a wonderful one.
Our entrees were:
* A daily special with crab cakes, topped with poached egg, asparagus and hollandaise.
* Breakfast Jardiniere, which included two eggs, toasted bioche, fruit cup, sauteed spinach, Lyonnaise potatoes, pastry (we picked cheese Danish), juice and coffee.
* Bouchon French toast, which was a rounded stack of delicious brioche with alternating layers of custard and apples, served with maple syrup.

Corned beef hash has nice size dices of corned beef and potatoes along with peppers and onions. Nothing like you get in a diner. The eggs were perfectly poached and completed the yummy meat filled dish.

Let's see. We were hungover and just wanted a good brunch. They kept us waiting for over 45 minutes for a table even though there was no wait. The waiter kept apologizing and even came to tell us that they had spilled water on our table and were clearing it up.

We sat down..just happy to have food. Waited another 15 minutes for the waiter. Ordered. Waited another 30 minutes for food. 10 minutes later when we asked where our coffee was you know what the waitress told us? ""Oh so I was bringing the coffee when I spilled it but I'm going to get another one right now"".  Er, okay? Either that's their rule for whenever they're lagging or she really did coat her hands with butter. Several people ordered the French toast which tasted like we were eating pure sugar. No joke. Like sugar out of the sugar jar. Maybe mixed with a little bit of honey and with sugar and honey in the shape of pears on top. Plus, they brought us hot coffee with straws in it..who dOES that?? Not straws to mix..7\/11 huge straws where you drink slushies out of them.

Bouchon put together a really dinner nice menu for restaurant week.  The table started with a large bowl of pitted olives and 1 tasty salmon rillette each.  I would go back just to eat the rilletes, they were salty silky perfection.  The next course was a tomato salad which was dressed with a flavorful basil dressing. I really loved this salad because I am crazy about tomatoes.  For the main, we chose the trout which was beautifully presented and came with tons of toasted almonds and green beans.  The portion was very satisfying and it was cooked nicely but I had trout earlier that day from DB Brasserie and DB's was quite a bit better.

D's steak was good, though he was disappointed that the fries weren't house-made or more special.

I started off with a soy latte which came in a very cute and tiny glass cup and a straw. It was extremely smooth without a hint of bitterness or overcooked soy flavor. they brought us chilled butter and freshly made jam, along with a mini pan epi bread. I wish the bread was softer, but the flavor was very good and yeasty. Attention to detail was incredible. For instance, the chilled butter had a paper cover with the Bouchon logo which was peeled off right after serving.
My friend selected the raspberry beignets as her pastry. They were served at room temperature and covered with granulated sugar. The inside was filled with a generous amount of fresh raspberry jelly.
I ordered one of their specialty items, the Croque Madame. The waiter suggested ordering the egg fried. The yolk was barely cooked at all, which is less than the way that I normally cook it, but it was delicious mixed in with the rest of the dish.

Furthermore, I thought it was a buffet - silly me.  I didn't put two and two together (Thomas Keller restaurant, Venetian, $$$$, probably not a buffet).

Then I had a daily special, a fluffy spinach quiche with fresh baby greens and vinaigrette dressing.
Another friend had butternut squash soup which tasted just like the one you get out of the box at Trader Joes.
Another friend had a fancy french toast, and the last friend had a fancy  omlet.

Less-than-adequate service and lackluster food had ruined what I had set up to be the Thomas Keller standard.  When a group of 8 of us were looking for one fancy dinner in Las Vegas, I decided to give TK another shot - and wow, it was totally worth it.

After drinks at the bar, we sat down and after ordering, were immediately offered giant amounts of delicious bread and butter as well as freshly roasted pistachios.  I had soupe à l'ognion to start, and it was delicious.  A rich, beefy broth poked through the gruyère crisply melted on top.  My friends who had the rillettes du saumon were so pleased with their appetizer that they simultaneously insisted on giving bites to the whole table and guarded what remained jealously.  It was, in a word, superb.

My entrée was the trout, and it was fantastic.  It was flat, with a wonderful melange of roasted cauliflower, croutons, crispy potatoes and tangy olives and capers on top.  The acid worked perfectly with the mild trout flavor, and it was one of the most superb fish dishes I have had in a long time.

Before ordering dessert, I was disappointed that there was no cookie plate as I knew that there usually were macarons served.  I had been searching for macarons all day, to no avail.  I slyly asked the waitress if the pastry chef might have any hiding in the back, and she said she wasn't sure but that she would check.  I ordered the profiteroles (which were incredible), and then after dessert was served, the waitress delivered a box of four GIANT macarons to the table just for me.  ""It's our pleasure,"" she said.  ""You seemed so genuinely upset that they weren't there, so we went down to the bakery to find them for you.""  Now THAT is the Thomas Keller service standard I've heard so much about.

All in all, this was a wonderful experience for our one ""fancy dinner"" in Vegas.  If I ever came back to Vegas (which, you know, might happen since I have a magician boyfriend), Bouchon would be first on my list.",1,1,1

They got my order wrong too.

Soupe Provencal very bland. Took a while to get our waiter to bring some salt & pepper for it.

Strawberry tart, meh.  Was bitter as the orange pate sucree had too much rind.  Johnny cake cobbler had a very strong flour taste, yuck.

The Bouchon cocktail at the BH location is better.  Plus the butter here isn't honey butter.

Still... Overall not bad, especially for Vegas.  The Julia Child promotional prix fixe was a good deal.  The pork portion was huge, almost disgustingly so.  Desserts were also quite big.",0,0,0

Sadly they were out of their pistachio maracons so instead we had the coffee one and a red velvet cupcake. Their macarons are very delish and so fresh just they way they should be.

I don't know what waa going on, maybe a bad day? I noticed while I was waiting that all the servers looked upset or in an unfriendly mood. That struck me as odd.

Then my food arrived, bland and tasteless at best. Gaufres au Levain $14.50 (waffle with Carmel banana, walnuts and cream). I could have made AMAZING moist waffles at home, to come to a fine dining resteraunt you want better than what you could do yourself. Isn't that the point lol.

We were in Vegas for a friend's bachelor party.  I suggested Bouchon because I've been there before and enjoyed it.  We had a reservation at 8:45pm on Saturday.  Got there on time to find out that they still needed to prep our table.  Really?  Didn't get seated till 9:10pm.  What's the point of making a reservation? A buddy complained to the manager about the wait.  The manager apologized, saying it was a misunderstanding and gave us a free round of Chimay.  

We ordered our food and tried to enjoy the rest of the night.  It took 70 MINUTES for them to bring out our food.  Wow!  On top of that, the food wasn't even cook properly.  Bouchon is known to have the best french fries around.  The fries came out overcooked.  The steaks were undercooked and bland.  On the bright side, the moules-frites were pretty good.  No one finished their food.

The manager came by and tried to offer us free desserts.  We told him we're not trying to get free stuff.  We just want to be respected and treated right.  The waiter was nice, so we ended up giving him a decent tip.  As we were walking out, the manager and waiter were waiting at the door with another free round of Chimay.  He KNEW they were at fault.

My favorite is the croque madame which is toasted ham and cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce served with French fries (a lot too!!!).  The mornay sauce is my favorite! It's light but yet very flavorful!

Their french toast is also really enjoyable!  Bread pudding style with warm layers of brioche, custard & apples. Served with maple syrup.  Because it's bread pudding style, it's very moist!  It's great if you love french toast but really REALLY love bread pudding!!

Lyonnaise potatoes are really good too! I've had some before but never like at Bouchon!  I've had them where they were just dry, but here the onions, the oil and the parsley all came together and created the best lyonnaise potatoes I've ever tasted!!

French onion soup - very good!

Frisee Salad with poached egg!  Good but I'm not sure if it was $14 good!  The poached egg did make the salad very good though.

Steak frites! Delicious!  The meat was cooked to perfection!! Medium rare was what I had requested!  the maître d'hôtel butter that came with the steak was delicious!  Made the steak tasty!

The Good:
- Amazing french onion soup
- Bread at start of meal is incredible and butter too
- Roast chicken and side of frites were perfection
- Food generally delicious and all the sides were good too

- Hostesses at front were friendly and cheerful but lacked the professionalism and poise you would expect at a fancy restaurant (Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, Le Cirque, West Restaurant, etc).. they seemed young and inexperienced and it started off the whole experience like we were being seated at a Red Robin (ouch!)
- Decor was nice and warm, very large room
- Very casual for an expensive french restaurant.. some like this but I generally prefer to dress up if I am going to spend hundreds of dollars
- No butter plates or knives provided.. eat bread off the paper tablecloth.. casual and fun but also messy!

- Cocktails are a little unimaginative and all were too sweet -- waiter also agreed (""The Last Word"" cocktail was decent tho)
- Many of our dishes came out cold
- Table by the doors\/windows were very cold\/drafty

Details that a restaurant like this shouldn't miss often were: not clearing bread crumbs before setting down appetizers, leaving water glasses empty, etc. The waiter would disappear for large periods at a time. He often didn't know who ordered what.

The food was also lackluster. Although my mushroom soup was fine, the steak I ordered was prepared with a shallot sauce that wasn't listed on the menu. When I complained to the waiter he said that he was ""fairly certain"" he described the preparation to me because he usually does. He later brought out a replacement that was bloody red, not the medium I had ordered. I ended up paying $35 for a steak I barely touched.

A nod to the baker; I could have eaten an entire epi with the butter and been perfectly satisfied.  The bread was perfect.

After chatting with our waiter and telling him how much we liked our first course the kitchen sent out a taster of sweetbreads on gnocchi which was AMAZING!!

But, if any one do 'em right it's Keller. These mussels were really, really good. I almost lost track of myself and started drinking the broth. There were so many mussels that I stuffed myself. I haven't stuffed myself in a restaurant in years. My girlfriend's steak was cooked perfectly served with a nice compound butter on top nestled next to a mountain of fries. 

The table next to us ordered the exact same thing. One of the diners was really upset that he couldn't get any steak sauce with his steak. Then, he tried to order French's mustard. The waiter did a great job of handling that. 

It was somewhat slow and we were invited to take a tour of the kitchen.  The hot line was spotless.  I was shocked.  I've seen brand new kitchens that hadn't served food yet that weren't that clean.

I am so glad Anthony Bourdain came here on an old episode of No Reservations. He was right; they have AWESOME French fries here. When a chef says another chef has better [insert dish name here] you have to try it. Not having enough time to come here for dinner, we ended up eating brunch here. Note: they do not take reservations for breakfast or lunch; only dinner (and go to OpenTable.com).  We arrived around 1pm and was quoted a 20-minute wait. After a few minutes in the foyer and some free Madeline cookies, we decided to sit at the bar instead. We figured the service would be faster and we could watch the bartenders make drinks and the oyster shuckers work their magic. Unfortunately, our order was placed at 1:23pm and we did not get our food until 2:10pm. The bartenders that put in the order were baffled as well on how screwed up the kitchen was. They kept looking at the receipt (that is preprinted when the order is placed) and at the clock above the bar then disappearing into the kitchen, only to tell us it would be a ""moment."" Aside from this, the food was fantastic.

+ Croque Madame - ham sandwich with an egg on top and a MOUNTAIN of fries
+ Lobster Bisque - I loved it because it didn't have the distinct white wine taste and you can see the lobster; also they add apples to it. Weird huh?
+ Sourdough Waffles - didn't taste like sourdough but it was wonderful! Fresh strawberries, powdered sugar, vanilla bean butter and syrup?! Nothing was wrong with this dish.

Notes: the restaurant is located in the Venezia Tower (go towards the guest rooms' elevators and take it up to the 10th floor and walk across the sky bridge.) You can request outdoor seating when you're making the reservation. The attire is pretty casual. The people next to us were in swimsuits underneath their clothes and I saw someone else in PJ bottoms.

I can't wait to come back for dinner on my next trip.

We received a text message that our table was ready and we were promptly seated. Very shortly our waiter Matt came over to get our drink orders.

I was extremely happy with this suggestion because I didn't want the typical Mimosa or Bellini and it was not overly sweet but the perfect amount of strawberry flavor.

We then placed out food orders, but unfortunately they had run out of the rock Shrimp Hash that Matt said was deeeelicious (our fault for getting there so late).

-Croque Madame: it's like taking the most perfect eggs benedict you can imagine, replacing the types of bread, and then making the dish even more delectable and delicious.

Okay, now to my review of my overall experience.

We got to the restaurant on a Sunday at around 12pm to have brunch. Like a boss, we were seated within five minutes of arriving. ***DISCLAIMER: THERE ARE NO BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS HERE.*** Kind of the first thing I look for when I go to any Sunday brunch, nowadays. Don't worry, I don't have a problem.

Chocolate croissant: Flakiest chocolate croissant I've ever had with slivers of almond and a drizzle of chocolate on top. Absolutely perfect.

Raspberry beignets: Not my favorite of the selection because the raspberry jam within the beignet was too sweet and the entire thing was just coated with sugar, so too sweet for my taste, but hey, who's to say this won't be the perfect fancy donut hole for some other brunch go-er.

Steak Frites: Those frites tho. They are probably the best I've ever had. Next to anything with truffle oil on them. So, take note, Bouchon, I like truffle fries as much as the next person. Can I get an 'amen?' Steak was cooked perfectly and covered with onions. Now, if you're weird like me and don't like the taste of the onions, then refrain, refrain, refrain from ordering this. Or you can ask them to omit the onions, but I'd rather get the food the way that it's supposed to come. 

Chicken and Waffles: Bacon, bacon and bacon. Whaaat? Yeah. If you're looking for greasy fried chicken, you're not gonna get it with their version. It is a roasted half chicken with a side of chive waffles. And you guessed it, there's also bits of bacon in the chive waffles. Also comes with a side of gravy that comes with plenty of, you guessed it again, bacon. I was halfway expecting the maple syrup to be bacon infused. But I didn't even use the maple syrup, so I guess I'll never know. The chicken was moist, the skin slightly charred and the gravy added the perfect saltiness that the chicken needed. The waffles were a perfect balance of sweet and salty. 

I, also, ordered a coffee, which they kept filling and piping hot. 

The overall experience was great. I have no complaints. The service is the best. Make sure you ask to sit in Adam's section.",1,1,1

The tomatoes were vine ripened.  The sweet 100 tomatoes were perfectly sweet, the other tomatoes maybe lemon girl and a brandywine heirloom were ok.  The salad had a basil infused olive oil with cheviere cheese.  It was good.  The service was ok but not the very best. We also got creme brulee and it was good again not the best.  We also had the onion soup, it was ok, too salty.  I make a better one.  That's at least 2 dishes I think I cook better than what I was served.  The meal tab was $130 without tip.

Each of my three visits since then have not strayed from fantastic. It's no secret that I am a huge fan of Thomas Keller and I'm simply grateful that I can access one of his restaurants easily.

A beautiful restaurant with wonderful views of the Venetian courtyard, floor-to-ceiling windows, but it doesn't feel too fancy with the bustling atmosphere. It's such a wonderful setting for breakfast or brunch and catching up with old friends. The service is always phenomenal. On my last visit (09\/08\/13), our server and busser were both so friendly with great personalities! My friend and I had so much fun interacting with them. The server was even kind enough to write down the details of the special since I want to report it accurately for my review and photos! He even signed the paper, haha.

I have tried the Croque Madame, French Toast, Salmon Tartare, Omelette Du Jour (12\/31\/11), Chicken and Waffles, Beignets, and Breakfast Pot Pie. I have also tried their French 77 and Hibiscus cocktails. Everything is really great! On my most recent trip, the Breakfast Pot Pie was the chef's special composed of a Bouchon puff pastry, scrambled eggs, cherry heirloom tomatoes, country gravy, and crispy bacon and served with Pommes Persillade. The ""Chicken and Waffles"" is a dish I will always go back to even though I want to try so many other dishes. The roasted chicken is always juicy, skin crispy, and with the Sauce Chasseur, really savory. Paired with the bacon and chive waffles and maple syrup. The perfect sweet and salty relationship. The pot pie was actually my least favorite of all the dishes I've had.

I absolutely recommend Bouchon for a nice brunch with a loved one, a great setting for a morning date! Always check out the chef's specials for the day as well!",6,1,3

Price is surprisingly acceptable for a fancy restaurant like this one. I only went there for breakfast and had the Croque Madame which is basically like an Eggs Benedict with Toast instead of Muffin. It is however one of the best I have ever had when it comes to an Egg and Ham sandwich. The toast was grilled to perfection which adds to the overall texture and taste. I would come back and try for a dinner item for sure!!!,0,0,0

Bouchon has long been known as one of the top places for a fine high-end lunch in Las Vegas. It's Ironic how the Venetian Hotel tries to mimic the Italian and streets of Venice style, but yet they host a top-of-the-line French restaurant. Whatever sells right? The Palazzo seemingly has 10 Fine Italian restaurants to make up for it.

The staff was extremely friendly as they seated us, though the wait times were long (French style cuisine always seems to be relaxed and not rushed). 

While waiting, we read many Yelp reviews and photos to help us make a decision. We were going to get the famous spiced beignets (I love French and Creole beignets), but the chef reminded us the special of the day was a rasberry beignet, so we decided to try it out. It came with two warm, sugar coated beignets (different than Louisiana's creole powdered ones) oozing with rasberry sauce. The sauce was great and had fresh fruit, and it was very good, but it was basically a high-end krispy kreme donut. I'm not sure it was a beignet at all. Though I enjoyed it.

I ordered the croque madame after passing on the sourhdough waffles and french toast (which both had great reviews - next time!), and it was 3 star worthy. $19 for a French sandwhich which had a poached\/fried (half\/half it seemed) egg on top with hamm and a sweet French sauce. I enjoyed it, though it came with way too many fries (unlimited said the waiter) and I wish instead of all that fries, maybe a small waffle or something else instead would make it better. The bread was half fried, half soft - so it had a great texture to it. Wasn't worth the money and wasn't amazing, but definitely good.

My friend ordered the famous Bouchon Chicken and Waffles. If you like Roscoe's or Grand Luxe's Chicken & Waffles, you'll enjoy Bouchon's. If you don't care for chicken & waffles, skip this - it's just an improved version of it. The chicken is French rotisserie style (not fried) and is extremely juicy and you can tell it's been marinated for a while. I loved the chicken. The waffle is fluffy and comes with two sauces - a regular maple syrup and a famous salty bacon broth which ad a salsa-like consistency with whole premium bacon strips. I loved the bacon salsa with the waffle. A mixture of salty and sweet.

Total damage. $60 for a lunch. If you enjoy French food and want a non-buffet fine meal option, check out Bouchon.",3,1,1

It was the best breakfast I had on this trip...er, although I as subject to convention food breakfast, so relatively speaking it honestly doesn't take much to be a best breakfast.

That's not to say the food was bad. No, it was very very good.

Our waiter, whose name I do not recall sadly, led us through some recommendations that we were very happy with.

* Sweetbreads to start. Mmm, glands. It was on the specials chalkboard.
* Pan roasted trout, piled with vegetables. With clear eyes on the fish head. Fresh!
* Chicken and waffles. Yummy. Is it really French? Do I care?

And lots of coffee. 

Definitely the priciest of breakfasts, and worth it.

We admired the selection of absinthe at the bar, and also the good beers on tap. 

I couldn't really feel any ""food magic"" in the space. It felt like the typical good food decadence I feel in the strip area of Vegas.  But if I can walk into a restaurant, see the food I'm eating, and dine without hearing the endless bings and bonks of casino machines, I'm pretty happy.
Service and food can't be faulted for anything, for my experience. But I was bummed that the people at two small tables nearby me seemed unhappy. One duo effectively dined alone, as their food arrived 15 minutes apart and there was never a time they had food together on the table. Another, um, gererously portioned couple seemed unhappy with the size of their meals. 
Since casinos are probably not very far away from handing out collectible feed sacks to strap to our faces in the buffets, I leave it to the latter couple to sort out what best meets their dining expectations.  For the former, the management came and resolved the issue as best they could and I admire the duo for leaving the waiter a very generous tip, as the timing of the food preparation was not his fault.

I've done a dinner here, as well as a brunch. It was very good, but I probably don't need to return for a meal. Bouchon has kind of blown its wad and I don't get the impression that an encore is necessary.
Maybe for some absinthe, or a pastry from the bakery.",2,2,2

Croque Madame was good but did not surpass my favorite place for it in SF (Butler and the Chef). The shellfish platter was a disappointment though. The oysters were okay but the raw clams tasted very oceany. Not a good thing with seafood, raw or cooked.

This is the perfect place to take Mom or Grandma for lunch!

Delicious! I ordered my burger medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly. It arrived with accompanying sides of creamy horseradish mayo, and ketchup.

I chose Bouchon because most people I've talked to raves about Thomas Keller and his establishments, and its location was convenient.

I made a reservation well in advance (like in Jan, and we dined here 2\/16) and snatched a nice table for two at 7:00pm.  Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable and made our dining experience very enjoyable.  I loved that the restaurant was open and airy and BIG, and doesn't give off that claustrophobic and dark vibe many French restaurants tend to give off. The menu wasn't this big, stuffy, heavy book but was instead doubled as a napkin holder, made of a thin piece of paper. Clever.  

After we had heard all the specials, I decided on the french onion soup and crispy sea bass in a creamy sauce made of chives with crepes of parsnip.  Bf opted for the steak frites.  His steak frites were about the best steak frites I've ever tasted.  French onion soup was PERFECT......perfect cheese, perfect soup, perfect in every way.  My fish was indeed crispy and tender and delicious, but somehow lacking that ""wow"" factor I was looking for. Maybe because the parsnips crepes were kinda bleeechhhhh.

Service, as I expected was top-notch, especially the water\/drinks waiter.  He deserves 5 stars for his attentiveness and consideration.

Dessert: really really good.  we had the tropical sundae which was a medley of sorbets: cherry, mango, and coconut, bathing in a tangy tropical ""soup"" and topped with fruits (raspberries, kiwis, mangoes).  Absolutely delish.

Overall, I'd like to give it five stars, because the food, service, and price were all very impressive.  The atmosphere of the place was also very nice.

Took my girlfriend to watch the Lion King (LOVED IT) in December and we were so excited to try this place for brunch. After waiting an exhaustive period of time and watching hordes of people that came after us be seated before us, we confronted the host about it. They realized they totally screwed us so they immediately sat the 2 of us at a booth that could have easily sat around 6 people. OK, that's cool I guess...

When my girlfriend asks our server if they have vanilla lattes he answers without any hesitation: ""no."" A bus boy working in the vicinity over hears us and actually tells us that they do make those because he used to work the espresso bar (I guess he got demoted for knowing too much?!).  Whatever, we are still trying enjoy the experience... 

We ended up ordering the Croque Madame, Corned Beef Hash, and some waffles. Croque Madame, ooh sounds fancy huh? Let me break it down for you: ham and cheese with egg on top. Sounds simple & delicious, well it should be UNLESS the bread is BURNT beyond edibility. After telling the waiter, he explains to us that's how the croque madame is supposed to be. We literally had to take one side of the bread and break it in front of him using both hands. Don't get me wrong, crispy\/crunchy bread can be delicious, but this was not that. This was Wolverine-adamantium solid and burnt. The waiter then says to us, ""yea ok, that looks pretty burnt""...

We then had a run-in with his manager. You would think at a high end establishment he would come to our table to let us know that we were being taken care of. No! Instead he tells that the bread might come out the same way. WTF?! Anyways, the next one comes and it's perfectly fine, go figure! Corned beef hash...sigh. Why do I always feel the need to order corned beef hash at a fancy place when I know Hormel corned beef hash is simply the best?! Waffles were good. We really wanted to like this place, trust me.

Day 1- Omelet du jour (spinach, mozzarella and tomato) and a side of bacon and the Strawberry champagne cocktail. 
- The presentation was lovely, the omelet was perfectly whipped and was almost too pretty to eat. The gravy boat of bacon was also a treat.

Sour Dough waffle - Totally different experience! The waffle was detectible, light and fluffy and the vanilla bean butter melted in my mouth! I would go back again and again for this dish.

It is expensive, but not more expensive than the other upscale restaurants in the Palazzo\/Venetian complex.  We also know this is Mr. Keller's ""bistro"" play, it has been much documented.  And I love French bistro food, my favorite kind on earth.  So 2 stars?  Here's why:

Service: At these prices you expect excellent service.  We had two tables of 8 each, next to each other, and all I can say is that the service was no better than what you would hope to receive at a Chili's.  Timing was off, smiles were rare, it took forever to deliver a glass of cranberry juice to the one person not drinking wine.  Clean-up was either too early or too late.  Just a mess.  Unacceptable at a restaurant of this rep.

Food:  Yes, pommes frites are a staple of bistros, and Bouchon is known for theirs, but the volume of fries was overwhelming.  At the end of the meal we all sat looking around and laughing at the endless piles of frites that nobody could finish.  I had a flatiron steak, asked for it medium rare, it arrived well done.  I could have sent it back, but given the service I didn't want to chance it, so chewed (and chewed and chewed) it down.  Steak quality was mediocre.  Had a endive\/watercress salad that truly was nothing special.  The walnut vinaigrette did nothing to enhance the bitter endive, think it made it worse.  Ostensibly there was some Roquefort cheese in the salad, but about 4 little nibbles, added nothing to the rest of the salad - disintegrated.  I know times are tight, but this is a double digit priced salad, c'mon.  Nobody raved about their entree, in fact, I think people were expecting something special and kind of stared at what was delivered.

Wine:  A pretty fair list, and while not reasonably priced, I've seen more outrageous pricing elsewhere.  But it was predictable, mainly French, with a nice representation from the major regions, but nothing unique or intriguing.  Very safe list.  If this is a bistro there should be some more fun, and less pricey, bistro-y choices like Cru Bourgeois from Bordeaux, a longer list of Provencal wines, some unique choices from Cali.  I could have put this list together in my sleep, and the sommelier and wine service was pretty sleepy and sloppy as well.

But it isn't.  Bouchon has to be judged based on what it is: a (supposedly) elegant, innovative, and exceptional Thomas Keller outpost, on a mezzanine level of one of Vegas's nicer hotels.  

I came here with three other friends the week after my birthday, and wasn't really impressed.  While this might be a product of stratospheric expectations, there were some pretty basic things that stand out as very average and generic.  

Let's start with the ambiance--the decor is impressive; nice without being overbearing.  The patio (we didn't sit there, but we checked it out) was an incredible, almost Shakespearean paradise.  But there was a white paper table cloth covering our table.  Eeek.  Seemed a little counter-to the attempt at elegance, to me.

Our waiter was friendly, and I would have liked him, had he been serving me at Red Lobster or Texas Roadhouse.  But in a nice place, I would have liked less down-to-earth friendliness and more formal stoicism.  At least TRY to uphold the atmosphere.

The food was good but not great, and nothing came close to wowing me to the point of NEEDING the food again.  The closest that came was the bone marrow (which I'm a sucker for anyway), but as far as bone marrow that I've had, it was pretty standard.

So what to do? Settle for his other nearest restro- Bouchon! 

Bouchon is not a Vegas flashy restaurant and it won't cost you an arm and a leg. The price is very reasonable. You also get that great customer service (as we did). Bouchon is located in a weird hidden spot and we actually made resos 2 months in advance, we didn't really know how busy it'll be... so we decided not to risk it. FYI it wasn't that busy when we went, but then again it was a Sunday night. 

We started off with the table bread- which was delicious and homemade as they have their own bakery. My BF couldn't find a beer he liked and the server was nice enough to let him taste several. We decided to feast and ended up ordering the charcuterie plate, dozen oysters, mussels, steak frites, and bouchons dessert. Man they were all delicious! The charcuterie board came with patay and it was the best thing ever. I would love to have that to put in my Vietnamese banh mi! My entree was the mussels and they were cute small mussels but there were literally over 50 mussels! It was more than plentiful and delicious. The saffron broth was amazing. The steak was good too and the oysters were very fresh. The dessert- 3 bouchons, a pretzel ice cream and a marshmallow thing with a salted caramel bar inside was amazing. It had crazy flavors from sweet to salty to savory. 

We were VERY happy that we got to try Bouchon. It also didn't cost too much like other celebrity chef restaurants AND Thomas Keller delivered! Amazing, we'll come back next time! Totally impressed.",22,14,19

Though it's a bit frustrating to not be able to reserve a table for brunch, our party of six was quoted a 45-50 minute wait and we were seated within 20 minutes in the back room. Our server was very friendly and relaxed, giving us suggestions on cocktails and the specials before we placed our drink and beignet orders to start. The beignets were light and puffy, and absolutely stuffed with raspberry jam. I wish I had ordered some other pastries as well, but I made do with the excellent baguette and delicious blackberry preserves delivered to our table in the interim. 

Our server recommended I order the corned beef hash with poached eggs over the gravlax with more baguette. I did enjoy my dish, but after my love affair with the complimentary baguette, I couldn't help wish I had gone the other way. Tastes of the Croque Madame were also very good with the bread holding up quite nicely to the Mornay. The side of fries were also excellent, remaining crispy even as they cooled.

We came for brunch and had a delicious time!  MMM....

Best part of my meal:  raspberry jam filled beignets!!  DELICIOUS!!  This was a special but I'm sure they offer it on their regular breakfast pastry menu (house made beignets with jam, for $7.00).

I ordered the Breakfast Americaine (go figure...in a french bistro).  $22.  Comes with eggs any style, bacon, sausage, pastry of choice (get the beignets), brioche toast, orange juice, and coffee.  The orange juice was delicious!  It was so sweet and smooth - no pulp.  One of the best orange juices I've had.  Coffee was a little room temperature so I was a little disappointed.  I like it hot!  and one of the waitress\/2nd waitress wasn't overly friendly.  It seemed like she was training to be a waitress and forgot some of the specials\/orders.

My friends also ordered the waffles and they liked it.  They also loved the beignets.

They give you complimentary french baguettes that they place on the table (no basket).  Eat it right away with the butter and jam.  Otherwise, it gets really hard pretty quickly.

Service:  our waiter was nice.  He was attentive and friendly.  The other girl was ok but not super friendly.

Ambience:  like fine dining...but for brunch (less formal)

Price:  They're not too bad for ""fine dining"" type of restaurants.  They tend to be a little bit more expensive than other restaurants.  But with better food!

my first restaurant review this year goes to Bouchon Bistro at the Venetian.  

Bouchon is probably my favorite spot in Vegas. yeah i know, it's silly. we have one in Beverly Hills. but i guess it's partly sentimental, since hubby and i dined here back here when we were dating. the other part... Thomas Keller just charms me. yeah that's sentimental too! but what i really mean to say, is that TK manages to impress and delight me, and i walk away with a fond memory every time.

so i came along with hubby on his work assignment and the booger for a few days. there were just a few spots i really wanted to hit before heading home. yeah there are so many choices in Vegas and it can get pretty overwhelming. on the strip, off the strip... la la la... i had the pleasure of living in Vegas many years ago, hence i was happy to keep it simple. so on our last evening, i chose Bouchon. reminiscent of our dating days, but returning with a renewed perspective, after having dined at The French Laundry a few years ago on our babymoon.

it was a sunday evening on a 3-day weekend, we arrived a bit early for our ressie and our table wasn't ready, but we were promptly seated. when i stopped to ask if a booth table were available (for the comfort of our son), they stepped out of their way to find one. one wasn't available, but we managed to keep the little one well behaved with the godsend iPad.

the standard epi bread and butter were set on our table. the server peeled off the butter seal, revealing perfectly spreadable butter (not the kind you usually get that's still hard, straight out of the fridge - thank you) and a lovely ramekin of warm, toasted pistachios. i started off with a half dozen fresh OYSTERS and a glass of the Pinot Blanc (oui, from Alsace, Francé). hubby went for his go-to seared FOIE GRAS. for the little one, since they don't offer a kids menu, our waiter offered ""kiddie pasta"". i nodded in parental approval, asked him to put that order in right away, and my wish was granted. meanwhile hubby and i enjoyed our hors d'oeuvres somehow magically in peace. the seared FOIE GRAS was plated on toasted baguette, surrounded with friseé and a gorgeous crimson berry compote, with crunchy lightly candied whole hazelnuts. it reminded me of the Bar Tartine foie gras and jelly sandwich i had long ago (even before the foie gras ban), but this is a more grown up version. and my oysters were just sublime. two varieties were New England and i can't remember the rest, but they paired well with my Pinot Blanc. one of the highlights you will notice walking in is their gorgeous oyster bar. you cannot get those out of your mind when contemplating your meal. while the first two of them were tiny, next two were medium, then finished by two enormous sized oysters. all so fresh as if they just came off the boat, and perfectly chilled.

for our entreés, i chose from the TRUFFLE MENU.  i had never had a GNUDI before, and our server recommended it. topped with black winter truffles, how could i not indulge. hubby went back and forth deciding between the roast chicken and the LAMB SHANK, and finally decided on the latter. when my truffle pasta arrived, my eyes widened by it's pretty presentation and did wonder how i would fill up on the five little dumplings... but wiping away all my discern, that first bite was divine. the pasta layer is so delicate, you can't find where it ends and the ricotta-parmesan filling begins. such a cloudy pillow of lightness. it's cheese, but not cheesy, nor creamy. just beside myself. so happy with my choice. i will forever remember this bite, alongside the pearl and oysters from TFL. hubby's lamb shank was expertly executed. so tender and flavorful with just the right amount of fat and comforting savory. literally falling off the bone lusciousness, but i secretly wished he had chosen the roast chicken. but only because i have yet to try anything ""ordinary"" (ie. chicken, as ordinary as chicken can be!) from TK and still need to experience his take on it. but that will just call for another visit. our son's pasta arrived in perfect timing. he was settled into his entreé long before we received our mains, so that allowed our meal to flow smoothly. his pasta gently seasoned for a child. it was neither too cheesy nor buttery and it was also perfectly warmed. i didn't need to wait for it to cool for his palate. he was able to eat it as soon as it was presented to him, and picky little him ate the entire thing. wow. i'm still blown away.  i never imagined having a TK dinner go smoothly with my restless 3yo son. but it happened!

Now on to the food. The white sausage was a simple dish, but surprising yummy. One bite of the sausage and I kept eating more. The Croque Madam was very rich -- a little too greasy because we had eaten at Picasso the night before. The croissant and beignets were heaven a day later, along with their homemade jams and Nutella. There's real fresh butter in that croissant -- either that, or crack.  The food tasted very home-made and comfy.  We'd definitely come back for the food.

5 stars for steak 

Everything here is very tasty but the steak frites was the standout.  The steak is infused with delicious flavor and the fries were perfect.  One of the best steaks that I have ever tried.  Way better than most restaurants that specialize in steak only and cheaper than those types of restaurants ($36.75).  If two people are both ordering dishes that come with fries, I would recommend substituting one dish with vegetable instead of fries.  This is because one dish comes with plenty of fries for two and their vegetables are cooked superbly.  We had the sautéed green beans which were seasoned with garlic and maybe lemon.

Do you rate according to the experience, or whether or not the food was exactly your cup of tea?

The wife and I have wanted to try some celebrity chef places before we leave Vegas for good and Bouchon, being one that is willing too look the other way on.... Well, let's just say we put the ""casual"" in ""business casual"" and they seemed like an option for us.

I'll get this right out there and say that I am generally not a huge fan of French cuisine. WIth the exception of the marvelous concoctions served up by Olivier at his Baguette Cafe (Hi Olivier!), which routinely blows my socks off, and many wonderful encounters with crusty bread across the globe, the flavour profiles just don't do it for me very often. Bouchon was up against it from the beginning.

I ordered a new potato salad with egg confit, the steak Bouchon with a black truffle demiglace, and a chocolate marquise for dessert. All were good on various levels. The salad was fascinating and I was surprised how much I liked the way the raw egg yolk that crowned the whole affair oozed all over the dish. 

Steak was cooked to perfection and tasted good, but of course I just wasn't that into the glaze. I'm not one of those Philistines who smothers steaks in gloopy brown sauce from a bottle; however, I'd have preferred my steak unadorned or in a nice peppercorn sauce. Mushrooms and fungi, it turns out, don't just turn me off because of their texture -- the taste plays a part too. As I alluded to in my intro, this is personal taste preference rather than having anything to do with the quality of the dish.

The desert was suitably chocolatey and tasty, nothing I'd go running out again and again for, but pleasant and a nice way to round off an elegant meal.

Overall, the meal was tasty. The experience was amazing. So why only four stars? Well, it was nearly $200 for the pair of us without any alcohol and I find that I'd prefer to be spending that money on a week's worth of panini and chocolate tart from around the corner at The Baguette Cafe.

We tried a variety of foods from their Cinnamon Beignets du Jour - spiced doughnuts with a side of amazing house-made cherry jam and nutella, to their Poulet et des Gaufres - Roasted Chicken with Bacon-Chive Waffles (to die for), Tahitian vanilla bean butter & Chasseur (gravy), Quiche du Jour - Spinach and Cheese which was so light and airy in texture, to a few a la carte items from their pecan wood smoked bacon (highly recommended), Pommes de Terre Lyonnaise - sliced pan fried potatoes topped with parsley, and over medium eggs to dip our toasted brioche into those yolks.

We found the menu to be fairly complete - lots of great options. On top of that they had a few really excellent specials. 

We started with the bone marrow - because, when else would we ever order bone marrow?! My other half LOVED it, but unfortunately it wasn't for me. I still recommend you try it! If we go back I'll probably try the fois gras instead. Our entrees were the lamb and the saffron muscles. Both were beautifully prepared and presented... and delicious!!!

We were deciding between Bouchon, American Fish, and Bartolotta.  However, two members of our party had dined at Bouchon and suggested it.  

We had an 8:30pm reservation and arrived about 20 minutes early to have a drink or two at the bar.  It was pretty packed so we grabbed a bar table in the bar area.  Not once did a server come by to bring us water or take a drink order.  We went up to the hostess to express our concern and see if they could send someone over to help us.  Before anyone came by, the hostess came and escorted us to our table outside on the patio.  She was aware of the situation so we assumed that our service from that point on would be impeccable. Boy were we wrong!

Once seated at our table, another 15 minutes passed before or waiter even came by to greet us.  We had to flag down a bus boy for waters!  Upon our waiter visiting, he was friendly and warm but it did not make up for the start of the meal.  They had a few specials on the menu where one struck our immediate interest.  However, when we went to order it, the kitchen was out of it.

Moving on to the food.  We ordered the salmon rillette appetizer which was delicious.  We also each ordered the endive salad per our waiter's recommendation.  It was tasty but nothing extraordinary.  I have had many better salads in my day for half the cost.  For our entrees, we ordered the chicken, salmon, and trout.  All were very tasty but nothing to rave about.  I was expecting much more from Thomas Keller. 

Back to the service.  We had ordered the Pommes Frittes as a side dish.  A very simple side dish we presumed.  However, it never came.  When we asked our waiter about the status of the dish, he said it is on his way.  However, having been a waiter for a fine dining establishment, I can pick up on when a waiter messes up and when the kitchen messes up.  Immeditaley after I ask about the status of our fries, he ran to the computer and began inputing what I presume was the fries.  To make a long story short, after much reassurence they were coming, they never came.  

We finally had enough and decided to call over the manager to make her aware of our experience.  She seemed very sorry and apologized but only proceeded to take off our apps and drinks from the bill.  You would think that our meal would have been taken care of.  Lastly, we were celebrating two birthdays that weekend in Vegas and I made Bouchon aware when we made our res.  However, they did nothing to acknowledge that.  

Overall a very dissapointing experience.  With all of the great restaurants in Vegas, I will never be returning to Bouchon and I suggest you check out many of the better offerings of Sin City.",0,0,0

We came as a group of 6 on a Saturday morning for brunch. We only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table which was surprising. We were given water to start and most of us ordered bellinis or mimosas; my fiancé also got a Bloody Mary. 

We ordered some beignets to share as a starter. What we didn't know was that they actually gave us two orders of them even though we only wanted one. Sneaky Bouchon Bistro! We also received French Bread which was awesome. 

The chicken and waffles was amazing. To die for. Bacon and chive waffles with sweet maple syrup, roasted tender chicken with homemade gravy. Oh man!!!! It was perfect. It also came with a little vanilla bean butter which was the perfect complement to the savory waffles. My fiancé had corned beef hash which was also awesome and house made. One friend ordered truffle fries as a substitute for the regular and it was $6 to substitute - beware! Another friend never received her side of spinach that she had ordered. 

When it came time for the check, the waiter brought one big check for all six of us. We asked him to remove the spinach and split up the checks. He came back and had removed the spinach but it was still one big check. We asked him again to split up the checks, telling him my fiancé and I were together and everyone else needed separate checks. He came back with one check for my fiancé and I, and one check for everyone else. He had to go back a third time and split everyone's checks up separately. I think he was either hungover or having a rough morning, but it was frustrating after dropping $100 on a meal for two.

I had the mussels which came in a pot which was separated into two parts, one with mussels and a small one without so that you could dip into the amazing white wine sauce without sifting through shells.  The mussels also came with the fries which Anthony Bourdain mentioned which are definitely amazing.  I'm not sure if I'd go with best ever, but they were definitely hot, crispy and delicious.  

My mom had the trout, which came as a whole fish split in half and covered with veggies which were cooked perfectly, soft but not mushy.  There was some sauce over it and the combination of all of it was magically delicious.

My dad had the special of the night, scallops.  The portion was a little bit small, but the quality was fantastic.  The scallops were cooked absolutely perfectly, seared on one side but not rubbery at all.  

The best part of the meal was the appetizer special, some kind of puff pastry with veal something or other on top with foie gras sauce.  This was the best few bites of food I've ever had in Vegas.  Period.  

The appetizer alone would have been enough to give Bouchon 5 stars, but unfortunately, I can't give all 5 because the waiter wasn't that friendly or helpful and they screwed up my reservation and made it an hour earlier even though I had received a confirmation from Opentable for the correct time.  They still seated us right away because it wasn't busy, but I shudder to think of the wait if we had walked in 30 minutes later because the restaurant was packed.

It's a beautiful restaurant, with high ceilings, booths upholstered in blue velvet, and an impressive display of fresh shellfish on ice. The service is nearly impeccable.

We went for brunch, which, I think, is my favorite meal at Bouchon. When you sit down, they bring a baguette that is just fantastic, with ramekins of butter and apricot preserves. Bread and butter is one of my favorite things to eat anyway, but when it's superlative bread and exceptional butter, it's one of the very best things.

One of the specials was Country Hash (potatoes, Merguez sausage, red peppers, red pepper hollandaise), and it was savory and earthy and really, really good.

The Croque Madame was fantastic as well--your traditional grilled ham and cheese sandwich, on buttery brioche, topped with a perfectly cooked egg, and sauce Mornay (a cheesy cream sauce). 

I've been saving the best for last--the Chicken & Waffles. I'm not sure that it's really chicken (if it is, it's a very petite chicken), but you're served a breast, thigh, and leg of perfectly roasted chicken.

The bread is fresh - probably about a couple of hour's hold - crispy crust - soft and moist interior. The bread was served with little ramicans of butter - and you just grab a piece of a ""branch"" of the bread. 

Had a few items during my visit

Coquilles St. Jacques Poêlés
Somewhat of a light meal - but rich in flavor and texture. The Scallops were done perfectly, with not the texture of being coming rubber. Fork tender meat - with a nice serving of muschrooms. The sauce was rich in it's own right, a nice complement to the Scallops. 

Sorbet aux Fruits
It tasted good! Fresh pear sorbet - tasted as a real pear on a summer's afternoon. 


Pork delmonico chop, Brussels sprouts, red wine-glazed pears & roasted shallot pork jus
The pork chop was cooked exquisitely, perfectly done, nice amount feeling like a cave-man when eating this. The Brussels sprouts were a nice touch - but the red-wine glazed pears made the dish. A good natural sweetness (and tang?) to contribute to the savory-ness of the pork. The sauce it-self was sweet with the taste of pears - and some of the notes of the wine. Nice way to end a long day at work. 


Crème brûlée
First, it was delicious - a very sweet treat. The sugar was crispy; a floating crystal lake of sugar atop a soft-solid that is crème. The crème had a hint of vanilla, but the better part was it had black pepper in the dessert. A great spice kick and it was unexpected.  Bit of advice, it comes in a ramican that measures about 8"", once dish can easily serve two. 


Service

As common LA folk (hahaha) we didn't know hwat all the facny words meant but basically it was a trout with green beans and almond pieces. While it doesn't sound amazing (and it has its head, not a fillet if you are squemish) it was very good. 

Florentine quiche with a side salad was amazing! I never like quiches but this savory custard melted in my mouth. Oh my goodness. Get it if you do not like fried items like the croque madame. 

Over all our bill was 98 for four girls and 5 glasses of various juices. 

They also serve a special bread with butter and a special preserve. You must try the preserves even if all you want is rich butter! It is quite tasty and different... like a secret mix of spices and fruit. Not quite strawberry and not quite orange marmalade. Sadly, the bread was no hot... and I was disappointed more so when some of it was ice cold. 

But being hungry\/hung over\/tired this is a eloquent place to eat.",1,1,2

In comparison to it's counterparts, Joel Robouchon and L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon, it falls significantly short. Service is still impecciable but Bouchon has definately lost it's cordial lustre for me. And here's why...

The heart of French pastry has stopped beating here. The assortment of pastries are lazy and heavy, made not in fluff or layers but the same as a common American bakery. I had to choke down most of it with my juice. The same stale and hard bread is served for brunch and dinner service.

Most menu items still hail French titles but oddly taste and feel like American dishes deconstructed to have hints of French. Strange, I honestly thought Bouchon was a French restaurant. 

If Thomas Keller is really known for his stellar dining experiences, I would bet that Bouchon isn't responsible for any of it.",3,2,2

\/\/ FOOD \/\/
Croque Madame: Toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg and sauce Mornay served with French fries. I thought this dish was a little heavy, but it was a perfect dish to share. The flavors were on point and with a little Tabasco sauce it made it even better. I just loved how you break the yolk on the egg and it runs down the whole brioche. I would recommend this dish for sure. 

Poulet et des Gaufres: Basically this is a chicken and waffles dish. It comes with a roasted chicken, a bacon-chive waffle, Tahitian vanilla bean butter & sauce Chasseur which is like a thick gravy with pieces of mushroom and other vegetables. The vanilla bean butter was on point with the waffle! The roasted chicken was tender and still juicy.

Love Bouchon for the obvious that I'm sure everyone else stated before. Thomas Keller with that Bistro more affordable feel. The meal we had though took it over the top. If you watch a lot of food shit on television than you can see how I was so brainwashed into what we indulged in tonight. Key words: fresh bread, fresh seafood, foie gras, and TRUFFLES!!

Started with that amazing bread they bring out baked fresh onsite that reminds you of daily breakfast strolling the streets of Paris. Crusty on outside and chewy soft inside. Rub that housemate butter and dijon mustard. Yes!

Next we shared an assortment of the oysters available. Fuck the freshness is so damn good. Yes, you pay for them here and yes it's the same anywhere else but I love it when it's fresh.

Next had the escargot and crispy duck leg. Escargot is wonderful because of all the butter. What was a nice touch was the pastry baked on top. Loved it. Crispy duck leg was too salty and didn't enjoy it. Would have been really good based on how it was cooked but just added to much salt to it. 

Some Pinot Noir to wash it down and get ready for what's next. 

Pan seared Foie Gras. Woo Hoo. Damn this was so rich and amazing. I just prefer it seared in its natural fatty goodness over the mousse option which I'm sure is wonderful too. I want to just eat this with their bread. What a treat. Felt guilty eating it but you're in Vegas.

Also with the Foie Gras they brought out a Ribeye with fries. Your ""Steak Frites"" but a ribeye and we added TRUFFLES. For the night you could add Truffles to anything for $25. Damn I wish I just paid $25 and added it to everything. Please add it to my bread, salad, soup, oysters.. You get the point. Now I understand why all the chefs on TV go so nuts over this stuff. To experience true truffles cut and sliced over your food... Wow. 

If you have a chance to experience this, please let go and do it. What an amazing experience and it just exemplified to me what Vegas is all about. I heard that Jose Andres does a good Truffle showing at Bazaar too. On a side note, I was sad that the Croque Madame wasn't on the menu tonight. Probably because it was New Years Eve but I would have still ordered it with all the food we got and would have and could have and should have added TRUFFLES!!",0,0,0

Their menu was so adorable. It was made out of paper and folded around each of our table napkins. We have to unfold it to see the menu choices.

Our server was excellent. He was good at explaining what off-menu items there are. He also kept our table clean from the bread crumbs we get from eating their bread.

Our water was kept filled by other waiters and our dishes were always taken away as soon as we were finished with them.

My recommendations:
- Escargot: The escargot is served with a puffy pastry on top. The pastry was nice and crunchy and complimented the escargot pretty well.
- Pate: Very yummy spread.
- Mussels entree: The sauce and the mussels tasted pretty good.

For my entree I ordered the salmon which came with couscous. My dish did not taste salty at all and the salmon was not dry. However, I did taste some of the Steak ""Diane"" entree and it was pretty salty. The mussels entree was delicious though.

I had called ahead of time (they only take walk ins) and was told the wait could range from 10-50 minutes and seeing how it was a weekend, I was nervous it might take a while. However, we were quickly seated without having to wait and promptly greeted with water and the delicious bread (crunchy on the outside and soo soft on the inside! The strawberry jam and butter are super good too!). We definitely got a bit too excited and ordered too much for our party of 4. We started with the large seafood platter which consisted of lobster, clams, oysters, and mussels. I would recommend getting the SMALL sized platter if you're really in the mood for seafood since it was good, but we really didn't need the whole thing. I then had the chicken and waffles which were good, but not CRAZY good. The waffles are special because they have chives and you get two roasted (not deep fried) chicken legs. It comes with syrup and vanilla butter which got me excited but the vanilla butter just tastes like butter. I will say the waffles are nice and soft not like crunchy. We also had the eggs Benedict which was good (eggs poached just right) and comes with a nice side salad with a vinegrette dressing. The blueberry French toast was a bit egg-y for me but that makes it very soft so if thats your thing, I would consider it. It comes with fresh cooked blueberries and powdered sugar which is a good addition but don't make the French Toast too sweet. One person had the grilled salmon dish which I didn't try but apparently it was very moist and tender (perhaps they sueved it?). All in all, the food is a 4.5\/5 but the service is what gives this place a 5. I asked to pack up the leftover bread we had (not wanting to waste it) and they ended up giving me 4 whole fresh loaves of bread (honestly I didn't want new bread because I can't eat that much but it was very nice of them). They also gave me fresh strawberry jam, butter, and syrup to go (I had some leftover chicken and waffles). 

I know Buchon is owned by the owner of the French Laundry so I had high expectations and I felt they were well met here. While some big name resturaunts (ie ones with famous owners) aren't totally worth the hype, I think Buchon does a good job of creating high quality food with somewhat high but reasonable prices with excellent service.

Pros: Service was on point. They don't allow reservations for brunch so we decided to get here as early as we could (easier said than done after a night out in Vegas)! We arrived around 9:00 and were seated immediately which was great, I was expecting a longer wait. Our server was friendly and very attentive. Our food came out quick and our water glasses were always refilled in a timely manner.

The ambiance here is great. The decor gives it a really classy feel, much like the rest of the Venetian hotel. Huge windows bring in a lot of natural lighting. Feels like it would be a really nice place to eat at for dinner as well.

Cons: Finding the restaurant is a little tricky. You walk through the casino and the hotel lobby towards a hall that leads to a different set of elevators. The casino does have multiple signs that help point you in the right direction.

Came for a light bite dinner, but even ordering off the starter and salad portion of the menu, couldn't finish the food, and felt badly.. since it was all so yummy.

Well prepared... romantic inside, but music was inappropriate and just way too loud. Ordered some light white wine.

The dinner was just perfect...

Pan epis comes to your table without plates, so don't bother asking, as I did. So fresh and crunchy.

We started with the special chilled cantaloupe melon soup. Nice balance.. sweet, salty, creamy... yum.

We also got the starter dish of clams with sofrito. Can get salty without any kind of bread to dip and balance it out. 

Then we also splurged for the cold salmon rillettes (remember.. the week we were there, it averaged 117F!!!)... also wonderfullly rich, tasty, and slathered all over fresh crostini. 

What we just couldn't finish was a wonderful watercress and endive salad ($11) that had chunks of Roquefort cheese and this great walnut vinaigrette and large toasted half walnuts. Perfect  and light. Full of flavor and service was not pushy.

We dined in a relaxed space before heading out to the hot Strip to enjoy the night shows on the Boulevard.

It was worth the money, not as expensive as I expected, very high quality, but at the same time not as sublime as I was expecting.  The meal had one defect (remedied by them), but again, not as spot-on as I had hoped.

Service was decent; our waitress was bubbly, though not entirely attentive.  Our sommelier did a very good job of selecting a Rhone wine for about $100.

Our first course was salads, and probably the best part of the meal for me was the Salad au Frisee Lardons.  I order this dish whenever I see it on a restaurant menu, and this is one of the best that I have ever had. The addition of fresh tarragon, which complemented the very subtle vinegar from the surface of the poached egg was,...okay, yes...sublime.  I thought, ""Okay!  This is going to be awesome!""

Our next course was the Seared Fois Gras.  It was good, just good.  Served with a reduction and on a nice brioche-like round, it was a simple and classic presentation.  Yet, it didn't really marry is a way that did the foie gras justice, or as well as I have had at less-prestegious restaurants.  Almost ordered another one since I live in Fois Gras-starved CA, but I didn't think of doing that and canceling my main course (as I have done before when the Fois Gras course was worth a replay, like at Saddle Peak Lodge.)

The low point came when I ordered the Steak Bouchon.  A thick cube of ribeye about 2.5 inches in each dimension, the dish has a challenge, I think, in that there are parts of a ribeye that are less tasty (the eye) than others (the rim and tail).  I ordered medium rare, asking also what the chef would recommend -- waitress agreed.  When the dish arrived, I could tell there was a problem when I tried to stab the steak with my fork.  Tough. Overcooked.

With some effort, I cut a slice, noting that it was definitely medium, and it was entirely the ""eye"" of the ribeye.  IMO this piece cooks faster and also is more prone to getting tough due to its lower fat content.  This had both.  I tried to eat it, but at $51 I had to send it back.  When I asked the waitress if it looked medium rare to her, she shined a little flashlight on it and said, ""Well, in the kitchen it probably looks more rare than it does out here.""  I'm not really sure what that meant, as I had ordered medium rare for ME not the kitchen, and since I was the first person cutting it open (and it certainly didn't ""behave"" MR when I first pressed on it with my fork), I have no idea how someone would think this steak was serve-able.

So they fired a new steak and it was a lot better.  The Béarnaise sauce was spot-on, but all-in-all it was not a special dish, certainly not a $51 dish.  The Steak Frites is about 60% of the cost and looked just as good.

We passed on dessert, had a coffee and polished off the wine.

Would I recommend it?  Here's my thought:  I like Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  It is pricey for the quality (as well), and I think these two restaurants are pretty equivalent -- you get a bit more ""scene"" and ""scenery"" at MAG, but the quieter feel and slightly better food at Bouchon offsets that.  They are contrasts, and I'll probably be back to Bouchon with lowered expectations.",0,0,0

A restaurant tucked within the gorgeous Venetian hotel, everyone visiting Las Vegas needs to put this on their LV food destination list. The food, the atmosphere, the service was beyond delightful. If going for brunch, plan to sit outside in the garden patio of the hotel. The patio is nicely shaded so it's very comfortable despite the intense LV heat.

For brunch, I opted for the Oeufs Benedict, two eggs poached with Hobb's smoked pork loin on an English muffin, topped with Hollandaise sauce and mixed greens alongside some cocktails. My bf had the brunch special of smoked chicken apple sausage and two eggs, potato, and toast in warm skillet. They serve complimentary bread with amazing butter and jam. To share, we had a dozen of the east and west coast oysters and at the end for dessert, we had the raspberry filled Biegnets, which are jam filled sugar coated doughnuts. The eggs benedict is wonderful, and the eggs were perfectly poached. I enjoyed our cocktails, especially the French 75 and their bloody mary. My bf really enjoyed his dish and drinks as well. The oysters were all great, very clean and fresh. The beignets are an absolute must. I'm not one for sweets, but these were some spectacular beignets. Our waiter was very good at being conversational and helpful with our orders. Absolutely no complaints on service and food here. The wonderful ambience is also something to note.

I can only speak highly about my first and hopefully not last visit to Bouchon. Overall, we had such a great time here. I almost forgot I was in LV because of how isolated and tucked away the restaurant is from all the activity outside. Definitely consider for brunch and sit in the outside garden patio.

We went in at around 10 on a Sunday, so it was busy, but not too bad of a wait though.( 10 minutes)
Our waitress was in training, believe it was her second day, but still didn't diminish our experience. Just had trouble with some of the words, it is French afterall. I'm glad she was new instead of something else, like her hating her job. 
The restaurant itself is very nice, much larger than I had thought. With an outdoor seating arrangement as well, which is by the pool area. But you really should enjoy that when you Can enjoy it. When it's warm. 
Croissants and toast,(not together) came before us. Moderation is key, but the hell with that when it comes to pastries. Escpecially French ones. Very good but not surprised. That's how it should be. 
The jam. Damn. My girlfriend was telling me how people snatch this up, and they actually sell it down in the bakery. That it's very, very popular. And when I tried it, I could see why, it was very fresh, it was just jam, but it was like I was eating it for the first time. You put jam to advance the toast, you put this jam on your toast because it's an edible plate.

The HAM STEAK & EGGS($25) and OMELETTE du JOUR($17) was our entres. No complaints here, it's just after we ordered we started seeing all these other meals that looked much more scrumptious, with French fries and an omelette that was as big as a persons foot. Just good stuff. The omelette comes with either bacon or sausage. The sausage is very packed(with vitamins?). We kinda had our fill of the meat, because I'm assuming, by accident? I ordered a cutting board full of different meats sliced very thin. I guess I ordered it. I just said yes when he(my waiter) said something French. So don't be embarassed to ask, or say something when you're not sure, like me. No regrets though, had I not inadvertently said oui, I wouldn't have gotten whatever it is I ordered.

From the minute we were seated, service was sub par and disappointing.  The waiters were more preoccupied with anything other than customer satisfaction.   We learned later that the restaurant closed at 2 pm and that the staff's focus was on ending their shift.

Upon ordering, We were told that several of our first choice items (regular menu items, not specials) were out.  We had to ask multiple times for our coffee which was not delivered until the end if our meal.  After delivering our meals, the waiter once again scurried quickly away.

And, when delivered, i wasn't surprised to hear they had no more aioli.

I don't mind expensive French restaurants with attitude.  I do believe, that if you are promoting a that restaurant is ""open for brunch"", the restaurant should deliver on that with a menu and staff in place.

When I heard of his restaurant in the Venetian called ""Bouchon"", I decided to get a sense of what Thomas Keller's cuisine tastes like. 

On my last day before departing Vegas, I decided to have my last meal at the Bouchon. I had to wait 30 min for a Sunday brunch, which I didn't think was too bad considering Sunday brunches are a popular time. 

Overall, I liked the ambiance of the place and the service. The servers were polite and attentive to you. While the general ambiance exudes a certain level of formality, it is completely acceptable to come in typical casual attire (shorts\/flip-flops are fine for brunch). 

I ordered several items from the menu: le pain au chocolat (chocolate bread), le poulet et des gauffres (chicken and waffles), et les oeufs benedicts (benedict eggs). I have to say, every item on the menu nearly blew me away. I admit, I have not had many chicken and waffles in my life, but Keller's take on it is really exquisite; apparently, the preparation of the chicken takes 36 hours, and the waffes are infused with bacon chives. The chocolate bread was a type of croissant pastry with chocolate incorporated inside of it. The croissant was flaky but quite tasty (especially with their grape jam!) The chicken, unlike many chickens I have had in the past, was moist, succulent, and full of flavor; they definitely cooked the chicken to a perfect temperature. The waffles were crisp yet moist as well. The benedict eggs were amazing as well; the hollandaise sauce complemented the rich\/tender eggs as well, and the ham underneath enhanced the taste of the eggs.  

I think what impressed me the most was how Bouchon was able to take rather simple ingredients (chicken, eggs, bread) and elevate it to a level that you typically don't encounter in everyday life (unless you're a culinary chef).

Just because Thomas Keller got a lot of money to slap his name on it, you are not really eating at a Thomas Keller resto unless it's French Laundry or Per Se. This is just a very slightly higher-end La Madeleine with inflated Strip hotel prices. 

I gave it two stars because of the noise and flaky service. For food alone I'd easily give three maybe four. It's a cavernous space and they really try to pack 'em in and flip the tables as quickly as possible to generate volume, pretty much the antithesis of a what a genuine, relaxed bistro experience in France is like. The noise level was almost deafening. My dining companion was seated right across from me and we were literally shouting at each other during several points in the meal. A conversation was pretty much impossible and neither of us are hearing-impaired. Although my ears were ringing all that night after...this is absolutely not the place for a relaxed and intimate dinner. Don't be fooled into thinking that just because it's ""French"" food.

Courses came out at odd intervals and aside from when it was time for us to pay and run out (flip those tables!) our server just didn't seem to be very good at his job. Maybe he was having an off day, got caught in the weeds...but I honestly think in his case he's just a bad waiter. 

Started with a nice platter of oysters. They didn't make us sick so that's good. Not that I expected them to. 

My dining companion had the roast chicken which really was delicious and so well done. Chicken is usually one of the most boring things to order on any restaurant menu but this is an exception. If you've always wanted to try one of those flavorful, moist classic French roast chickens you've heard are so good, here is a place to start. My trout almandine was quality. Simply prepared and I liked it. The rhubarb cake dessert was tasty.

This was my first visit back to Bouchon after I had gone several times a few years ago. Prior to that it was always for breakfast and lunch. It's was less crowded and quieter at those times. However, service there has never been especially good and it suffers the endemic Strip celeb chef phoning it in for the tourists problem. 

I'd recommend going for lunch or breakfast (especially during the week if you can swing it) avoiding weekend dinner there and not setting your expectations for food and certainly not for service, all that high.",0,2,0

But alas, I was in Las Vegas, and had a reservation for the restaurant at my hotel (the Venetian), Bouchon.  As exhausted as I was, I put on my ""dinner shoes"" (perfect for sit down occasions where the destination is a mere elevator trip away) and headed down for dinner.

I love food- but food is still food, so while I expected to be wow-ed by the food, I never really expect any food I eat to be out-of-this-world extraordinary.  I try to maintain realistic expectations.  But let me tell you, this food came close.  I had foie gras for appetizer, the salmon as my main course, and also tried some fries.  Those are the 3 most memorable things I ate, so this review will be primarily based on my thoughts on them.  

The foie gras (if you're into that) is good - extremely rich and creamy and can easily be shared among 4 to I'd say even 8 people.  It comes in a small 4 oz jar with some toasted bread.  I've only had foie gras once before (prepared entirely differently) making me hardly an expert in the area so I'm only capable of leaving a brief thought - it tasted like very flavorful butter.  It was delicious and worth a try, but I was told that it is a little different from what you might expect at a different restaurant. 

The salmon - heaven.  I've had pretty good salmon before, and some pretty bad salmon (over cooked, stiff, and tasteless.. ew.)  To be honest, I half expected this to just a typical good salmon, that I might not find terribly memorable (because I had yet to discover really memorable salmon).  Well this salmon was extraordinary - somehow the chef had managed to achieve the perfect combination of color, flavor, tenderness.. it was beautiful.  It was not over cooked or undercooked, and it looked like the color that salmon should be.  I typically enjoy the natural flavor of salmon so I don't usually need much additional flavor added to my salmon for me to think that it's good.  However, this did have some sauce that complimented the salmon perfectly.  I could taste the sauce, yet it did not overpower the salmon flavor that I enjoy.  I savored every bite and quickly forgot about how just an hour earlier, I thought I would have achieved the same level of nirvana (yes i was THAT happy.. and yes, eating good food really makes me that happy!) eating carne asada fries.  I'm pretty sure I was proven very wrong.  The salmon was much better.

The fries.  Everyone has raved so much about these fries that at the time, so I will refrain from repeating myself but yes, they are the perfect blend of flavor and crunchiness.  I love fries!  I love them so much that I will even eat them cold.  And I did indeed eat these fries cold later one (we didn't finish them and had taken them to go.)  One thing that I discovered when eating them cold was that these fries had some delicious onion flavor snuck into them!  Brilliant! It was like they were fried in onion infused oil or something.  I didn't notice them while eating them hot (and someone let me know if you do!).. but the flavor was significantly more apparent and a nice surprise to me later on.  Now I'm dying to try them fresh again... I think it might be my only hope for being truly transported to another world by way of food.",0,0,0

Didn't get reservations at the Yountville location when we visited Napa Valley a couple of years ago. I guess with the availability of ample restaurant options in Las Vegas, it is easier to find a reservation at the Las Vegas location.

We stayed at the Venetian during our visit to Las Vegas and while strolling by, ran into Bouchon. I didn't even know there was Bouchon at Las Vegas until that time. With no second thought, I immediately went inside and made a reservation for dinner on the very same day.

There is both indoor and outdoor seating area; each is beautiful in its own way. The indoor seating area has dim lights and very subtle and classy decor. The outdoor seating area is next to the pool.

We were served complimentary bread and butter. So delish. We skipped the appetizers and went straight to the main course.
- Steak Frites (It comes with fries by default; since I usually like mashed potatoes with steak, I asked them to substitute my fries with mashed potatoes
- Gigot d'Agneau

Tucked away on the tenth floor of the Venetian, the restaurant is housed in what seems like a world away of the neon lights and the crazy glitz and glamour of Vegas. Instead, a subtle nod to old Italian charm is defintely felt as you get off the elevator.

The restaurant itself is like a large French bistro. I think this place would be great for brunch with its large windows facing the beautiful courtyard outside.

Although I made reservations more than a month ahead, it wasn't necessary as the dining room was only about 50% full on a Thursday night at 9:00pm.

We were seated at a nice private table by the window.

We ordered the apple walnut salad to share, had the mussels & frites and the steak frites and fresh brewed passion fruit ice tea.

Service: The service was commendable. Our waters were never empty, our waiter even brought new carafes of passionfruit ice tea after we happily drank ours quickly. Bread was served immediately and the dining captain came to check on our dining experience. Overall a great attention was paid to our time there.

Food: It was good but not great. The mussels were o.k. but a little too meaty for my taste, it takes away from the subtlety of the flavors of the wine sauce.  The steak was a hanger cut and was a bit too tough for me although Mike said it was good, it was also priced a little high for a hanger steak. They do give you a mountain of fries! They were skinny but lacked any ffavor to them. I am a fry girl for sure but didn't feel like these were the best or even memorable fries I had by any means.

For dessert we ordered the apple tartine-good but not excellent and the chef also gave us a free custard (that was actually quite delicious).

The gin, Cointreau and lemon juice melded together perfectly.  One friend ordered a Moscow Mule and the boys in my group ordered dirty martinis (the best they've ever had). James C was kind enough to bring out the olive juice bottle for my friend to get the name.  

My hubby and I started with oysters and my friends got the biggest shrimps I've ever seen.  As I noted above, I got the mussels for my entree and I wanted to bathe in the sauce.

My hubby ordered the Gigot d'Agneau, lamb with ratatouille, and my friends each ordered the Steak Frites.  One of the steaks was a wee-bit too rare and James C took it back to the kitchen without a second thought.

I was thinking about steak frites.  Instead, I got a special appetizer that was short ribs with foie gras and a red wine reduction.  It wasn't what it sounded like.  It was a tiny rectangle wherein the short ribs were chopped into the smallest possible pieces, topped by foie and then topped with a jelly that was the red wine.  It was like a mini layer cake about the size of a Twix.  It was also cold.  The texture was unnerving.  I couldn't get past it.  The flavors - if they melted all into your mouth - were good.  But I could not get past that weird jelly texture.  Blech.  Then I got the gnocchi because the server told me that they were pasta - not potato - and they were not.  The only way to even sort of describe them is that maybe someone took something light and fluffy like mashed potatoes, squirted them out of something and into a pan and browned them slightly.

The worst part of this restaurant experience is finding it- we walked around the casino for 10 minutes trying to locate it, but after asking 2 employees where it was, we finally found out it was right near the main entrance to the Venetian (which we had entered from 10 minutes prior), tucked away to the right of the check-in desk and up 10 floors in the suites tower. 

Once we got there it was a great experience. I can't say how much of Thomas Keller's influence is on this place (he obviously does not cook there, and we're still planning a FL visit) but if he had any effect whatsoever, it had to have been good. 

The restaurant has a casual yet elegant feel, and the service was impeccable and not in any way obtrusive. That's exactly the service I like- help us out when service is needed, but stay out of the way for the most part. Dishes were promptly cleared, water was filled at just the right intervals, and the pacing of the food was on point. Our waiter was informative but not pushy.

We started off with the parsnip soup and mac and cheese side, which were both excellent. I choose the roasted chicken based on our waiter's recommendation and my gf had the steak and frites (basically a really nice version of steak with fries on top). Her steak was one of the better steaks we've had in a restaurant, and we've had alot. The chicken was tender, moist, with just the right amount of seasoning on the crispy skin. 

I was pleasantly surprised with the portion size, we couldn't make it to dessert because we were so full off of our appetizers\/entrees. We probably could have done without even one of the entrees and still would have been full.

Wine - The King of Scotch selected a nice white wine from France, refreshing with a nice earthy mineral finish - the sommelier complemented the selection, and thanked us for ordering a grand but overlooked wine. - 4 Stars

Entree - Scallops with citrus foam.  Plum scallops seasoned to perfection and cooked just right.  The citrus foam combination imparted an almost Maine Lobster flavor. - outstanding 5 Stars.

Then you get the crunch of the crostini and the creamy texture of the rillette. It's served in a jar, and it comes fully packed with the salmon mixture. They do not skimp here! 

5 stars - Watercress and endive salad with walnuts, apple, roquefort blue cheese, and walnut dressing. This was so fresh and simple with just the right amount of dressing, so it didn't cover up the natural flavor of the endive and watercress. 

5 stars - House bread is worth a mention here. It is crunchy in the outside and chewy on the inside. A great baguette!

5 stars - French onion soup is prepared classically. It has a cheese covering that is just the right amount to go with the flavorful broth. 

2 stars - Service was such a disappointment here. Our waiter did not treat us like guests at all. We were looking for a light dinner, and after learning we were there to order soup, salad, and an appetizer, he questioned us about not ordering entrees. Then on, he did not treat us with any kindness. It was as if we were a hassle for him. The busboys and servers were much nicer. 

For this type of restaurant, I expect the service to match the level of food, but that was not the case here with the service severely lacking. Maybe next time, we'll get more lucky with a better waiter. That's right, kudos to the chefs because the food is worth returning for.",3,3,3

This wasn't your standard menu grazing lunch at Bouchon. Since I was in Vegas with 150 or so of my business colleagues, we decided to craft a pre-fixe lunch menu...designed specifically for a quick, massive yet rewarding bite before our afternoon full body massages and rock wall climbing at the Canyon Ranch Spa. The menu choice was either a roast turkey sandwich with honey mustard, melted Brie on a melon sized baguette...or their ham & cheese baguette (I forgot what was on it)...

I opted for the simple and delicious turkey sandwich (the brie & honey mustard combo is lip-smacking genius)...and, under strict orders from YELPER Courtney P., I personally ordered a pile o' Bouchon fries...Nice call, Courtney! 

Rule #8: Never personally order fries at your table...the grubbing fingers will start snatching away the fries like sticks in a Kerplunk game. 

Desserts were assorted tiny versions of their brownies, raspberry tarts, and TKOs (Thomas Keller Oreos). We just had a enough time to pop a few in our mouth and head off to our massages...it gave me something sweet to digest on in my terry robe.",3,3,3

First of all, I was there with my 2 sisters on a girls getaway and Bouchon serves Island Creek Oysters which are harvested in our hometown-- a cool and delicious coincidence. I had the soup du jour as an appetizer. Not everyone likes cold soups, but I do and this one was the best I have ever had. It was cucumber and leek and it was perfect in every way. When the waiter placed it on the table we all gasped because it was SO beautiful. The presentation was bright green and gorgeous with a dollop of pastel yellow and a bright orange disk in the center. I should have photoed, sorry. The texture was silken, not cloying, but almost creamy. If I were teaching at a culinary institute this soup would be the exemplar for layered flavors. It literally made me moan like Meg Ryan in ""When Harry Met Sally."" I can't even describe the interplay of the clean vegetables, the bright citrus, the flirty white pepper at the end. Oh Chef! It was divine! 
For entrees, we had one pork, one fish, one quiche. I can't comment on the fish and pork because I'm a vegetarian, but the spinach quiche was fluffy and yummy. 
For dessert, we shared profiteroles and chocolate mousse. Both of these were beyond amazing. The chocolate mousse was, in my sister's opinion, ""the most chocolatiest thing in the world."" It's served with cute little bits of lady finger cookies in the shape of spoons. Perfect for sharing. Delicious and adorable. The profiteroles were even more impressive. Again the layered flavors blew us away.

The service was not what we'd expected of a fine dining establishment associated with Chef Thomas Keller.

The waiter was appropriate in greeting us and defining menu, he was appropriate in taking our order. Problem, we never saw him again.

The meal was delivered by restaurant staff. We had to communicate thru restaurant staff for the Wine Master service(sommelier title  unknown ), he was appropriate with paring and serving wine, still no waiter.

There was a gentlemen across the dining room, we made eye contact, he approached the table, he knew we were unhappy. I asked what happened to the waiter, he pointed across the dining room indicating he was busy with another table. We were speechless with this response.

There was no reason to debate at this time. We asked for the check, he indicated he could help us with that. Still no waiter....

The lack of training we observed from our experience at Bouchon was not acceptable.

Upon exiting the restaurant we were approached by a female employee""she wanted to make it right"". A little to late, the core staff is weak at this establishment.

You know that coming in, because you're eating at a French restaurant at the Venetian (why does the Venetian have French restaurants anyway? You'd think they'd all be Italian...). But the food is pretty legit, even if the people dining here are not.

I ordered the Poulet Roti. It was more than I expected. Two pieces of chicken, on top of sweet corn kernels, button mushrooms, fingerling potatoes, and lardons (which looked like bacon to me). It was really, really good. The corn brought out the flavors of the chicken, and the potatoes and mushrooms gave it just the right texture. The lardons were good at breaking up the taste and texture of chicken (which, I'll admit, isn't one of my favorite kinds of meat). I ordered this because of all of other types of food the chicken came with, and I clearly made the right choice. Altogether, it made a very delicious package. I paired it with the Pinot Gris, which was $11 for a glass, but went very well with the chicken.

The service was good, the decor was good, and the food I ordered was definitely worth my while (and the price!). My only complaint is that the dessert menu was a little lacking in interesting.

Our appetizers were UNBELIEVEABLE.  The mussels were fan-freaking-tastic and we all agreed that we could have easily ordered three orders of the mussels and eaten them for dinner.  The pate was perfect.  

Dinner was odd.  My fiancee had three ideas of what he wanted -- our waiter told him he HAD to get the steak.  Steak??   We both looked quizzically at one another.  Steak??  And yes.

How can I not score this place when my Man specifically made reservations to take me here for my birthday dinner number 2? When re-reading my review...I think the 4 stars were based on my experience with the FOOD here...

The ambience was very nice, casual, people came in flipflops and shorts...which is not what I had expected...sorta romantic...except for how we were 6 inches away on each side from the other couples...they were packing us in like sardines....ugh...AND the noise level was pretty LOUD. I had imagined this place to be a little more romantic and moody...but it was not...

The service was good...it was interesting that the menus were printed on paper which they took from you, so you can't even keep it as a souvenir...what we didn't appreciate was the server practically forcing us to order something as an appetizer or ""1st course"" as we would be waiting for our meals for a long while because there were people ahead of us...the bf said...No thanks we're not interested...but he repeated again several times like we were STUPID highly suggesting we get something...this put the BF in a bad mood because the server was 2nd guessing what we should be getting and not leaving us alone! I mean they give you a bowl of pistachios and bread! WHY did we have to feel pressured into ordering a salad? Which by the way did have the best goat cheese EVER..it was like BUTTERY soft and smooth...and we only waited like 15 minutes before our meals came out! WTH? 

So anyways...we both tried the specials for the evening, I had the top sirloin, he had the halibut...both were excellent! We also ordered the pomme frittes (fries) and they were just alright and too much for 2 people to eat...Also had 2 glasses of wine which paired very nicely with our meals...The 1 good suggestion we appreciated from the server...

ALL in ALL it was a very EXPENSIVE meal and we truly had way better service and food at Napa Rose for the same price...at least that's in my opinion....

I truly hope French Laundry is BETTER than this place, because I can't believe the previous review saying that they enjoyed this place even more...that's not saying much about French Laundry then...keeping fingers crossed...Overall it was a classy place...MINUS the loud and irritating stamp machine they have in the front that embosses their name and phone number one a blue square card...LAMENESS...",0,0,0

ordered:
*I ordered how half a dozen oysters [$18] which is simply delicious. I would highly recommend it to any of your lovers. 
*I also ordered a quiche [$13.50] which add cheese bacon and onions. It wasn't bad very soft it just in while me. I have definitely had better quiche before. 
*the steak frites [$33.50] comes with fries. we specifically ordered it medium and it was made perfectly medium but lacked in flavor. Which I know they are not a steak house therefore I can't complain at the steak is in that out of this world. *My friend really enjoyed the special of the day which is the wild eggs benedict. He said that the egg was cooked perfectly. 
*My girlfriend had the Gravlax [$16] which came with smoked salmon with a petite baguette, chive cream cheese, red onion, tomato & capers. she enjoyed it however complained because it took too much of her time to have to put everything together. And she's used to eating a salmon lox. everything came separate so you'll have to put it together yourself.  However the salmon is definitely smoke in house as it was not that salty.

Our waitress was awesome!! we have to wait a long time for are oysters and she made sure to tell her manager that we had to wait. basically her colleague messed up and we got the oysters after our food came out. I was able to get us half a dozen oysters for free without of complaining that i had to wait a long time Which is definitely great service. 

prices are kinda on the high side. i really wanted to love this place. I can't give it 5 stars because honestly everything was great [decor, outdoor setting, staff, menu selection] but the food was just average. The best part of my meal was the oysters.

Oh, forgot to mention the from-scratch nutella that pompously walloped all dangling, whittling stoics. Just in time for the Truite aux Amandes! (Pan-roasted trout with haricots verts,almonds & beurre noisette) 

And that's the end of the food discussion. I don't want to use the constraints of language to pointlessly expound on experiences that tapped into multiple dimensions, ulterior states of being and possible dips into unutterable puddles of the unknown. Bouchon's  target directive hinges on ferocious cultivation of threadbare necessity to perpetually extract endless distinct, complicated conclusions upon a single item. Sometimes dishes will only consist of four ingredients. I felt like pulling a Johnny Depp in ""Once upon a time in Mexico"". Thankfully, I understand perspective. And have no desire for stasis. 

Thanks, gurl!  The search is over.

The bread.  They serve you a nice loaf of freshly baked bread with salted butter.  I could eat two loaves of this stuff.  There's nothing special about this bread other than the fact that it's done extremely well.

I've been here three times and so far I've had the steak frites and the mussels with white wine and butter (twice).  Both are awesome dishes, but as you can probably tell, I'm partial to the mussels.  The mussels are done with a white wine, garlic and butter steaming liquid that is amazing when you dip the freshly baked bread in it.  I think there's also some thing slices of andouille sausage in the broth for flavor.

I don't recall my experience with the steak frites, but I'm sure it was good.

This place is great because it's ambiance is without pretense so you can relax, but fancy enough to go to for a special event like a birthday or anniversary.

Since we were visitng Las Vegas I booked a dinner at Bouchon hoping to get amped up eventually for Per Se. Well..........I was distinctly underwhelmed and frankly disappointed with the experience at Bouchon in Las Vegas. 

The restaurant is in a very fine setting up on the 10th floor in the Venezia tower. The ambience is muted and elegant and evokes a parisian setting. I can vouch for that becuase we visited Paris last year. The dinner started out with the staff seating us in a very nice setting. I had been hyping up the restaurant to my wife and I was eager for validation of the hype. The maitre'd looked very harried and was brusque. Another waiter brought out the bread and placed it on.............the table, not on a plate. Nowhere in Paris have I seen bread placed on the table. 

In any case, we proceeded to order the food and wine. Meanwhile the maitre'd corrected my pronounciation of some wines (okay for a guy from NJ, I  kind of expected that). Our waters were poured once and thats it. We replenished our glasses. We did not order appetizers. I ordered the chicken (yes, the same one that pops up when you open the bouchon bistro web page) and my wife ordered the gnocci. Then the food arrived, looked pretty but was salty and mediocre. My wife could not even finish her gnocci. Meanwhile, another usher kept on coming to our area and making notes on a notepad while we were left completely unattended. In any case, we proceeded to order the desserts. My wife ordered the cheesecake and I ordered Marquis au chocolat. I got a competely different dessert which was the special on the menu. Both the desserts were good but kind of the ""Maggiano's"" quality.

Good choice to have a quiet brunch at the Venetian. Located next to the pool so you can tell who's coming from the restaurant and who's coming from fun in the sun. 

Get the sourdough waffles -- do not get the french toast (it's not actually toast). Enjoy the rest of your day at Vegas!",0,0,0

It has a bustling, no nonsense, bright, noisy, food lover's tone to it.  That puts off some tourists who expect that a fine restaurant has to be quiet, velvety, dark, and formal.  But if you know what you like it can be good here.

What I like is oysters.  Lots of them.  So while my cohort slept in the room I snuck down for a baker's dozen with some bread and sancerre on the side.  The place was booked solid all night, but like most restaurants of its ilk it has a large unreserved bar section so that solo diners and couples can usually slip right in.  Personally, I brought my laptop and cell phone to work on a business presentation -- but in deference to people who think that paying lots of money for good food means a certain level of decorum, I put the laptop discretely on the banquette next to me rather than the table.

How can one place's raw shellfish be any better than another's?  Is it the selection, the storage, the presentation?  Sauce?  Temperature?  Whatever it is, their oysters, half a dozen tiny gourmet varieties from the Oregon and Washington coasts, were out of this world delicious.

Service was ridiculous.  Slow, they forgot the oyster spoons, had to ask twice for bread, etc.  And it was in-your-face personal quirky, California style.  But it was, strangely, professional.  You know they know what they're doing, even if they're not doing it for you at the moment.  At the end, without my prompting, the waitress gave me two free oysters and apologized, said that they were far busier tonight than they were expecting.  And the oysters, a little pricey, but they were really, really good.",2,0,2

My mom was visiting from the Bay Area with her boyfriend, so we took them to Thanksgiving dinner here. Our waiter, Michael, was shockingly rude. Maybe his dog just died, or he was pissed that he had to work on Thanksgiving, but he did not even introduce himself.  He seemed annoyed that we didn't want to order any drinks. He was short and brusque with us. I asked for a kids menu and he said we don't have one. That's it. When I called to make the reservation and even asked the hostess when we arrived, they said they would have something for the kids. After much prodding, he admitted that they could make a half order of anything on the menu. In the end, I got her a half order of steak and fries with ketchup which she enjoyed.

When my husband asked, how big is the dinner size? His response - ""dinner sized."" WOW. Just wow. This is how they train people at Bouchon? I'm dropping 4 bills for this???? Beyond rude and unpolished. 

Only after my mom's boyfriend chatted him up about the Bouchon in Yountville (which they frequent) and other dishes, did he seem to loosen up a bit.

Food: Thanksgiving Menu dinner
pork belly with red-wine braised cabbage and persimmon - amazing composition of flavors
turkey w\/stuffing, pumpkin croquettes, cranberry-apple relish, gravy - this was just ok. The dark meat was good and serving large, but overall it was a bit dry, salty and the croquettes were overcooked.
creme brulee - this was tasty and creamy
bread pudding - served deconstructed. I'm glad he actually told us this as my mom ordered it anyway, but I was glad I didn't because I prefer traditional bread pudding. She thought is was excellent though.

Ambiance: Loud. It was very difficult to hear and hold a conversation. My throat was sore by the end of the night.

Location: this restaurant is hard to find and the entrance to get to the elevators to get there is awkwardly located near the check-in lobby.

Given the plethora of high-end dining options in Vegas and the lack of customer experience here, I will be passing on dining here in the future.",0,0,0

The first time was so amazing, I practically planned my next trip to Vegas around my dinner at Bouchon.  While the service left something to be desired on my recent visit, everything else was as exquisite as I remembered it.

Walking into Bouchon I hardly feel like I'm in Vegas.  The dining room is beautiful with big windows and a long metal bar.  It feels like being in Napa, and coming from California, it feels like home (albeit a home much nicer than my own).  

On my first visit the service was spot on.  We had at least five people helping us, but they never mixed anything up and it never seemed intrusive.  We also had a four person table for the two of us, which was great since we ordered so much food.  When I went recently, my waiter was very, very slow (both in his service and his speech, which included many, many uncomfortable pauses).  Both times I was particularly impressed by the sommelier, who is adorable, funny, and extremely knowledgeable.    

My first trip started with olives, the salmon rillettes, and the goat cheese salad.  I could have done without the salad (it was good, but very simple and too similar to things I make at home), but the olives had a great smoky flavor and the salmon was just fantastic.  I wanted to ask if they would sell me a jar of the salmon to go, but I thought they might be grossed out.  We also ordered a bottle of the sommelier's choice wine--a really fantastic syrah from Oregon.  

For our entrees I had the steak frites and the boy had the mussels.  Both of them were amazing, but I preferred my steak to the mussels (and I really love mussels).  They both came with a giant side of frites, which I was honestly a bit disappointed by, given all the raves I'd heard.  There were just too many of them and they seemed slightly undercooked.  Still, that didn't detract from the meal at all.

My second meal started with the salmon (I'd been craving it for months, and it was just as good as I remembered) and the fois gras.  I know fois gras is evil and decadent and I'm suppose to hate it, but my god was this some delicious fois.  The outside was glazed with the most amazing strawberries, which accented the creamy inside perfectly.  

For our entrees we had the lamb chops and the scallops.  The lamb had a peppery sauce I wasn't too fond of, but the scallops had another summery fruit sauce that was perfect.   

Both times, dessert at Bouchon was good, but not the highlight of the meal for me.  I've had both the chocolate moose and the beignets. The moose was very dark and rich, but I preferred the cream filled beignets.  

Small details like the plate of cookies they bring out with your coffee only add to the experience of Bouchon, leaving you entirely satisfied.",2,0,2

The free baguette was hard (as it should be) so I skipped out on that. Their truffle fries r absolutely delicious! The fruit plate was great -- a little small,but there seemed to be some kind of spice flavoring on it which was very interesting to the palate- I actually enjoyed it. Fresh squeezed orange juice was ok. I just didn't understand why they serve warm water? No ice. Is this how they serve water in France? Anyways, that was a little odd or at least offer with or without ice? I ordered the chicken and waffles-- it was good. The waffles had a hint of bacon and chive in it I think. Different yet tasty! The chicken was cooked well paired with an onion sauce-- the sauce was amazing-- ask for extra ! Goes great with the chicken! . The husband ordered the corned beef hash in which he seemed to like with the 2 over easy eggs on top. Overall, I'd come back if I was staying here. Price point was $$$.

First off, our waiter claimed to have lost his voice and was whispering to us asking for our drinks and mains and such.  However he would sometimes use his normal voice while speaking to us.  

I ordered the pate and my be ordered onion soup.  My pate was excellent but his soup was really heavy and he really disliked it.

I ordered the roast chicken and he got the steak frites.  My dish was really too salty.  It was on a bed of beans and mushrooms and that did not help the flavor.  His steak was more like a burger and really was not crazy about the flavor.  Tasted pretty bad actually.

And during the end of dinner this girl got up and fell backwards and hit her head.  And then she started throwing up in a trash can.  It really was disgusting.  We were in no shape for any dessert.

However we were offered a free dessert, declined it, and suggested a free drink.  Score!  But that really didn't make up for the dinner.  This all with our waiter who lost his voice but was speaking normally.

This was my second time there so I was able to find the restaurant somewhat easily.  The signage from the casino is terrible and is almost impossible to find Bouchon unless you know where you are going.

They must have been short servers because half of the restaurant was unavailable at 9AM.  The hostess said it would be a 10 minute wait for a table or I could be seated immediately at the bar so I chose to sit at the bar.  Initially I was the only one at the bar and was attended to immediately by the bartender.  This was a good thing because about 5 minutes later another 4 or 5 parties decided to eat at the bar also and I could tell that he was going to be overwhelmed.  However it didn't affect me because I got my order in and was served promptly.

I decided on the Omelet du Jour which was a Dungeness Crab and Roasted Pepper Omelet.  It came with sausage or bacon (I asked the bartender for his recommendation which was bacon) and a piece of toast.  The omelet was nice and fluffy with plenty of crab meat.  I didn't really like the roasted peppers because it seemed to overwhelm the crab.  Now who doesn't like bacon.  Their bacon was delicious and another plus is that it wasn't the least bit salty.  The toast comes with butter and what I would assume to be freshly made strawberry preserves.  My only issue is that the toast was very delicate and the butter was not softened so it was difficult to spread the butter without the bread basically breaking apart in your hand.  The jam was excellent.

Go up to the 10th floor. Head to your right (there's a sign that says Bouchon) through a short walkway to the Venezia Tower, where you'll find the restaurant!
You can also get there from the hotel lobby elevators.

We ate here for brunch on Saturday and there was about a 20-30 minute wait, even though we saw empty tables in the restaurant. The hostess in front didn't seem very organized and wasn't very friendly, but our waiter was much more pleasant once we were actually seated. We sat out on the patio next to the fountain, and it was pretty nice - the restaurant patio overlooks the Venezia Tower Pool Garden. However, the sun was really hot (a high of 106 degrees that day!) and I wish they'd thought to move the umbrella so that all of our seats were in the shade...

On to the food!
- Beignets du Jour were amaaaazing. Crispy spiced doughnuts, smothered with warm Nutella and the best jam I've ever tried. Only 3 small doughnuts for $8, but I think it's worth it!
- Bouchon French Toast was the best one for sure. It's bread pudding-style - quite unique and really delicious! It's also the perfect size for a brunch item, not too heavy, and it's also at a good price.
- Oeuf and Boudin Blanc was not presented in a very appetizing way, but the white sausage was really good!
- Croque Madame: I had high expectations after reading great reviews about this, but was slightly disappointed. It was good but not amazing, and I kept on remembering that it was $19 and feeling like it just wasn't worth the price. I guess it is pretty filling though - bread, egg, ham, creamy sauce, and a huge pile of French pies. A little too heavy. You might want to share it with someone.

There's complimentary bread with butter and jam (not the same wonderful jam that comes with the beignets, but still good!) We also ordered two glasses of fresh squeezed orange juice, and like at most restaurants, drinks aren't really worth it. Just stick with free house water!

The four stars are mainly for the fantastic beignets and French toast. It was nice trying Boudin, but I'm not completely sure if I'd eat here again.",1,0,0

Service was good, and we were put in a separate and private side-room for our party of 12 (and a fixed % gratuity was also not tacked on) which was nice. But the food was underwhelming. I came in with somewhat high expectations so maybe that's what messed me up. We came for brunch and shared the pastry platter (sticky bun, cinnamon scone, cheese danish, and pain au chocolat). I ordered the chicken and waffles and my wife ordered the sausage hash.

The cheese danish is pretty incredible - for some reason it reminded me of the cheese rolls at Portos with a hint of orange and lime (or some kind of citrus). The bite that I had was probably the highlight of the experience. The pain au chocolat was OK - I've had pain au chocolat in Paris, so kind of hard to beat that. The chicken and waffles were good but after several bites, it was a bit much and started getting heavy (I could only finish half of it). The chicken was cooked perfectly and was tender and moist. The waffles (bacon and chive) were good but I think this is what made it somewhat overwhelming... oh and maybe the gravy for the chicken. The biggest disappointment and oddity was the sausage hash. I don't know what kind of sausage it was but it wasn't very good - it had a weird flavor. It looked like cubed Hilshire farms sausage but tasted gamey and lacked seasoning. Considering this was supposed to be a hash, the ratio of sausage to potatoes was way off - way too much weird-tasting sausage, to the point that my wife had to request more potatoes since there were barely any in the dish to call it a ""hash"". My wife and our friend both ordered this and only finished half. I would have expected them to finish all of it had it tasted much better. The other disappointment on this note was the fact that our waiter actually advertised prime rib hash but then came back a minute later after it was ordered saying they had just run out. Keep in mind, it's 11am at this point in time. I guess that's what everyone else and their mother's ordered. But you'd think they'd prepare more of it in anticipation that most patrons would want to order that...

For a well-established restaurant, I was surprised that it was so hidden and impossible to find. We literally walked all the way around the Venetian, but the signs (like all of the signs in Vegas) were tiny and completely miss-able and finally had to stop and ask someone. Basically, you have to find the Venezia Tower, which is guarded by security, take the elevator to the 10th floor, which is a SEPARATE button not in the normal numerical sequence, and then go pass another security guard. Crazy, no wonder it was completely empty when we got there around lunch time!

Anyways, the interiors were beautiful as usual - the perfect composition of dark grains and warm, natural light. Our service wasn't stellar, but it was good enough.

But the FOOD definitely saved it for me. We ordered the sourdough waffles and the florentine quiche. The waffles came with super ripe strawberries and vanilla bean butter - a brilliant sweet complement to the slight hint of sourdough. The quiche, which was my first, was so melt-in-my-mouth-good.

The one top thing to do is make sure to eat the bread they give you when you sit down. When it comes out fresh, that bread is really really good. 

Here's a couple of pro tips, they have a vanilla bean butter so ask. Also if you park at the Venetian, don't go toward the casino at the elevators, there is a set of elevators farther down that say bouchon. It brings you right there.

Their steak frites are not to die for, so what keeps me coming back for more?

1. Pistachios with their bread & butter.  I love bread. Especially when it's warm and fresh.  The waiter will come by and leave the bread on your table (european style) with the butter and a small cup of pistachios.  You can order some marinated olives to go with this set up, but there's something about this quirky combination that gets my appetite going -- who needs to order an appetizer?

2. Saumon Poele. That's how you say delicious, seared salmon in Bouchon-ese.  Perfectly seared and served over vegetables.  The portion is small, but each bite is perfection.

3. Macaroni au gratin. MmmMac and cheese. Enough said.

4. Pot de Crème. Infused custard - It's rich in flavor and light in texture.  I could share, but I don't.. it's all for me.

A few notes: Their steaks aren't the best. So unless you must have the dead cow, try something else.  The brussel sprouts are on the salty side -- maybe it's the pieces of bacon in there or just the way they season it, but whatever it is... you'll be thirsty later.",4,2,1

Located on the tenth floor of the stunning Venetian hotel, Bouchon is one of Thomas Keller's fantastic creations. 
The inside of Bouchon is elegantly decorated. It actually looks like an old French bistro you may find in France. 

Bouchon is open for breakfast, weekend brunch and dinner and is usually pretty busy, especially for brunch. And speaking of brunch, that's the meal my wife and I had at Bouchon. Since they don't take reservations for their weekend brunch we had to wait about fifteen minutes for a table. 

Once seated, we were given complimentary bread, butter and housemade jam. The bread was fantastic, as was the butter and jam. 
After the bread we ordered a side of pommes frites. These fries tasted so similar to fresh made McDonald's fries, which I mean as a compliment because I love fresh McDonald's fries.  For our main entrees this is what we ordered;

I have never ever tried a better tasting butter. I could have eaten it with a spoon. Actually, I did. Although it looked plain, my wife's dish was delicious. The white sausage was amazingly juicy and the beurre noisette sauce was excellent. The buttered croissant that came with her dish was also great. Probably the best buttered croissant I've ever had.

We decided to forgo the restaurant week menu since it didn't seem to have anything special nor worth getting compared to the regular menu.

Provided that this was just dessert and the reputation of Bouchon, I had high expectations as I walked across the dining room to our appointed table.

My boyfriend decided on the creme carmel. Upon its arrival to the table I was disappointed by its lackluster appeal. There it was, a gelatinous blob, sitting in a shallow pool of its caramel juices. No spun sugar garnish, let alone any garnish - what you see, is what you get. 

Looks aside, we dug in into the thick creme to find...nothing special.

First time I came here was over a year ago, I was looking forward to their brunch since my love was telling me how he raved about his dish and how they have chicken and waffles. I admit, I didn't hear a single word except ""chicken. and. waffles."" Unfortunately, I didn't get to try it. Their chicken and waffles were only on their weekend brunch menu. We went there on a Monday, so I opted for something off of their daily specials. I could not remember what I had there but I remembered what my love had ordered. It was such a plain and simple omelette that I don't remember eating, I don't recall anything. He had this overly sweetened french toast in a cylindrical shape with apples and syrup. He isn't a sweets lover, so it might be reasonable for most. He liked the texture but the sweetness was too overwhelming. 

Few months ago, we went there again, choosing the right day of the week. Dealing with an hour long wait wasn't cool, but for a group of 6 without a reservation, it's reasonable. They had these little pastries in the front for the people waiting for a table and you can always order a mimosa and drink your day away. I am happy to say that I finally ordered their CHICKEN. AND. WAFFLES. served with both gravy and syrup. Chicken wasn't deep fried like southern style, and my waffles had bacon and chives in it. I don't really care for bacon but this darn thing was so delicious, that I had to stuff my face immediately with table manners. For the first time I enjoyed the taste of syrup more than gravy on my chicken and waffle. The sweetness of the syrup was balanced out perfectly with the chicken and waffles. My chicken tasted like honey grilled wings (except it was a chicken leg and a breast) and the bacon and chives made this dish into more of a savory course rather than the confused-wtf-are-you-eating dish. Because my sauces are served separately, I don't need to worry about my waffles turning soggy. The waffles were so plump and fluffy, I was gonna die. 

I fell in love with this dish right there, right then. It will be hard for me to come back here again to try other things. Their daily special almost did it, they had shrimp and grits that day, it was one of my toughest decisions to make in Vegas other than to bet on red or black at the roulette table.",0,0,0

We made a reservation here for a late anniversary celebration, at 6pm to avoid the crowds, and because we were seeing Mystere later. Great choice, the restaurant was emptyish and it was nice and quiet. 

We decided the apps and sides looked more interesting than the entrees, so we ordered a bunch of things to taste, like:
-Oysters
-Bone Marrow 
-Quiche du jour
-Salade des tomates
-Tiger Shrimp Risotto
-Marinated Olives

A standout for me was the bone marrow. Having never tried this before, I was excited to see that it came with thick grilled bread. We scooped the marrow out and spread it on the bread, and drizzled some of the garlic\/parsley\/shallot\/sherry vinegar sauce over it. Just out of this WORLD. So decadent...I definitely can't eat that all the time, but was glad to try it this once!

We also were presented the dessert menu, which we pondered for a few minutes before quietly deciding on sharing a lemon tart. Now, this is where it gets interesting. Before we could order, our waiter, Rico, walked up to the table with a plate of dessert-a lemon tart, which was compliments of the chef. How did he--? Maybe it's the standard celebratory dessert, but I'd much rather think that the tables were mic'd up or that the waitstaff have the ability to read minds. Keeping the mystery alive!

Disclosure: we were on the VIP list because my girlfriend works for the chef's brother, however, we paid for our entrees and I saw the other tables get the same level of service that we did, so the only difference between the VIP treatment and the unwashed masses is a plate of pastries, a yogurt parfait, and a charcuterie plate.

But that pastry sampler is an excellent place to start.  The cream cheese danish was something that I'd happily roll around naked in.  The pastry was light, airy, and flaky.  The cream cheese was light, and more like a sugary custard than the filling that you might get elsewhere.  The GF loved the sticky bun.  You could make a meal out of the pastries alone.

The yogurt parfait was kind of lost on me.  It was sweetened with fresh strawberries, which I'm sure would make most people happy, but since I don't eat that fruit, it didn't move me.

On the suggestion of the waiter, I ordered the Chicken with Waffles.  This is a dish that I would normally pass on (what does chicken have to do with waffles anyway) but the waiter's description intrigued me and I'm glad I took the advice.  It's a good balance of savory and sweet, with chives mixed into the sourdough waffles and a half chicken.  Tip:  let the maple syrup mix with the sauce that you pour over the chicken.  It's awesome.

Service was top-notch.  Granted, we were on the VIP list, so they were sucking up to us and we had a team of people swarming over our table from time to time, but looking around, they did that for everyone.  And for the price you pay at Bouchon, you deserve that kind of treatment.

The restaurant is easy to find if you're arriving at the Venetian by cab (the elevator is right off the main check-in desk), but if you're walking in from the strip through the casino, you'll probably get lost.",0,0,0

I ordered the Special which was scrambled eggs with wild shrimp, spinach, hollandaise sauce and brioche toast. Delish! the sauce was amazing and worked so well with the sweet little shrimps.

So we had to wait over an hour to get a seat. Must be a good place right? In such high demand?

While waiting I got a coffee at the bar, and even though the small cup cots $3.50 ad I gave a $5 the bartender never brought change back. I was going to leave her a tip anyway, but fine. Let her keep the extra.

At last we are finally seated. And something felt wrong... For most of our meal we are surrounded by dirty tables. And there's an army of waiters frantically running around with no visible effect. And then it hit me... they don't use TRAYS!!! Everything is carried one thing at a time. It means if you drop a spoon a waiter has to go all the way to the kitchen to get you a new one, come back and deliver it. They can't just grab it ""on the way"" like all normal restaurants. It also takes 4 people to clean a table.

I also observed them set a tale. Then clean it off. And then set it again. Yes, when you have twenty people, there is a 100% chance of redundancy.

Overall... The food is decent, although it looked like a fancy Denny's menu. There was nothing interesting that you can't get at a random breakfast place. Presentation... same thing. Not bad, but nothing impressive.

Had this been a little breakfast place with prices half of what they are - it would have been a 5-star! But this is suppose to be grand, top-of-the-roof (they are actually on one of the top floors) experience and they seem to not comprehend simple things. Seriously, this is a tray
http:\/\/www.remodelista.com\/files\/img\/sub\/Vintage-silver-butler-trays.jpg

It allows you to carry MULTIPLE things! Highly useful when you have a line up of people looking at the rows of dirty tables.

And I have been to places where for that same price, your water was served in pure crystal glasses and coffee cups had gold rims, because you were paying for the experience, as well as the food.

The costs for this place are really not justified. You can get a much better deal for your money. The value of their food and service is about 70% of what they are charging.

(Let me know if they discover the invention 'Tray'! That would significantly improve the service + waiting time).

Note that the yelp current quoted price ($31-50) is only if you order the cheaper items on the menu. Many of their steaks are around $40 and their wines start $10 per glass. So with tip and taxes, if you plan to have one drink during, you are looking at spending at least $60.",1,1,0

Either sit by the counter and enjoy some fresh pastries with jam and coffee and juice if you're not a big breakfast eater or sit (preferably on the patio if the weather permits) down and enjoy a relaxing, true French style petit-dejeuner experience.

I'm a fan of hearty breakfasts, so one of my favorites here at Bouchon is the Croque Madame that comes with a mountain (seriously!) of the best French Fries ever. 

Enjoy a ""stacked"" French toast if you have a sweet tooth. It looks more like a miniature cake that you won't let you put your fork down until it has vanished into your belly.

The waiter and all the bus boys provided excellent service.  We started off with the Grand Plateau which had raw mussels, oysters, clams, cooked shrimp and lobster.  It was soo delicious and I loved the presentation.  It was stacked on tiers and it had all these delicious sauces.  The seafood was extremely fresh and even though it was pricey ($110), its a good appetizer to split among a big party.

For the main course, I ordered the Daube de Bouef which was braised beef short ribs.  It came with potatoes, carrots, and fried bone marrow (which was very interesting).  When I eat short ribs, I expect them to just melt in my mouth, so I was kind of disappointed by the way it was cooked.  It just didn't have the flavor I expected from all the raves I heard about Bouchon.  The bone marrow was very interesting, it kind of just bursts in your mouth and its very liquidy, it tasted kind of like melted fat, which sounds gross but it was a good addition to the dish.

I absolutely LOVED the macaroni au gratin which is similar to mac and cheese.  I love it when a restaurant makes a simple dish that just tastes so elegant and I liked how it was kind of burned around the edges of the dish.  I also got to taste some of Bouchon's french fries and I thought they were prepared very well too.  Overall I liked the sides more than the actual main part of the entree.  

Of course their wine selection is amazing, we had a bottle of white wine and a bottle of a cabernet which the waiter selected for us.  They were both delicious and great accompaniments to our appetizer and main dish.

I don't know if last night was an anomaly and the chef was just having a bad, or if they feel they can rest on their laurels, but many of our meals were subpar and none were excellent.  First, the trout was poorly selected and deboned so badly that it seemed that more than half the bites had at least one bone.  I watched the poor chap eating in continuously try to discreetly remove bones from his mouth.  The regret at selecting the trout evident in his face.  Second, my steak was cooked about as badly as I would do it.  There was no consistency through the meat and appeared to have been rushed.  I would have apologized to my guests if I had served this at home.  Finally, with respect to service, there were multiple mistakes made.  Perhaps the most glaring was they accidentally gave one in our party one the deserts intended for the party beside us.

The ambience and service were OK, but nothing special really and the meal, though there were some high points, was completely ruined by a mistake that should never, ever occur at a restaurant of this caliber. The problem? My lamb dish came served with a sauteed kale that was so oversalted that it was, in hindsight, inedible. I should have sent it back but we were running late and I had already sent the lamb dish back once so that they could cook it as I had ordered it (medium well). So my wife and I mixed the kale with bites of other things and ate it. What a mistake. We were both physically ill for the rest of the night from the salt. We each had to drink four bottles of water over the course of two hours just to be able to swallow and tone down the headache and sore throat from the salt. 

This was an inexcusable mistake at a restaurant of this quality. SOMEONE in the kitchen had to have tasted that kale and decided to serve it to customers rather than tossing it and making a new batch. If it was a mistake of extreme overseasoning on just our dish, then that is equally inexcusable.

The restaurant is right next to the beautiful garden and pool area. The interior design of the restaurant is really pretty and definitely a romantic ambiance for a date!

They don't do reservations for lunch so our wait time on a Sunday was about 20 minutes, which isn't too bad. Plus, they have free pastries out to nibble on while you wait. 

My boyfriend and I got 1 pastry and 2 entrees and we were stuffed by the end! 
- Beignets du Jour ($8): These were made perfectly! Crispy on the outside, super soft on the inside, topped with cinnamon and powdered sugar. You can dip these with their homemade strawberry jam or chocolate. Just thinking about this makes my mouth water! Seriously so delicious. 
- Chicken and Waffles ($27): The chicken is roasted, unlike the usual fried chicken from Roscoe's x) This is their most famous dish. My boyfriend said it was just regular roasted chicken but I appreciated that they didn't make it dry. We both really liked the brown Chasseur sauce it came with - it really made the chicken more tasty! The waffles were really good as well but I usually get tired of eating any waffle after a while.
- Croque Madame ($19): This was the first time we've tried this dish and we both loved it! The only complaint was that we wished the sandwich was bigger!! It was super delicious. My boyfriend usually hates cheese but he loved this dish because all the flavors and ingredients blended in really well. The ham was really great quality too. Definitely recommend this dish - it ain't no regular sandwich! It also comes with A LOT of fries - wish they could use some of that space to give us more of the sandwich :p

I had heard Thomas Keller opened up a place, but didn't know where and it honestly didn't take me long to find Bouchon in the listing of restaurants along the strip. How could I NOT make this a priority? I quickly booked a reservation for a Sunday dinner and were were definitely not disappointed.

We ended up being a little early, but considering it was a rather slow Sunday and our reservations were on the early side, they had no problem seating us right as we walked in. I was a little surprised at how quiet it was, but I think it made for a much more enjoyable experience. The ambiance was very much a Parisian bistro, down to the tile floor, dark wood bar, and white table cloths. The 2-top tables were set rather close to one another, but that didn't bother me much. It was a tiny bit distracting when the single man next to us was ordering, but that's only because I honestly wanted to know what he was ordering. It also gave me an opportunity to ask how he liked the chicken, which I was eyeing on the menu earlier.

Our waiter greeted us as soon as we sat down. He asked for our preference for water and allowed us some time to peruse the menu. Water delivered, he gave a thorough explanation of the various specials they had that night. My husband and I both skipped on cocktails from the bar and went with wine for the evening. Unfortunately, their wine selection, while lovely, is outrageously expensive. I managed to find something reasonably priced and lucky for us it turned out to be a good find (Sans Liege '10 ""The Offering"" - it was surprisingly good, totally recommend it). The sommelier who poured our wine was very nice and complimented our choice without being judgmental. Overall, the waitstaff were warm, friendly, and very professional.

We started our meal sharing the hors d'oeuvres special for the evening: fois gras pate, duck confit, and huckleberry gelée terrine. This was simply exquisite. That's the only way to describe it. The layer of fois gras at the top melted on the tongue, making way for the incredibly savory and rich duck confit. The huckleberry gelée was brightly tart and just a bit sweet and essentially cleaned up the palate. I am so happy we ordered this. It certainly was a one-of-a-kind experience.

We both ordered a salad: I had the farro salad with kale, fresh tarragon, and preserved lemon segments and my husband had a green salad (the type of salad is escaping me at the moment). I was slightly disappointed in my salad. It was much more of a grain salad than a kale salad, which is what I was expecting. Had I the opportunity to change my order, I would have as this was definitely a meal salad. It was very heavy and filling. My husband's salad was a standard mixed greens with a lovely vinaigrette.

For our entrees, my husband went old-school traditional with the Steak Frites (roasted flat iron cut) and I went with the Salmon. The Steak Frites was delicious: the steak itself was perfectly cooked to order and the frites were plentiful and yummy. The salmon was perfectly cooked (medium-rare) with a lovely seared crust on all sides. It was served with a side of farro and little cubes of winter squash. Since I had had my fill of farro with my salad, I stayed away from the farro with the salmon and enjoyed the fish and squash. As I write this, I'm curious as to why the waiter didn't question my order, seeing as I was ordering pretty much the same thing for 2 courses. I know that the customer is always right, but in this instance, I honestly would've liked some guidance and perhaps a nudge to order a different salad. Besides this little diner-error, everything was delicious and fresh.

I made darn sure I saved room for dessert and neither of us were disappointed. My husband went with the Flourless Chocolate Tart and I went with their special for the evening Egg Nog Pot de crème. I loved this custard. It was not too over-the-top spicy, but perfectly sweet and creamy. My husband's chocolate tart was incredibly rich and delicious, too. Both of us were very pleased with our choices.

Considering The French Laundry is on my bucket list, I'm happy that I was able to at least enjoy one of Thomas Keller's establishments early and one that doesn't require a reservation 6 months in advance. We very much enjoyed ourselves here and will happily come again. I hear their brunch is lovely, too...",3,0,1

The place was empty at dinner, and that should have told me something.

I was seated outside and provided two ""vines"" of bread with butter & a small bowl of pistachios. One of the stars I'm giving is for the butter, which was the perfect texture & consistency. I ate the bread, which was hard and stale, primarily for the butter.

As a first course, they were doing an off-menu special of Fruits De Mer, which the waiter described as a take on bouillabaisse. Small bowl of bland, bland, bland, flavorless tomato water with the most tender seafood I have ever out in my mouth. The squid and octopus were the most incredible texture, which sadly was not complemented by the rest of the dish. Accompanied by a ""crostini"" which was an untested slice of stale bread slathered with an average aioli. The seafood accounts for the second star.

I ordered the lamb for a main. I love lamb, and eat it on the rare side...but not the purple side. Totally undercooked, poorly seared, and just rubbery.it was served with undercooked peas and some tasty square of an unidentified food that may have been potato. The lamb was inedible and I sent it back. Got another one that was almost as rare and completely gristly, rubbery and inedible. And completely oversalted. That was it, I sent it back and checked out.

Thomas Keller has the reputation of being a perfectionist - that's his brand. I felt this was very much a case where a celebrity chef has lent their name to a restaurant that they haven't set foot in since it opened. I cannot believe that Keller would, for even a moment, allow the horrible food that came out of that kitchen to bear his name.

At least I hope not.

I thought that the potato disc didn't really add much to the dish in terms of flavor. It was a little crunchy, but seemed to be there mainly to absorb the sauce. The sauce did not go very well with the foie grad, as it was a tad too sweet and overwhelmed the taste of the foie gras. 

As for the truffle risotto, it was absolutely delicious, but very rich. The first half of the dish was great, but I'm glad I split it with my boyfriend.

The chicken itself was roasted, not fried, and one of the softest chicken I've had the pleasure to sink my teeth into. The waffles had chopped chives in the waffle batter, with chopped up bacon sprinkled on the top. The waffles were tangier than usual, and it was a pretty decent pairing with the chicken. 
Will I ever fully absorb the concept of how these two things pair? Doubt it. -_-

2. Bus boys - Why are tables being cleared when food is still being eaten.  We had muscles and fries on our table still being eaten and a bus boy comes over to clear our table while were still eating.  I'm not sure if he understands English but come on!

Food:
1. Mussels- we specifically asked for appetizer mussels not entrée muscles.  We see the bill of entree muscles.  I give props on fries.  Although it was a little salty but very well done.  Mussels were fresh but the sauce was lacking depth and substance.  
2. Black Label Ribeye (special) - Roasted black label (better than prime) cooked raw!  The sauce was running all over the plate and the vegetables tasted dirty, probably not cleaned properly. 
3. Roasted Chicken - Best dish of the night.  Crispy surface, moist inside, with a wine reduction sauce.  
4. Lamb - Cook medium rare but nothing special about it.

Wine:
Your wine sommelier working the night of  9\/11\/2011 should be fired.  Why is wine not opened and poured at the table?  Heavy, dirty, grimy, unpleasant sediments can be found in the wine, which is why I prefer wine to be opened\/poured at the table. A begging sommelier should not be pouring wine at the end of the bottle and finishing it from a new bottle, no excuses!  If this sommelier is only bringing wine to the table, why even have one?  Why not have the waiter bring it to the table?

The pistachios and bread before your meal comes? Cute. Above average.

The decor? Average.  I swear I've seen this exact decor in more than a few restaurants in New York City.  

Appetizers? Below average. We kicked off our meal with a dozen oysters. The shucking left bits of shell through 3 or 4 of the oysters.  I can do a better job at home.  

Entree? Above average to pretty good.  Steak frites. Quite delicious, but I wouldn't say it was particularly amazing.  I certainly enjoyed myself and I think at $30ish, it was very reasonable.  But have I had better steak? Yes.  Would I believe that the man behind the French Laundry had a hand in creating the dish that I was partaking at that moment? Probably not.  There wasn't any innovation or creativity behind this dish.

Dessert? Beats me.  We didn't have any since we were full by then.

Wine list? REALLY expensive.  Considering that the entrees were in the $30 range, you'd think there be a lot more wines that would be in that range.  If that was what you want, then you'd have to go with the house wines.  Otherwise, prepare your wallet for a world of hurt should you decide to partake in libations.

He ordered the special artichoke appetizer and the chicken. 
The artichoke hearts were lightly breaded and fried. The batter was very light and was not oily at all. There was a pimentel aioli to dip and tiny slivers of olives as well. The watercress on the top was a nice touch too. 

The chicken was probably the best roast chicken we've ever had. The skin was crispy and the meat was extremely juicy. The jus was so flavorful and I could not resist dipping my bread into it! The server informed us that the chicken was in a brine and then left to rest for 24 hours before being roasted. It was served over 

Having eaten a late lunch only a couple hours before, I ordered the house salad and the special crab appetizer (so adventurous, I know). I wish I ordered more, but did not want to feel the guilt of wasting food that took so long and so much care to prepare. 

The house salad was full of fresh mixed greens, topped with a round of herb goat cheese, and tossed with a red wine vinaigrette with shallots. It was amazingly light and very generously portioned. 

The crab appetizer was a cold platter with a large claw and leg. It was served with lemon and 3 sauces, 2 of which we were sure were the same. They tasted almost exactly the same. One was a mustard and the other was your typical marinara sauce. 

The dessert was the absolute best part of the meal. It was the special of the day. The bottom layer was Thomas Keller's own ""oreo cookie"", topped with a mint-infused bavarian cream full of chocolate crunch balls. Then there was some sort of sponge-like layer over the whole thing. It was to die for. There was a mint streak on the plate and a double chocolate ice cream as well. This was a euphoric moment to have this with a cup of strong black coffee.",0,0,0

Out waiter was nice, but a little over the top for us and was a bit chatty.  Some people might like that, but not our group.  It made it a bit awkward for us.

I started with the beet salad and a selection of oysters.  The salad was yummy and the oysters were a fair selection from the waters of the north pacific.  I've had a better selection with better condiments to go with them.  The wine was fair, but I'm always trying new things and the waiter didn't have much input in my selection.  I had the lamb for my main entree and even though it was a smaller sized portion it still had a lot of great flavor.  You don't get that gamey taste, but just a full savory one.  The steak my gf had was delicious with the smothered butter and caramelized onions.  For dessert we had the profiteroles, which was a-ok.

I got chicken and waffles. It's not a great thing to get when you're hung-over but it really is delicious. Its a little heavy (the gravy you pour on the chicken is heavy) and the waffles have little salty pieces of bacon on it, but it is DELICIOUS. I especially like the combo flavor of sweet syrup and salty chicken. The chicken was also super tender, probably some of the most tender I've ever had...

I tried my friend's croque madame and it was DELICIOUS as well. The brioche bread was buttery and delicious and the ham was a good salty contrast. The french fries were amazing as well (probably some of the best fries I've ever had).

I got a chocolate croissant which was amazing (honestly everything was amazing) and the bread they serve you is great too. Desert was even better! We got 7 deserts and I think I tried all of them. The best were a creme puff \/ ice cream pastry thingy, chocolate cake thingies (so good!!), and the lemon tart. The flan was good, but i didnt have a lot. I didnt like the custard that much.

Let's start with the food. Ah, Thomas Keller, a California treasure and also an expected knock out dinner. But, I guess you get what you pay for at Bouchon. Price is affordable, and will run you around $50 a person, but the food is forgettable. Where is the rich and luxurious taste that we are all so used to? I had the lamb while my girlfriend had the rainbow trout. The lamb was really gamey, and the trout was a huge filet with nothing notable. The plating lacked effort, and it was just all around disappointing. But, there was something Bouchon did do right, baked good and desserts. The complimentary bread was amazing and the beignets were absolutely delicious. But, I'm here for dinner not dessert, had I known about the food, I would have eaten at Shake Shack first then came to Bouchon for dessert later.

The second issue I have is with the wait staff. Look I am sorry I did not want to order a drink or appetizers, but that doesn't mean we deserve less attention than others. I don't appreciate being given a dessert menu, before you have cleared my dinner dishes, and I also don't appreciate you checking how much I tipped before I left the table.

It was definitely a vegas bucket list for me. The space is hidden on the 10th floor of the Venetian and it's kind of hard to find. The restaurant I think is a beautiful open space with a classic French design. The menu isn't too expansive. It's small and the way it's organized can be a little confusing. 

We started off with mimosas, escargot, froie grois pate, and the small seafood platter as appetizers. They also served is complimentary bread with the most delicious butter and blackberry jam combination. I loved the escargots . It can with a puff pastry on top to soak up the garlicky oil goodness. I even dipped extra bread in that sauce. The texture of the escargot and flavor was on point. The froie was good but it's was really hard. Like a spoon can stand upright in it. I definitely like the taste of a actual froie filet better but texture of this was good. I give it 3\/5 stars.   The seafood platter was a beauty. We couldn't stop snapping pics of it. The lobster is flavored and it was delicious. The texture was a little chewy. The shrimp was also plump and fresh but it would have been ""crispier"" if you know what I mean. The oysters were delicious!  Both kinds were. Sweet and fresh. Loved them. The mussels were ok. Could have passed on that.

We didn't get our mimosas until after the appetizers and the waitress felt so bad she gave it to us on the house. That was such a sweet gesture. I love it when restaurants comp things for you when service isn't just right. 

For main dishes we got the croquet Madame, the salmon plate, the burger and the steak hash which was the special. The croque Madame is so rich and buttery and gluttonous. I don't think I can eat all of that but my friends did. We also upgraded to truffle fries and that was an excellent idea since it was delicious and the biggest hit. I liked my salmon plate. Nothing special and it's something you can make at home though. The steak hash wasn't that great actually. For 30 bucks it tasted like the steak hash I can get at a diner. 

Overall it was a great experience and the service was wonderful. Somethings in the menu are superb, some are just good ( standard but not worth the price) and yes guys this place is pricey.",1,0,1

Having been to French Laundry (which, granted, is in a completely different price stratosphere) and experienced the meticulous detail accorded to the food and service at a Keller restaurant, perhaps I'm biased, but this restaurant was actually disappointing.

Went with a group of 5 friends for brunch, having heard wonderful things and perused the menu.  The wait was a reasonable 30 min. at 11:30 on a Sunday morning.

The restaurant is decorated in traditional French bistro style.  Our meal began with knots of bread (that were cold and did not taste particularly fresh) served with butter and jam that tasted distinctly of blueberry but which our waiter pronounced as blackberry.  No bread plates, so I assume the white paper tablecloth makes it easier to clean up the copious amount of bread crumbs at the end of a meal.  No separate butter and jam utensils also meant that individual knives were being dipped into both (and mixing them).  This sort of detail didn't in any way detract from the meal, but seems oddly unattentive for Keller.

We ordered fresh orange juice ($3.50 for a small glass), croque madame, chicken and waffles, sourdough waffles with strawberries and vanilla bean butter, omelette du jour, and oatmeal with sugar and candied orange.  Prices were in the mid-high teens with the exception of the chicken and waffles, which was $25.

The food was completely unremarkable.  The omelette was described as being served with heirloom tomatoes, basil and cheese.  What arrived was a standard French omelette filled with cheese and dressed with a slice of heirloom tomato and a few thin strips of basil on top.  The egg itself was lukewarm and tough.  It came with sausage (overly salted and greased) and toast.  The sourdough waffles and oatmeal were well-executed but undistinctive, although the accoutrements with both (strawberries with vanilla butter and candied oranges, respectively) were unique and delicious.  The toast that accompanied the oatmeal was underwhelming, and the waiter was reluctant to bring more jam upon request.  On the positive side, the croque madame was rich and decadent as it should be, and served with an enormous helping of pommes frites.  The roast chicken and waffles could have probably fed 2-3 quite happily, and the gravy and syrup were both classic and tasty.

Service was in no way attentive.  The waiter didn't seem particularly well-disposed toward us and made clear what he thought of our choice of tap water.  Light upselling pressure (he recommended all of the most expensive dishes on the menu, wine, champagne, and dessert) and stinginess with jam were negative points.

Came away with the feeling of a pricey and pretentious restaurant with unremarkable feeling.  I hope Bouchon in Napa is better.",2,0,0

In saying that, knowing that we were going to Bouchon for brunch, I was still very excited. I can honestly say that breakfast is pretty much my favorite meal of the day. I chose the croque madame for my love of sunny side eggs and buttery brioche. I learned from Mr.Bunnie's culinary school days that a well-cooked egg possesses no color of evident cooking when fried, poached, over easy, scrambled...you name it. And after many dozens of eggs tried in mastering this process, I, too have learned to appreciate egg cookery in a whole different light. Just look at the perfectly cooked sunny side up egg drizzled with mornay sauce drowning my beloved layers of brioche toast and sweet salty ham. Delicious!

As much as I loved my dish, I loved his dish more. Mr. Bunnie has made quiche for me many times before and I've always told him it was the best that I have ever tasted. EVER. However, once the soft moan of satisfaction escaped out of me, slight appearance of goosebumps on my arms, and the faint closure of my eyes, I have to admit -- I have a new love. The hint of sweetness from the pillowy custard grounded by the layer of perfectly baked buttery crust was pure heaven. Tender creamed leaves of spinach set stage for a perfect balance with the custard that just melted in your mouth. At that moment, he knew as well as I that as much as I love his quiche, I will probably never utter the same adoring praise ever again.",1,1,2

We made a reservation for 8:15 being told nothing was available earlier. We came a little early and must have missed the crowd because more than half the place was empty making us wonder why the late reservation. The hostesses were not very friendly and my date said that upon returning from the bathroom they were even colder than before. We got seated at a pretty awkward location near a pillar and literally three feet from some other table at each side; there were many other open tables and were not notified of outdoor seating options. We did notice the hostess was friendlier to other types of people, like older and Caucasian. We noticed this seemed to be the trend here as the meal went on.

The server, Jerry, was very nonchalant and inattentive, quite the opposite of what we observed from his other table three feet away. While my date was at the bathroom I asked some questions and he asked about our food allergies and I'm guessing he assumed I couldn't speak English because I'm Asian. It was frustrating trying to tell him things and before I could order starters he walked away to attend to the larger party again. I thought maybe I was imagining it but when my date returned, also Asian, she was annoyed with his inattentiveness and after she finally had an exchange or two with Jerry she said, ""He's talking to us as if we don't speak English."" We both speak native English, and she teaches it in California for work. He kept asking if he wanted drinks, each time we said no. The last time asking for drink orders, he sternly looked at us while throwing his hands to the sides and asked, ""So do you want any drinks with that?"" I couldn't believe he was being so rude since we ordered over $100 worth of food. He also got the oysters wrong and mixed up where they were from, i.e. East coast was actually West. There were other issues, but this review is getting long enough. My date worked in many restaurants as a server, hostess, and manager and had less patience than I did. 

The other staff, food runners, bussers, a neighboring server with long hair, were all great and we really appreciated it. 

Now the food, also no. The $25 house made pasta dish was undercooked; we were shocked since making your own pasta usually mean knowing al dente. There were also giant chunks of slightly cooked garlic that made up more volume than preferred since they were pretty inedible. The server asked how it was and we said ok, to which he chuckled and said he could bring something else. My date hates to waste and said no then turned to me and also said, ""I don't want to waste more time."" The other things we got, seafood platter and escargot, were pretty standard. The mussels in the seafood platter were nice; not overcooked and slightly sweet. We didn't have high seafood expectations since Las Vegas is in a desert and being in Seattle a few weeks ago, so honestly the seafood is really just standard.

Overall we were completely underwhelmed and even offended. Definitely will not be returning and regretful that we chose to use up one of our vacation nights dining here.",1,0,0

If only I can be the aZn kid, Data from the Goonies then it would be awesome. Don't mistaken this spot for the Bouchon Bakery located on the casino floor, that's just the decoy. You must first start off in the lobby where you follow the signs near the check in\/out counter. Find the elevator that takes you to a secret Da Vinci floor. Bank a left out of the elevators and continue through the Michelangelo (inspired ceiling) hallways until you hit the spot on your right hand side. 

We arrived here around 1030ish am for brunch on a Saturday. The wait was about 20 minutes. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations. The restaurant was crowded and the tables are right next to each other so don't expect much privacy from your neighbors. I do recall the dude next to us throwing a fit about something.

Let's talk about their table bread. They just throw that bad boy on your table without a basket or a serving plate. Interesting concept but don't worry germaphobes, they use wax tissue paper to handle the bread. The butter and jam is what makes this a winner. First, I believe they're both made freshly. Second, the bread+butter+jam equals a scrumptious treat. Heed my warning: if you're on a carb diet, it's probably not a good idea to try it because you won't want to put it down. The flavor of the day was blackberry I believe. Sooooo bombskiz.

In honor of Le Roscoe Pierre Chicken & Waffles that I do love to eat in LA, I ordered the: the brunch chicken and waffles. From looking at the price ($25), you'd think they were giving you duck confit and waffles. Although it's a little pricey, I have no buyer's remorse. Honestly, I'm craving it as I type this now. The bacon and chive waffle leaves a distinct taste in your mouth. Normally, you're only use to the taste of butter and syrup. Not these waffles. You get a hint of the saltiness and some other unique flavors with every bite. You even actually feel the crunch of the bacon bits in the waffles itself.

The chicken is served in 2 pieces. Looks will deceive you here, the portion of the chicken may seem petite but when you actually rip the flesh off the bones like a carnivore that you are, you'll realize that there's plenty of meat to work with. Although the chicken was slightly salty, it was still very tender and juicy. It's accompanied by a mushroom type chauffer gravy sauce.

Service was great and the atmosphere is loud & vibrant. I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu and to eat some more bread with homemade jam!

My boyfriend and I went here on our first night in Vegas to celebrate my birthday.  We arrived a tad early and after checking in with the friendly hostess, we sat at the bar and ordered two glasses of wine.  The bartender was very friendly and helped us with some recommendations.  After about five minutes, the hostess came over and showed us to our table.

The table was beautiful.  We were seated outside on their patio next to a tall fountain in between two Venetian hotel towers.  Gorgeous.  After another round of wine, we decided on their octopus special with heirloom tomatoes, a cheese plate (selected by our waiter), and the pan roasted trout with almonds in brown butter.  Our waiter seemed skeptical that it would be enough food for us, but I told him we were saving room for dessert.

The cheese plate was very yummy.  With the exception of one cheese, I was crazy about all of the selections.  The one cheese I was not a fan of was just too pungent for me, which is saying kind of a lot since I am a cheese maniac.  I will get to the octopus later, but the trout was amazingly buttery and delicious.  I was stuffed by the end of the meal so I did not get that much of the entree, but my boyfriend devored it and I loved the bites I wrestled away.

Going back to the special octopus: not good.  It was bascially glorified calamari with three little bites of tomatoes.  Very salty and disappointing.  And to think the waiter had raved about it.

Which brings me to the waiter.  Okay, when I go to a nice restaurant (especially a nice French restaurant), I want a waiter who is friendly, knowledgable, and professional.  Our waiter had the first two, but definitely not the last descriptor.  We didn't see him for the last two thirds of the meal, but heard him talking to the table behind us about getting into fist fights and brawl with guys in his neighborhood.  WTF???  It wasn't only the topic of conversation that was irksome, but the fact that he was bragging very loudly about and ignoring his other tables.

It kind of ruined the evening waiting for a dessert menu (which was never offered), waiting for the check (had to ask a busboy), and hearing some young punk talk about his psuedo-UFC activities.

We enjoyed the lobster and mussel bisque, seared foi gras, steak frites and lemon tart. They serve fresh knotted pull apart bread right on the table with french butter and warm pistachios.  The bread was crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy in the middle.  Absolute bread and butter perfection. Our served kindly split the bisque for us at no charge.  It was rich, buttery, decadent and piping hot.  The foie gras was seared and served on butter soaked brioche and surrounded by a strawberry rhubarb compote.  I do wish the compote was a chunkier texture instead of the smooth puree.   Of course, the dish was very reminiscent of breakfast buttered toast and jam. Yum. It was under seasoned, but a few salt sprinkles fixed it right up.  The steak frites was doused in butter (shocking).  It was served with a hearty helping of pretty perfect fries.  They were. hot, crispy, and perfectly seasoned. The flat iron was cooked perfectly, and was wonderfully tender.  

At this point, our arteries were surely hardening, but we felt we could not skip dessert.  We chose a lemon tart for something light and fresh vs. a rich chocolate number.  It was the perfect texture; zingy and the un-sweetened pine nut crust was excellent.   

We were pleasantly surprised by the prices at bouchon.  We received chocolate covered strawberries with our check for the holiday.  A delicious meal.  We will go back, and soon.

Dining alone I opted to eat at the bar. I had the Quiche Lorraine, which came with a very small salad. The service was very fast (e.g. The waitress asked to remove my plate before I was done and the restaurant was not full), which led me to worry the quiche was heated by microwave.

The quiche itself was delicious! It was fluffy, light and flavorful; much better than most quiches served in the U.S. The only negative is that the crust was flimsy, which I've only experienced when microwaving.

Overall, I enjoyed the meal and would recommend the restaurant.",2,0,0

I started off with a steak tartare and it was decent. The steak was cut nicely but I thought it could have used a little more acid just to bring out the flavors. We also had the salmon rillete and escargot, which were amazing. The salmon rillete had flaky chunks of salmon and was bold in flavor. The escargot sat in a pool of garlic, shallots, and butter, and was topped with bite size puff pastries. It was simply delicious. 

I had muscles in white wine, garlic, and saffron broth, and it was best tasking white wine and muscle dish I've ever had. Although the muscles were a bit small, the garlicky saffron wine broth made up for the lack of meat. Oh, and the frites.... my goodness! They were so good that I had to ask the waitress to take them away from me. Otherwise I would have finished them all the crispy-salty goodnes. They give a hefty portion of frites with each dish so be ware. 

One more thing (and its going to be hard).... try not to fill up on that hot, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside baguette they give you in the beginning. I always try not to eat too much, but I have yet to succeed.",1,0,0

We took the Deuce which stops right in front of the Venetian and once you step into the closest doors for the Venetian, you will see Bouchon cafe- so convenient!  But we were looking for the Bistro.

A bit of a trek through the Venetian. From Bouchon cafe, just follow the path and stay right. Head all the way to hotel registration and to the right of registration is a corridor to a set of elevators. Elevators will take you to the floor where Bouchon bistro and the spa is. The bistro is away from the casino bustle and had a beautiful courtyard adjacent to it. 

I ordered the Madame croquet and my mother ordered the daily special omelet (flat iron steak, cheese, potatoes, and spinach). We also ordered a side croissant. 

There was complimentary baguette that was neatly prepared into individual portions- like leaves on a vine. The server informed us that baguette was made in house and complemented with house made butter and raspberry jam. It was warm and delicious!   

The meal was delicious! The omelet was light and fluffy while the Madame croquet was excellently prepared. The egg yolk was medium runny- allowing me to dip my fries and sandwich into. I consider runny yolk breakfast gravy. However, I felt that the Madame croquet needed more flavor other than salt. But I still enjoyed it nonetheless. It also came with a mountain of crisp and salty string fries. The croissant was also very delicious- light and buttery.  Portion sizes are relatively large. We finished what we ordered but we're definitely stuffed.

Service is excellent. Our server was genuine and unpretentious. He told us to save our receipt and use it at their bakery location for 25% off our purchases (valid for the next 3 days)!

It's safe to say that after the experience we had at Bouchon, I am inspired to visit more high-end restaurants like these once in awhile.

Bouchon was a big treat for us, we don't normally splurge quite that big for dinner, but we were out celebrating our birthdays, we were going to see the Blue Man Group and so I ended up making reservation at Thomas Keller's Bouchon.
Being that we never splurge like this, we had decided that price wouldn't be a concern, we knew it would be pricey but to order whatever dish we wanted, it was a special treat after all.

After running in circles around the Venetian we finally found Bouchon!  We were greeted very nicely and promptly seated at a table where we immediately were served water and introduced to our waiter who explained every dish so that our mouths were watering before even having seen the menu!

We ended up ordering a gnocchi with chicken and some kind of cream sauce, along with a carrot soup (well it had a fancier name than that....it was kind of like a vichyssoise.) and I, of course, HAD to get the french onion soup.  Why dine at a top notch french restaurant without finding out what a top notch french onion soup would taste like?

For dinner I ordered the Bouchon steak it had, for a lack of a better common term, something reminiscing of potatoes au gratin, but the potatoes were shaved and stacked into a square with sauce between .... (I'm not fancy chef, so I can't remember the term for everything lol....).  My husband had the flank steak with french fries.

Now, before we even got to the food, they served us fresh baked bread, it was delightful!! Soft in the middle, crispy crust.... just like it should be! Butter came with it AND warmed pistachios!  I'd take a warm pistachio, eat it and then eat some bread and the flavor from the pistachio carried over to the bread, it was divine. Can't stop dreaming about it ;-) lol.

The rest of the food was also magnificent.  Have you had french fries that melt in your mouth??? Never! (Well, now I have.... thanks Bouchon!) Steaks, of course cooked to perfection.  
For dessert, they happened to have my very favorite one on special for the day, Creme Brulee!   It was perfect.  Sugary top that cracked when we poked our spoon through it, cream velvety vanilly goodness overflowing..... 


The service was of course impeccable. Every time I took a drink of water, the glass was topped off again.  After awhile I almost felt bad drinking any more, because the poor guy kept running back with the water jug after each sip! :)

Pricey? Yes. But we went for the experience of tasting a master chef's cuisine and for the atmosphere.  For one night and one night only, we didn't care much about the bottom line.  If you come to a fancy eatery like Bouchon, do yourself a favor and forget about the price.  Order what you want to taste because THAT is what you will remember for the rest of your life.   

I would definitely come back, I do recommend that if you are out to try an upper class type of restaurant with good food, Bouchon is a good one for sure :)

So put your blinders on for one night, make your reservation at Bouchon and treat yourself to a mouthful or two of Thomas Keller's excellent cuisine.  You will enjoy it.",0,0,0

I got the Croque Madame which was good, a little too buttery for me, but that's just a French thing, but don't get me wrong it was very good and very crisp. One friend got the steak rare and it came out almost completely raw, which was a little sad.

One of the main reasons that I enjoyed it was because it was incredibly similar to what I've had in France. I've visited the Paris Hotel breakfast buffet in the past and it's like the disneyland version of ""french food"". This was just what I wanted, a nice place that's calm and simple. Nothing is too overpowering (like awful music) and the interior decor is lovely. 

The meal: The bread to start tasted exactly like that delicious bread only found in France, even down to the rich butter and marmalade that usually accompanies it. I had the full breakfast, the best bits being the juice, pain au chocolat, coffee & eggs. This is very simple and brought out in steps; the way it should be. 

Reading through the reviews I notice a mixture of complaints about wait time & richness of food. First off, if you're eating here after you've been wasted and filled to the brim with buffets this must seem like an unwelcome comedown. Clearly in America we're used to absurd dining experiences: massive portions, fast-eating and so on. All of it being amplified in Vegas; but it doesn't have to be. I imagine not everyone that visits Vegas wants to suffocate in gargantuan food, and can appreciate the luxury of a relaxed meal. In France a basic meal can on average last two hours, this is relatively faster than that !

We decided to patron Bouchon after reading some yelp reviews, and looking up the creator, Thomas Keller. Although yelp has it down as casual, the overall aesthetic was much classier. To be fair, they didn't refuse us service for our subpar attire, but I get the feeling that flops and shorts would be frowned upon. 

We arrived a little before our reservation, and so we waited at the bar and helped ourselves to a cocktail while we waited. The bartender's mix and presentation was superb; exactly what you'd expect for a 12$ cocktail. 

Once sat, we were greeted by an ever rotating service staff that seemed to have extremely niche positions. First in the parade was our head waiter, who showed us the menu (hint: it's wrapped around the napkin!) and immediately assuaged us without seeming condescending. Next in line was our baker, who's sole point was to constantly keep us breaded, buttered, and pistachioed. Since Keller also has a Bouchon bakery, we weren't shocked to find the bread was crusty deliciousness. Out waiter returned and I decided to quiz him on his menu knowledge. He scored a perfect grade. 

At his suggestion, we tried three cheeses as a sampler. We had a musette, cheddar, and a goat's milk cheese. All three had exactly the flavor profile described by our waiter, and were paired with a scrumptious dob of honey and a apple sliced fanned out.

At this point, the dedicated drink carafe holder had made an appearance, as well as our table clearer, who doubled as a utensil swapper. I've never used a single utensil for so brief a time. 

The main course arrived - lamb for myself, a gourmet bacon salad for my friend - and was, as expected, excellent. For dessert, we enjoyed the signature Bouchon (miniature brownies topped with pumpkin ice cream, over a toasted marshmallow base). 

Between the fantastically attentive and personal service, to the gorgeous presentation and overall tastiness of the meal, Bouchon easily earns a 4 out of 5. The food was delicious, but the flavors were relatively unidimensional and didn't quite reach that delightful level where you're left satisfied but craving more.",1,0,0

O.M.G. it is amazing! I actually thought about asking for a small container to take what we didn't use home with us because the thought of them throwing away such a gorgeous concoction made me want to cry.

The quiche du jour was a spinach florentine and it was delightful. The eggs were almost a custard consistency: smooth and creamy. The spinach was fresh and fragrant. The crust was buttery and flaky.

Walking in, I was greeted by a trio of very friendly wait-staff-members, one of whom directed me to a booth near the windows looking out on some kind of garden or plaza. The view outside was nice enough, but the menu offered more interesting sights. If you like waffles, eggs, or fruit for breakfast you should try this place. The selection from the aforementioned categories was impressive.

Still, I'm a light eater in the mornings, and tried to order a small salad. My server, thankfully, would have none of it. She talked me into ordering the lobster gnocchi. I also got some coffee, black. The coffee was impressively good, so much so that I inquired as to its origins. Supposedly Bouchon serves a chef-selected blend of three different beans. I'm not sure what that means, but I like the result - a hot drink with subtle bright notes but not too much bitterness. The gnocchi was, in my opinion, extravagant, for what was a very small dish. Fried capers, pieces of lobster, and gnocchi were the main elements of this fare. They were sufficient. The plate was very salty, very filling, and an excellent way to convey lobster to a sleepy, not-very-hungry, east-coaster.

A cursory glance about the dining room revealed the other patrons were thoroughly enjoying their dishes as well, most of which were of the giant waffles with interesting ingredient x variety. You won't leave here hungry.",0,0,0

I was looking for duck confit and it was on their menu, so of course I had to go.  The decor is not particularly French but it was clean and elegant all the same.

We ordered a small sampling of everything instead of entrees because we wanted to try more offerings.

Duck Confit - So perfectly done... Light and crispy skin and tender duck full of flavor which is both subtle but savory at the same time.  It's one of their more popular dishes and I am surprised it's not their most popular dish.

Charcuterie Plate - Go with what the server recommends as your selections and you can't go wrong.  We went with the big plate and tried all the combinations, including the head cheese and other more esoteric choices instead of the more common ham or salami.  The selections might vary depending on season so just go with what you like or ask for suggestions.

Steak Tartare - It is presented so beautifully with an egg on top.  Every bite is a flavor and texture sensation.

Pate - You can have it sautéed or cold.  We ordered it cold so we can eat it and enjoy the flavor without the extra grease or fat.  I don't think there is much you can say about pate that you don't know already.  It is rich, decadent, and about as close to food heaven as it gets.

I think we also ordered a Chilean sea bass, but with all the excellent tastings above, I don't even remember much about it.

The service was pretty good, my water was always refilled. The complimentary bread was delicious and the leaf shape  was just so cute. The jam was delish but the butter was too hard. I kinda wish they served it up softer, to make it more spreadable. Oh well. 

I couldn't decide what I wanted to order. I was inclined to order the special of the day which was a steak omelet but due to rave reviews I ended up ordering the chicken and bacon chive waffles and a chocolate croissant. The croissant was so buttery and flakey. Really good! The chicken and waffles were really good too, but in a different way. Roscoe's chicken and waffles is probably the best I've ever had but this one is a more sophisticated version, as it should be for $26 a plate! The chicken was moist and juicy. The waffles were golden brown, the hint of bacon and chives really enhanced the flavor. In my opinion it totally lived up to the hype. 

The only downside was that our food took waaaaaayyyyy too long. We literally sat there for 45 minutes before our food came out.

As many others said, the location is a little confusion.  It is not in the regular area with the other Venetian restaurants, but rather next door in the Palazzo (about a week before the offical celeb intoxicated opening), and the signs were not that great.  Anyways, we found it an upon walking in it was so beautiful.  The decor was amazing, I loved it!  

There was a party of 5 of us seated in a booth that most likely is for VIP....we had a view of the entire room.  (Quick back story....my friend made reservations for 4 and then the day before it changed to 5.  Well upon calling an additional guest was not possible.  However, the additional guest has a few connections in LA and therefore Vegas and she was able to get a party of five in.  Basically, what I was told after we left is that the restaurant thought one of our guests was writing a review).  Like another yelper, I also loved that the menus were cleverly wrapped around the napkins

First, let's start with the service.  For a party of five, we had about 5 different people waiting on us (and sometimes all at the same time, really it was a blast!).  Our waiter was great!  He was extremely personable and easy to like.   (I am not into the pretentious dining experience).  The sommelier was helpful and suggested great wines for the table.  And every plate was delivered and cleared with perfection.  The wine glasses were always full and bread always replenished.  Every single person that helped us was great.  

The food was amazing as well!  We were brought some of the best bread, fresh from the over (still warm).  There were so many great choices on the menu.  Instead of a main course, I decided on the endive salad (beautifully presented and just as delicious), French onion soup (overflowing with cheese, the best part) and roasted bacon brussel sprouts (amazing) I was not disappointed in the least bit.  Other ordered the fish (salmon, I believe), chicken dish and of course the steak frites.  

Of course the dessert was not to be ignored.  Although we each ordered a different dessert, somehow we ended up with 3 extra at the table (again, I think it had something to do with the rumored review).  I personally picked the creme brulee and was 110% happy!  This is one of my favorite dishes so I order it ALOT, and this may be been the best I ever had.  I forgot the other desserts, but I know there was not a morsel left on any of the plates! Everyone walked out very happy (and a little tipsy!)

The bill was very reasonable, I was actually shocked!  While I like to have a variety when heading to Vegas for restaurant, I would have no problem returning!",0,0,0

Started out with us getting our pictures taken for a keepsake, was a nice touch. Then onto an hour of the most amazing canapés that included:

Gruyère cheese gougeres
Foie gras terrine with orange marmalade
B.L.T
Dungeness crab salad
Salmon tartare

These were all delicious, but my personal favorites were the Foie Gras and the Dungeness Crab Salad. They were never ending, one of the servers kept coming back to me because he picked up on my two favorites, I literally ate a healthy serving of both.  Also served during the hour was unlimited Billecart-Salmon Brut Champagne MV. Servers made sure our flute was never empty.

Moving onto our assigned seats, we were then given a table full of more food;

Huitres
Olives Marinées
Assiette de Charcuterie
Rillettes aux Deux Salmon

Served with a glass of Pastou Sancerre, La Cote de Sury 2011. I'm a big Sancerre fan, this wasn't good, but the the rest of the plates were pretty good, charcuterie being the table favorite.

Onto the Salad of Maine lobster, Dungeness crab, bay scallops, Bouchot mussels, prawns served with sauce gribiche. This was probably one of the top seafood salads I've ever had. Dinner could've stopped here and I'd be ok. It was phenomenal. Salad was served with Christian Moreau Chablis 2012.

We then chose between sautéed Scottish Salmon or Slow Roasted Rib Eye. I've had their Scottish Salmon before so I went with the Rib Eye.  Equally as fanstastic as the rest of the food, and it was huge. I couldn't finish it. Main entree was served with Deyrem-Valentin Margaux 2009.

Dessert, my favorite meal. Chocolate Sponge Anniversary Cake with vanilla bean bavarois & fromage blanc ice cream. Served with the most delicious  dessert wine, Domaine Cazes, Rivesaltes Ambre 1996.

I was stuffed and just when I thought they couldn't possibly bring more food, Mignardises, a full plate. 

We were also given a ""goodie bag"" to take home that included a signed menu from Chef Keller, a box of macarons, and bag of shortbread cookies and a copy of Finesse magazine.

However, you have to be Indiana Jones to find the place in the Venetian.  Seriously....you have to go up an elevator after walking down a long corridor.  Then you see some guy standing behind a podium dressed nicely and I believe his only job is to point to his right....because he knows everybody that comes down that elevator is looking for Bouchon.  Then you have to dodge a huge boulder and the natives attempting to blow dart you.

But once you dust off the cob webs and make it through in one piece, you are in for a treat.  Actually you can get a basket of treats.  Seriously....they have a basket of danish (well I guess it isn't danish since it is a French restaurant), a basket of baked goods.  They are baked that day without a doubt because the freshness is there.  The type of confections that crumble when you touch them.  That is how you know you are about to eat something that is greater than anything else.  Now let's talk about the ambiance.  The restaurant looks like an upscale bistro.  It appears to be classier than another favorite French spot Mon Ami Gabi, and it seems it has a quieter feel as well.  Probably because half the patrons starved to death before making it to the restaurant.  

However!  It is worth the sacrifice of life and limb.  The breakfast portions are huge.  The omelet is amazing.  The boudin sausage with eggs is an excellent choice.  The french toast is also a great choice as well.  You must realize that it is bread pudding style and not the type you may be accustomed to.  But that just means you need to try it more.  People need to experience different things in life.  People need to be challenged.

Here is your challenge:
Prepare for your trek to the restaurant by first visiting the man at the General Store (just like the game Oregon Trail).  Purchase some head of oxen, crates of food, and have a doctor in your party so nobody dies of drinking typhoid water while out on the trail.  Once you see the scarecrow attendant that points you to the right, give him a thumbs up and allow him to call his family.  I am certain they have not seen him in years.

In this case, I was utterly disappointed.  Dry, almost flavorless chicken breast was what greeted my first bite!  I'm a dark-meat fan, purely due to its moisture, depth of flavor, and its succulence, so I already knew the dark meat will satisfy.  But the white meat in this case was typical of ANYWHERE else!  I'm not sure if the Las Vegas location is lacking the passion of its Napa bretheren, but the execution needs some adjustment.  The roast chicken in Napa seriously kills this 10-fold, with the breast just as succulent and moist as the thigh\/leg.

Best part of the meal?  The onion soup, and the amazing bread and butter!  I left the chicken on the plate, but destroyed the soup and bread as if that was what I came there for.  As for a return visit....it'll have to wait till my next visit to Yountville.",1,0,0

We located Bouchon by entering the Venetian main door and walking past the registration area to the right, where there is an elevator. We were told that it only goes to the Tower, and since the buttons were not properly marked, took our chances. Mysterious buttons notwithstanding, we arrived on the first floor of the Venetian's ten-story tower. The grand hallway through which we walked, with its painted ceilings, was so magnificent that food seemed secondary.  Then we were seated in the elegant Bouchon dining room, which really did look Parisian (everything about the place was much more like Paris than any restaurant in the nearby hotel of the same name).

I ordered the corned beef hash with its two eggs perfectly cooked-to-order. It was sumptuous and very beefy, the best representation of the dish that I've ever had. The delicious breakfast classic was accompanied by light and crispy toast made from pain brioché. Currant jam and a bowl of high-quality butter were delightful, and we used them on the house's French bread.

My husband had the omelette du jour, which was ""Caprese"" style with mozzarella di bufala, tomato and basil. He declared it a winner. 

We partook of both a regular croissant and a chocolate one, which were paragons of perfection, being both light and very buttery.

A side-dish of pecan wood bacon was unusually flavorful and cooked just right--well done and easy to chew.

Dessert was a fantastic trio of light and crispy profiteroles, which were filled with vanilla ice cream.

The bread reminded me of the cliché yet real image of me buying a warm baguette from a local French boulangerie over lunch and eating it over the course of six meals during my time in France as a poor college student. Unfortunately, the escargots and steak frites were mediocre.

Service was friendly, however, the staff did not seem attentive of the fact that we had a Cirque du Soleil show to attend that evening. The wait time between the wine, appetizers, and entrées was lengthy. Our dining experience from start to finish was over two hours. We made it to the show with minutes to spare.

Lastly, we had our concierge from the Palazzo inform the staff at Bouchon that we were celebrating our anniversary, but nothing was done to commemorate our special occasion.",0,0,0

Trust me when I say sitting outside can be very uncomfortable most summer days. It over looks the pool and they have beach umbrellas set up with blue and white decor. First come first serve so no reservations and you may request the outdoor upon arrival if available. 

I enjoyed their baked pastries. They are known for their baked goods after all but I most enjoyed the croissants-both classic and chocolate. I actually thought the spiced donuts were okay but I liked the berry jam. 

For my entree I tried their special. It was an omelet with steak,asparagus, and mozzarella cheese. Sounds good right? I felt like I could have easily made it at home. The steak I think was the thing that made it okay with it being very salty and almost looked like leftover steak bits. They give you a choice of side of fruit, sausage or bacon and I chose fruit. I thought it would have been an assortment but it was just strawberries. Not a bad thing since I like them but what if you didn't? My guest had a waffle with nuts and caramelized banana. It was better than Mine but I already had enough sweets with the baked assortment we started with. 

Since there is always room for dessert we decided to try the pineapple rum dessert. I would only recommend it if you Love rum. I thought it was overpowering. I would have much rather liked it without the run sauce so perhaps ask the server if you can pour it on your own. 

This experience with food was not up to the expectations today but I have also experienced their dinner and throughly enjoyed it. The service was very good I just think I will maybe choose a signature dish instead of a special next time.",0,0,1

The only vegetarian dish they had on the menu was their Gnocchi à la Parisienne which is sautéed gnocchi with a fricassée of vegetables & beurre noisette.  I had already had gnocchi the night before at Mastro's because that was their only vegetarian dish too but Bouchon's gnocchi was much better than Mastro's.  It was more flavorful and it probably had to do with the brown butter it was sautéed in.

I also had their Salade de Betteraves (heirloom beets, marinated baby fennel, navel orange & Oregon hazelnuts with petite frisée) which was also very very good, and their Champignons (forest mushrooms) that was divine!

Their complimentary bread came to the table nice and warm and it melted the butter perfectly.  I would probably come here just to eat that.

For dessert, the table got several different kinds to share, a lemon tart, chocolate bouchons, and a banana chocolate tart.  I liked them all but my favorite was the banana tart which was a special that day.

Their servers that day were great, friendly and accommodating.  Everyone at the table had a great time and thought their drinks were great too.",5,0,0

FRENCH TOAST: probably the best thing we had, but mostly because it was like brioche bread pudding and not really a breakfast food--I thought I was getting breakfast.  We had dessert at 10am. Oh well.  While the general flavor was pretty good, I do not know why they poured the syrup on the plate--it made everything that touched it soggy and uber sweet. So that's to say I ate around those sickly sweet parts because I don't like it sticky soggy sweet.  If you put the syrup on the side, which I didn't know i had to ask for, I might have really enjoyed this.

CORNED BEEF HASH: it had real hunks of corned beef and potatoes, but it didn't have much flavor.  I think it's a totally fixable dish.  

STEAK AND EGGS: well it was what they said, steak and eggs, with potatoes on a skillet.  The steak was ordered medium rare and it came out medium to almost medium well--c'mon, this is a Thomas Keller joint, isn't steak temperature one of the most basic things?  And then on top of it, the steak had no flavor.  It was like ok Safeway meat, thrown in a pan, with no seasoning.  If it was like a $2 dish, maybe I would understand but I'm pretty sure it was a lot more than that.

COFFEE: it was bitter and not enjoyable at all.

ORANGE JUICE: it was sour, but it was fresh squeezed so it's a risk you take, I know.

Service was friendly and quick at least.  And the decor is nice like a big version of the Yountville location (thankfully no neon Vegas lights or anything).  The only thing I wished they did was when we walked in, the restaurant was empty, and the hostess said it will be a 20-25 minute wait.  Maybe she could have explained 30 seconds because we all looked confused why you're telling me there's a huge wait when there's tons of tables--you know, we only have so many servers during the day, or we close half the restaurant etc...in any case, we got seated in 5 minutes so I'm not complaining, but I'm just saying it was odd.

On weekdays they only serve their breakfast menu from 7am to 1pm and there is limited lunch items...

I absolutely love the Yountville location but this one is no comparison so I don't need to come back to the Vegas Bouchon...

Tips
--It is located in the Venezia Tower. If you enter the Venetian main lobby, turn right at the registration desk (NOT towards the casino) and take the elevator to the Venezia lobby (it's like on the 14 floor or something, but there is only one button anyway)

--Bathrooms are located outside of the restaurant

--There is outdoor seating that overlooks one of the pools as well as indoor seating

--if you use their massive Bouchon stamp at the front of the restaurant, be ready for a really loud noise to imprint the card...it is cool, but it is hugely loud.",2,0,0

Next I had the soup special which was leek and potato. It was a wonderful purée with wee bitty bacon bits on top for color and taste. Who am I to say no?! 

After all that, a negroni, sitting on the patio in the heat I wasn't crazy hungry. (They also brought us bread and pistachios to nosh on.) So I split the chicken entrée with my other half. It was the right decision. It was still a large portion especially considering the amazing sauce it was served in. It was so rich, I'm pretty sure it was illegal in 25 out of 50 states. ;) Elegant and not at all overpowering.

Bouchon has never disappointed me. This is only for brunch though, I can't say anything for lunch or dinner. I've tasted the pomme frites, chicken and waffles, croque madame, profiteroles, brioche and jam and hibiscus drink. 
The pomme frites are crisp to perfection. The bread on the croque is nicely toasted and tastes wonderful with the gooey runny egg- however, I prefer mine with a fully cooked egg. The chicken and waffles are probably my favorite. Compared to Roscoe's, it's a different experience all together. You don't have to use the syrup because the waffle has this nutty flavor alone. Topped with a piece of chicken and a smear of butter and you're good to go! The chicken is beautifully fried with all the flavors coming from the meat itself, not the batter. 
I love bread and Bouchon has the BEST bread and vanilla bean butter on earth!!!! Everything is better with butter- lemme tell you!

We were just going to grab some pastries to go so we could munch on them at our leisure; however, we decided to go full-on breakfast at the last minute.

First of all, the restaurant itself is just lovely.  Elegant, blue decor puts you at ease as soon as you walk in.  There is also a very nice outdoor seating area if you are so inclined.  Service was great.  Our server was very expeditious in taking our order, bringing our food, and checking on us throughout the meal.

The first thing we did was sample one of their pastries on special, which was a chocolate almond croissant.  This was absolutely amazing.  The perfect way to start out breakfast.  They also have a special deal where you can get 4 pastries for $13, which sounds extremely cheap compared to most of Las Vegas.  We had them box some up to-go for us, which made us anticipating the next morning's breakfast in a hard-core, can't wait, stomach growling sort of way.

I chose the Brioche Doree for my main meal.  This was a delicious French toast served bread pudding style, layered with custard, caramelized apples and bananas, drizzled in maple syrup.  It was so delicious.  Comforting, moist, soft, oozy - all your favorite food adjectives rolled into one.  I ate all of it, and I never ever ever eat all my food.

My husband ordered the Petit Dejeuner Americaine which was two eggs any style with bacon, sausage, pastry, brioche toast, juice and a Bouchon blend coffee.  Out of all that, he was mostly in awe of the toast.  He took a bite, then sat back and kind of zoned out for a bit.  Said it was amazing, which is kind of an odd thing to say about toast.  But I suppose it is brioche that is made at Bouchon, so it probably IS amazing.

We split a side of Lyonnaise potatoes, and I highly highly highly two thumbs up suggest you order these with your meal.  Ugh.  So good.  In fact, I could've used a whole plate of these.  Like a huge, ginormous plate.  In order words, don't split this side.  It is definitely a single serving and you'll want them all for yourself.

Also, last time I had the lovely foie gras terrine which was CREAMY, RICHNESS, CLOG YOUR ARTERIES DELICIOUSNESS!

There was a very strong and very unpleasant metallic after taste to that first bite. My friend gave me a bite of his NY strip and it tasted the way steak was supposed to. Then I thought maybe the butter or shallots had burned and that's why my bite was off. So I scraped everything off the piece of meat and went in for another bite. Same story. Odd, off-putting taste all over again. I hate to use the word ""rancid"", but well, that's what it tasted like.

The waiter came to check on us and I ended up sending the steak back. As my waistline will attest, I have never sent anything back in my entire life. The waiter was very nice, though I think he may be new as he was a bit flustered and nervous. I was glancing at the menu to see if there was anything else I wanted to try and though he was trying to be helpful the waiter offering to wait for me while I selected another entree felt a little pressured. I hurriedly ordered the salmon and while it came out fast and was tasty, it wasn't really what I wanted.

I was surprised and disappointed by the experience here. I know this place can be great, but with such a huge variety of fantastic restaurants in Las Vegas, I think I'll have to move on from Bouchon.",3,1,1

Breakfast and Coffee are exceptional.  I enjoy the Hash and Eggs.  My Wife loves the Beignets.
My Last Meal on Earth:  I would start off by ordering an Ice Cold Draft Beer.  Next is the Rillettes aux deux Saumons = Great Flavor and what a way to get started.  I then move on to the Assiette de Charcuterie and another Beer.  Next comes the Oysters on the half shell.  They have a wonderful selection of the freshest oysters you can find, and we are in Vegas.  Finally comes the moment of my biggest delight.  My main course would be the Chicken and Waffles.  They are by far the best Chicken and Waffles you will ever have, and the chicken is roasted not fried. To finish off my last meal I would have one more beer.

It's not every day, after all, that you head into the parking garage and up an escalator that no one knows about, just to eat brunch.

The wait was short (they said 20 minutes, but it was more like 10). The service, unfortunately, was crap. Totally disappointing for a Thomas Keller restaurant, even if it is a more casual one. The food itself (Croque Madame for my girlfriend and quiche du jour for me) was good. The quiche was a bit on the small side (one slice for $12), but was a nice way to start the day.

If service was more prompt and attentive, they would've earned another star. It's also disappointing that you need to hike downstairs for the baked goods rather than being able to buy them in the restaurant.

Also, a Thomas Keller restaurant should really have fresh juice. Only the OJ, however, is fresh. The grapefruit juice is bottled, which is hilarious since even Treasure Island's buffet serves fresh grapefruit juice.

The roasted chicken was cooked perfectly, and the waffle was just crispy and sweet enough.  The vanilla bean sauce was just too much as I wanted more and more.  The real star of the show for me was the savory roasted chicken gravy that came in a small gravy boat.

Even the syrup was nice and refreshing. 

My omelet was great. It was my first time having chicken inside of an omelet, and although I probably wouldn't order that concoction again, it was good for what it was. The sausage was excellent.

Amidst the bustle that is Las Vegas, you can escape into this haven.  It is nestled on the 10th floor at Venezia Tower.  The decor inside is amazing, as soon as you step inside you are transported to a French bistro. Tall windows let in plenty of natural light.

The fresh baked Fugasse that is unceremoniously delivered directly onto the clean white table is beautifully formed and baked to crisp and airy perfection.  The vegetarian me, got lucky as their Pâtes du Jour was a mushroom based dish, it was earthy, rich and satiating.  

Oh boy oh boy there are no words to describe what we were delivered for dessert.. The Berry Pavlova, this cloud of sweet indulgence was served with what I can only say are the most extraordinary strawberries I had ever tasted!!  They tasted like real strawberries, not the stuff we have got used to buying at the grocery store, but the small delicate ones that some of us have had the privilege of picking straight off the bush and biting into, to have an explosion of flavor fill our being.. I would go back just for that..  Also their Pommes Frites and Oeufs Mimosa are not to be missed.

They are open for lunch on a weekday, but its a lighter fare. The menu was pretty limited to various soups, salads, and sandwiches. I got the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato bisque soup.

During our trip to Vegas we decided we wanted GOOD food, not just EXPENSIVE food. Therefore, the Bouchon, (as well as Jaleo and Yojie) seemed to be a fantastic option for us. 

We had a little trouble finding it - it is tucked back in the Venzia Tower area, but once we got there we were very impressed by the gas lamp lit hallway that, if you look to the right while entering the restaurant, is very beautiful. The restaurant itself is also very beautiful. Unfortunately, we were stuffed into a corner in the very front room with a limited view of most of the restaurant, which really bummed us out. 

The food and the service were mainly great, though. Our bread\/water waiter as well as our main waiter were very attentive, funny, nice, and knowledgeable. At one point I was sitting alone for a a long stretch, as my husband was making a business call. Both waiters made sure to come over and ask me if all was ok, and reassure me that dinner would go at our pace, which I really appreciated. 

We started with drinks - red wine for my husband, which was recommended by the waiter and it was good, and I had their cocktail the Silent Lady, which was a mix of whiskey, pineapple juice and a few other things that was smooth, and fantastic. I sipped on it throughout the evening. They also served us warm pistachios as well as a beautiful ""vine"" of french bread - both were wonderful.

Next, we decided to take it slow and order a few plates to share. We had the cheese plate, which our waiter worked together with us on. We like softer cheeses, so out of their selections of goat, sheep and cow's milk cheeses he selected the three that were the softest. It came with honeycomb, walnuts, crispy cranberry walnut bread, and thin apple slices. The cheeses were fantastic - two very creamy and spreadable and one a little harder, with smoky flavors. Really fantastic when paired with everything else on the plate.
For our next shared plate we decided to go with the deviled eggs. Although they were not our favorite - we thought that they were beautifully presented and fairly decent. We felt that they lacked flavor, as compared to a friend who makes her own, Coastal Flats in VA, and Pappas Bros. in TX.

For our main plates, we decided to share a few things again. My husband ordered the Duck Confit, the Crab Legs, and I ordered the Poulet Roti. All of the main plates were fantastic. The duck was succulent and fall off the bone, in a fantastic sauce with crispy skin as you'd expect. My husband also enjoyed his crab legs which seemed very fresh, and were in a lovely garlic butter sauce. My Poulet was fantastic as well - crispy skin, a lovely sauce just as with the duck, and the brussels sprouts were very nice with the bacon. I wasn't fond of the chest nuts which were slightly chewy and just not a good mouth feel for me.

Although we were too full for dessert, our waiter sold us on a small dish of their cherry ice cream which turned out to be really, really fantastic. It had thin crunchy shavings of chocolate, and small pieces of cherry. We very much enjoyed it. 

When they packaged up our leftovers ,they gave us another entire ""vine"" of bread which was incredibly generous. We had a really decent experience here, and if I was ever in Vegas again I would definitely come back to the Bouchon at the Venetian. I'm removing one star for being shoved into a corner and the Deviled Eggs could have been better. Otherwise though, this was a five star experience that I won't soon forget. Thanks!",1,0,0

For starters, I had a sweet corn soup with apple wood smoked bacon vol-au-vent. I was worried the soup would be too heavy to start with, but it was the lightest soup I've ever had. The consistency was almost like foam. The vol-au-vent, though very small, provided an amazing burst of flavor that worked really well with the sweetness of the corn.

My entree was the steak frites. This is possibly one of the most well prepared steaks I've ever had. The steak was juicy and tender the whole way through. Even the last bite had some juice left in it. It also had color  from end to end. I hate it when steaks continue to cook after they've been plated. When I was eating it I couldn't stop saying how good it was and I'm still talking about how good that steak was! On the side, the frites were the freshest I've ever had. I also had a taste of the macaroni au gratin and, though I'm not a fan of mac and cheese at all, I absolutely loved it.

The dessert special of the night was creme brulee and that was definitely the best creme brulee I've ever had. It was made with real vanilla bean. We were also given a sample plate of some mini dessert treats, which was a delight.

My sister had probably the best dish, which was the Croque Madame, which was a grilled ham and cheese sandwich, with a fried egg on top, and french fries on the side. It was a pretty big portion for a sandwich, and tasting just a part of it was just sex. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now. The cost came out to be nearly 90 (4 people) for the tab, but I have to say it's worth it compared to eating at a buffet, where your stomach would be subject to gluttony and unhealthy decisions. I would like to come back to this place again when Vegas is on my mind again.",0,0,1

I am a big fan of Thomas Keller restaurants and I'm from napa and have been to bouchon in Yountville before. The menu is pretty much the same but I just think that this restaurant doesn't compare to the original in the valley.... Here's what we had...

1\/2 dozen raw oysters... These were yummy and very fresh.

I had the Poulet Roti, which came with Bacon Lardon, sweet corn, arugula and onion confit. The dish was good but not anything great. At the end of it I was thinking to myself ""Dammit! why didnt I get the Croque Madame?!""

The Steak and Frites... Left a lot to be desired. The best thing about the dish was the French fries. The steak lacked great flavor and the carmalized onion overpowered the protein. A big no no. 

I probably wouldn't come back to Bouchon  Las Vegas unless it was a company paid meal lol. 

FYI the service wasn't great. We saw our surver once, only once in over 2 hours. our busser was too busy talking to some chicks in the back and we had to ask for steak knives and fill my own water (which I'm ok with) but I worked in fine dining and I know what good and great service is and this wasn't it.",0,1,0

We got into Vegas this past Friday morning and I went straight to gambling and drinking, not the best idea when you haven't had anything to eat. After coming down $100 on blackjack, I went to the bar to get more drinks and forgot about what just happened, another not so good idea with an empty stomach.

Finally, when we went to Bouchon to eat, I only remember a few things after leaving the restaurant to yak in the nearby restroom, then eventually just leaving the restaurant to go to the hotel room and sleep. (Stay at the Venetian, it's beautiful!)

So from what I remember, the bread they give you is tasty and creatively presented along with butter.

The service is top notch, very elegant. You should dress up and have proper eating etiquette. They will say something. I was putting my head on the table (you know why) and they didn't like this.

I don't even remember what I got. I wanted to get the Steak Frites,which was probably going to be awesome, but I didn't get it. I choose something else that was cheaper because I sort of knew I was going to just leave the place and sleep.

From what my friends say, the pork belly and veal were delicious.

One thing I liked is that this place is sort of secluded on a random floor. You must take the elevator then go down its own corridor until you get to the spot with a great experience ahead of you.

The setting is breathtaking. Bouchon is nestled in the gorgeous Venetian hotel. Even though we arrived well past dinner hour, the smell of fresh bread was the first thing to hit our noses as we approached. 

At the recommendation of multiple Yelp reviews, my friend got the Croque Madame - which was good, but was basically a ham and cheese sandwich. The fried egg and butter sauce added a rich component to the dish, but caused the bread on the sandwich to get super soggy. The fries, on the other hand, were piping hot, salty, and delicious.

My meal was outstanding. I ordered the trout, which was served whole with hericot verde and almonds. The fish flaked away perfectly, the haricot verde were crispy, green and fresh, and the almonds were sliced thin and added delicious flavor and texture.

We had been in Vegas for a week for a conference, and literally hadn't left Caesar's in 5 days. Finally, the conference was over and we were free to leave the building. We went to Bouchon to celebrate and just have some fun! We were ready to eat, drink and spend some cash on dinner.  

We got to Bouchon where we were off to a good start with one of the best dirty grey goose martinis I've had. We were seated at a large plushy booth, and opened the cute little paper napkin wrap\/menu. Everything on the menu sounded so good!  

And the downward spiral of our meal began with our waiter... First, our waiter, I really don't know what to say. He didn't know the specials, he was just not with it all. He took away mine and my friend's empty wine glasses w\/o offering another glass of wine. 3 out of 4 of us ordered the apricot and arugula salad, which was actually nectarine and arugula salad and he didn't mention it when we ordered it. We finished our salads, and then we waited, and waited, some of us with only tap water now to entertain our palettes, and waited, and waited FOREVER! Seriously, during our wait we never saw the waiter (nice play on words there!). Then he shows up and says, ""sorry for the little wait. haha."" And I'm like, ""We're really annoyed with the wait."" And he pretty much just laughed again and walked away! Mo-Fo!  

At this point I just wanted to pay for what we had already eaten and leave.  But our food finally showed up.  It was OK.  I had the steamed mussels in white wine broth served with fries.  Some of the mussels were not open.  I always thought that was a sign of bad shellfish and you shouldn't serve it.  The broth was good when soaked up with the bread, but the fries were too salty. 

We had said during the meal, ""The review will automatically get a one star rating if the dinner is so boring you fall asleep while still at the table."" Well, we definitely almost lost one to dreamland at the table and the dinner did bore us all enough that it sapped our energy to anything with our one free night in Vegas.

Pork Belly- this was a special entree that I shared with a friend. It came with more lentils as the vegetable which were unimpressive but the pork belly itself was ridiculously good. Nice and crispy on the outside, very fatty and tender on the inside. 

Lemon Tart- this was also awesome. As my dinning companions noted it was also like 3X the size of the chocolate tart for the poor soul who was foolish enough to order that. It was super lemony tasting so if you don't like that bitter bite than this probably isn't for you.

I could eat the skin all day. The chicken, however, was on the dry side unfortunately, even with the gravy. Maybe it is just that hard to cook chicken breast. The dark meat was a little better, but I've definitely had much better chicken from places with much less stars and dollar signs. What saved it were the waffles. They were pleasantly different from regular run-of-the-mill waffles. It is salty and fluffy with just a touch of crispiness. After adding the syrup, it is even more perfect. I would come back for the waffles by itself. 

My boyfriend had the salmon eggs benedict. The smoked salmon was on the salty side, so each bite took a little more muffin and eggs to balance things out. Eggs were cooked to perfection and the salad worked well with the rest of the dish. 

Their apple raspberry cheese danish is delicious -- this is coming from a person who doesn't care for apples. Apples weren't too tart or mushy; the pastry was light and had a gentle crunch. It is just sweet enough to make me want more.

It was my last day in Vegas and I was looking for a place to eat around my hotel. After reading Rod U's review of this place and being that it's in the hotel I was staying at, I decided that my last meal would be here. The ambiance is nice and I love that you can see all the fresh seafood on display as you enter. You have the choice to dine inside or outside overlooking a fountain and pool area. 

The menu has various options and my server was very helpful in assisting me in deciding what to order. I started off with some oysters (one of each of the 4 types they had) and coffee. Oysters were very fresh and sweet. The coffee was strong and just the way like it. Shortly after I finished my coffee, my server brought over a beautifully braided fresh baked bread. It was amazing! At this point I was getting full. 

As I was ready to tap out, they bring out my order of Hachis de Merguez. It was flavorful and hearty. Presentation for everything made everything so appealing. Even though I was stuffed, I continued eating because everything looked so good. I'm glad I did because the food was delicious.

The best part of our meal here was easily the spread of warm bread, butter, fresh roasted pistachios and Dijon mustard that they bring you in the beginning.  It's an interesting spread but somehow it all works well together!  

I wasn't in the mood for a large meal, so I only had their Soupe al Oignon aka French onion soup ($9.75) and a side order of Pomme Frites ($7).  The soup was okay but I didn't love the flavor.  I have rarely met a french fry that I didn't like and sadly I didn't like the ones here.  They were overcooked to the point of being dry and hard.  My friends ordered the Sole and Steak Frites, and they were disappointed by the flavors of their entrees as well. The only person who enjoyed their meal had a salad.

The portion was the right size and although it was pricey, the quality and taste made it okay. The best part was the grilled chicken, it was marinaded so well.

How casual?  One of our servers did an extended shimmy to a Prince song, there was constant ""inappropriate"" banter between ourselves and the wonderful individuals who serviced our tables, and there may have been an impromptu coloring session wherein caricatures of patrons at other tables may have been found serenading around the staff's own contribution - the sexy and i know it duck.  So while the high ceilings and beautiful courtyard might suggest one experience, you certainly aren't limited in that manner.  

The unanimous decision of our table is that this is the best service we have ever had.  I should explain that.  The balance between entertaining and professional one finds here is something I had previously not experienced.  One might think that perhaps the staff's antics was a convenient mask shrouding potential issues concerning their knowledge of the menu.  That is simply not the case.  We received incredible guidance concerning wine choices and our server hand-picked an off-menu dessert for us (an incredible vanilla bean creme brulee that one international traveler in our group deemed the best she has ever had... it was in my top five as well).  When I can say that people who worked at the restaurant overshadowed a Thomas Keller production in a positive fashion, it becomes at least subjectively obvious that a new dining experience has been created.  

That leads us to the food.  Bouchon is one of those few Vegas restaurants that allows friends with different means to comfortably dine with one another.  You don't have to go high-end (I did anyway); as you can see, most Yelp reviews focus on the cheapest dish, a luxuriously decadent take on the Croque Madame, a dish that is fully less than 1\/2 the price of the steak.  I am sure it is incredible, yet I would encourage patrons to purchase the steak Bouchon, a blissful cut of New York strip steak doused in black truffle jus and accompanied with celery and potato boulangere.  It was easily the best steak I have had since I have moved to DC, and frankly, may have been the best strip steak I have ever eaten (and yes, this is coming from a Texas guy).  The portion was generous, absolutely perfectly cut, aromatic from the truffle, and intensely flavorful.  I would strongly suggest pairing the steak with the sauteed spinach (brilliant) and potato puree (very buttery).  While it wasn't paired with the steak, the other dish I really enjoyed was the braised cabbage.  I wasn't as enamored by the mac and cheese here, but that isn't to say that it wasn't a solid preparation.  

Given that this restaurant delivered on two of arguably the best experiences of my life (best service and potentially best NY strip steak), it is pretty much a no brainer that I would suggest this restaurant to anyone.",9,7,10

When we finally stumbled upon Bouchon it was a deep sigh of relief that not everyone in this city lost their tastebuds to smokey casinos. 

+1: The bread and pistachios at the start. Call me a plebe but this was some of the most delicious fresh bread i've had in the US. It reminded me so much of fresh Parisian baguettes that we would get for about a euro while abroad. Yummm!
+1: Salmon Rillettes were amaze-balls! Seriously. GET THESE. they are smokey and buttery and a bit licorice-y. overall delicious. 
+1\/-1: I got the croque madame for dinner (Told you i'm a total plebe) and my partner got a lamb dish. The croque was yummy (mountain of french fries!) but the lamb was sort of lackluster. It wasn't bad per-say but it wasn't what we would expect for a place this renowned. 
-1: Can't quite put my finger on it but i left the meal feeling strangely underwhelmed. The app and the bread were great but the lackluster finish is what I ultimately remembered about the place. 

Overall: I'll probably be back next time I'm in LV since it was one of our best dinners there, but I wouldn't call it ""the best I've had"".",2,1,1

We had the french toast and the croque madame, both of which were finished completely.  In typical fashion, portions were perfect.  The french toast was much better than your typical version, with less carbs and was far more satisfying, but was a little soggy in the middle.

The place can be hard to find so the best thing to do is ask someone when you walk into the Venetian how to get here.  It's actually in the Venezia tower.  The employees in the Venetian are all really helpful and will get you there.

The place had a long lineup when we arrived and the hostess added us to the waiting list and told us it'd be about 30 minutes.  She showed us a sitting area where we could wait and there was some pastries that they had for people to snack on.

I tried the pastries and honestly I could have ate all of them and skipped brunch because they were that damn delicious!  

Thankfully I had some self control...trust me this isn't often and held off to try brunch.

The hostess got us early and quickly sat us at a booth.  The place is pretty nice inside.  Our waitress came over and brought us some water, our menus and some bread. 

I LOVED the bread they brought.  It's some of the best bread I've had since being in France.  The butter was great and the homemade jam was fabulous.

We ended up ordering some lobster, I ordered an omelet of the day (I don't even remember what was in it!) and my friend ordered a salmon benedict. 

The lobster was really damn good.  The older table beside us commented on how they liked our style.  They were super friendly and we had some great conversation with them.

Our omelet and salmon came.  My omelet also came with sausages and toast.  I took a bite of the toast and wasn't impressed but I just had some fantastic bread and lobster.  I left it but started putting some serious work into my omelet and sausages.  The omelet was honestly the best omelet I've had...I don't recall all the things that were in it but it was cooked perfectly.  The eggs were extremely fluffy like scrambled eggs but was in an omelet form.  I struggled to finish it and it took me a long time.

My friend loved her salmon and told me it was the best one she's had. 

I will definitely drop by the next time I'm in Vegas which will probably be next year to try something new.

BEIGNETS DU JOUR: Our pick was the raspberry jam-filled version, which was tasty but served cold, which we found odd. Feel they would have been even better warm.
ROASTED CAULIFLOWER SOUP: Beautifully smooth texture, subtle and delicate, topped with toasted walnuts for extra texture and flavor.
CORNED BEEF AND SPINACH BENEDICT (SPECIAL): Very tasty, the beef was tender and flavorful and balanced out well with the spinach. Hollandaise was rich, portion was generous, eggs cooked perfectly. 
MERGUEZ SAUSAGE HASH: Delightfully spicy hash topped with over-medium eggs and served with toast. Homey but well-executed, almost overlooked this dish on the menu.
POULET ET DES GAUFRES: Roasted chicken and bacon-chive waffles. The roasted chicken is excellent but combined with the incredible gravy, it is elevated to decadent! Waffles were just okay, liked that they had a bit of a savory element to them but felt the chive flavors were under pronounced. That gravy though is crave-worthy!
BRIOCHE DOREE(?): Bread pudding made with French toast, topped with caramelized pineapples and served in marshmallow. Tasty but not my thing, the bread pudding itself was cooked perfectly but neither the pineapple nor the marshmallow flavors really worked for my palate. 

Service was understandably more casual for brunch than dinner. Patio seating is available when weather is appropriate, and the setting and view are gorgeous.

My friend got the scallop entree and it was phenomenal!! Seriously! Very rich though. It was small, only two or three scallops, but because of the richness, we couldn't eat any more than that anyways.

Saturday, you've gotta order the chicken and waffles. The chicken, be sure to use the gravy. Trust me, my goodness! Amazing!

There really isn't anything not good on the menu. The only think I haven't liked is the French Toast. And that's only because it's not a typical Americanized style meal.... Which makes sense since this is not Americanized or American style food. Lot wasn't bad, I just didn't like it, personally. 

The management has always been very courteous and over the top helpful as well. Both the managers have given us their cards and told us to let them know when we come in.

Just look at the way the man smokes and drinks, WHILE eating his food! You think after all that tar and alcohol his taste buds are still working properly?? You only need to read his books to know that he isn't even conscious half the time he's eating. 

""Oh, we might've had the salmon, or maybe it was pork... I dunno, I was too drunk."" Okay Tony, we didn't buy the book just to hear about your drinking binges... BUT ANYWHOOOO

So he positively raved about Bouchon, describing it as something every French restaurant should aim to be... just to be sure, I asked my culinary school-graduate cousin if she'd heard of Thomas Keller, and she was quite offended by that actually. I think she muttered something like ""Doh"" and ""stupid bitch...""

Well, that was incentive enough for me to make reservations at Bouchon the next time I visited Vegas, and, taking Tony's advice, I ordered the Poulet Roti. That's just a fancy name for Roast Chicken. My bro had the mussels, which came with a huge cone of pommes frites, which is another fancy name for French fries. 

My chicken, as expected, was thoroughly enjoyable. The skin was crispy and delightfully tasty, and the breat was... JUICY! As I sliced into the tender white meat with my knife, I could see trails of juice squishing out of it. So I dumped my knife and fork and dug into my plate with my TEETH. That's how real foodies do it, guys, we use our hands, just as God meant for us to do.

The mussels were okay... simple white wine\/garlic sauce... but it had a sour tang to it! That baffled both my bro and me. Maybe it's how they make their sauce? With an extra squirt of lemon juice? Not our cup of tea, thankyew vewy much. 

Mmm, I heart the fries. I think they were the star of the meal, being crunchy and uniformly salty. Kinda like McDonald's fries, with less preservatives and a lot fresher. Yum. Fries. Oh yum.

But in the end I have to take off one star because it was good... but not THAT good, ya know? I dunno, maybe I just need to puff on a few of those cancer sticks and order a couple bottles of their finest wine... then maybe I'll think UMG the food here is outta this world!!!!!",2,1,3

I unfortunately have to share my experience and it was a sorry excuse for an establishment of this caliber. I went for brunch on a Sunday, and arrived shortly before it got really busy. We had an abundance of waiters so it was nice to have drinks constantly refilled. The bread was nice and chewy, the beignets were delicious and the mimosa was divine. I decided to order one of their specials, the eggs Benedict. My entree arrived looking like it sat under a heat lamp for 30 minutes. I immediately cut into my poached eggs to see if they were runny, and was sadly disappointed to see that they were fully cooked. I hesitated to send them back, then my friend reminded me that I was paying $27 for this plate so I might as well get it right. I sent it back and received another plate a few moments later. The eggs on this dish were better, still not completely runny but I accepted it. The dish was quite tasty and satisfying. The waiter apologized several times for the mishap but it still left a sour taste in my mouth after wanting to eat here for so long and then paying $80 plus tip for brunch.",1,0,0

I easily made a reservation via OpenTable and also made a note to tuck my $20 OpenTable gift certificate in my wallet for use at Bouchon.  I also requested to sit by the windows based on my fellow Yelper's reviews, and that request was honored.  Yay!

We were quickly seated, walking past the amazing looking oysters (which I don't even like!), to a beautiful table that overlooked a courtyard at the Venetian (might actually be a pool, but it was dark).  Our waitress immediately greeted us with enthusiasm and introduced us to the menu.  Having eaten a later lunch at Otto Enoteca and still being on EST, I wasn't as hungry as I hoped, which meant that hubby and I decided to split an appetizer and a main course.

Easy enough - let's get the foie gras terrine!  Yay!  (although the foie gras saute looked equally as good)  The small was plenty for two people - I actually think we left a smidge in there.  The bread that came with it was perfection.  I believe TK is the largest procurer of foie gras in the country, so if I'm going to eat it, I want to have it at one of his spots, because I know it will be the very best I can get.  And it was.  Yummy yum yum.

We settled on the evening special:  braised beef cheeks (i.e. beef bourguignon) with fresh papparadelle pasta on the side. OMG, amazingness.  Totally the best I've ever ever had.  It was like pot roast, just amped up with perfect herbs, onions, mushrooms, and other veggies.  And that pasta - GROAN.  I almost asked for a 2nd plate of it.  Delicious beyond words.  And again, the portion size was perfectly split between two people.  I don't know what we would have done had I actually ordered my own entree.  Mercy.  I did order a side of the garlic spinach, mainly because I adore sauteed spinach about as much as I adore spaghetti and I just couldn't help myself.  Delicious.  

Since we stayed at the Palazzo, we were offered a winter specials app for the complex.  I happened to notice that this meant a free dessert at Bouchon, which I happily redeemed for the lemon tart.  It was TART, omg.  I mean, TART.  My lips still pucker up thinking about it!  Hubby got some delicious chocolately dessert that made him happy as can be; I just can't remember what it was.

Wine was amazing, of course.  My french champagne was perfection and hubby's bourbon cocktail was too.  Our waitress patiently guided us through the various red wine offerings, letting us sample this and that before we found the perfect partner for our braised beef cheeks.  Yummy.

All in all, terrific service and delicious food and wine made for a super pleasant relaxing dinner, even if I was almost falling asleep in my food since it was essentially after midnight at home.  

And bonus!  The OpenTable gift certificate was happily applied to our bill, along with the credit for the lemon tart.  No snootiness at all!  YAY!

I would definitely recommend Bouchon for dinner, but man oh man, the breakfast, brunch, and even poolside menus look just as divine, so if you're having trouble squeezing in for dinner, definitely make an appearance for one of their other serving times.  Yay TK!",2,0,0

Bouchon is a good option for brunch, located in the Venetian. Friends we're staying at the Venetian for a conference and due to timing we decided to have brunch at Bouchon. I was able to make a reservation on OpenTable day of and the hosts were nice enough to seat our friends and allow them to order before we arrived. We were running late so this was quite helpful. 

The menu is classic French bistro with a mix of breakfast and lunch items. I've been to all the Bouchons at this point, from Yountville to NYC to LA, and have a good knowledge of the menu.

The chicken and waffles are a staple and served with a vanilla butter. Rich, sweet and salty, this is the best chicken and waffles I've ever tasted. The Cobb salad is also solid with thick pieces of crispy bacon, hard boiled egg and chicken. 

I was looking for something light, so I ordered their shrimp cocktail. It's one of my favorite shrimp cocktails due mostly to the dijonnaise that accompanies it. Four large peel and eat shrimp are served with cocktail sauce and you need to request the dijonnaise. 

Our friends ordered the goat cheese salad and the tartine of the day with truffle fries. The truffle fries were the most overpriced item on the menu and were not very good. They charge $10 to add truffles to the fries. The goat cheese salad is quite simple with a plain chicken breast on the side.

Other staple options include their omelette and croque monsieur. 

Their breakfast pasties are excellent but we were keeping it light so skipped those this visit.

This restaurant is located on the tenth floor of the Venetian so you don't see the typical Vegas crowds walking by the outside which is nice. I was expecting a casual dining atmosphere but when we arrived there were a lot of people who got dressed up (although there were a couple people who had on jeans and a t-shirt) and the dim lighting made it a great date place. The bus staff was very attentive and our waiter was actually french.  He seemed a little out of it at first..he didn't know what the specials were and had to read off the chalkboard which we could have done ourselves. 

Now onto the food and drinks...

Drink- The Bouchon. I tried the signature drink with my meal and it was very crisp and clean. Just a hint of a citrus taste. 

Appetizers- Beef tongue. I was surprised this wasn't chewy at all but it came on to the table just barely warm. I'm not sure if this was suppose to be a cold dish but the temperature threw me off a little. 

Main dish- Steak and fries, and Lamb special. 
My steak came out with fries piled high on the dish. The steak was cooked perfectly and the fries were thin and crispy just how I like em. But it didn't stand out from the countless other steak and fries dishes I've tried. As for the lamb dish, it was presented beautifully but looked half the size of my steak dish.  My BF finished it all and said it was just enough to fill him up.

Dessert- Pot de Creme.  The custard was flavored with coconut and it was oh so good! It comes with three small cookies to eat with ..I only wish it had more of those delicious little cookies. The coconut flavor was very subtle and it was a lot creamier than most custards I've tried.

The restaurant is not easy to find, but asking the less than friendly Venetian security we found it. The dinning room is beautiful with its high ceilings, ornate tile floors, long dark wood bar, with a raw bar at one end. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and guided us through. Every table starts off with a fresh Baguette to share and warm pistachios. Everything on the menu looked appetizing. There are several items on the menu that are not seen on many menus today like a charcuterie plate, which was great to see. We started off with the special, Sweet Carrot Soup with Almond Butter, then the Cold Mussels. This was my first try at cold mussels and they were fantastic; served on ice with dijonnaise. For entrees we ordered a Braised Lamb Shank and Roasted Chicken. They say one of the true tests of a chef is their roasted chicken, and this one was excellent; sweet crispy skin and juicy. It wasn't any thing special or different but it was cooked perfectly. The shank also was excellent; a deep rich flavor, fall-off-the-bone tender. I wasn't feeling wine that evening so I opted for the Moose Drool beer from Montana. Surprisingly this beer was a great compliment to the lamb shank. I was expecting a pint, but they only serve an 8oz portion of beer...figures. We turned down dessert but they knew it was my birthday so they brought out their trio of ice creams on brownies. The house made ice creams (chocolate, vanilla and basil) were delicious and the brownies were slap your mama good! They also sent us a coffee pot de creme, which for a non coffee drinker, this was tasty.

We were told it would be 20 mins and it ended up being more like 40 mins. 3) As we waited, it seemed an inordinate amount of tables were left unseated which was inexplicable given how many people were standing around waiting to be seated. Overall, we weren't impressed with their organizational skills. 

Finally seated, I ordered a special (scrambled eggs w\/shrimp and tomato lobster sauce) which was not very tasty. Quite ""meh"" for me. My husband ordered the ham steak with potatoes. I liked the potatoes, but the entire thing was way too salty for him. He did like his cream cheese danish very much. And I enjoyed the bread\/butter\/jam they brought around at the beginning of the meal. Overall we were quite disappointed.

And my boyfriend had the sourdough french toast with vanilla butter. 

We also shared a starter each day. Day 1 we had the pork belly. It was lusciously fatty porky yum yum surrounded by white beans and confit apples - absolutely delicious. On day two we had raspberry filled donuts which were airy and dense in all the right places.

I was there three times in the last month and have reservations to go again next month.  

The lamb and ratattoulle dish was delish.  If you don't like a gamey taste, you might not like it.  It has a small hint of game, most people who tried it said they couldn't taste it.

The Croque Madamme looked amazing!  and it tasted amazing.  It's pretty rich so it might be something you can share.

I also had the Trout.  It was good, but not my favorite.  Cooked well, and paired well with a light sauce.

For breakfast I had the Au Gratin.  This was by far the best dish I had there.  scallop potatoes are served on the side, while the main part of the dish is served in a small cast iron pan keeping warm a creamy, cheesy, oh so delicious treat.  It was a deconstructed au gratin that should not be challenged.  Can you tell I liked it? :)

The service was excellent.  The first time I went for a large party and they gave us the private dining room, which usually has a 2000 min, since no one had booked it.  

When we were there for breakfast, they were VERY slow, but they knew it. (they were having a little trouble with the homemade Brioche being ready).  So they gave us complimentary pastries, 5 pieces, and free espresso.

This restaurant defines luxury dining in Las Vegas. The beautiful decor is the perfect setting. From the French pewter bar, elegant dark wooden chairs, antique light fixtures to the vibrant mosaic floor. Never visiting Paris, I would imagine this is what a Paris Bistro is like, with a distinctive homey feel. Why is Bouchon the epitome of luxury?

The service is definitely praise worthy. Our server was very knowledgeable and genuinely friendly. Servers are dressed like someone you'd see in a French painting. White collar shirts, black vests and a long white apron knotted at the back. Managers patrol the room, lurking over each table, checking if anything needs doing.

Our server then introduces us to our sommelier for the evening. He couldn't be a better choice. He was knowledgeable and very enthusiastic about wine, but without pretentiousness. Bouchon only carries local wines, which is quite surprising considering they're a French Bistro. Nonetheless, they're very particular with the California wines they choose. The wines are selected in barrel from the cellars of the finest wine makers California has to offer, and are exclusive to the restaurant.

The menu is a single folded sheet of brown paper; it is, for the most part, a very standard traditional menu. With the daily special chalked on a blackboard. Not expecting anything less, we're served promptly. As the server walked through the dining room, a couple gazed to see what she was serving. The steam, and the wonderful scents catch their attention. It's Thomas Keller's famous French Onion Soup. After one taste of this soup, I knew it was on my favorite's list. Intense flavors, a beautiful balance of sweet and salty, and topped with caramelized gruyere cheese.

My main entree was a treat for the eyes. Colorful and well put together. Gigot d' Agneau, a very rustic dish originating from the south of France. Perfectly cooked lamb, just under medium, served on a cassoulet of pole beans, and topped with pickled lambs tongue. Finally, it's topped with savory infused lamb jus (juice). A party for the palate! 

Last but not least, dessert is served. I decided to go with one of my favorite traditional French treats. Marquis ou Chocolate. Dark chocolate mousse with burnt orange cream. This French treat is like eating a giant truffle. Not only did the orange add a bejeweled touch, its citrus notes brightened the chocolate. However, I did expect more flavor from the dark chocolate itself. I had a hard time finding the bitter notes of cocoa, and still this dish makes a strong magnificent statement.

Looking around you don't see any plates going back untouched, to say the least. Tom Keller's ideas on how to meet French techniques with a California sense are intact. This contemporary yet sophisticated Bistro has made my top ten faves. After my experience, I will be back expecting nothing less. I hear Tom's brunch is something spectacular!",0,0,0

Oh. my. god. The quiche. The quiche is like none other that I've ever had. It's really tall and fluffy and flavorful, and the crust is perfectly flaky. That's the dish that hooked me. After that I've made it a point to have brunch or dinner here every time I'm in Vegas.

My favorite dinner entree here is the trout. I think they have different seasonal preparations for it (I've had it once with almonds and once with cauliflower), but it's awesome either way. If you're lucky enough to eat here while they have their special veal appetizer, you'd be stupid not to order it. It's like a little rectangular piece of veal with a crispy topping on a bed of creamy polenta in an espresso broth. SOOOO GOOD! Wtf? It boggles my mind how Keller came up with that combination. I dunno what they do to that veal, but there was so much flavor in each bite that I almost died before my entree arrived. My boyfriend ordered the Capon (also a special - chicken that has had its man-parts removed), which was also extremely delicious. Most tender chicken I've ever had.

We did run into problems with the service during one brunch. The waiter was awful. He told us the wrong specials, forgot to bring our coffee, and just wasn't very attentive. That day something was wrong with their system and they weren't able to process any payments. The waiter got very frustrated because he had several tables wanting to pay and leave, so he started cussing in front of everybody. I mean, I cuss too, but I just didn't expect it in a classy restaurant like Bouchon, or any restaurant for that matter. He probably had a nervous breakdown or something. The general manager did send me a $50 certificate though to make up for the awful experience. Even with the service problems, I still give it 5 stars, the food is THAT good.

We ordered the french onion soup, the trout and the steak. It was okay. I wish I could say more about the food but it really wasn't too memorable. Maybe French cuisine wasn't our thing so escargot, caviar and fancy cheeses didn't sound too enticing. 

Surprisingly, Bouchon stills stands out in my memory as pleasant, enjoyable and unforgettable. It's probably because of the good service. Our waiter was very friendly and engaging. When I was choosing a healthier dish, he teased that I shouldn't be thinking about diets on vacation. For dessert,  we tried ordering ile flottante or vanilla meringue with almonds and caramel but they had just ran out. Our waiter was not ready to disappoint...he came out with all the different desserts they still had. Five dessert dishes total! He said we should as well try the others and they were on the house!

Wow, very impressive! Granted it was late and they probably wanted to get rid of any fresh food they had, it was greatly appreciated on our part. They were all delicious especially the lemon tart and chocolate mousse. It was very generous of them and we made sure we left a good tip.

I also ordered some brioche, which came as slices of toast (not like the little crown-shaped bread thing). The brioche was pretty good, though nothing spectacular.

The Venetian is a bit of a circus but it is worth going over there for Bouchon.  This has to be one of the easiest Thomas Keller restaurants to get into in the country.  It is one-fifth of the experience of The French Laundry or Per Se.  But for delicious, reliable bistro food it cannot be beat.  Right up there with Keith McNally's definitive NYC bistros.  

I always get the foie gras en terrine.  It comes in a little glass crock.  They scape the excess fat off the top and put it next to the candle to warm it up.  Then they bring a constantly replenished supply of eggy, buttery toasted brioche chunks for you to spread it on.  

It's like:  ""Waiter, bring me a fresh plate of toasted brioche every ten minutes until I pass out.  And then bring them every twenty minutes.""

I'm a creature of habit so I always go for the definitive steak frites.  But you can't go wrong with anything there.  You'll already be full from the terrine de foie gras so the entree only matters in so much as you'll be taking it home to have for lunch the next day as you don't want it to get in the way of dessert.

I really enjoyed my experience at Bouchon.  The food was good, the service was good, and the atmosphere was good.

I do have a couple of knocks against the place, but nothing major.  They do not take reservations for the weekend brunch, which is fine.  However, we were told that if we arrived at 11am, we would be just fine.  It turned out that we ended up waiting about half an hour for a table, so that was a bad call by the hostess.  Then, when my friend was putting down his name for the waiting list for a table, he spelled his name for the hostess, and she still wrote it down incorrectly.  Not a big deal, so not a big knock.

Service: nice host and server. Server always asked us about our meal and refilled water for us. She seem to know a lot about the specialties of the day and was really caring.

Food: food here for breakfast has been the same over the past few years I came here. Either egg, muffin, waffle, sausage, etc. 
Got the sorted pastry and that was good. 4 big pastry is satisfying for one person. The pain au chocolate was fluffy and crispy. The sticky pecan bread was tad bit sweet. The blue berry muffin was good. Really wanted to try the fruit tart but they ran out. -sad face- but it was only 10 am though. 

Sausage and egg was one of the specialties of the day. Sausage was too salty. Did not like.

Hanger steak and egg was another special dish of the day. Steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare as asked. Looked dark on the outside but perfectly soft and red inside. 

Terrine foie grass was interesting. First time trying it. Basically like 6 small strip of bread and a small jar of foie gras and another small cup of salt. Spread the foie gras onto bread and done. Too little amount of bread though. I ended up taking breads from the other dishes my family ordered to add with the foie gras. For $25, that's very little for a big price though. If you never tried it, it's worth trying once.

I think I would have been sick of them after 5 mussels. I got to try the waffles from the chicken and waffles dish as well.  The waffles were disgusting.

We're (unfortunately) in Vegas a few times a year on business and went to Bouchon for an early 6:30 dinner after working all day at a trade show. We didn't have a reservation and were offered a table on the outdoor patio. I protested that it would be too hot since I knew it was over 100 degrees out there. The hostess added ""it's not too bad"".... I should have added: ""we're here for dinner, not Bikram yoga""....I Googled the weather and found that it was 105 degrees. Up dog, down dog.... 

They miraculously found us an inside table. We were not famished and ordered: 

onion soup (I ate mine, wifey's went back: too salty and just not good). 

mushroom quiche - undercooked to the point where the egg was still runny (wifey sent back, they cooked it more, still nauseating)..... 

side order of green beans (haricot verts) okay, nothing special 

side order of ratatouille (more salty than the Dead Sea)

Action:  apologies.  soup and ratatoulle removed from bil.  Free extremely marginal dessert given.   Halved yellow cherries ON TOP of FOLDED crepes with a sugary sauce and tiny scoop of bland ice cream....This was ""on the house"" after I reminded the waiter that it was supposed to be on him.

We were starving when we arrived and nommed our way through the delicious bread extraordinarily quickly.  The only thing that would have improved the bread would be warm bread.  

Two people in our group ordered the french onion soup, and they raved about it.  We ordered a side of marrow and I really enjoyed the way it was seasoned.  We had to ask for extra crostini, which is a pet peeve of mine when serving food that requires a cracker\/crostini\/etc to eat.  But it was tasty and they brought out the extra crostini without delay.  I shared the goat cheese salad with my husband.  It was exactly what we expected it be, and very tasty.  

For our mains, three of us ordered steak frites, and the oddball in our group ordered the veal.  We were already full on bread, salad, soup and marrow so it was hard getting through the main course.

Group of 6 had breakfast here.  Beautiful setting in high ceiling french bistro setting overlooking landscaped pool area.  Got table right away, wasn't full at 9am, but was 2\/3 full by the time we left.

Ordered pastry basket which had 4 outstanding pastries ($16).  Ordered coffee, which for drip, was outstanding ($3.50 each).  

I ordered omelet of the day, which was excellent ($16).  Wife ordered sourdough waffles, which may have been best we've ever hard, topped with sauteed bananas ($12).  

Other couple split chicken and waffles.  Waffles had bacon pieces in them, savory.  Chicken was roasted, not fried.  Tender and tasty, with great gravy.

Altogether, with some split meals and other stuff not mentioned, $96 tab for the 6 people.  Everyone ate plenty.

I've had brunch and dinner at Bouchon before and everything is delicious. I can't say I've had a dish that I didn't like. In terms of drinks, I've had wine and the Bellini in the past. I tried the Bloody Mary this past brunch outing. This was my first time trying Tito's Handmade Vodka with the Bloody Mary and I have to say, I loved it! Whatever smooth magic this Austin, TX spirit adds to the cocktail really works and this might become an ordering classic. 

This past brunch outing, I had the poached eggs benedict with smoked salmon. They do eggs and the hollandaise sauce very well. The smoked salmon was plenty and quality. The greens that the dish came with was dressed lightly with white wine vinaigrette and there's added tarragon leaves for finesse. 

I tried my hubby's croque madame which I've ordered in the past before. The bechamel sauce is done well and the truffle fries that it comes with is more than plenty and is probably the best I've had.

4.5 Stars.  Thomas Keller does not dissapoint here with dishes that make you buckle.  This is his ""affordable"" and easier to get into establishment.

FIRST, SKIP the coffee!  The only disappointment here.  Maybe I don't know what French coffee is supposed to be like but DAMN!  This thing is like......crude oil.  Its thick, bitter, dark flavor just got worse and worse with every sip.  Nor was it hot hot, just above warm.  Don't even do it, or you'll remember I told you so.

Now.....

- Vaunted Chicken n Waffles was ridiculous.  The roast chicken 1\/2 dark 1\/2 white was just succulent, moist, flavorful, perfect.  This dish was most likely the cause of a longer wait holding up rest of our dishes, probably because they were handpicking which poor chicken's time were up.  The gravy was good (think it had bacon in it or ham), but not necessary as the chicken was just delicious.  The Waffles as others noted are not your everyday waffles.  They were sweet yet sour, crispy yet soft.  It took a few bites to get used to the uniquness and am still unsure whether I liked it or not.  But it doesn't matter because the chicken was very good.  Not a huge serving of chicken, but the whole entree was filling enough.  

-  Brioche French Toast was delicate, meltful (I love making up words), fragile, beautifully done.  The Vanilla Bean butter and syrup went perfect with the blueberries.  I'd order this everytime we come here.  

- The special Chocolate Almond Croissant.....the moment it hits your lips, you're done.  The exterior look is nothing special, but once you bite, once your tooth hits the pastry, your saliva glands explode.  Nuff said.

- Table Bread was meh.  Skippable.  Don't waste stomach space on this.

Service was strong.  Not stellar, but strong.  Water\/coffee filling was often.  One server was too busy and less attentive, another was super friendly and alot of pleasant sweet eye contact.

In Vegas, there are so many restaurants to try that every visit you plan different spots to try.  Bouchon at the Venetian is one that will always be considered for every visit, just make sure to skip the coffee.  Yikes.",35,26,35

One of my favorite types of cuisine is the ""French Bistro"" type, and thankfully my dining partner likes it as well...
We went for breakfast first.  We sat at a table inside near the patio.  Dining partner had the Croque Madame- huge with tons of bechamel sauce and a pile of fries so big it could have fed a small-ish army.  I was jealous of this, but I had a nice omelette with ham and cheese.  Both of us had sides of bacon, and it was tasty, and the appetizer was an almond brioche...that is my fault, for I love almond paste very very very much a lot.  Both of us at the table love bacon too, but back to the croque madame.  YUM.  The coffee was good, so was the OJ, and I rarely order juice.  We had to walk it off, and thank the stars the strip was right outside to walk on.  On or up?  Oh well, never mind.

LATER----we decided to go have some oysters.  We ordered a half dozen oysters, the charcuterie plate (delicious) and then ordered the moules frites...which were really really scrumptious, but we had no room for them, and this is a long story for we sort of ate an appetizer somewhere else, which I will review later...and our eyes were bigger than out stomachs, and I mean this in the nicest way.  The sauce that the mussels were swimming in was fabulous, and dipping french fries in this sauce was divine.  The mussels were fat ass, and consistently this way and juicy and delicious.  Despite the waste of not all eaten mussels, the meal was super, and I loved all of it, would definitely go back again and again.",1,1,1

We've been here before and always enjoyed the first-class service and beautiful ambiance.  The food is amazingly consistent and well priced I think.

For appetizers, our party of three split the barley salad with baby artichokes and the duck confit.  The salad was interesting - interesting texture similar to rice but with a good amount of acidity from the tomatoes.  The duck is basically a leg quarter that's cooked to a super juicy consistency with a crispy skin on the outside.  It's served on a bed of buttery polenta.  This dish will make you a fan of duck!

For main course, I always get the roast chicken - basically Bouchon elevates this dish like no other.  It's roasted to perfect consistency and like the duck has a crisp, buttery skin.  They offer some roasted potatoes and Brussels sprouts too.  The chicken meat is perfectly cooked and the sauce is amazing too.

My wife had the mussels in saffron broth with truffle fries, which were generous portions.  Our 14-yr old niece had the grilled ham and cheese (topped with a fried egg) with fries.  It looked pretty tasty since she scarfed it all down.  Note that Bouchon is fairly generous in portion size - so no need to order extra sides of fries.

For desserts, it's hard to do better than the chocolate bouchons (3 brownies per order) with peppermint ice cream.  Sweet balanced by minty refreshing flavor.  The other dessert was the eggnog pot a Creme, with two shortbread cookies.  This was also amazing - similar to a panna cotta with a unique flavor.",1,0,1

We checked the website's menu and decided to order two club salads to go.  The website said that the salads were $16.95.  When I went down to pick up my order I was handed a check for for over 50 dollars.  I figured it must have been a mistake so I politely asked the bartender if there was some sort of confusion.  He went on to tell me rudely that I should have never checked the menu online and it was wrong (customer service score=0).  I owned a restaurant for over a decade.  First rule = the customer is never wrong (even if they are).  That said, I wasn't wrong, so I showed him (politely again) where on the website I saw this information so he could let management know that it needed to be updated.

Over one year ago, this was one of my favorite places for brunch. The chef changed about one year ago and their quality was nowhere near what it used to be. I remember the pastry was not as good and the food in general was mediocre after the new chef came in. As a local, only I would know that. We chose to go to different places because Las Vegas has so many incredible places for brunch, both on and off the strip. We were staying nearby for a staycation and decided to give it another try earlier today at about 11:30 AM.
In my opinion, this place is a phenomenal tourist trap. We only waited 15 minutes for a table but it was what happened shortly after that left me completely disappointed and unappreciated as a customer...
We were sat at a table that would be for four and there are only two of us. It was blocked by a large wood panel which made the area dark and gloomy. We noticed at least three other open tables for two people each. We asked if we could be sat at one of those tables instead. We would never have asked if our table was the only one available. We were not looking to sit outside but we were looking for the best option should it be available, which three options were! The hostess that was helping us was more robotic than anything else, clearly showing that intelligence and a flair for customer service are not required to work here. When we explained that we would like to sit at a different table, pointing to the tables available, none of which were anything special and between so many other people and in a very busy section, we were told that those may be reserved for a CEO or a VIP, yet it was confirmed that none were expected at this time! The hostess went as far as to say that we would have to walk back with her to the front if we wanted to change our seats. We were so kind to her the whole time and we were shocked 'internally', trying not to show reaction. After she said that, I explained that she just made us feel like we are worthless and completely unappreciated as a customer. I also explained to her that without my business, a CEO doesn't have a job. My friend and I are blessed to do extremely well and we both know that no CEO or VIP would ever insist to sit in these areas as they were completely stuffed with other people, very limited in space, and there was no privacy.
Not even five minutes later, a gentleman came over and it was clear that he was doing everything possible to correct the situation. By this time, we tried not to show reaction but we were both completely let down. He offered us another table and insisted. We followed him and he placed us at another table for four that was close to the outside, yet it was right smack in the path of waiters which would mean we would constantly be in close proximity to waiters passing us by and causing us discomfort because of that. The other three tables were still empty. He actually believed he gave us a great table. He insisted on offering us a drink on the house yet I don't drink! My friend was trying to be nice so she said she would take a Bellini. Not even 30 seconds into sitting there, we already had a waiter bumping into our chairs, not in anyway his fault, because the table was in his way. We chose to get up and we left.
I will never try this place again and I will not recommend it to anyone because it is deplorable. This restaurant has forgotten that in hard times, locals are what keep business going. As a local, through my own actions and word-of-mouth, I will not be encouraging business for this restaurant ever again.

I felt like our server had one too many drinks the night before.  He was not only slow with everything, he was also just very strange. 
 
Back to the food...
 
The food looks infinitely better than it actually tastes.  I tried the Croque Madame (with pomme frites!) and the Chicken and Waffles.  Additionally, the bf tried the oysters, which he said were good!
 
Pomme frites were good, but not the best I've ever had.  I think I had high hopes based on all the other reviews.  They were the perfect size and cooked the perfect amount, but they were not satisfying.  And I love French fries.  I love eating them so much it's unhealthy.
 
Chicken and waffles was also decent, but not out of this world. 
 
Okay, so when the food came out, it looked beautiful.  When I took a bite, it was good, but not as good as it looked.  The food was cooked perfectly well, but there was something missing.  However weird this sounds, the food lacked character.  Everything tasted fine, it was just uninspired.  It was one of those experiences where you think it'll be amazing and when you're actually experiencing it, everything seems amazing.  Everything is executed well.  But then you're done with the experience and it wasn't actually quite as good as it seemed.  It was still good, but there was something missing.  That's how I felt about my brunch with Bouchon.

I guess when you are out on vacation and without a full working kitchen (and just don't want to cook anyways), it is quite tough to eat healthy, but this was nuts!  And unplanned.

My Bouchon Bistro stop was an attempt to have lunch before it got too late.  I considered looking for something green, such as their cobb salad, but was enticed by the waiter pointing out that the Brioche Doree $12 (French toast with brioche, vanilla custard, caramelized pineapple, toasted marshmallow & maple syrup) was one of their specialties.

What came to the table was easiest described as a small tall brick of bread pudding.  Thick and moist and yummy.  I was glad to have tried it, though my sugar levels may have to disagree with me.

Bouchon Bistro was a bit tough to find as it was located a bit away from everything on another level.  I had to take an elevator at the Venezia Tower, and from there it was still a bit of a walk.

One nice bonus of dining at Bouchon Bistro is that the receipt you get doubles as a coupon for 25% off a Bouchon Bakery purchase at the Clock Tower location.  The negative was that finding this specific Bouchon Bakery location (from within!) was a quest in itself.  Asking staffers for directions only ended up adding to my frustration.  My tip to finding this particular Bakery location is to head outside to the Las Vegas Blvd, and then look for the clock tower to the north side of the property - you can't miss it then!",0,0,1

We were seated within 15 mins or so in the outside patio, which was very nice. It was the perfect temperature with a beautiful breeze blowing.

Ordered an ice tea, which had great flavor (I know, what makes a great ice tea??) and dug right into the bread. As instructed, we added butter and jam, which is super delicious! 

We also ordered Beignets du Jour, which conveniently came with more jam and Nutella. These were yummy!

Now that we were sufficiently stuffed with bread, I made my order of  Oeufs Benedict; two eggs poached served with smoked salmon, country bread, sauce Hollandaise and mixed greens.

The food came out in just the right amount of time. Smoked salmon was delicious - great smoky flavor which mixed well with the eggs\/bread. I wasn't a huge fan of the Hollandaise sauce, it seemed a bit bland (maybe the smoked salmon overpowered it). 

Our server was ok, not very personable. Didn't say much the entire time but delivered everything, so not a big deal. Sometimes you get a server that goes over the top and chats you up\/shows enthusiasm.

In contrast to my preconceived notions, I was surprised to find that Bouchon was as warm and unpretentious as it was impeccable in its execution:

__________

We stopped by Bouchon after a typical (i.e. sleepless\/drunken) night out on the Strip, and we were very much in need of some hydration & nourishment. The comforting, laid-back atmosphere of the restaurant was exactly what we were looking for - soothing and classically European.

+ Throughout our meal, we found ourselves glancing around the restaurant wondering if we were still in Vegas. 

While many businesses go to lengths to pull off that ""oasis from the action"" sort of vibe, Bouchon's take on such an aesthetic felt effortless and downright relaxing. The minimal music (although there's lots of ambient conversation), high ceilings, and abundance of natural lighting combine to transport you into what feels like a lovely French estate getaway. The whole setup is about as un-Vegas Strip as possible. 

+ We arrived without reservations on a Sunday morning, but our roughly 20 minute wait breezed by, thanks to a selection of newspapers\/magazines to browse through. 

__________

+ The complimentary table bread was the perfect kickstarter for an AM meal. It had a just-right exterior with a balanced crunch, coupled with a moist inside that paired very well with the day's jam selection (I believe it was apricot). This bread was so tasty that I felt compelled to ask for some to take back to the room to snack on later in the day.

+ We knew that our visit would be incomplete without ordering from the Oyster Bar - but being that I'm not a master of mollusks, we decided to go with our server's recommendation in determining what variety of oyster to go with. 

His selections were fantastic - mild and creamy with just a hint of brine. Paired with a spoonful of cocktail sauce and a dollop of horseradish - I could've shoveled those down by the bucketful! 

+ While I consider myself to be a generally adventurous eater, I definitely wasn't showing it during our visit to Bouchon. The Bouchon Burger was admittedly a safe pick on my part - but a heaping fistful of red meat was just what my stomach was craving after a night of drunken debauchery. 

The Burger was executed with an impressive attention to detail; the bun was crisped yet airy, the cheese melted but not runny. Most importantly, the patty was thick, delectably juicy, and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. 

The side of ""Animal Sauce"" was unashamedly reminiscent of a certain fast food chain that we Californians all know and love - but hey, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery!

The heaping pile of fries plated alongside the burger were a solid accompaniment, though the portion size on these fries could fill two diners with ease. In retrospect, we probably should've split a burger and ordered up some of the menu's other items for the sake of trying different things.

+ Bouchon's commitment to meticulous execution shined through again via a dish as simple as the Sauteed Spinach, which was amazingly fresh and full of vibrant flavor - a great counterbalance to the richness of the thick Burger. 

__________

+ Service was very thorough and consistent; my water was consistently filled, and so too was my coffee. I didn't have to ask for a refill even once! 

The level of service was all the more impressive considering that the restaurant got more and more packed as our meal went on - patrons seemed to pour in without pause, and no table went unfilled for very long. (That's always a good sign!)

Definitely planning a return visit - if not here, than definitely to the Beverly Hills location...!",5,2,6

We had to ask for a new waiter, the management was accommodating and we got a new very normal guy, who knew what he was talking about.  

I ordered the gnocchi entree and it was disgusting. The pasta was charred and there was a green leafy vegetable and pieces of nectarine in the dish (on the menu it just said it would have the gnocchi and vegetable).  The dish was also way over salted, as was everyone's entree dishes at the table.    The only good food here were the oysters, beet salad and the bread they offer here.

My bf is a chef, and has loved Thomas Keller for as long as he can remember. He always told me about Bouchon, and how he had never been... so for his birthday I decided to make reservations at the LV location.

Reservation service on the phone was helpful and on point. I notified them it was his birthday and they gladly served him a dessert at the end of his meal.

Upon getting there (with our reservation being at 8P) it was packed! With it being such a popular place I wasn't mad even though I was hungry. It took about 30 mins to get seated.... but once being seated they gave us complimentary champagne for having to wait, win!

The service was efficient and accurate. Remember if it's busy, the time from ordering to getting your food can take a while. This restaurant is beyond amazing and extremely busy, but it's clean, intimate, and the food was amazing.

Did I mention the portions are big? For it being a chic restaurant, my beau and I assumed the portions would be a bit small.... once we got our food we were shocked, they are very giving. 
+Fries are heavenly.
+Bib salad.... the dressing with herbs is fresh & out of this world. Light & simple.
+French Onion Soup - will get your taste buds going crazy, very savory & onion-ey!
+Trout with the best green beans you'll ever consume

This was our second time eating at Bouchon in Vegas.  The first was for dinner and this time was for the Sunday brunch.

I found out about the brunch from all the great reviews on Yelp so I wanted to see what it was all about... especially since I was drooling over all the pics of the chicken and waffles!

Brunch begins at 10am and they do not accept reservations.  It's first come first serve, but we didn't have to wait long (maybe 15 minutes - we showed up around 10:30 and this was a dead weekend at the beginning of April).  

You can't beat the buzzing bistro atmosphere here with their checkered floors, giant windows, and friendly service. We arrived starving (prob not a good idea) and devoured the bread and jam they served us.  This stuff was delicious.. I think it was a strawberry jam... I'm not sure what the flavor was, but we couldn't eat enough of it.

We ordered the croque madame and the chix + waffles.  The waffles were fantastically fluffy yet crispy and the egg on top of my sandwich hit the spot.  They piled a million fries on my plate, I couldn't even put a minor dent in them, but they were delicious.

Drinks - We ordered a cappuccino and two Kir Royals $12.50 ea.. (creme de cassis with champagne and lemon twist).. which is now my new favorite drink!

With 2 meals, a cappuccino, and 2 champagne cocktails the bill came out to around $100.  The price was expected.. not cheap, but not too over-the-top expensive for a fantastic restaurant in Las Vegas with a classy vibe.

I will be back for a third time.. maybe for lunch if they serve it!",0,0,0

I always wanted too checkout  Bouchon just rarely go high end restaurants much anymore. Special occasion whenever have full family together. This was definitely one of those occasions. Talk about packed for brunch or breakfast\/lunch. Still not that bad of wait twenty mins at most.

We started by sharing Bouchon Pastry Basket. You get too select four different ones or any combination your heart desires. We asked if you could order from the pastry special board for the day. Can do! On this day good thing since half of the pastry list too choose from was out. The ones that we did have was fabulous!! We had regular croissant, almond chocolate croissant, apple cheese danish, and scone. Every one literally tasted fresh out of the oven. The croissants talk about buttery, flaky, moist, and really felt like tasty of Paris in your mouth. Just great way too start off the day fresh pastry and coffee. 

I ordered the Croque Madame. Talk about ham and cheese. The fact using fresh brioche bread added so much more depth then regular bread. Sliced Ham not skimpy at all or the quality of Ham and cheese. More cheese on top with some kind of white cheese sauce. Then ultimate finish sunny side up egg on top. Heavy breakfast packed with all the bad things start the day but SOOO good.

the service was excellent once the waiters were finished battling over who was to serve us. in a restaurant of its caliber, i didn't expect to see such a fussy spectacle over the matter. for the rest of the evening, however, the waiter was exceptional (surprisingly knowledgeable about the food and its preparation).

the feasting began with complimentary pain d'epi (wheatstalk bread) and butter. it was one of the tastiest breads i've ever had. the crust was thick and crunchy and the inside was soft and chewy--but not to the point where your jaws would be sore from chewing it. we weren't even hungry but we were able to kill the entire loaf (actually, my wife had just one section while i finished the rest).

for our appetizer, i completely forgot the waiter mentioned that they had salmon tartare as one of the specials of the day and ended up ordering the beignets de brandade de morue. they were disappointing to say the least. greasy and crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside, they tasted like fried taro puffs that can be found at dim sum restaurants for 1\/7th of the price.

for our first course, we split an order of moules au safron which were served with fries. we had heard really good things about the fries and, for the most part, they lived up to the hype. the fries really were all uniform in length and perfectly seasoned. at first, they appeared to be pretty ordinary but, as we worked on them for the rest of the meal, we realized that each following fry was just as perfect and crispy as the preceding fry. the mussels were much the same. each succulent mussel (there were so many of them we lost count..perhaps 70-80?) was perfectly cooked and delicious. 

the meal could have ended with the mussels, but because i didn't know how big the portions were going to be,  i had also ordered an unnecessary $45 duck entree. the entree included duck breast with crispy skin, collard greens, and fried polenta. this was our least favorite part of the meal. the duck was a little rubbery and not very tasty at all. the collard greens were very very salty and fibrous. the polenta, however, was probably my favorite part of the entire meal. it was so light and crispy but rich in buttery-corn flavor. 

i deducted 1.5 stars for the duck entree and cod beignets and another .5 star because the restaurant was difficult to find and because of the initial concerns with the service.",6,4,5

It was like a closet inside of a room.  I don't get it?!  No views, no crowds, nothing to look at.  It was so dark that we had to use our cell phones to see the menu.
The wine list was expensive and not to my liking.  The French Onion Soup was so salty that I could not drink the broth.  I just ate the cheese on top and gave up on the rest.

Moved to two salads, one with blue cheese and walnuts, the other with warm goat cheese over dressed greens which were both executed well and were complimented with fresh chewy delicious bread. 

For entrees, my husband had the lamb and I had the chicken. We also opted for sides of mushrooms and mac and cheese. Everything was excellent however the mushrooms were over salted. Considering this wasn't a theme in the meal, I won't hold it against them.

At first, we thought we could get to the Venetian from the Palazzo, but we didn't find a secret passageway that would get us there. We then managed to find the entrance to the Venetian and find a casino directory that would help us get to Bouchon. There were instructions on the map itself that indicated that we would need to take the guest elevators to the 10th floor to find it. We successfully convinced the security guard that although we did not have room keys to the Venetian, we did want to visit Bouchon on the 10th floor. A few floors higher, we crossed a lounge area and selected the path that would take us across a skyway and straight into the welcoming arms of Bouchon.

Now that the trek was over, we were greeted by a friendly host who promptly showed us to a table. We admired the breakfast menu for some time and luckily looked up long enough to see the chalkboards with the day's specials. Jon ordered one of them: three-egg omelet with short ribs, tomatoes, and cheddar. He also got a side of pommes lyonnaise (sliced potatoes and onions, cooked in butter and herbs until golden brown). I went with the Bouchon French toast. All of their juice offerings are freshly squeezed, so we tried the orange juice.

While we waited for our food, we surveyed the bar's selection from our table since the menu listed each of their breakfast cocktails at $12 each, including mimosas and bloody maries. (They must use real champagne from Champagne, France and fresh-squeezed orange juice for those mimosas.) They seemed to have a nice selection of the hard stuff, but Jon wasn't impressed with the scotch selection.

The food made me happy that we chose Bouchon for breakfast: the eggs that made up the omelet shell were nice and fluffy, and the short rib meat inside was cooked perfectly. The pommes lyonnaise made me want to learn how to make it so that I could eat it at home. And the French toast, albeit small in portion size, was delicate and combined several of my favorite things: brioche, apples, custard, and bread pudding. Definitely a great start to the day.

The restaurant was relatively quiet (definitely quiet compared with the hubbub in the casino area), the atmosphere was calm and elegant, and there wasn't anything to complain about the service. In fact, they probably refilled our water glasses one too many times, but they never let them stay low or empty for longer than two minutes.

I was going to give it two stars, but now I'm thinking I can't justify the second one. I mean, steak frites. It's just not that hard.

I'm from California. Being from California I am, of course, very familiar with French Laundry and the bar that it has set. I could never (in the foreseeable future) be comfortable spending $270 per person for a tasting menu, so French Laundry is not in the cards. Still, I thought trying a Thomas Keller restaurant could be great and assumed that Bouchon would also be out of my price range. After looking at the menu, I was pleasantly surprised! Bouchon is probably one of the more AFFORDABLE restaurants on the Strip in terms of fine dining. The food and the service were not lacking, either. This place knows how to do it right.

The ambiance was perfect; exactly what we were hoping for. It's fairly big, but each table still seems intimate enough. The dark wood gives it a great old school feel very reminiscent of wine country. The bar is a fantastic place to wait for your table: craft cocktails are shaken up and served by friendly bartenders.

After being seated, my fiancé and I started with the beignets (cod) and a seared octopus special. The beignets were a touch salty for me, but both dishes were great. I opted for the trout (yum!) for me entree and he went with the chicken. Both so simple, but done so well! After eating our way through two courses, we couldn't pass up dessert. We had seen an order of the profiteroles come out and we knew we couldn't pass them up so we split a deliciously decadent order (one order for two people is sufficient). While the food was being coursed out ever-so-perfectly, our waitress was super attentive without hounding us. We've eaten at a fair share of nice restaurants, but we both left commenting on how great the service was. Absolutely stellar.

 When all was said and done, we both left with great tastes in our mouth (figuratively and literally). I would recommend Bouchon to anyone looking for a great dining experience in Vegas. In a city that has no shortage of fine dining options, it's hard to make the final decision on dinner reservations (I went through a few options before settling on this and STRIPSTEAK), but this needs to be on the top of the list. The bill wasn't cheap, of course, but it didn't feel overpriced; it seemed well-priced for the environment, the service, and the quality of food.",5,1,2

Good but not amazing. I hate to air some French Laundry here, but to be honest I was not impressed with Mr. Keller's extension into Vegas. I  am worshipper of all thing Keller, but maybe that hype over played what we ate. The ambiance is very Vegas and over the top. But I never go to a place for the ambiance alone. I go there because I am hungry and my taste buds tell me so. Taste buds say - salty with a chance of mediocrity. It was a good steak, and the fries were a highlight and if I could combine Bouchon fries with a double In-and-Out burger, I would call it a day and save the calories on all of the other ""French"" delectables. But, the food overall was so salty that I felt like a camel that has been wandering the Sahara for months. The veal appetizer with the lentils were amazing! Pate? Salt lick wrapped in bacon and more salt liverishness. The oysters seemed fresh, but maybe the thought of being in the desert and having witnessed first hand what Seattle has to offer, I would save the airline fare and just fly to Seattle and find a place having happy hour by the piers.

First off, the breakfast American was heavy, oily, and just not good.  While I was expecting simplicity executed with perfection, it was instead like eating plate of pure grease.  The online menu says it comes with their ""famous fries and coffee"", but this apparently is now no longer included for $22.  Even the brioche toast was dripping in grease.  

The smoked salmon plate was nothing to write home about either. 

I will say the lone bright spot was the bloody Mary's which were well done.  Very good drinks, but the price on them is a joke of course.

The service was very friendly but not all that competent.  My coffee arrived with no milk or cream, and I had to flag someone down twice to get some while it was getting cold.  Stuff was arriving to the table that we didn't order.  The service is just weak overall for a restuarant of this supposed pedigree.  The manager came off as a bit of condescending dick as well.

We started with some cocktails which were very well made, strong and with great flavor. They also served bread and some excellent spread - I believe it was a salmon spread which was absolutely superb. I would have bought multiple jars of it on the spot if I could. Honestly, for me, it was so good it may have just been the highlight of the meal.

For an appetizer I got a squash soup which was quite tasty, but I've had better squash soups at Michael Mina, Circo, Mastros, etc. which are roughly the same price range. Again, it was good though, the flavor was there and the consistency was very good.

My entree was the braised short rib. This was the other highlight of the meal. It was cooked to perfection - soft, tender, melt in your mouth good. And unlike many other nice places, they didn't skimp on the sauce they put around it which I was very pleased about. The rest of the plate left something to be desired though, it came with some greens and as I recall some mashed potatoes both of which were flavorless and seemed like total afterthoughts to the protein.

Desserts were entirely forgettable. As is the case with so many nice places and group meals they don't actually ask or provide desserts, but instead leave a sampler tray of their desserts in miniaturized form. This is always so disappointing because if there's something good, there's so little of it. But to be honest, there wasn't much good, plenty of little treats loaded with heavy creams.

To start the bread is amazing. It comes out in a vine pattern and is some of the best french bread you'll ever had.

Our first course was the salmon spread. It's both fresh and smoked salmon with creme fresh and I'm sure some other things. It comes in a tiny mason jar that they pop and then remove the clarified butter from (it's used to seal the jar). It comes with toasted bread to spread it on.

Next our main course. I had Steak Frites - a great french cut of steak topped with herb butter and cooked to a medium well (I asked for medium - so a tip to a future diner ask for one level below what you want). It was still tender and wonderful. It came with a huge mountain of french fries. Too much to finish!

My wife had the famous chicken they're well known for. It's two breasts that are ""airline chicken"" style. Also very good.

The true disappointment is when our server came by to ask us how the appertizer was, I gentlely let him know that there was a lot of sand in the clams and his response just shocked me.

He said they did not touch the clams after they received it to retain the sea water flavor.  Could it be more BS or what?!  Anyone with the minimal sense of food would know that you would soak shelf fish in water to let them spill out the sand before serving it.

The brioche was of course drenched in butter but balanced with the salty flavors of the ham. We felt like it needed a citrus component. It wasn't our favorite dish of the day. Next time we may just go with 3 entrees among us 4. We were overly stuffed. 

We will return again for dinner! I love Thomas Keller restaurants. Always great service, reasonable prices and delightful food.",0,0,0

Then came several other guests and she engaged them in conversation and asked whether they wanted indoor or outdoor seating, totally ignoring us as other guests arrived. I then took exception to this and was finally escorted to a table but certainly not graciously. Our waiter came and started to apologize for the ""misunderstanding"" as he put it.

I've been to both this location and the BevHills location, and although I would say I favor the BevHills location this one still does a good job.  I still haven't made it to the one in Yountville yet!  Anyway, I have had both bunch and dinner here, and I have to say they do a great job of fancified French bistro food.  Personally I think dinner here is a better value. 

For food, I recommend the steak frites - their fries are delicious (and the steak isn't so bad, either).  This time I for some reason got the vegetable gnocchi, and they were a nice departure - I wasn't looking for something super heavy and it delivered, with lots of fresh veggies and pan seared fluffy gnocchi.  Since it's Vegas, I also got the opportunity to get my foie on.. I got the terrine of foie gras - which I unfortunately was not able to finish (but they packed it up for me for later!).  One of my friends got the pan-seared foie gras which I thought was a better choice flavor-wise.  Anyway, no real complaints for me.

Service was good - my water glass was never empty and the waitstaff was efficient enough.  Decor is upscale-bistro style, classy but nothing special.  There is a nice hustle and bustle inside the restaurant but you can still talk to your friends, which is nice.

If you want salt or pepper you have to ask for it, no shakers on the table. The waiter comes over and grinds the salt like they do pepper. Guess it is unacceptable to salt and pepper your own food.

The BF and I rolled into the restaurant in extremely casual clothing - shorts, tshirt, hoodie, flip flops - and boy did we stand out like a sore thumb. In fact, it was one of the first things we noticed. Everyone was dressed in nice evening wear. My apologies!! I'm from California, where even at the nicest restaurants, people wear tshirts and jeans!

Anyway, they sat us anyway (they'll still take our money, is what the BF said). The server recommended some stuff and took our order. I got the gnocchi, which was the only vegetarian dish on the menu and I was sort of unsure about it because I had tried gnocchi before and didn't like it. 

This gnocchi was different! It was REALLY good. It was lightly fried and had just the right amount of seasoning. Topped with kale, tomatoes, and celery. The only downside was it was a bit greasy so my stomach couldn't handle eating the entire dish in one sitting. 

The BF got raw clams (which he liked, but said he prefers oysters to clams) and the duck dish, which he ate the whole thing.

I came with my significant other after boasting how good the pastries were from Bouchon. We did not come in dressed formally as it was an extremely hot day and we were in shorts and flip flops. After being sat we were approach by the bus boy who was pleasant and friendly. He took our drink order and walked away. As the bus boy left we were immediately approached by our server Edward B who asked us if we were ready to order only after sitting for about 2 min without time to even look at the menu. When we placed our order he asked how would I like my eggs cooked and I replied with basted. He looked at me with a frustrated look and said ""basted what? poached? poached medium? basted how?"" in an extremely sarcastic way as if I had no idea what I was talking about. Now somewhat shock and irritated I just went with the poached eggs. Once the server delivered our drinks, my espresso came without a spoon. Just curious how I am to stir the sugar in my coffee. I had to wave down another gentleman that helped me. Food arrived promptly and was tasty. Edward came back while we were still eating and asked if we saved room and were ready to order a dessert. We said no just because by this point we feel extremely rushed. While I was still on my last few bites Edward dropped off the bill rolled up into a cup and says ""no rush take your time""...extremely unprofessional!!! Let us finish our meal. I quickly paid and he was right back to take the signed check before we even had time to get up. This was an extremely irritating and rushed experience. Maybe because we were not dressed up to par.  Bouchon is not a cheap place to eat. With that being said the amount they charge for food I would expect  more attention to details and not to be rushed out the door.

I ordered the Bouchon French toast and a capuccino. The food arrived quickly: a tower of custard-drenched brioche layers with cooked apples in-between, and topped off with crisp apple slices. It was delish. The cap was decent.

I ordered the corn beef hash with over easy eggs and was able to try the croque madame. The corn beef hash was excellent! I didn't expect the corn beef to be thick diced chunks because I'm so use to the canned corn beef. It was a nice surprise. Cutting up my leaky eggs were a perfect combination with the potatoes making it just soft enough. Not soggy. Great flavors of pepper and a hint of salt. Corn beef had a good coriander taste but not overbearing. Excellent pieces of meat. 

The croque madame was yummy. It was quite filling from one bit. Very generous with the ham. The cheesy sauce drizzled on top put the whole sandwich together. I liked it very much. Bonus, the dish comes with fries.

In the past year and a half, we've dined here twice for dinner, and THREE times for breakfast...at least once on each of the Vegas trips that we've been too lately.  And that's a lot considering we like to try different restaurants that the Strip has to offer. This review will be about our breakfast\/brunch experiences only.

First off, their pastry items are to die for. Their croissants are flaky on the outside, yet so moist on the inside. The Pecan Sticky Bun is delicious. And then there's the out of this world Strawberry Croissant, which if you're lucky, is on the menu when you go dine...my fiance greedily ate it all when I wasn't looking, and he DOESN'T like pastries. Honestly, you really can't go wrong with any of their pastry items.

For their breakfast items, I have two words for you: Salmon Baguette. The smoked salmon is unbelievably flavorful, and the bread, chive cream cheese, and capers are all perfect complements to the smoked salmon. I am utterly in love with this dish as a breakfast item, and have ordered it...EVERY...SINGLE...TIME we've been to Bouchon for breakfast. My fiance normally gets the Breakfast Americane, and he loves their scrambled eggs so much that he plans on asking them next time if he can just order a big plate of scrambled eggs. He would also recommend the Omelette with chicken if it's on the menu...it was on the menu as a ""Special"" when we went. It's a light, fluffy omelette stuffed with tender pieces of chicken, red and green peppers, and cheese. So simple, yet so delicious. That's probably the best way to describe breakfast at Bouchon...they take the SIMPLEST breakfast items that you can order from anywhere else(example: Dennys), yet they make it memorable.

I would also recommend the Bouchon coffee as well...it's so good that I'm tempted to go get an empty Venti cup at Starbucks and having Bouchon fill it with their coffee for me. Just kidding...sorta ;)

Service can be a bit spotty for breakfast\/brunch, as sometimes it doesn't seem like they are adequately staffed for the morning. It's not horrible, it's still decent, but it seems like the service for dinner is a lot better...at least when we've gone.",1,0,0

It's quite fancy.  I was just amazed by the fancy decor when walking in.  You feel like you stepped into a bistro in Paris (not that I really know, but it feels like it to me) and the service is very formal.  We went for breakfast.

Good:  My Group of 9 showed up w\/out reservation on Saturday morning (they don't take reservation for breakfast). We were seated promptly, the hostess was nice, and we were given tasty pastries to snack on while waiting.  The waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly about everything on the menu.  I decided to try out the crab omelet (never had a crab omelet before).  The presentation of the food was very nice, fitting. The food taste itself was great, it was rich in flavor, but not in oil\/butter (at least taste wise)...and the frites..although similar looking to what you would find at McDonald's, had good seasoning flavor, and unlike your traditional french fries...these frites were very crunchy yet lacked that super oily feeling. I'm assuming because they used a more premium quality oil to fry their frites in.  The restaurant itself is also very nice inside, and classy, and I appreciated how the tables all had ample room from each other, and you can get a view of the inner Venetian Garden which is kind of nice. 
  
  Bad:  After our order was taken, that's when things started going down hill. We did get our food in a decent amount of time. But when we received it, there were 3 different servers (none of them are actual server) who did not know what anyone ordered, not to mention they called out the food by different names..making it even more confusing for us to get our food. We were left with empty water glasses for long periods of time. When I had to call a server (after taking our order, we never saw our original server again) over for a second time to reminding him that we needed water, and not to mention no one came by to check how everything was at least once...the service..was definitely not good. At least for what we were paying...after all all groups of 6+ were automatically charged 20% gratuity.
  
Ugly:   So after getting such bad service my group got our bill and realized that..not only did we get bad service, but they took a 20% tip from us...20% is acceptable to tip for good service. but to take a 20% tip for a large group and give bad service, is unacceptable. Not to mention after receiving the bill, no server came by to take the bill for about 10 minutes. So I went to speak to the the manager. I helped him understand our situation, as we did not get the service we expected...the manager did remove the gratuity, so we could tip something more ""fitting"". But before doing so..he gave me a guilt trip about asking him to take it off because it was ""company policy"" to automatically bill 20% gratuity (again that's fine, if we received good service, but we didn't), and because the tips were shared between servers and etc. (If they cared about their tip, shouldn't they have been giving better service, if we didn't go waterless for 20 minutes that would've been nice too).  And on top of that..being the manager, I expected him to at least comp us something and\/or an apology...rather than a  guilt trip.

Bottom line:  the price was decent because the food and the environment was nice.  The service was okay, but lousy especially given our group was at first charges 20% automatically..and the fact the manager made no attempt to make our experience better and gave me the whole ""company policy"" thing..really spoiled our breakfast. I do NOT recommend Bouchon...try going to Mon Ami Gabi instead.

We had reservation for 530pm and the place was quite empty when we in. There were plenty of meat dishes to choose from, yet I was feeling more adventurous and decided on the monk fish with lobster sauce. 

The monk fish by itself didn't have much flavor, but dipping it in lobster sauce makes it go from okay to amazing. It fills you up and leaves you craving for more. Be warned, one of my friends had the steak and fries and there is simply too much fries.

The opening bread was warm, soft, and crunchy and the butter was sweet.  For starters, we had the special pork belly and the salmon rillette.  The pork belly melted in your mouth.  The rillette was served in a jar; the waiter scooped out the clarified butter off the top that sealed in the flavor of the salmon.  It was served with some toasted bread and went well with the tableside pot of mustard that is typical of a classic French bistro.

For entrees, we enjoyed the Beef Bourguignon and the Leg of Lamb.  The Bourguignon smelled and tasted great and was fork tender.  The Leg of Lamb was sliced thin and delivered a perfect medium rare and had a delicious au jus.

For dessert, we enjoyed the three Bouchon brownies with ice cream.  

Service and atmosphere were excellent.  The room had mirrors and tiled floors to remind you of Paris.  We came with our 2 daughters (ages 7 and 10) and they enjoyed the Macaroni au Gratin (mild cheese and good for the young pallet) and the Croque Madame, which had a fried egg on top of buttery toasted bread that sandwiched in tasty ham and cheese.

If it was, neither of us was laughing.

My sis and I were in Vegas for a nursing conference.  I love French food, she's up for almost anything, Bouchon seemed an obvious choice.

The interior is fancy-French (in an overdone, Vegas sort of way).  We were seated quickly and attended by an initially cheerful waiter who couldn't stop crowing about the heirloom tomato salad.  He was so insistent I had to wonder if the chef had ordered too many.  

We ordered the spring pea soup, melon salad, octopus salad, and a main of gnocchi (all to share).

The soup arrived and was beautiful.  A bright spring-green with a flourish of flash-fried black rice skimming the top.  I was SO excited.  Then I tasted it.  WHOA.  The SALT.  I couldn't believe it.  My sister grimaced too.  To our dismay, we had to send it back.

The melon ""salad"" was an odd little assortment of shaved barely-there melon curls balanced on their ends, tiny slices of fig, mini-marshmallow-sized bits of cheese and daubs of a meyer-lemon cream delight.  This dish was fresh, tasty, and beautiful to look at (though so miniature as to seem like a plate you'd make up for a doll's tea party).  No stranger to tiny bites (nor to the Las Vegas markup) I thought the over-salted soup must have been a fluke.

WRONG.  

Here's a run-down of our other dishes:

The octopus salad: Quite salty on the outside, but since octopus meat is pretty bland, it worked out o.k.  I love salty food when it's done right, and this octopus was cooked perfectly.

The tomato salad: We grudgingly ordered this when our soup had to go back.  Heirloom tomatoes, a little cress, a garnish of fried onion.  The tomatoes, sadly, did not knock our socks off as the waiter had suggested.  They had no more or less flavor than an heirloom bought at Whole Foods.

The gnocchi: So incredibly over-salted I couldn't believe what I was tasting.  Clearly the pasta was hand-made and cooked perfectly, so why was the dish RUINED by too much salt?  And gnocchi is a perfect cushy, carby, salt delivery system!  How in the hell do you over-salt gnocchi?  It was as if the kitchen was bored and dared each other to screw with the poor tourist saps to see if they'd catch on.

The skate: (Ordered after the gnocchi disaster.)  Flavorful and also too salty, the skate was overcooked.  By this time we were an hour and a half into our meal, and thought, ""fuck it, let's just eat this and get the hell out"".  Our waiter had abandoned us for a table of 8 vulgar, shiny, tits-up-to-there, nouveau-riche cougars who were already sauced.  Cutting his losses.  I can't say I blame him.  The gang of Real Housewives types were so lit, I'm sure they couldn't taste anything, and as the waiter was cute and young and full of flattery, no doubt he got a good tip.

In total, with only one glass of wine a-piece, and even after all the dishes we had to send back, the bill was well over $100.  We got no real apology from anyone about the over-salted food (by the 3rd dish we sent back it was clear the staff was annoyed).  If we hadn't had to get out the door to a show I would have caused a scene.  As it was, we paid the bill and fled.

I still can't get over how clearly well-prepared the food was and what a shame and a waste it was that it was ruined by something as simple as too much salt.  Is the Chef-de-Cuisine a chain smoker with nary a taste-bud left to his name?  Was the Chef-de-Partie not paying attention when he made the stock and salted it twice, sending it out to ruin every dish it touched? 

What a waste.",0,0,0

3. Onion soup, $9.75. Savory, condensed soup with tons of onion and topped with 2 slices of bread drenched with melted cheese.
4. Lamb - tasty slices of lamb, $33.95
5. Pan-seared Scottish salmon, $36.50.  The salmon was well done and I had asked for it to be medium rare, additionally, it was very salty. The only real disappointment in our meal.

Hubby had a glass of Rodney Strong Cabernet, $17 and coffee, $3.95.

Disappointed again. To start, we had the Petit Plateau and the Tomato Salad. We ordered the Trout, Pork Loin, Truffle Sausage, Tartine du Jour (tuna nicoise) and the Chicken.

First off, the the Petit Plateau was nice. Oysters, lobster, clams, mussels - it's $65 but it can feed 3 people easily which makes it definitely worth it. Everything was fresh although I still felt the Kumamotos at CraftSteak were a bit better. The Tomato salad was pretty good - good flavors and with the added goat cheese (something my waitress recommended), it balanced my meal very well.

That's sorta where the awesomeness stopped and the disappointment started. Pork loin was meh - though juicy and tender, I felt like I could have eaten this anywhere half-way decent. Tartine was just tuna salad on baguette with a side of fries. Truffle sausage wasn't anything spectacular and didn't have the richness usually associated with truffles. Chicken was... well, chicken. And the trout was probably the best tasting dish with a good presentation but again, nothing that blew me out of the water (pun intended).

For dessert, we ordered a custom cake from the Bouchon Bakery - chocolate with light vanilla frosting with strawberry sorbet. Unfortunately the sorbet was the best thing about the cake in my opinion. While the cake itself wasn't overtly sweet, it just felt like it was missing something. In fact, the entire meal felt like it was missing something.

Plus, our waiter was TERRIBLE. He made awkward, TMI conversation with all of us and couldn't even remember the specials. This was right after he extolls the virtues of himself as a superior waiter. #Fail.

On the upside, ambiance is quaint and cute (like the BH location) and the Epi bread is to die for... but that's about it.",0,0,0

First... It is a Thomas Keller restaurant.  Arguably one of the best chefs alive and a true master of the culinary arts.  If you can't appreciate this simply fact then you would be better off spending your money at McDonald's.

The atmosphere here is fantastic, if not a bit loud...  but then again, it's Vegas baby.  Menu's are on brown wax-type paper that will ring your napkin.  Our server was excellent, with out being overly pushy and was quite helpful in explaining questions we had on the menu.  He also didn't look at us in disgust when we joked about not being able to order anything in French, due to our limited linguistic abilities.

Now... on to the food.  It was incredible!  I could leave it at that but I wont.  We had a group of five and started with multiple appetizers.  Specifically, we had the Escargot... delicious with the puff pastry on top,The Pork Belly Sausage... I believe the dates in this dish really make for a maple like flavor that is awesome, A selection of Oysters, most from the Pacific Northwest and all extremely fresh and grit free, and finally, the chilled Mussels.  I love Mussels but had not had them chilled before.  Again, they were fantastic.

I had the Steak Frites for my entree.  The steak was excellently prepared and the frites were a golden, crispy, salty, wonderful experience.  The herbed butter on the steak was excellent as well.  My wife had the Roasted Chicken dish and it was phenomenal as well.

To finish I had the Chocolate Mousse, it was the richest, thickest, creamiest Mousse I've ever had... I loved it.  I was also able to sample the Apple Tart, and Beignets... both we as good if not better than the mousse.

I can't recommend this place highly enough... in my mind it is a 'Can't miss"" while in Vegas.  I am looking forward to buying the Bouchon cookbook and trying out some of these recipes.  If they turn out half as good at home as they did at the restaurant I'll be a happy guy!",0,0,0

Corned beef hash - Seriously one of my all-time favorite breakfast foods. Unless you've had experience dealing with the stuff, I never recommend it for the first timer. However, Bouchon's version is very simple and stripped down. It is salty though, so be aware. Still delicious.

Croque madame - After finding out chicken & waffles weren't available, most yelpers suggested this delicious eggy-ham sandwich. It comes with a MOUNTAIN of French fries. May seem small, but it's hearty. Did I mention the mountain of fries?

It then took a really long time to get our entrees and that too after asking about it. Our waiter was non existent, the busboys doing most of the serving. 
When the entrees arrived mine was completely overdone and when i asked the manager if she thought so, her response was ""I don't know, it's dark in here.""
They comped up the salads and have us dessert but we just wanted to leave at that point. I asked them to take off my meal which they did, though I could sense they were upset about it. Not as upsetting as getting your meal two hours after you sit down. 
Overall, not too pleased and my co workers who wanted to leave much earlier said they would never repeat.",0,0,0

I recommend the bone marrow here. WOW two HUGE medium rare pieces with toasted bread to sop up all of the delicious sauce. This is the dish that made the greatest impression. I will remember you forever bone marrow.

My sole and my boyfriend's lamb came out perfect. The lamb was so tender. I almost wish I had ordered that instead of my fish except my fish had the BEST SAUCE IN THE UNIVERSE!

I was brought their pain d'epi with some butter and the small bowl of pistachios.  I love this bread and I have to take care I don't overdo it.

My server was Amy and she was a gem!!  I asked her about the size of the Bastille Day menu dishes and she explained they were all appetizer size.  I ordered a half dozen oysters, an order of pommes frites aux truffes, and The Saucisson platter.  

The oysters came 2 each of three different areas from which they were harvested.  Next up was the sausage assortment that came on a board.  There was one horizontally sliced piece of their bratwurst on a small bed of sauerkraut, 2 rounds of Merguez, a slice of garlic sausage en croute, and one link of their boudin blanc.  The sausages were accompanied by some whole grain mustard, some yellow mustard, a couple of cornichons, and some pickled onion slices and other small vegetables pieces.  With the platter, I was brought more bread (3 kinds), and then came the pommes frites.

It was a feast.  The sausages were all very good.  It would be a fantastic platter to serve any day but this is special for Bastille Day.

After this, I ordered Chocolate Bouchons for dessert.  These were one of their dessert specials for the night.  I didn't see macarons as was stated online when I read about their special menu for the day.  The Bouchons were small, vertical brownies with a small scoop of ice cream with coconut, one fresh cheerry dipped in chocolate and chilled before serving.  There was also some raspberry syrup on the plate.  The Bouchons were great.

I have an affair with Bouchon.  I have been there several times and I just like the bistro atmosphere and looking out the window and seeing that lovely park area with pools on the 10th floor of the building that's so private and away from the rest of the Venetian\/Venezia\/Palazzo Resort.  Bouchon has been the place I've reviewed the most.  It's one of those places that just puts a smile on my face and I look forward to going there.  Service is always first rate and the food is very good.

I think I have a new Bastille Day tradition that started last night!",9,4,12

I couldn't believe how incredibly moist the chicken was, even the white meat was so tender.  The chicken jus was so delicious too - I literally mopped it up with the epi bread, even our waiter commented on how I cleaned my plate :)  At first I was uncertain about ordering chicken for my main dish, but our waiter encouraged me to try it as it is their signature dish and I'm so glad I did!  My husband's roasted leg of lamb was amazing as well...I'm usually not a big fan of lamb, but this was definitely one of the best I've had.  The only part of that dish we weren't crazy about were the Tokyo turnips and the crispy panisse (chickpea flour cake).  The panisse lacked flavor and was a bit cold, it just didn't add anything to the dish.  

I really wanted to try the smoked salmon rilettes as an appetizer after seeing it highlighted on The Best Thing I Ever Ate, but since there is raw fish in the dish, I'll have to wait until I deliver this baby :)  

Instead of having dessert at the restaurant, we opted to go to Bouchon Bakery by the Phantom of the Opera theatre.  We had the strawberry croissant, which was a sliced croissant topped with strawberry jam and a crumb topping...so buttery and decadent, I loved it!

The Croque Madame had the perfect salty bite.  You get a ham and cheese sandwich, toasted and buttered to perfect.  To top it off you get a sunny-side up egg. Calories-Smalories. You cannot skimp on this greatness.  Break into the yolk and ZOMG... sauce to moisten the sandwich and to mix in with the sauce that reminds me of hollandaise.  Comes with a side of fries but you can ask for potatoes or fruit.  The sandwich is somewhat heavy so the size is perfect for a brunch meal.

The Sourdough Waffle was also amazing.  You don't need to extra syrup or butter because the waffle is by itself sweet enough.  It is topped with pecans and apples so it feels like you are eating a pie instead of a waffle.  The sourdough flavor is light but only if you nibble the edges of the waffle that is not topped with the sauce.

Raspberry filled beignets were also a great appetizer.  The waffle was light and pretty crumbly.  The raspberry jam was not overly sweet so the sugar coating makes it a bit that isn't overpowering.

I loved the feel of this restaurant in addition to the service and the coffee.  Yes, the coffee.  I don't know what coffee they brew but it wasn't sour tasting and I kept wanting refills. A must try when you are in Vegas and looking for a superb brunch location.",8,6,7

We wanted one night of not thinking about the prices and instead just focusing on the quality, the atmosphere and the service.  We picked Bouchon due partially in part to its connection to Thomas Keller, which is a (sort of) long distant connection to us.  Hey! Come on, we live in the Bay Area...that counts...right?  Anyway, we also decided to try Bouchon because we are fascinated with French food generally.  Bouchon blew my mind; it was everything I had hoped it could be and everything that I had always known food could be. 

We went for dinner on a Friday night around 9.  I recommend making reservations through Opentable. Though they may have availability for walk-ins on some nights, they were packed on the night we were there, so I wouldn't count on it.   

Service was phenomenal.  We were seated outside on the patio, in the cool evening air, overlooking the Venetian's breathtaking garden pool.  Our waiter was calm and patient, he kept telling us to relax, that he would be back whenever we had decided what we want.  His wine recommendations were the perfect pairing and our water glasses never went empty.  He was neither overly friendly, nor coldly standoffish, but a perfect blend of the two.  

To eat, I had the soup du jour, a sweet garlic soup, and my boyfriend had the French onion soup to start.  Then we moved onto a warm spinach salad with pickled mushrooms and seasonal root veggies.  For our entrees, my boyfriend had the Boudin Noir (Blood Sausage) with potato puree and caramelized apples.  I had the most amazing Croque Madame (Fancy French ham sammich) with pommes frites.  For dessert we shared a cafe pot de creme served with short bread.  

The bill was high and I will not mention the exact amount.  I will say that you can expect appetizers and soup to run in the $10-16 range, entrees to run in the $15-40 range and dessert to run in the $8-20 range.  Expect to spend money here and you wont be surprised when the bill comes.  It suffices to say that it was worth every penny.

My only complaint about the restaurant would be that the restroom was actually outside the restaurant, just past the entrance.  And that, my friends, isn't even much of a complaint.  

Dress code seems a little touch and go.  I really liked that they seemed to seat the families and the more causally dressed folks in the main dining area and the quieter and more formally dressed folks out on the patio.  Maybe it was just a coincidence on the night that I was there, but I would definitely suggest dressing up and getting on that patio!  While my boyfriend and I tend to be a bit overdressed most of the time here in San Francisco, I felt completely comfortable at Bouchon.  

I would recommend Bouchon to anyone who truly enjoys food and wants to escape into a dream land of glamorous people and beautiful nights.",3,0,2

The first time I came here was for dinner. The restaurant was cold, noisy, and impersonal, and the food, while meticulously prepared, simply left me wanting. Upon leaving, I was resigned never again to return.

But friends and acquaintances kept saying, ""But you must try brunch! You MUST try brunch! It's the best!"" And you know what? They were absolutely right.

What was a cold, noisy, impersonal restaurant during the evening became a warm, still noisy, but welcoming restaurant during the day. It was classy and refined, as a place of this ilk should be, but not fussy and pretentious -- just the way brunch should be.

Chicken and Waffles ($25): This is the Jeffersons dish -- soulful comfort food that has moved on up to a deluxe apartment in the sky. Perfectly roasted chicken with crispy bacon and chive waffles, served with Tahitian vanilla bean butter and a sauce chasseur. My LA friends will balk, but Roscoe's chicken and waffles ain't got nuthin' on this dish. Roscoe's is good grub, to be sure, but Bouchon's iteration is sheer gourmet and absolutely delicious. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the waffles were probably the BEST waffles I have ever eaten.

Oeufs du Jour ($26): Scrambled eggs with wild shrimp, sauteed spinach, Cajun hollandaise sauce and brioche toast. This dish had a ton of personality and flavor. One bite and you are instantly transported to the French Quarter in New Orleans. The eggs were light and fluffy and the shrimp were buttery and sweet. And the savory hollandaise sauce had a nice kick of heat.

So for those who had a less than stellar experience at Bouchon, I will repeat the advice that I was given: You must try the brunch. For it really is the best.",7,2,4

The accompanying pomme frites were even soggier than the aforementioned croissant. Hands down, I would have gladly eaten an Egg McMuffin and a side of McDonald's fries rather than what Bouchon served to me last weekend. Looking back, I should have sent items back, but did not even contemplate doing so at the time.

Time goes on, and we get this delicious fois gras in the jar--as my friend said, ""best meat cheese EVER!"" But despite how delicious our food was, and how happy it made us feel, we could not escape the fact that our waiter was a bumbling idiot.

Instance One: I got rather excited when I learned that there was Bouillabaisse as the special. Gasp! Waiter tells me 5 min after ordering that they have no more bouillabaisse. Fine... I go for the trout, order half a dozen oysters, and a side of roasted Brussels sprouts.  

Instance Two: Friends ordered a carafe of wine at the beginning of dinner.  After having a glass each, the waiter came by and for some reason decided to pour part of the wine into my friend's half-full water glass... and does NOT tap off the wine that he lost in the glass. Instead, he just brings a new glass of water! 

Instance Three: The waiter fails again by pouring tap water into our sparkling water glasses. Who does that?!  He was the one who originally poured us our sparkling water.  I prefer that you not dirty it up with tap water unless I ask for it.

Instance Four: Waiter brings out my friends' glasses of wine they wanted to pair with their entrees AFTER we finish our meal.  MAJOR FAIL!

Instance Five:  He never brings my Brussels sprouts. I was looking forward to having some nice, roasted Brussels sprouts since I don't know how to cook them, but no. Looked on the receipt, and he never put them in.

This waiter must've been half asleep, or high on something. Barely an apology from the waiter, and he did nothing to compensate for the terrible service.  Yes, my friends and I should have complained to the manager, but by Instance Two, everything was laughable.

5 Stars for their service
5 Stars for the food
5 Stars for the ambiance

At Bouchon, you're definitely treated like a Duke or Duchess.  Your bread is kept full, your drinks kept filled, and your table kept clean.  I assume that they watch your table like a hawk or have special powers because whenever our waiter was needed, one was at our table without even having to wave one down.  Service is important to me and their timing with everything was impeccable.  

Now for their food....

The Pastry Basket: You get to select what 4 items you want in your pastry basket.  We chose their pain au chocolat (chocolate filled croissant), a plain croissant, raspberry beignets, and a scone.  Both croissants were flaky, tasty, and had a buttery taste to them.  I thought that the beignet was just okay and their scone was phenomenal.  I could eat 10 of these in one sitting.  Don't dare me, I will.  The scone just breaks and melts in your mouth.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=D6VMKEvKSRDmL3Yft3EoPQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)

Chicken & Waffles: I just had to give their Chicken and Waffles a try since it was my first time here.  Fellow Yelp Bud, Rodney H, recommended this and I was hit with the some of the best chicken and waffles that I have ever had.  You can't go wrong with this order.  Usually the waffles is the highlight of a chicken\/waffle dish.  Here at Bouchon, they didn't skimp on taste with their chicken, which made it tough for me to decide what was better, the chicken or the waffle.  The chicken was seasoned and prepared just right.  Combine the great tasting chicken with their waffles (crispy on the outside, moist on the inside) and you're left wanting seconds. Take my recommendations...get the Chicken & Waffles.  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=wG5czHVCRBod8yOR25gCSQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)


Ambiance:  
We were lucky and caught Bouchon at a great time. The restaurant was empty and quiet for a Sunday morning.  Look around and Bouchon's French setting makes you forget you're even in the Venetian.  

Price:
The great service, food, and ambiance doesn't come with a Denny's or IHOP price tag.  The pastry basket, my chicken & waffles, and the gf's dish (Croque Madame) came to about $60 before the tip.  But in my opinion, this is not expensive at all because you get what you pay for.  Heck, it's a lot cheaper than flying out to Paris for this.  

Overall, I had this place bookmarked for some time now. I wasn't disappointed and look forward to trying out their dinner menu. Bouchon, you're a hit and can't wait to come back.

3) Steak aux Pommes - Pan seared prime flatiron, carmelized shallots, maitre d'hotel butter and pommes puree

I was told for our party of 7 that the wait would be about 35-45 minutes. Reasonable for a big-ish party around 10am on a Sunday. So we waited... and waited. At the 45 minute mark, I went up to inquire as to how much longer. They said they were just waiting on a table who had just paid to leave. So we waited and waited. 20 minutes more. Then I got the text that our table was ready! So all 7 of us walk up to the hostess stand. One hostess told us we'd be seated momentarily. We waited another couple of minutes. Another hostess came to tell us it would be another 10 minutes while the table was getting ready. 

""Another 10 minutes!?"" I exclaimed. HANGRY!! 

She said they send a text 10 minutes before our estimated wait time. I told her our estimated wait time was 35-45 minutes, and it has been over an hour now. Why would a restaurant text a patron saying their table was ready, only to tell them it's going to be another 10 minutes??? ODD!

Finally, we were sat at a table in a different room. We had 2 different waiters and a runner serving us. We got warm bread and a refill of warm bread brought out to us. As well as waters. Except some of us got room temperature water and some got chilled water. Refills were also of mixed temperatures. Food came out 20 minutes after ordering.

Knowing that I will not be going to French Laundry anytime soon, unless I suddenly won the lottery, robbed a bank, or found a millionaire dollars on the street, Bouchon was the only thing that would give me a taste of Thomas Keller's work (for now). Named as ""America's Best Chef"" in Time magazine and with multiple awards under his belt from the James Beard Foundation, I was ecstatic at the opportunity to dine at one of Thomas Keller's restaurants. 

BUT...I guess I held the bar too high for Bouchon b\/c the food, service, and ambiance\/décor just didn't live up to its hype.  

On Sunday, 8.1.10, my friend and I came to Bouchon for our last meal before returning to SF. Bouchon doesn't take reservations for weekend brunch, it's first come, first serve. We arrived at 12:30 PM and the wait was about 30 minutes. 

FOOD (4 STARS):
*Beignets ($7): MEH! The beignets were very heavy, dense, cakey, and dry. They reminded me of Entenmann's sugar powdered donuts. No bueno. The accompanying nutella sauce was too thick which caused the beignet to crumble into the sauce when dipping. It was also served w\/ a peach jam which was too sugary and sweet for my taste. 

*Croque Madam ($17): YUMMY! A CM is simply a ham and cheese sandwich topped w\/ a fried egg and bechamel sauce. Everything about the sandwich was nothing short of perfect. The salty ham, along w\/ the nutty gruyere was sandwiched against two thickly slices of bread that was buttery crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy inside. The runny egg yolk and the bechamel was the icing to the cake as it added a layer of creamy decadence. It you're a sucker for layers of flavor and texture combos, the CM will not disappoint.

The frites, on the other hand, left little to be desired. They were served room temperature and were overly seasoned w\/ spices and salt.

SERVICE (-1 STAR):
The hostess was cold, rude, and had a very condescending demeanor.  It seemed like she didn't want to be there and it was written all over her face. 

As we entered Bouchon, I greeted her and she just stared at me and said, ""How many?"" 20 minutes later, I walked up to her to ask how far along we were on the list and she abruptly said, ""I don't know, you need to go in there and check."" Ummm, excuse me, but aren't you the ""hostess""?!?!? 

Aside from the hostess, our waiter was nice and did make it an effort to check on us. However, the service is beyond SLOW! It took nearly 30 minutes to get our food after our beignets. Mind you, Bouchon is heavily staffed and the lunch rush had died down at this time. Considering this, I would not suggest going to Bouchon before leaving for a flight or if you're on a time crunch. 

AMBIANCE\/DÉCOR:
Let's just say Bouchon is very photogenic. Bouchon it's very loud and chaotic during the lunch rush. What's even more annoying is the wait staff constantly bumping into your chair while you eat w\/o any apologies. 

When I have the opportunity to dine at French Laundry one day, maybe then I will see and experience for myself the talent behind the man that has been named ""America's Best Chef"". Until then, it will just be wishful thinking....",8,6,9

Everything about this place is good or better, so it really should be a 3.4\/5 star

Service: Superb, very tentative staff. Very knowledgeable of most things from food to even serving utensils. They forget to bring our macaroni gratin out but repaid that with free dessert and after-dinner aperitif (best part of the meal)

Location, Decor and Ambiance was good. Accessible, Dark Mahogany theme and music was just right.

Food: this is where the rating drops. Nothing bad... but then again nothing good.

The Mediocre:
Lamb: Good, proper medium rare, the subric was crispy, poached pear was well infused with red wine and the greens were well infused with the lamb jus. But while this is all good, it lacked anything else. what else can I want? Some more rosemary, a little char on the lamb, something spicy or just something else. It was lackluster. While everything was good on its individual characteristic, nothing was fantastic.

Steak: Was a little better since it had some char. Actually, this was the best entree but was still lackluster.

Bouillabaisse: The mussels were probably not soaked before cooking and tasted like New Orleans swamp water. Ruined the rest of the Bouillabaisse. The Sole was really good, but needed some salt.

Fries: Simple, reminds me of McDonald fries. That's it.

Macaroni Gratin: Good, but macaroni was cooked for too long.

The Must Have:
Duck Confit: I have always thought duck confit was supposed to have the bone fall off as you pick it up, but this one does not. Still very well done and also very good. Tender, flavorful and well paired with the polenta, mushrooms and red wine duck jus. If only everything else on the menu had this intensity.

Pate de Campagne: Yes, just do it. Reminded me of England. The cornichon pickles weren't too sour and didn't overpower everything else, a great addition. Just do it.

Dessert: Can't find the name on the menu, but was cookie dough mixed with brownies. Banana ice cream on top. Served with caramelized banana slices and hazelnut. Kind of like banana foster. 
Rich in chocolate, well paired with banana. Both intense and both compliment each other. Just order it. It is small. One big bite to finish it all, but that might be too intense for some :)

This is what Vegas seems to be like in price to quality. But I would pay more for something better.",0,0,0

OMG brunch here really validates the 5 stars I gave Bouchon for dinner. Wanting a real meal in the midst of eating not-so-healthy on vacation, I was looking forward to getting some delicious brunch on Saturday morning. Er, ok more like 1PM.  For a seemingly busy weekend, it wasn't crowded in the restaurant at all and we were promptly seated. Because I was so excited to go here for brunch, I already searched through pictures on Yelp for the best looking brunch since I knew I'd be super indecisive if I didn't (thanks Yelp!)

We got:

Quiche du Jour- my choice, it's always quiche florentine (spinach) served with a side salad. One bite in and I was literally speechless. It was the FLUFFIEST, LIGHTEST, most DELICIOUS quiche I have ever tasted in my life. Caps lock does not convey well enough the joy I felt when I ate this. It is only one slice, so I ordered a chocolate croissant to go with it.

Sourdough Waffles- came with strawberries, maple syrup, and vanilla bean butter. The waffles were incredibly fluffy with a hint of cinnamon or other spices that gave it a nice fragrant flavor. There was a pretty good portion of it too. This was my second choice if I hadn't gotten the quiche and it would have also definitely satisfied me.

Bouchon French Toast- I don't like French toast or bread pudding, which is what this resembles. My friend said it was good though. It's an incredibly tiny portion though (thanks Yelp again for pictures)

Overall, this was definitely worth the money and my best meal of the trip.",1,1,0

When you stay at the Venetian hotel, you kinda have to act like you're someone special or some kind of a big shot. So, your breakfast (at least once) has to be taken at Bouchon (with french accent please, merci)

#1 highlight: their baked sourdough fresh hot bread, amazing just by itself, comes with butter and delicious homemade peach jam.

#2:  the cafe latte was very good, intense espresso's bitterness and the milk's accompaniment made it smoother for your oral cavity.

#3: nuttela spread (you can never go wrong with nuttela no matter what) AND their baked bread, you hear the bread crunching along with nuttela's presence to get you in one of the best euphoric stages, especially when two annoying loud guys are sitting next to you, it helps a lot, not to hear their annoying voices and hear the crunch with the nuttela and forgetting that they're there. 

#4: it's exactly next to the small pool of the Venezia lobby (Venetian Hotel), so you just go straight to the pool.

#5: Spending the day at the pool, you can get nice overpriced cocktail drinks from Bouchon, but relieve your bankruptcy pain with the thought  that you just live once and you better enjoy your life to the fullest, by ordering $12 iceplended margaritas and raspberry caipirinha in plastic cups.

Everything impresses from the start. The martinis are perfect, the bread is fluffy and plentiful, and the pistachios a pleasant surprise. We started with the impossibly rich pate, and an equally decadent goat cheese salad. 

The sizable appetizer portions left us too full to finish the tender, meaty lamb shank special (served atop mushrooms, greens and a buttery potato puree) and the curiously crispy gnocchi accompanied by endive, Kalamata olives and even more goat cheese.

This was a highlight of our honeymoon. I was so looking forward to this meal and knew after we got here, nothing would compare. And we were right. 

We were sitting next to a lovely couple who highly recommended the chicken and waffles and what a recommendation it was. 

Let's just say the bread and butter course was the best I've ever had. 

We started with the basket of pastries. We had the raspberry beignets. Full of freshly prepared raspberry jam with a crispy exterior. The chocolate almond croissant was incredible. The pecan sticky bun was topped with so many pecans! But my favorite of all was the cheese pastry. It was a muffin full of mascarpone cheese and it was heavenly. 

For our entrees we split the eggs Benedict which was good but I could have done without. The chicken and waffles was the star of the show. Bacon cheddar waffles with perfectly roasted chicken with mushroom bacon gravy poured on top. Like, are you kidding?! It was perfect. The side of fries and bacon were also exceptional. 

We mentioned that we were on our honeymoon and were sent a delicious creme brulee on the house that was, of course, perfect.

Sweet parsnip veloute is good.  The seasoning was both savory and sweet.  The bouchon dessert was great with caramelized bananas.  The salmon tartare wasn't special.  It was a deconstructed version surrounded by capers, chopped egg, and toast.

As a result it was a great place for the anniversary dinner celebration of a foodie francohphile (moi) and an a larger than life meat and potato devotee (mon mari). 

Although we were delayed by Strip traffic and a self-parking scene that would put the UFC to shame, our welcome was warm and seamless. A brief pause at the bar for a perfectly mixed Kir (moi) and a draft Chimay (MM) and we were quickly seated at a table for four in response to MM's request for a roomy spot. 

The food was stellar, but even more I was blown away by the service. Our waitress, Julie was friendly, knowledgeable and expert. Even more impressively both sommeliers were fantastic. While MM was willing to drop $135 on the first bottle recommended, the sommelier skillfully, diplomatically plumbed his tastes and finances and steered him to less expensive bottle, a 2004 Bouscasse Madiran wine (of an unusual varietal - Tannat) that was just perfect for us and our meal. His by the glass recommendation of a Vouvray with our oysters was also spot on. World class treatment. 

We were immediately presented with a first class epi accompanied by salted butter and a small ramekin of pistachios. 

We shared an order of escargots bathed in garlic butter distinguished by a splash of pinot noir and caped with individual puff pastry topknots. 

I had the pate de campagne which was creamier than most and perfectly balanced pork, liver and subtle spice (allspice?) notes. It was served with warm grilled bread, and accents of mustard, cornichons, watercress and radish. MM had a perfect half dozen oysters. 

We also indulged in a soup course - veloute of white bean drizzle with a thread of sage butter and tiny sweet tasting croutons pour moi and onion soup gratinee for MM. 

Slowing considerably, we shared the Gigot d'Agneau main course. Once again the rusticity\/refinement balance triumphed. Instead of rough slices from a roasted leg or lamb, a filet of meat had been delicately rolled and roasted to perfect rosiness, then sliced into medallions. It was fanned atop a bed of pearl barley folded into a chiffonade of collard greens with minced nicoise olives in a pool of unctuous lamb jus. 

We had the chocolate bouchons which were rich and warm with a slightly gooey center - elevated to ambrosia by an accompanying cherry sorbet. How do they make sorbet that taste more cherry than cherries do?

I just read a review that ate probably the same day I ate there. We also got bread on the table. I didn't have a problem with this. With the white butcher paper on top of the table cloth, and Bouchon being a simple brasserie, I thought it added some playfulness to the event.
Our service was quite good, it seemed that the team that covered our table was a well oiled machine.  We later found out that our original waitress had to leave for some emergency, and our new waiter seamlessly filled in.  Water was always filled, and service kept things moving without feeling rushed.
Food: 
the cheese plate was delicious with a good mix of some foreign and domestic cheeses. I don't know enough about cheese, but all tasted quite good.
the lobster was sweet and briny, you could taste the ocean.
french onion soup had the perfect amount of salt and cheese, and of course loaded with onions!
the Boudin Noir (blood sausage) with caramelized apples and mashed potatoes was a revelation. I'm a big peasant food fan, and the rich sausage combined with the sweet apples was perfect.
the beef bourguignon was quite delicous, a nice sized portion of beef rib on top of some tender noodles and root vegetables. reminded me more of a beef stew, but still damn good.
the lamb medallions were also great. I love gamey meat but my table mates usually don't. The meat was just gamey enough to know you weren't eating straight up beef. It was seasoned and cooked very well.

we apparently had some ""off the menu"" desserts, some creme bruleee and ""bouchons"" little delicious chocolate cakes topped with homemade ice cream was both delicious. the strawberry ice cream being especially delicious ""ma! they got real strawberries in here!""

also, I'm pretty ignorant about wine, but whatever we had was good. I also enjoyed some kronenburgs ""the budweiser of france"". 
coffee service was pretty ordinary, but after the mountain of food we ate, we weren't paying much attention.

while I usually can't afford to eat in this budget range, there was no moment where I though we were over paying. the care and attention given to the food and its ingredients were well worth the price we paid.

Plus, pa didn't raise no city boy. 

I gotta tell you, the duck dish 2 of my boys got here was above and beyond my dad's roasted duck recipe. 

* Vegan friends , stop reading here * 

The skin was carmelized and so delicious that my friend thought it was bacon. I quickly corrected him and was also shocked at the thin layer of fat. it was cooked a little rare, which actually brought out more flavor. I was "" mesmerized"" like that Celtic Frost song. 

And this wasn't  even my dish, but it was for sure the highlight. 

I opted for the Grilled Ham and Cheese with a fried egg on top in some sort of fancy sauce. It was decent, but obviously light years away from the duck. I don't know ...it sounded good at the time. 

I did get the duck appetizer, which was a square breast coated with a slice of bacon. I can't recall the sauce that was served with this, but it was excellent as well.

I was excited to finally have a meal at a Thomas Keller restaurant, especially living in New York and have yet to try Per Se. Our group stayed at the Venetian and opted to have a special dinner at Bouchon for a friend's Bachelorette weekend in Vegas. 

Getting to the Bouchon is a bit tricky as it is located on the 10th floor of the Venezia Tower, unlike other restaurants, which are at the casino or shopping level of the Venetian. We had a reservation for a party of 16 and our table was ready as soon as we arrived. The restaurant was empty because we booked early in order to go to a show. The atmosphere in Bouchon has the feel of a classic French restaurant with its high ceilings and natural night making the space very comfortable. 

I ordered the French Onion Soup ($9.75), Steak Frites with truffle fries ($37), and sampled the Gnocci. The steak frites was very enjoyable but felt the quality was the same at other French Bistros. I was not a fan of the texture of the Gnocci - it was bland and too soft\/mushy.  At best the food was acceptable. Nothing special and certainly not excellent or outstanding. The service was also a little inattentive - we had to follow-up multiple times for water refills.

I put off writing this review for a few weeks because I feel a bit guilty for dissing the restaurant of someone who is considered one of the best chefs in the country.  But, the purpose of Yelp is to give real unbiased reviews, so here goes...

The positive:  The host staff was great.  My boyfriend and I were meeting his friend for dinner, and another restaurant won by popular vote.  But, as it turns out, they have a ridiculous reservation\/cancellation policy so we bailed on that one.  Next came Bouchon.  We weren't given any hassles, and they were very accommodating when we called to say that we may be a few minutes late for our reservation.  

The decor of the place was beautiful, and the paper on the tables was a nice touch.  It was a nice mix of French elegance and casual sensibility - which I guess is what a French bistro is exactly supposed to be.  The bus boy deserves a mention as well.  He actually was the highlight for me..  he accidently filled my glass with tap water instead of bottled (this was not a big deal to me - I would've been fine with that) but he felt so bad and was so apologetic that he kept bringing us fresh bottles throughout the night to make up for it.

Now for the negative.  

Both items I ordered were under seasoned.  The meal would've been 10x better if salt had been invited to the party.  The onion soup was the first offender - I love onion soup, and was really excited to try it here as well.  I was disappointed to say the least.  I should admit that I'm not the biggest fan of veal (or veal stock) so I'm sure that added to it, but I just didn't think it was that good.  At all.   I ordered the roast chicken as my entree, and had high hopes for this as well.  Keller's  brine recipe gets rave reviews, so I thought this was going to be the most delicious roast chicken I had ever tasted.  It wasn't.  Again, it needed salt.   The chicken itself was very tender and had a nice crispy skin, but the corn and potatoes it was served with were a big let down.  There wasn't enough of a difference between the two in flavor and texture to make it an winning dish.  Lardons and mushrooms were also in the mix, but to me this dish was just boring.  Chicken, corn and potatoes.  My mom can make that, and she doesn't cook.  

The service also lacked.  Our waiter was mostly absent, and when he was around he didn't really seem to want to be.  My original thought was to order the gnocchi, but I second guessed myself (gnocchi in a French restaurant?!) so I asked his opinion and he said to go with the roast chicken, hands down.  That's another strike against him, haha.  

If I could do it over again, I'd skip Bouchon for dinner and maybe go for brunch instead.",0,0,0

I was expecting so much more from a Thomas Keller restaurant. The night started off poorly when we had to wait almost 30 mins for our table, party of three at 9PM. 

As we waited for our table we scanned the menu and decided we would order dishes to share. Our server started off being very helpful, but slowly lost interest as the meal progressed. For starters we ordered the Assiette de Charcuterie and the Salade de Frisée aux Lardons 
et Oeuf Poché. Before the starters arrived, bread was delivered, it was nice, but not impressive. The starters took a lot longer then they should've, considering there was minimal cooking involved. The salami was okay and should have been served with more bread. The salad was good and the egg was well poached, the vinaigrette was delicious. The toasted Brioche served with the salad was amazing. As our plates were cleared, our table was covered in crumbs. The crumbs were never cleaned from our table. I noticed several other tables being crumbed between each course.

For our entrees we decided to split the Croque Madame and the special of the evening, a Pan Seared Duck breast served with roasted Sunchokes, Satueed Chantrelles, Chestnut Pain Perdu and a Huckleberry Gastric. The Croque Madame was delicious, the mornay sauce was rich and bread was so buttery. The fries served with the sandwich were under seasoned and very ordinary. We were so excited for the duck dish, but it couldn't have been more disappointing. The duck was over cooked, the entire dish was cold and bland.

If I paid that kind of money, the food better be so good i will never forget the experience. But really, the food is mediocre. Gave it 3 stars because my husband enjoyed his dish and the service is very good.",0,0,0

Summer 2016

Hmmm...where to go for brunch with a two year old on our last day in Vegas?!! So many restaurants, so little time! #damnfirstworldproblems

Bouchon, it is!

Since I had an impressive brunch here four years ago, I was curious to  see how it would be on a second visit...especially now, with a toddler. It was one of the few fine-dining restaurants that was kid-friendly. Or maybe not?!? According to Yelp, this place is not good for kids, but they gave my daughter crayons with activity pages that made me think it was.

Our food was delicious! The baked chicken was unexpected, I was hoping for fried chicken that usually came with waffles. Nonetheless, it was tender and seasoned well. I love how the waffles had bacon bits, so when the maple syrup was added, it was a perfect concoction of sweet and salty. I had my daughter choose between fruit or oatmeal and she chose oatmeal. She enjoyed the oatmeal with pomegranate and mangoes, I was surprised she didn't pick them out. I was apprehensive when they gave her a little ramekin with brown sugar, but she didn't dump it all in her little pot. In fact, she hardly touched the brown sugar. Wha....?!?!?!

Our waitress was helpful and friendly, the guy who served our food had a great smile, and the food didn't take too long, but it still didn't feel like a five-star experience. So I had to reflect, what the heck happened?!? Then it hit me:

How is it that my two-year old was well-behaved at Tableu, but she was
less tolerant of sitting still in Bouchon?!?! What can I do in the future so she can be an angel when I want to dine in an upscale restaurant? I don't want to have brunch at McDonald's just because it's where many people with children eat. 

Then I realized how smart it was for the hostess at Tableu to seat us at a table for four. The tables at Bouchon were so small and close together. Just like Tableu, they had a lot of utensil on the table that my toddler considered ""toys"". Now that I'm thinking about it, I should've asked for a table where I could sit next to her, not across, so it was easier to manage what my daughter was doing. Because she wasn't sitting next to me, there were many nerve-wracking situations that could've been avoided. For example, she wanted me to hold her so she kept getting up and accidentally pulling our table cover and the table next to ours, which almost knocked the glasses and cups. If we we're sitting next to each other, I could've held her down and she wouldn't have needed hugs frequently. And, most importantly, I would have enjoyed my meal more. Oh well, lesson learned. I'm just relieved my toddler didn't have loud, crazy outbursts. Whew. 

Oh... what happened to our leftovers?!?! How come I didn't get a doggie bag?!?!

The Food (4 stars):

Though we ordered pretty simple dishes, they were all prepared well. I had the American breakfast (eggs, sausage, bacon, brioche, choice of bakery sweet, coffee and fresh squeezed juice). I forget how much it was, but for all that food I thought it was a decent price. Other items that were ordered were a cheese and mushroom omelette, and wedge salad with a tasty dressing. Everyone really enjoyed their food.


Service (0 stars):

I was expecting the service to be at least average, if not excellent, at this restaurant, but it was really, really disappointing. I can take some slowness in service, especially at a French restaurant, where it's expected and sometimes even preferred. So service was slow, but that's not my issue here. 

My waiter was either new or distracted (despite it being uncrowded) or just plain incompetent because:

1) He talks up the strawberry croissants so much that I'm really looking forward to them but then while I am waiting for my food another server places a sweet cheese pastry in front of me. It's definitely not a strawberry croissant, so I ask the server if it's something that just comes with my meal. He says yes. I look around and see a bunch of other people with them on their tables, so I just figured it was something extra I didn't notice from the menu. End of story. I'm hungry so I start eating it without my coffee....Wait, why don't I have my coffee by now?

2) Because my original server forgets that my meal comes with coffee and juice, and I don't see hide nor hair of him until I am almost done with the sweet cheese pastry (I'll be getting a strawberry croissant later, after all) when my server pops by to ask how I like the pastry. I tell him it's great (it was actually very good), and he says ""oh, I'm so glad you like it--personally, it's my favorite. We ran out of strawberry croissants so..."" Um yeah, thanks for letting me know earlier. And I'm glad you made sure I would be ok with the substitution before you did it....Oh wait, no, you didn't....And oh, thank you for finally bringing my coffee....Oh, wait, you didn't do that either, did you, because you didn't even realize it until I brought it up....And what was that? Did you say you were sorry? No, no, you just laughed it off. 

3) When do I finally get my coffee? When I'm almost half-way done with my breakfast. And it's brought by a different server. Is my original server avoiding me? I don't know. In any case: Booooooo!!!! 

4) Despite keeping an eye out for my waiter towards the end of the meal, he has completely dissapeared. Even through another half hour of chatting, I don't see a peep of him. I finally flag down a different waiter to ask for the bill. It's not so much about the waiting, as where the hell has he been for the last 45 minutes? I only got my first refill on coffee after he brought the bill. After the cup has been sitting empty for well over 20 minutes. WTF? 

I usually don't bitch about service, but wow, it was so bad it actually affected my dining experience. I'm sad. I was so looking forward to this restaurant. And the food really was good. Will I ever go back? Maybe. I'd like to try dinner here sometime. On a sidenote, all of the other guys who serviced the table were professional and lovely. It was just our main waiter that sucked.",1,0,0

Love the fact that they have a separate elevator that takes you directly to the restaurant from the parking garage so you don't have to walk through the casino.

Their bread (with phenomenal butter and jam) is a great way to start the meal!  I love their coffee... it is always strong but the temperature can be hotter, in my opinion.  I LOVE their Saumon Fume (smoked salmon with petite baguette, chive cream cheese, red onion, tomato, & capers)!  4 out of 5 times, I will order that dish as you can NEVER go wrong!  I've tried the Hachis de Boeuf (corned beef hash served with two eggs) and all sort of their omelet specials of the day but l will always regret that I didn't order my Saumon Fume!  

Why did I give Bouchon 4 stars versus 5?!  The truth is... it's the people working there.  Not sure what it is but the employees NEVER smile!  The front desk hostesses (there are always 2-3 of them) are always busy talking to each other.  They NEVER smile and always give you that ""pissed-off"" look like you are such a burden when you arrive.  As for the servers ...

The fiance and I did a power wake-up early Sunday morning to ensure  non-queue walk-in status. Boom. We were seated right away and started our morning the correct way with coffee and bellinis. The coffee, referred to as ""a medium roast European blend"" was exceptionally smooth. The bellinis were of the classic nature, with peach nectar, bubbly and a raspberry floater - juicy and refreshing. To go with our beverages, we ordered a few pastries. The featured beignets, filled with fresh raspberry purée, were good, although I was expecting that hot-cooked dough sensation as opposed to something that had been made a few hours ago. We also ordered a pumpkin muffin (before the squash goes extinct for the next 10 months, which we ended up saving for a to-go snack to make room for the mains). 

An epi baguette was delivered to our table escorted by fresh butter and strawberry preserves. The bread had a pleasantly crunchy crust and a chewy crumb to it. 

Chicken and Waffles. The bacon-chive waffles were that savory sweet species. You know those mornings where you can't decide if you're feeling like something sweet and charming or like something meaty that will power you through for the rest of the day? These waffles help make that decision for you: drool inducing hits of bacon and a little tang from the chive all smoothed out with sweet waffle batter which is improved in it entirety with Tahitian vanilla bean butter served on the side. The chicken is roasted as opposed to the classical fried chicken and waffles combination. The end result deemed to be juicy and flavorful.

Quiche Due Jour: which apparently happens to be Florentine more often than not at the Vegas location. I am most likely ruined from all other quiches after this one with its healthy dose of spinach and garlic suspended in creamy custard bordered by a flaky buttery crust. A perfectly made quiche. The salad was coated in a red wine (read: raw onion) vinaigrette - buyer beware - my head turned in to a breathing onion odorizer. A shot of listerine should be served upon completion of this dish. Or maybe Thomas Keller just wants to leave a lasting impression. Nonetheless it was a fantastic meal and I would gladly return for brunch at any of their locations I happen to be.",6,3,6

They don't take reservations for brunch so getting here early will cut down on the wait time.  I've been here three times with close friends and most recently for my mom's birthday, and the chicken and waffles is what I always recommend.  Having grown up in the South, this is not your soul food variety with fried chicken and sweet waffles as is done at many other places in town, but a wonderful reinvention that showcases the creativity and respect Keller shows towards his ingredients, classical French cooking techniques, and the humble dish from which it is inspired.   

The dish is presented at one's table with a perfectly half-roasted chicken with crispy flavorful herb-encrusted skin enclosing impossibly succulent and juicy meat that comes right off the bone.  Despite being laced with with chives and bacon, these savory waffles are light as a feather.  The accompaniments include maple syrup and a Chasseur sauce(""hunter's"" sauce) made with demi-glace, mushrooms, shallots, and herbs, along with a Tahitian vanilla bean butter.  Nothing is unintentional as one can feel free to spread a little butter on the waffle, drizzle some maple syrup to finish, and eat it alongside the chicken dipped in the Chasseur...such a complex symphony of flavors that will have your taste-buds doing cartwheels.  Very rarely can a variation on a classic transcend the original, but with someone of Thomas Keller's caliber, I think his rendition does just that.",10,0,5

If you want more details:  My husband and I decided to try Bouchon for breakfast during our stay at the Venetian because of the great reviews here. We initially showed up around 10:20 on a Tuesday morning and were told there was a 20-minute wait. As usual in these situations, my husband felt 20 minutes was too long to wait, yet we then proceeded to spend over 20 minutes trying to find another place to eat! We finally decided to return to Bouchon, but by that time, the manager informed us they were no longer seating people for breakfast. I said, ""Could you please recommend another good place for breakfast?"" At that, he said he'd just seat us anyway. He was genuinely nice about it, with no ""Hey, I'm doing you guys a big favor"" attitude. They don't take reservations for breakfast, BTW.

Our servers were both very good. However, although our order was taken right away, it took a LONG time to get our food, and it wasn't as though we'd ordered anything complicated. 

Even my cafe au lait took about 20 minutes to arrive, and that was only after I reminded one of our servers about it. What I actually said was, ""If the bar has forgotten about my cafe au lait, don't worry about it; I'll just have a regular coffee.""  He replied, apologetically, that he would take it off our bill but added, ""I'm sure the bar knows about it--they just haven't gotten around to it."" I said I was sure it was just an oversight, and he repeated, ""No, believe me, they know about it. It just takes them a long time sometimes."" Uh, 20 minutes for a cafe au lait that they HADN'T forgotten about? Is cafe au lait an unusual request in a French restaurant? By then, I was dying for some java, plus I didn't believe that the au lait would ever show. So, I asked for a cup of regular coffee. That arrived right away, and wouldn't you know it--the cafe au lait came right after. (Yes, I like coffee, but I hadn't hoped to be in the restroom the rest of the morning.) 

The couple next to us were already sitting down when we were shown to our table. I have no idea how long they'd been there, but their food arrived only about two minutes before ours finally did. After they'd finished, the male of the couple complained pretty vociferously to each of the waiters, separately, about the long wait. For what it's worth, we heard one of the servers explain to him, and apologize, that the head chef was off that day and also that they were a little short-staffed in the kitchen. Ok, these things happen--but is the expertise of a head chef really required to make sure the kitchen can turn out eggs, hash and waffles in less than 45 minutes? (I guess the bar manager must have been off that morning too.) I might add that the restaurant was NOT crowded. I wish servers in these situations would at least stop by to explain what is happening and apologize for an excessive delay *before* diners have to complain or ask questions. 

Our entrees were good overall, but by the time they arrived, they no longer seemed worth the money. My sourdough waffles with vanilla bean butter--I based my choice on the recommendation of some Yelpers--were truly nothing special. I could not taste even a whiff of vanilla in the butter. The strawberries it came with were very fresh and sweet, though. My glass of o.j. was fresh-squeezed and lovely.

The only standout of for both of us was our side order of bacon. Actually, we'd ordered a side of sausage, not bacon. I've never been so glad that a restaurant got an order wrong, though, because the bacon was EXQUISITE--I don't know how they managed to cook it so that it was not crispy or overdone yet also contained not a fraction of an ounce of gross, rubbery fat. (It was standard American-style strip bacon, not Canadian-style bacon or ham.) Unbelievable.... Even the Taleban would eat pork like this. If it had not been for the bacon, we would have left feeling completely gypped instead of just partly gypped.

Oddly enough, I would consider returning to Bouchon for dinner, because I suspect it is a better experience than their breakfast. But seriously, over 50 bucks for eggs and bacon, waffles, and hash browns, plus coffee and a small o.j.? (Not including tip.) Maybe if it came in a reasonable amount of time, fine, but not for that wait. Instead, try Grand Lux Cafe on the casino floor of the Venetian. It offers much more reasonable prices, good if not excellent food, and WAY faster service--albeit not the world's best bacon.",0,0,0

Not a very good place, the type that serves mediocre food and survives on their name, undeserved reputation from when maybe they used to be good, and the expectation that their clientele are ignorant and either don't realize or are too proud to admit they were suckered in to getting ripped off at a place like this.

The seafood platter starter was pretty good. Nothing to complain about although not nearly as epic in presentation as, say, Mastro's which really makes it feel like a night out.

For my courses I decided to judge them on a couple of bistro classics, the onion soup and croque madame (a croque monsieur with a poached egg on top). I can make better onion soup than Bouchon--straight up. If Thomas Keller would accept the challenge I would go on Food Network for a cook-off and bury his ass. The soup tasted a bit burnt and too strong overall, my first impression was that someone dumped a double-dose of instant bouillon into the pot by accident. And not enough cheese, which is a major pet peeve. At a nice place, why cut costs by withholding the last ounce or two of cheese that would put the soup ever the top?

Croque madame was served cold, almost completely. Once I started eating I found a little warm spot in the center, but it had definitely been sitting for a while, so I suppose that's why the food took so long to arrive; I should have sent it back but didn't feel like waiting another hour. It was pretty good, definitely would have been better served hot but even so nothing remarkable. The bread was a bit thick and the ham wasn't anything special. The fries were unremarkable, and not consistently cooked which is kind of an unusual problem. A lot of them were a bit undercooked, the rest were fine, but visually they all looked like they came from the same batch. Not as good as McDonald's.

The lemon tart dessert was probably the highlight of the meal, but even so, I occasionally caught a slight stale taste.

Nice and helpful service from our waitress; who warned that the Bouchon French Toast I was eyeing would border more on ""dessert"" than a breakfast.

I order BOTH.  

Bouchon French Toast - so decadent, moist, and sweet that your heart nearly stops beating.  Is it from the sinful joy?  The overdose of butter from the brioche and custard?  Possibly both.

Food:
The complimentary bread rolls were top notch. Reminded me of baguettes that I so-loved and enjoyed on my visit to Paris. Really, really good.

The lamb was so tender and non-gamey, it could pass for a filet mignon. I don't think I've ever tasted lamb quite like this. AMAZING

The pork was huge! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. My girlfriend's favorite.

Bouchon = refinement 
Bouchon = disappointment

Never having dined in one of Thomas Keller's restaurants before, I was so enthusiastic about my groups decision to try Bouchon. Two of our groups members are professional Chefs one of whom used to dine at the original Bouchon on a weekly basis while cooking in Napa and he was a huge fan. 

Arriving late without a reservation we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. I ordered a Ramos gin fizz to be told the bar did not have egg white to make my drink. Really? I would understand TGI Fridays not having egg white but a french bistro? Disappointment number one. 

We were promptly seated and handed the paper menus, charming touch may I add. We all were ""appitizer surfing"" that night so we ordered light. Amongst our table we ordered potato leek soup, laitue salad, cheese tasting, classic pate, and carved meats tasting. The potato leek soup was the worst thing on the table. It was so under-seasoned, resembles the consistency of canned soup, and was almost translucent rather than creamy. My salad was deemed ""inedible"" by our group. Rather than a grain mustard dressing expected on a laitue salad, it tasted as if they dumped white vinegar all over the leaves and tossed in a handful of random herbs and coated it in salt. The cheese tasting consisted of cheeses I could buy at my local grocery store. I yawned at the selections. The pate was tasted overwhelmingly of liver, just straight liver. The only thing that was good was the carved meats and the bread that was offered to the table. Disappointment number two. 

The service was lousy. Our waiter seemed bothered my our presence, didn't offer any specials or recommendations. When we inquired about a special written on a chalk board we were told they were out, why not erase it off the board? We were never asked how things were, there was no conversation, and we often had to wait for our water glasses to be re-filled. Disappointment number three.

At one point, what appeared to be a manager, sommelier,  and group of waiters walked by our table and literally smashed into the purse hanging on my friends chair. Almost knocking it and her off the chair, only one of the group offered a quick ""sorry"". Then one of the group suggested to my friend that ""perhaps if she didn't hang her purse over her chair, people wouldn't bump into it"". I didn't realize it was that difficult to maneuver through their restaurant without bumping into patrons. Disappointment number four. 

Finally our $111.00 bill was dropped, for what was basically just appetizers, sealed the deal of a night of disappointment.",1,1,1

I became an avid Thomas Keller fan after my trip to The French Laundry last October, despite the astronomical price tag. Thus, I was eager to try Keller's more affordable restaurant, Bouchon.

Bouchon, Las Vegas, is located on the 10th floor of the Venetian. Luckily, we were staying on the 12th floor so walking to the restaurant only took a few minutes. So location itself? FIVE STARS! :)

We were seated promptly for our 6:15PM reservation. Being so early, the restaurant was practically empty. The menu was printed on a parchment-like paper and wrapped around the dinner napkin. Cute points! I had a hard time deciding what to order. It seemed like the menu listed everything I love: lamb, duck, salmon, mussels, gnocchi. I was only able to cut my list down to lamb or duck so I pressed the waiter for his thoughts. He told me he preferred the duck since he loves him some good seared duck breast. Well sir, it just so happens that I too, am a sucker for a good seared duck breast so duck I shall have! Three of us actually ordered the duck, two ordered the moules frites (mussels and fries) and one ordered the salmon. We also shared the french onion soup, potato puree and macaroni gratin.

We started our meal with the usual bread service and I absolutely loved the butter (as I also did at The French Laundry). The french onion soup, though comforting since it was cold and windy that day, was nothing special; it tasted like any other french onion soup.

The mussels were very plump and juicy. On the menu, the description read: Maine bouchot mussels steamed with white wine, mustard & saffron. Though I've never had this combination before, the sauce didn't taste like what I had imagined after reading the menu. It actually reminded me of the chicken marsala I just made. The frites were a bit... disappointing. You may be right about most things, Anthony Bourdain, but Bouchon's fries are not the best things I ever ate. Don't worry though, I'll still keep you in high regard.

The macaroni gratin fell flat as well. Yes, it was cheesy enough, but the flavors just weren't there. I don't know, perhaps use a more sharper cheese? The potato puree on the other hand, was straight up smooth buttery goodness! I would be more than happy to consume 3000 calories worth of that in one sitting.

The waiter was right about the duck being seared beautifully. But that was the only thing good about this dish. The flavors didn't mesh well, mainly caused by the tart-sweetness of the rhubarb. With all of the other components being mild and savory, I didn't expect that punch. The sauce eventually grew on me by the end of the meal, but not to the point where I could say that I loved it. Nice try, Chef de Cuisine, Bryan Podgorski. I realize that rhubarb is now in season and I get what you were trying to do, but ultimately the flavor combination was a fail. However, I will commend you for such a perfectly seared duck breast!

We ended the meal by sharing a creme brulee. I'm glad it was delicious, or else I would have had to hurt somebody.",2,2,3

It was Friday morning.
Party of three please!
I got their early at 10am and asked for a table by the window...much to my surprise they gave us the far right corner beautiful velvet booth! I waited a little but my party of two got lost and ended up at the Bouchon Bakery.

My uncle had their quiche of the day which was spinach and it looked FAB! Like out of a Martha Stewart post.

I ordered the: ""Gravlax"" smoked salmon with a petite baguette, chive
cream cheese, red onion, tomato & capers (lifted description from menu)
...now I have eaten my weight in smoked salmon from all over the world...
yum this was PERFECT! and tons of food...sooo much food I could not eat it all. One the plate was this mini bagette that I wanted to clone. Soo cute and soo good. It was firm but soft enough for me to tear apart in my hands. The tomatoes were def beautiful. They were sliced def by a mandolin and it was a perfect red heirloom variety. The cream cheese I used sparingly but it had chives in it. I swerved the onions (should have spared them to server) and the capers were perfect. I kept scooping the salmon and carpers over and over...it seemed never ending.

Maybe their menu selection really wasn't that great the day I went and their waitstaff really was that annoying.

For now, I'm going with the latter.

Croque madame. Gnocci. Mussels. Those were our menu options. A sandwich, some balls of dough and seafood in the middle of the desert. Why? How does that even make sense? The bread on the croque madam was overly buttery, a failed attempt at resembling anything remotely grilled or toasted. I have no idea what they were trying to achieve with that. The gnocci was very unmemorable. And the mussels were mediocre at best.

One more thing: the fries. Let me talk about the fries for a second. Each entree, even mine which didn't include fries, came with a mountain of fries. Again, ""Why??"" No idea. Was the chef over zealous about giving out fries? Were they knowingly trying to supplement their subpar food with free French fries? Was it necessary to give us five pounds of this stuff? It was a. Lot. Of. Fries.

On to the service. Our waiter was teetering very close to annoying. Lingering at our table, asking us what ethnicity we were, what our plans were for the night, where we were from. Dude, can a girl eat her food without having to entertain the waitstaff? Guess not. Of course all traces of doting attention evaporated when it came to paying the bill. The sun had set, it was very dark outside and we were trying to split the bill in the dark, amongst six people. Yikes.

The combination of our clingy waiter's intrusive and at times, snide remarks and the poor menu selection have me more than convinced I do not need to eat here again. Next time Thomas Keller. Actually, maybe not.",0,0,0

I had only heard of this place because a friend recommended it to me -- it didn't even pop up in my Yelp search.  Also, you wouldn't really know about it if you were just perusing the hotel since it's so hidden.

We went for breakfast and I wasn't sure what to expect -- there wasn't anything super special about the decor inside.  We ordered an chocolate almond croissant, the french toast, and the breakfast with eggs, bacon, toast, etc.  Can I just way... BEST eggs, toast, and bacon I've ever had!  Big portion.  It came with these hash brown-type potatoes (sorry, don't know what they are called in French because I'm uncultured) but they were SPLENDID!

Thankfully we arrived when we did. The Mr. got the last famous Chicken & Waffle. The waiter said that they do run out quick, and that's what the Mr. really wanted so he got lucky. We were there around 1pm and they're open for brunch since 11. So, if this is what you really want, try to get there as early as possible. They don't take reservation for brunch FYI.

We were very pleased with the service. Our waiter and his ""second in command"" were very friendly and attentive. Since it was our first time, he took the time to explain the dishes. 

We ordered:
Chicken & Waffle - EXCELLENT! 
Croque Madame - I normally don't care for something like this, but this was really good. I'd give it a B+.
Bellini - it was perfect, not too strong, not too weak. 
The special of the day appetizer, which name escapes me. I think it was chicken but it could be pork. It looked like corned beef hashed, but it wasn't. The Mr. really liked it, but it was a bit too salty for my liking.

Our meal started with complimentary bread (which they sold in their bakery downstairs for $1.35\/piece). The cherry that comes with it is really good. The bread itself is also good. I wouldn't pay $1.35 for it, but since it's complimentary, it's perfect :) 

One thing we did notice, our neighbors didn't get the complimentary bread, so not sure if it's complimentary to all or you have to order minimum? The only reason we noticed was when the bread arrived, they wouldn't stop looking at our table and honestly made us a bit uncomfortable. The tables were pretty close together... not New York side by side close, but close enough that we could hear their convo and they could hear ours. 

I honestly didn't think the portion was big enough when the food arrived, but I was wrong. We both were so full that we didn't eat dinner till almost 9pm that night.

We didn't order desserts but we did stop by the bakery downstairs (a separate review on that). 

It was quite pricey for brunch, with tip, everything came out to $85. But you did pay for the experience in addition to the food.

The restaurant is tucked away on the 10th floor of the Venetian and walking into Bouchon, you are immediately transported into a Parisian bistro. The interior is classy, with tiled floor, wood pillars and waiters donning traditional French uniforms. This contrasts nicely with the  rest of the Venetian-themed hotel.

Their brunch menu is expansive ranging from American favorites like chicken and waffles to traditional French classics like the croque-madame. Not surprisingly, the prices are a tad bit on the higher side. Just to give you an idea on pricing, the cheapest item on the Brunch menu is the French Toast at $12 and the most expensive is the Steak Frites at $33.50. 

I wanted something more unique, so I ordered the croque-madame. It's a French ham and cheese sandwich covered in cheesy béchamel (roux), topped with a fried egg. It came highly recommended on Yelp and after eating the sandwich myself, I must say its praise is well-deserved. This grilled cheese on steroids cost $18.95 and it was worth every single penny.

It's a heavy but delicious dish. The thick slices of buttered brioche bread were grilled to perfection with just the right amount of texture. The addition of the sweet melted Gruyère cheese and salty ham lead to an explosion of flavors. 

In addition, the dish is served with a giant heap of french fries. They are thinly cut, light and crispy without being too oily. They are truly addictive and deserve to share the spotlight with the croque-madame.

- duck salad (very small portion): I don't think they have this everyday but if they do have it, order it!
- coq au vin: this one's a classic - it's a little on the saltier side though
- steak frites: another classic - steak was nicely cooked and they give you loads of french fries (make sure you pack the left over fries to go because it'll be good drunk-food)
- truite amandine - superbe!!! This one is a must try! Fish was very buttery, topped with fresh haricots verts! 
I paired my steak frites with a glass of champagne - perfection.
How can I forget dessert!
- Bouchon brownies (can't remember the exact name): this is not on their usual menu: it's warm brownies with melted chocolate inside topped with peanut butter ice cream and garnished with candied nuts - another must have!

We both ordered the Steak Frites.  By far, one of the best steaks I have eaten however, for me, the superstar were the frites (aka fries).  These were by far, the best fries I have ever eaten.  That may not seem like a big deal to many but that just means they have not had properly made fries.  The kicker to this was the aioli.  Its not provided without request but we asked and let me just say it made the fries even better than they already were...truly.  

Next....Dessert.  Well, we both got different items.  I ordered the chocolate tart.  Again, amazing.

We arrived around 11 and were told that it would be a 30 minute wait. The wait ended up being just shy of 30 minutes. The waiting area is very comfortable with seating and newspapers to read. The restaurant also puts out a plate of mini muffins to enjoy as you wait. When it was time to be seated the hostess offered to take our bags. We were given claim tickets to retrieve our bags after brunch.

Our waitress greeted us soon after being seated. She quickly brought drinks and told us about the specials for the day. She was friendly and checked on us frequently. The atmosphere for brunch was very lively. Tables were fairly close together so it was a bit on the noisy side. 

I ordered one of the specials which was a French onion base with flat iron steak and spinach topped with two eggs. It was a unique dish to be offered at brunch that was very well prepared. The French onion base was delicious and worked well with the steak and eggs. There could have been more steak, but other than that the dish was great. The toast on the side was a good way to enjoy the delicious mixed berry jam.

My husband had the BLT Tartine served with Pommes Frites. The BLT was loaded with crispy bacon. It was challenging to cut and enjoy, but my husband enjoyed the flavors. The Pommes Frites were perfectly prepared and addictive. 

We were offered a dessert menu which of course I welcomed. Why don't all restaurants offer breakfast dessert!? The Meringue with fresh fruit was perfect for the two of us to split. The meringue was large with a crunchy outside and soft center. It was perfectly sweet. The fresh fruit was a nice balance to the sugary meringue. 

Be aware that they do not take reservations for brunch which is fine. I only note this because the woman at the front desk during our check-in at The Venetian told us we would need a reservation for brunch.

The plain croissant and pecan sticky bun were fine but not overwhelming in any sense. Honestly, after having a croissant from Tartine in San Francisco, I think anything comparatively is underwhelming. The scone and the strawberry almond croissant were to die for -- the scone was not dry at all and almost cake like, and I have never had anything as unique as the strawberry almond croissant.

We sat on the patio which overlooked the pool area. The patio had a nice cozy atmosphere and seemed quieter than inside (which was noisy from all the bustling). The epi bread is freshly baked and their butter is amazing. The butter tasted to so fresh and light that I wanted to eat it plain.


We ordered a few cocktails, the moscow mule and I can't remember the second (wasn't that good). The moscow mule is a must have! Gingery and fresh, I could have had my bf's whole mug - and yes, the drink is really served in a mug. So cute!

We started with the pork belly special served with barley and sauteed veggies. Holy moly. The pork belly was soooo melt-in-your-mouth tender and tasty. The veggies were cooked perfectly (loved the brussell sprouts) and the barley added a nice texture contrast to the dish. We also had a mixed greens salad with goat cheese which was nothing special, not good, not bad.

The bf had the croque madame. Crap that thing was so buttery and creamy, it was like a pillow of heaven. The egg was perfectly cooked, the bechamel was killer and not oily, and the brioche was so buttery that I wanted to take it home with me. The croque madame was served with fries and they were skinny and crispy, but a bit too salty. I ordered the flat iron steak with spinach and garlic. The steak was so tender; I couldn't believe a flat iron steak could be so tender! The spinach and garlic were drenched in oil\/butter so I didn't care for it much.

For dessert, we had the BOuchons, which were brownies and ice cream. Nothing special. I wish they had better dessert!!!

Many thanks to a great colleague who HIGHLY recommended it {It's one of her favorite places & she's a big-time foodie!} as well as my entree!

I made reservations a few days before me & my husband's arrival in Vegas, fully preparing for what would hopefully be a great dining experience. As soon as he & I found the restaurant {which was a challenge for us the first time, as it's located a few floors up in the new tower of the Venetian and we didn't realize it} and were immediately greeted by a friendly concierge, we knew we were in for a treat :-) Especially when we walked past their seafood display - wowza, I though the Hub's eyes would pop out of his sockets when he caught a glimpse of those oysters on the half shell!

As we took our seats, we also took in the lovely brasserie setting - perfectly tiled floors, sumptuous fabrics and of course, chalk boards announcing the day's specials were spot-on to the brasseries we visited in Paris two summers ago... so lovely!

The meal was to die for, each component better than the last. Beginning with some kind of fabulous ""French"" cocktail, that had a hint of lemon and served perfectly chilled in a martini glass. Then, that fantastic, super-crunchy-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside, French bread & butter - served ever so casually, right on our butcher-paper lined table. We then moved on to those oysters and the French Onion soup. I'm not usually a bit fan of this type of soup {except for the crisp cheese on the edge of the bowl} but the depth of flavors in this one were phenomenal, and not to be missed! 

I greatly enjoyed the steak frites for my entree, however, I could have done with a bit less of the shallot butter on top - every other aspect was divine. The steak - even if a flatiron cut - was an ideal medium rare & perfectly tender and who could go wrong with french fried potatoes?!?

The restaurant and bar is exquisite classic French architecture with accents of deep mahogany paneling, ornate coffered ceilings, patterned porcelain tile work. This place makes you feel like you're in Paris. 

Looking for a place for brunch, we decided to try Bouchon for brunch. We waited in the waiting area that had a tv and an assortment of magazines and cookbooks for about 10 minutes until our seats were ready. What's brunch without ordering mimosas? So, we ordered Strawberry Fields and D'Artagnan. Strawberry fields is champagne with Fragoli wild strawberries. Never seen strawberries that miniature. D'Artagnan is an orange juice based mimosa with Grand Marnier and champagne. Both were refreshing. 

For brunch entrees, we shared the Brioche Doree and Hachis de Boeuf. Bricohe Doree is a French toast with brioche, vanilla custard, pumpkin spice and seeds, poached cranberries with maple syrup. Folks warned me this was more like a bread pudding. Honestly, thought it was just okay. Kill me for being honest! I've heard a lot about this entrée from others. The Hachis de Beouf, or corned beef hash in English was delicious. Probably one of the best I've had. Served with eggs over easy, potatoes, and toast, I enjoyed this dish quite a bit.

I was expecting the service here to be great and honestly was a bit disappointed due to the inconsistency. Figure a world renowned chef would have great service. The waitress was hard to find. She also gave us butter and jam upon seating but without the house bread. Until I saw others with the house bread, I requested it and it was about half way thru our brunch. The house made jam was great though which was a cherry jam. I asked for three servings of bread just for this.

The food here was great and I think is a bit of a hidden gem among the all you can eat watery egg buffets that pollute Vegas.  My husband got the Sourdough Waffle and said it was the best he had ever eaten (and he has had a lot of waffles).  I got the French Toast (brioche) and thought it was perfectly presented and tasted excellent. 

The tables we were seated in was the kind where one person sits on a booth that runs the length of the restaurant and other sits opposite across a long skinny table in a chair.  I was seated almost uncomfortably close to the German woman next to me--she was closer than my husband across the table.  The weird spacial arrangement of the tables combined with the dish clatter and bustle of the brunch rush made the conversational aspect of breakfast a bit awkward.  It was hard to talk or have a conversation when you feel like you are talking as much to the strangers next to you as you are your spouse.  I think that the diners who sat at actual tables rather than the long skinny booth thing probably had a better dining experience.  Next time we go I will ask for a real table, even if I have to wait longer.  The seating arrangement is the only reason this place doesn't get a fifth star for me.",0,0,0

I had the Pain Perdu. Brioche French toast with blueberry compote, served with vanilla bean butter& Crown maple syrup which was so light and good. I don't normally like fruit on any of my breakfast dishes because it's too over bearing usually so I try to stay away from that. 

Vanilla Latte: This blew me out of the way, I got a double expresso with out even mentioning of asking for almond milk. I don't know if there was but it was amazing!

The bread they give you while you wait (at the table) is fresh, with a crispy crust and a soft, chewy center.  And it'll keep coming until your food gets there.

There are also samples of small little pastry things in the waiting area.

I think the omelette changes on a daily or rotated basis (the omelette is on the menu, and the type is on chalkboards around the restaurant).

I LOVE Bouchon.  I've been here for both brunch and dinner and given the financial means, I'll continue to go back.

Brunch was absolutely delightful.  I love the natural sunlight that bathes the restaurant and view looking out towards the Venezia pools.  They have really good coffee, which is a staple in a brunch place.  We ordered beignets with nutella and homemade blackberry jam.  I ordered the Gravlax, a fresh and light DIY plate.  While you can get this dish at a lot of other brunch places, it was really refreshing and I wanted something light since I didn't want to hate my life after a heavy brunch.  
Side note: I would highly recommend NOT ordering drinks for brunch.  My mimosa was $12.50, average, and in retrospect not really worth it.  Stick with the food people.
Side side note: I couldn't find the infamous chicken & waffles on the menu. Unless I'm blind, it may be a special.  Next time, I'll definitely ask.

My dinner experience was a few months back with a group of 8.  Our server, bless his heart I can't remember his name, was outstanding and exceptionally professional, helpful, and informative.  He was the epitome of what service in a restaurant owned by a James Beard award winning chef should be.  The foie gras special was possibly the best I've ever had and still makes my mouth water thinking about it.  I had the poulet roti.  My chicken was juicy, moist, flavorful, and just wonderfully delicious.

- a mix of 3 cheeses.  All I can say is order the hook's cheddar!  It's amazing and after we had it we went to a cheese shop and bought 1\/2 a pound to eat at home.   

- I had the roasted leg of lamb on a nicoise olive chickpea socca with peppers, arugula, and jus.  I ordered it medium and thought it came out a little overdone even though it was still slightly pink.  I loved my dish and would order it again if given the chance.

- My boyfriend had the roast chicken on a puff pastry round with ratatouille, garlic chips and jus.  He liked his dish at first, but there was a layer of pureed tomato that killed it for him.  It overpowered the whole thing making it almost inedible as time went on.

In fact, every time I come to Vegas, I have to come here for breakfast at least once, and I pretty much order the same thing - quiche of the day, side of potatoes lyonnaise, and coffee.  The quiche (sometimes it's Lorraine, sometimes it's Florentine, this last time was escarole and bacon) never disappoints.  Always silky smooth, flavorful, and with a flaky crust, I could probably have it every morning of my trip.

The quiche comes with a nice little salad with a mild vinaigrette dressing, which balances the quiche nicely, but I always have to have some potatoes - it's breakfast, after all, and salad for breakfast must be addressed by potatoes.  The lyonnaise is usually a little on the oily side, which may be off-putting for some, but I like it.  I've had versions where the potatoes are crispy from near deep-frying, but these are cooked how they're supposed to be, with the potatoes lightly sautéed and tender.  Sometimes they need a touch of salt, but better to add salt than come too salty, right?

Some people rave about the coffee, but for me it's just okay.  I've had the coffee at Bouchon Bakery in NYC and it's the same.  I prefer mellower coffee that doesn't have that tang to it.    Amongst coffee lovers, I seem to be in the minority on this one.  However, I still always seem to drink at least four cups, so....

The service is usually great.  Even the worst service I had was still good compared to other places, so their folks are trained well.

Oh goodness gracious, this place is just lovely.  I'd probably give 4.5 stars if I could because my main menu item choice didn't entirely blow me away, but it was really really good.  I initially gave four stars, then wrote my review and upon reflecting, realized I needed to change it.

I'd DEFINITELY recommend you go here for brunch.  I've heard the Wynn buffet is also a must for breakfast, but if you're not going to a buffet, I'd say make this place your next stop.  It's really easy to find from the self-parking garage elevators - just follow the signs.

I came alone (business trip) on a Saturday right at prime brunch hours at 11:30am.  Seemed like couples\/groups were getting seated right away no problem, and there were plenty of open seats in the bar area so I snagged one for myself. (fyi they don't take brunch reservations).

I was promptly asked if I wanted anything to drink, and subsequently checked in upon every 2-3 minutes by 3 different servers behind the bar - not annoying, quite pleasant and kind actually.  Finally I was ready to order!  The breakdown:

-Coffee - it was good.  I wouldn't say anything to write home about, but nothing wrong with it either.  Bottomless cup is nice.

-The Beignets - oh holy shit the beignets.  These DID blow me away.  Two large sugar coated doughnuts literally BURSTING with fresh, house-made strawberry jam.  I picked one up and was shocked at how heavy it was.  I tried to break it apart - not so much - jamsplosion!  But seriously, I inhaled them.  They were so so so good.  An absolute MUST if you're a sweets-for-breakfast fan.  The jam is really really incredible.

-Speaking of jam, I asked about it because I'd heard they make it all in-house, and the server mentioned their jam of the day didn't come with my meal choice, but he would bring me some.  I was under the impression everyone gets baguettes\/jam\/butter after they order, but maybe not for brunch?  Maybe only if you order specific items?  I'm not sure, but I also didn't care because a) I had beignets, b) he was bringing me their peach mandarin jam anyways, and c) I don't prefer hard breads.  The peach mandarin jam was incredible.  INCREEEEDIBLE.

-I ordered the Chicken & Waffles (bacon and chive).  They were both very very good, but I've had better (in the northeast, surprisingly).  The tahitian vanilla butter was a nice touch, and I'll say I definitely tried every combination of chicken-waffle-vanillabutter-syrup-peachmandarinjam that was exponentially possible.  The chicken was juicy and moist with crispy skin on one piece but not really on the other, and the waffles were light and flavorful, although the last two i got two ended up being kind of soggy for some reason.  Interestingly enough, the standout of this dish was the mushroom sauce.  Mushroom sauce?  WIth syrup and vanilla butter and waffles?  Weird, I know.  And no, I did not combine it with any of those.  But what I DID get to do was switch between mouthfuls of savory and sweet, and for someone for whom that choice is a CONSTANT dilemma in life (#1stworldproblems), this dish is pretty close to heaven.  But for real, that sauce was essentially the best gravy I've had in my life.  I will likely be dreaming about it, and will try (and likely fail) to recreate it at home.  I might write to Bon Appetit to get the recipe...

I ordered a cheese danish to go cause a fellow yelp friend said it was amazing - haven't had it yet though.

Bottom line - a really great breakfast experience, in a nice atmosphere, with delicious food.  I'm glad I went, and I would highly recommend it (if you couldn't tell already).",0,0,0

The diner next to us ordered the same and was similarly raving to his wife about his perfectly poached eggs and sauce.

Left happily full and content. Worth every penny - don't pass up the chance to dine at Keller's Bouchon.",1,0,0

Fast forward to October 13, 2013 and the Bartenders don't notice new customers at the bar, the meat in the omelette and crepe are of inferior quality and the beignets are heavy lumps of fried dough.  

To start off with, Shane, the bartender, needs some lessons in customer service. I'd been standing at the bar for at least 10 minutes on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30 pm trying to get someones attention so I can buy two Bellinis. I noticed that every time I leaned forward to get a bartenders attention the man to my right would look at me and lean forward trying to get the bartenders attention himself. He and his wife had already not only gotten their coffee, but refills as well while I was standing there waiting. Finally Shane comes over when he notices this guy gesturing at him and asks him what he needs. After the man told Shane what he wanted (more coffee refills), I said ""Can I get 2 Bellinis when you get a chance"" and Shane says ""You're going to have to wait. I can only serve one customer at a time and right now I'm helping this customer"". Really?  Wow. So then Mr Bartender-Blocker tells me that someone before me waited 45 minutes for a bloody mary and I told him that that's unacceptable and that I would have been helped if he didn't keep leaning in front of me and blocking the bartender from seeing me. I don't think this guy had ever been called out on his shenanigans before, he was totally shocked. So then he starts in on me, totally going off, and after 5 minutes of his manic rant he tells me to quit whining. Um, I'm not the one doing the whining here, dude.

Anyways, Shane comes back and asks me what I need and I tell him two Bellini's please. And he tells me ""That will be $27 dollars"". Um, ok, I'm dressed perfectly appropriately for a Sunday brunch, why the announcement of how much my drinks will be?  Is this standard for this place? Really weird.

Bad service, plus serving someone else when it's my turn, especially on my birthday, equals no tip.

Once we were seated the service from our server was top notch. However, the food is seriously lacking. For $25 I expect my omelette to have prime cuts of steak in it, not tiny diced up pieces of second rate meat. My husbands crepe was topped with crab that tasted fishy and the broccoli tasted like it had been frozen. The beignets are supposed to be soft pillows of melt in your mouth carb heaven and they are heavy lumps that are covered in grease.

Come on, Keller, this restaurant needs a little attitude adjustment and the ingredients need to be higher quality. Considering all of the choices available on the strip, Bouchon is overpriced for second rate quality.",2,2,2

My husband raves about it everytime he comes home from vegas so it was one of the first reservations we made when we planned our trip. nothing exceptional but not terrible. 

have to say that their epi bread is to die for.  my favorite part of a baguette is the end (extra crusty) and providing the wheat-shaped bread\/epi loaf (with multiple ""ends"") instead of sliced baguette or rolls is perfect. 

started with some cold mussels and the breaded bone-marrow appetizer special.  i absolutely love me some bone marrow, but when she said it was breaded and fried, it made me think twice.  i should've listened to my gut (literally) and passed on that.  almost everything is better fried, but NOT bone marrow. just say no! keep it simple and traditional. the mussels were tiny and nothing special. 

my ribeye was perfectly cooked and delicious. husband had the steak frites, his usual, but it paled in comparison to the ribeye.  obviously they are different cuts of beef, but my husband mentioned that they were having an off night.  the frites were perfect.  no dessert because we were full of frites and we didn't want to risk a hit\/miss dessert.  we wanted to try bouchon bakery downstairs anyways. 

had very high hopes and expectations for our meal, but it was just ok.  i might like to try them again for brunch, but with all the other choices in vegas i most likely won't be back to bouchon. unfotunate.",0,0,0

We came here for brunch around 11-12? and it was pretty packed. I think we waited for a good 30 minutes or so but in the end the wait was totally worth the wait. I was totally drooling when we were waiting to get seated because I was looking at the menu that just makes me wanna get everything. In the end I didn't get anything from the menu and got their special. 

I thought the decorations looked great and there was an outside view where you can see the pool and stuff. I really like the environment of the restaurant. I thought the weird part was the music that went along with the place...It just didn't fit well. 

The service was pretty good. I think the guy was on top of his guy in terms of explaining all the specials and he always seem to have a smile on his face. He refills our water every so often so in terms of service I thought he passed.

I only tried 3 things in the restaurant and that would be the Croque madame, Maine bouchot mussels steamed in white wine, mustard & saffron served with French fries, and my pork belly BLT. Yes I said it...P-O-R-K B-E-L-L-Y B-L-T....I don't know about you but my eyes sure lit up when I heard that was the special for the day. 

Croque Madame: What is there not to like about a fried egg on top of a toasted ham and cheese on brioche. It's sounds so simple but it's just simply delicious. The combination of such simple ingredients can bring out such a wonderful taste. If anything I think the fries that came along with the dish was the EH part. I don't know...I just keep finding the fries to be a bit salty to me.

Pork Belly BLT - Personally I loved my dish because it's so unique. When have you ever heard of a pork belly BLT. It just sounds so epic and delicious. I think the worst part of the dish is figuring out how to eat it. Since there poach egg on top of the whole dish, I couldn't even hand-held it and eat it. So I decided to cut it but at some point I would cut the poach egg which will let out the yolk out(not that i mind but it can get messy :p.) The combination of lettuce,tomato, poach egg and sliced up pork belly made it pretty darn amazing. I thought the pork belly was made well because there are restaurants that make the pork belly really dry and it makes the pork belly disgusting but I find it to be the right texture here so it went along well. :)

Maine bouchot mussels steamed in white wine, mustard & saffron served with French fries - This is what my friend got and I personally loved this dish. I think this was my favorite dish that if I ever come next time I think I'm gonna get this dish myself(not that Pork Belly BLT isn't good). You get so many mussels for only 25.50?! I mean come on that's already a big steal...I couldn't even count how many mussels were in that bowl of wonderfulness! The white wine sauce was simply amazing and when you can some of that sauce in that mussel and you can suck it out...Just AMAZING!!! I seriously recommend getting this dish because the mussels that they have is really fresh. The french fries that went along with it...I saw my friend dipped it in the white wine sauce and she kept doing it and i was like HMM let me try. Later on...I found myself super thirsty because I couldn't stop eating the french fries dipped in white wine sauce. I REALLY LOVE THIS DISH.

Bouchon had really great service. We ordered an assortment of different items and everything came out, hot and delicious. All their portions were massive so we were completely stuffed. I was a little greedy so I ordered their smoked salmon on a baguette and a pain au chocolat to share. I could barely finish my baguette, which was sad because the pain au chocolat was not nearly as good later in the day. Everything that comes with fries is enough fries to feed 2-3 people.

We ordered beignets and the salmon baguette with a non-fat cafe au lait and orange juice.

Unfortunately maybe I should have waited till I could get to San Fran or NYC. This restaurant is very difficult to find at the Venetian. We arrived at 8:30PM on Sunday night without a reservation and were seated right away, which was nice. 

Salad choices were disappointing with a chevre chaud served on mixed greens rather than mache, so I went for an endive and watercress with roquefort. Good dressing although slightly over-dressed and nice endive... but they should not have bothered to list this salad as containing watercress as it barely made an appearance. Still, not a bad salad.

My boyfriend had the steak-frites which was nicely prepared and herbed, but the fries were so salty we had to drink about 5 glasses of water to get through just a few of them. There was a huge mound of fries left over -- need I say more?

I ordered the Duck Confit as my entree and could not have been more disappointed. What should have been a luscious little plate was dry and also over-salted. They did manage to get the skin crisped OK.

Who over-salts French cuisine??? Apparently, Thomas Keller does.

Granted, two of the four things we ordered were specials: a lovely capon rillette appetizer, and a top sirloin (slow cooked in a sealed bag with herbs for four hours, and it shows!) entree.  That appetizer was incredible, the top sirloin was delectable and from Australia, just like my date, and the salmon I ordered absolutely melted in my mouth, just like my d... err... anyway!  My warm goat cheese salad was amazing with plenty, if not too much cracked pepper on top.  I asked our waiter to bring lots of pepper, and being a total character from Chicago, he more than obliged.  I think he went a little overboard, yet otherwise, he was a really fantastic waiter, and I did find it hilarious, if not just a touch too spicy.  Delicious though!  He also chose us a very lovely wine to go with our meal, was a great conversationalist, and brought us tiny cookies from their pastry chef, who is diabetic, just like my date!  No kidding.

As far as bistro food goes, I suspect this place is about as good as it gets in Vegas. Other than baguettes and pistachios I don't remember eating anything noteworthy as an appetizer, but for the entree I ordered a grilled Atlantic salmon with veggies. I enjoyed the gamy flavor of the fish but the main reason I ordered it was because I wanted to sample the style of cooking fish shown in Thomas Keller's Bouchon cookbook. It was only grilled on one side, with that side being browned and well-done and the other side left completely raw. This gives an interesting texture to the fish and I enjoyed it. After the entree I noticed a big oyster bar so I ordered some Kumamoto oysters, which were very good as well.

Oysters: really fresh but specify what types of oysters you want to your waitress
Chicken and waffles: pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary
Steak frites: good

My only compliant, which isn't really a complaint because the staff was really nice...is that I wish we were served by one person only so that's it's more consistent and timely. We had our waitress and different servers who delivered each of our items. Our items came at odd intervals. There was a big gap between the bread and butter and our oysters, our main dishes didn't come at the same time...and when I asked the waitress if my drink was still coming after we had started our dishes, she seemed genuinely surprised it hadn't.

Everyone's dinner was okay, but nothing memorable.  Upon reflection, I realized that each time we've gone back, the quality of the food has slightly deteriorated to the point where it now compares to a higher end chain restaurant such as Paul Martin's.  For example, three in our party had the trout, which I've had a couple of times before.  The skin was completely soft and pliable, no crispness at all.  This is just one example.

SERVICE - Waiters generally good, helpful on suggestions, prompt service.  Girls at the front can be clueless (huh?).  Bartenders good.

DRINKS - Well mixed.  Big wine list, high markups.  Nothing new. 

FOOD - French bistro food.  Appetizers are better than the mains, which are okay\/good, but not up to my standards for Thomas Keller.  I've had the steak frites and the shortribs, two standard items on the menu, well presented and plated, good, but not exciting.  Specials can be more interesting.  Desserts are good too, but again not spectacular. 

AMBIANCE - Nice elaborate tiled floors, carrera marble countertop at the bar, tall ceilings and huge windows looking out to a courtyard with a pool.  I enjoy this a lot.

MISC - The easiest elevator to use is located past the hotel reception desk, away from the casino.  Turn left when you get out.  Otherwise prepare to get lost!

OVERALL - Don't expect French Laundry - it's not even close - otherwise a nice dining experience.",1,1,1

We were dressed for the place - they were certainly *not*.

I shared the pate with everyone at the table, got the leg of lamb, and shared the cheese plate with everyone too. My girlfriend got the roast chicken which was delectable (and arguably more food than my more expensive lamb.) My other friend got the confit de canard. We split a carafe of wine -- the total came to something over $200... To be expected, I suppose.

The waiter was very nice, and trained in French style waiter-ing, involving the classic ""bread crumb scraper"" at the end of every course. He was also understanding when we had a bit of a spill - he covered it up very nicely with a couple napkins.

In all honesty, I did enjoy coming to this place, in the moment...

But, later, when the food had been digested and I'd thought some more about it, I realized it wasn't as good as I was hoping it to be. I thought about my local French go-to place, Liaison in Berkeley, and they had much better food, and a much larger variety. The only thing that Bouchon has over Liaison is that it is a much more rustic, much more ""Paris in the 19th century"" kind of place, while Liaison is decidedly modern looking.

I give Bouchon what I consider a solid 3 stars. I can't shake the feeling that Bouchon is a place that people go to to be *introduced* to French food - it isn't a great place for those who appreciate it in its entirety already.

I expected a long wait, but surprised that we only waited 10 minutes for a table. I think that was the only good thing about my experience, besides the beautiful view of the gardens. 

Our service was HORRENDOUS. We got seated outside and it took over 20 minutes for us  to get service. I would possibly understand this if the restaurant was extremely busy, BUT it was actually pretty quiet on a Tuesday afternoon. Finally when we got a waiter, he was not friendly and was busy talking to his other coworkers than to pay attention to us. He took our order and did not even look at us, he was mouthing something to his coworker. It was very unprofessional!! He did not recommend anything to us on the menu and seemed occupied with other things. We never got a refill of water and no one came to our table to ask about our food. It took us even longer to get our check and we had to track down another server to check us out. 

The food was VERY disappointing as well. I had the Moules au Safran et à la 
Moutarde with a side of the Pommes frites. The mussels had no flavor and did not even come with any bread. The frites were great, but how can you go wrong with that anyways?

To preface my review - I went with a party of 11, for Brunch on a Sunday, so maybe brunch is just in general less impressive, or maybe a party of 11 is just too much to handle. I don't know.

My friends waited about an hour to 1.5 hours for a table on Sunday (during a long weekend, so it may not speak for the normal Sunday wait), and we were finally seated around 1pm Friday. The restaurant was still fairly busy, and we were seated in a private dining room.

First of all, the service was extremely slow. After our waters were brought, the waiter didn't come back for another 15-20 minutes to take our order. Most of the table ordered the famed Chicken and Waffles, while two people ordered trout (one without capers), and two ordered the omelet (one vegetarian with a side of fruit). I ordered foie gras, which they only had as a cold pate that day, along with my chicken and waffles.

The bread that was brought was decent, but the jam is delicious! It was probably the highlight of my meal, actually, especially when it topped a butter-smothered slice of bread.

When our orders FINALLY arrived, they had somehow confused where everyone was seated, so everyone had to pass their dish down to someone else. I'd accept this at an Olive Garden, but not at a restaurant as esteemed (and as expensive) as Bouchon. Then, they swapped the plates of the two people who had ordered the trout.  Finally, the omelets came... and the vegetarian got the side of fruit with the meat-filled omelet, while my bf got a side of sausages with the vegetarian omelet! Luckily the vegetarian wasn't one to go nuts if she accidentally ate meat, but had the mix-up been for something like a food allergy, it would have been disastrous. 

The pate I got was very disappointing. It was served in a glass jar with a side of crusty bread. When I say crusty, I mean really really, cut yourself biting into it type of crusty. My boyfriend actually sustained a cut from the bread. The pate itself was too salty, had a layer of something that resembled congealed fat over it, and was definitely not a consistent color. 

The chicken and waffles came with a boat of gravy, as well as one of maple syrup. The waffle was AMAZING - it's perfectly crisp and light and everything that a waffle should be. The chicken was decent, but the seasoning was unremarkable and thus nothing to write home about. I ate the chicken dipped in the gravy, which made it a bit more satiating to my taste buds.

The waiter never came back to ask us how our food was :( 

Overall, I expected SO much more from Bouchon. I may be back to give dinner a shot, but I probably am never going to come to Bouchon for brunch again unless I'm dragged kicking and screaming by my friends.",0,0,0

Dozen oysters fresh and tasty some of the best sea flavor

Eggs Benedict, American breakfast, croquet Madame, and steak and eggs all top notch

Service by bussers was also amazing .. very attentive and always on point with water refills and coffee.

Our kick down to one star was the very odd interaction of the supervisor when we ordered our 2nd bottle of champagne.

Yes  I get the price difference between the first and the 2nd bottle was a few hundred bucks higher but we have never been asked to show ID before ordering a bottle of champagne.

I would get at the first bottle to see if everyone was 21, but hardly for or group.

Later on we asked for an explanation on this as we had been here in the past and have never been asked for ID prior to ordering a bottle.

When I first found them years ago, I would've easily given them a 5 star review. Since that first experience, I've noticed a slow decline. The food is still good but now borders on pedestrian. Attention to detail and service kept me coming back.

Unfortunately, I have now had the one bad experience that prompts cathartic writing and has me questioning if I will ever bother again. A dining experience is one part food and one part service. On the food side, it's an increasingly difficult battle. As palates become more trained, it is more difficult to find flavors that surprise. So it's best to find a meal that entices. The trap of mediocrity begins with commercial concessions. When the commercial concessions are more prevalent than the enticement of your food; artistry becomes lost. Due to the nature of the business, I cannot knock them too hard for this decline. They are still better than most, but not worth a special trip.

What is really prompting me to write this review is the service I just had. The decades I've spent in the restaurant industry taught me one lesson above all others in regards to service. The only things that truly matters are beverages. It doesn't matter if your customers are drinking water, wine or carbonated corn syrup. If the condition of their drink ever becomes a worry in their head, service is lost. That is the experience I had today. An eternity passed after I finished my my cocktail and meal. It wasn't until my water glass was almost dry before anyone looked at me or asked me a question. 

""Would you like more water?"" The person wasn't even my server. My answer, ""How about an espresso, aperitif, and dessert menu?"" She seemed a bit shocked by my response. I don't blame her. After being ignored for so long, I was feeling unwelcome and trying to not be snippy. Maybe I wasn't successful. She had the look of someone new to the industry and the way the bartender interacted with her only served to solidify that impression.

I've tried foie gras - which I said I would never because it is just so inhumane, but it was absolutely amazing. I will never have it again, however I can say that it was the best thing I have tasted in a long time and preparation was the key. This was on the specials menu so I am not sure how often they have this specific item.

Oysters, dover sole, NY strip, hanger steak, gnocchi, roasted veggies, 2 bottles of Northern Rhone wine..... heaven. Just heaven! 

The steaks and sides come with béchamel sauce which was just too much for me at one point, in terms of creamy fatty things, so the chef prepared me a delicious shallots and wine reduction steak sauce, which was absolutely amazing. 

The chocolate dessert we didn't care for, possibly because we have just gorged ourselves with insanely delicious foods.

We made it there for Sunday Brunch, which other reviewers has commented was terrific.  Unfortunately the experience did not live up to the reputation, and I'm wondering if the trend of super Chefs opening outposts in Las Vegas isn't fraught with peril.  Perhaps the local talent base doesn't support the aspiration and instead leaves us with a watered down version of greatness.  Sort of a parable for Vegas itself?

The restaurant itself is lovely, and we snagged a nice table outside on the patio, which was a beautiful, calm oasis.  Unfortunately things kinds of came off the rails shortly after this as a series of service and cooking gaffes made me wonder if the staff was perhaps a bit hung over from the previous night's escapades?

We ordered Oysters to start, then Croque Madame and Quiche for mains.  Approximately 30 minutes after placing our order the mains arrived.  As the Oysters has not yet arrived, we sent them back and asked for the Oysters.  The runner who brought the food did a good job of realizing the error, taking the food away without argument and sending over the manager. The manager also did a good job of being appropriately upset by the miscue, promising it was not up to their standard, and comped the offending oysters (which turned out to be quite good when they finally arrived).

Hopefully smooth sailing from this point forward.  No such luck.  The Croque and Quiche arrived.  The Croque was absolutely delicious and perfect.  The Brioche toast that underlay it was a triumph.  However the Quiche was luke warm, not hot.  At this point we'd waited long enough and were starving so the issue was registered with the manager but the quiche (which was otherwise delicious) was eaten.  

Finally, in an attempt to redeem the challenging meal we ordered the Beignets.  They too arrived cold (not even warm) and were uninspiring.  An unfortunate end to an error prone meal.

Since most of the other reviews raved about the service I can only assume that our experience was an anomaly, but I have nothing else to gauge Bouchon with.  I'll give Bouchon another try on my next visit to Vegas, but in the meantime this was not the experience I expected, or to which I believe Bouchon aspires.

The 4 star rating is probably pretty accurate compared to my one experience at Bouchon.  Or maybe every one is giving this place 5 stars because it has Thomas Keller's signature on it.  Or maybe it was just that breakfast is really limited in a place like this, and dinner is where it really shines.   Whatever reason, I had an okay breakfast dining experience. 

I had the Ratatouille omelet.  (Message to self, do not order a meal just because it reminds you of a Disney movie where a rat is the executive chef.)  The omelet was okay, it had some diced squash and cheese in it.  Still, it was a little dry.  It came with a slice of very dry toast.  My wife had a quiche that she said was okay.  But it's not a good sign when she tells you that she really liked yesterday's breakfast on the other side of Vegas and she mentions going there tomorrow.  We also had the Croissant with strawberry jam and custard.  My thought is that it would have been better served warm and not cold.  Or was it just someone's order that was left standing for 15 minutes.  That, breakfast, a good size corner table, white table cloth service and a couple of coffees set us back close to $60 with tip.

In my opinion, a 'fancier' restaurant separates itself from the pack due to one (or both) of two things: 1) quality of service, and 2) quality of product offered.  Bouchon definitely turned the amp up to 11 on both fronts.  Not one to shy away from eating myself ridiculous at a beautiful and high-priced establishment, here's a short list of what I ordered for myself (I did share with others, now, so don't worry):

-- entree: a GIGANTIC veal chop, sous vide with aromatics, fricassee of fava beans, baby corn and roasted red peppers, and a delicious tarragon crema-like sauce
-- side: pommes frites...  come on now
-- side: macaroni au gratin...  TOTALLY worth it
-- 1000mL of a spectacular Riesling
-- 1\/2 dozen oysters (from both British Columbia and Washington)
-- French Onion soup...  had to do it.

While my side of the bill turned out to be significantly larger than the other gals' portions, I didn't care.  I don't come to Vegas to go clubbing.  I don't come to Vegas to merely just get drunk.  And I sure as hell don't go to Vegas to eat at McDonalds in between such ventures.  As a 'developing' foodie myself, I found Bouchon to be the most perfect entry point between typical fine dining and 'fooooormal' restaurant (Joel Robuchon, you are so next on my list!).

Our kind and generous server provided us with three things to cap off our wonderful night with Chef Thomas Keller:

-- vanilla bean infused creme brulee
-- brownie 'bouchons' (= corks, in French) topped with three different types of homemade ice cream (do NOT miss the mint chip...  it is to DIE FOR)
-- a house cocktail shot called ""the grand cru""

ALL were seriously soooooo so good.

The greatest part about the night, however, was our server, Paul, and some of the other guys whose names we unfortunately didn't catch.  Admittedly, we were a raucous, wild bunch (relatively speaking of course), and even though we weren't drunk or exhausted in the least, we were definitely the most animated and probably borderline offensive group in the whole joint -- and we stuck around for 3 hours!  THANK YOU SO MUCH PAUL (I hope that is your name...  you called us 'young 'ins' and you had Weezer-style emo-ish glasses on) for making our trip to Bouchon worth it a thousand times over!

Signed, the Captain of this ship!",4,5,4

However, we were disappointed to learn that they don't have a lunch menu.  They have a brunch menu and a dinner menu.  That's it.  Boooo!  But you know what?  Brunch is pretty good!  It took us a couple of days to warm up to the idea of brunch on a weekday and so we stopped in our last morning.  The location is wonderful, down a long corridor in the Venetian, away from the smoke and chaos of the casino.  It's a refreshing little get away within the hotel.  

We were greeted\/seated right away.  Our server was flawless and promptly took our drink order.  I decided to go with a bloody mary and it was delish!

Then we broke our no doughnut rule, and ordered beignets for sharing because we're on vacay and we've never had the fancy French version before.  They were served warm with a light dusting of powdered sugar along with cherry preserves and Nutella.  So worth the calories!  Then we both ordered a spinach omelette.

The outdoor patio was great, it was a perfect evening in Vegas.

We had a couple of their specialty martini type drinks, they were all excellent with fresh juices and mixed perfectly.

The oysters were so fresh they seemed plucked straight from the ocean! I had my doubts ordering oysters and being in Vegas. But I had heard Anthony Bourdin has first pic flown in fresh daily, so I was confident they would be fresh, and they certainly did not disappoint.

 The asparagus\/prosciutto appetizer was strange, it sounded better than it tasted, I probably would not recommend ordering that due to some sort of odd seasoning they used.

 I had a daily special appetizer, which had pork belly. I have never had pork belly so I decided to go for it, it was my favorite, quite delicious! It had crispy squares of pork with some sort of custard sauce in a pie crust with micro greens and white asparagus. The crust was addicting!

For main courses, I had the roasted chicken. I love roasted chicken, I make an amazing one myself, so I had to try what they did with it. Well, it was a huge disappointment. It was bland, flavorless, and dry. The sauce was so weak that came with it, well I could not tell what type of sauce it was. I would NOT recommend ordering this dish to anyone unless you are on a special diet that restricts seasoning.

My friend had the steak and frittes, and WOW that was so good! The steak was the best I have ever had. There was some sort of butter herb onion marmalade topping on the steak. The steak was so tender that it melted in your mouth, and with the topping, well it was sheer perfection!
The frittes (aka fries) were crispy and delicious! I would highly recommend ordering this!

I ended up filling up on my friends steak and ditching the dud of a chicken dish.
For dessert we had the profiteroles, I think. We gobbled them up so quick even thought we were stuffed that, well, I barely remember seeing them.

So the grand total with tax and tip was $230.90! 
That was an awesome deal for the quantity and quality, and let's not forget being in Vegas!

My most recent trip was with my mother and grandmother for Mother's day and I was pleasantly surprised. The first thing to say is they already ran out of the chicken and waffles which was sad :( However everything else was fantastic. We ordered the Corned Beef Hash, the French Toast (bread pudding style). Ham Steak with potato and eggs, and the Mussels. 

The Corned Beef hash was really delicate. The egg was cooked over well which had the perfect texture and it was placed on top of the corned beef which was very gentle but firm. It has the nice balance to it as it wasn't salty and the onions\/shallots were blended to perfection. The French Toast served bread pudding styles was definitely interesting. I love bread pudding but not a huge fan of apples. It has a moist but fluffy texture that held itself up but sliced through with a fork to perfection. The sliced apple was done is several layers and although I only had a few bites it definitely left me with an impression of french toast I'll soon never forget. The Ham steak was pretty good as well. Big heaping of ham steak with AMAZING yet simple breakfast potatoes well cut. And let me not forget the HEAPING amounts of Mussels in broth. Pretty much this portion of mussels was not only near impeccable with succulent but flavorful broth but the portion although shared family style STILL had some leftover when we left. 

The service - the reason I was hesitant to give the restaurant 4 stars was because of the service. Although helptul I expected better service coming from a Thomas Keller restaurant and from one of the more elite Las Vegas strip hotels. The service was standard but nothing where I felt like our tables was completely taken care of. I asked for water twice and although that sounds simple the restaurant was only at 2\/5th's capacity. The server was knowledgeable without a doubt but his follow up was lacking. I also had to ask for the plates to be removed when it was clear that certain dishes were finished and needed tidying. 

The ambiance was pleasant and what I expected from Bouchon. We sat by the window next to the patio by the pool so we got a nice warmth form the sun passing through. The tables and chairs were pretty straight forward and specials of the day were visibly seen. The seafood bar with the different oysters and little lobsters was also a pleasant sight when you enter the restaurant. As you went past the seafood bar, the liquor bar where you mingle and have a more casual dining experience is brim with both top shelf liquor as well as your more well known brands. The wine and champagne list wasn't lacking either as my mother and grandma both had something from the bar. One Bellini and another Espresso Martini which from the few sips I had were standard affair.

My recommendation based of brunch and dinner - Bouchon is a must try as it is tasty, pleasant to be at, and ironically different than what I normally get from a Las Vegas celebrity chef dine in experience. Ciao.",0,0,0

+++ CHICKEN & WAFFLES - Served only during the weekends. Roasted chicken, bacon & chive waffle, Tahitian vanilla bean butter & Chasseur sauce. Expensive, but worth every single penny! It's understandably one of the more popular entrees at Bouchon and definitely a must-try for first-timers. It won't disappoint. The roasted chicken is packed with flavor and complimented by their wonderful Chasseur sauce (similar to a gravy, but 10x better and not as thick). The waffles are just as amazing as the chicken. The bacon and chives adds heartiness to the traditional waffle, but does not overpower it like I would have thought. Remember to add a little bit of their slightly sweet creamy butter onto the waffles for that additional wow factor.

+++ GRAVLAX - Smoked salmon served with a petite baguette, spread of cream cheese & chives, red onion, tomato, and capers--my favorite dish for something light and refreshing that won't leave me bloated before heading out to a pool party\/day club. The salmon is smoked, but doesn't exude the pungent smokiness that some smoked salmon has. It's exceptionally delicious and although I omit the red onions, the combination of everything else still makes this a winner in my book.

+ CROQUE MADAME - Grilled ham & cheese brioche sandwich with a fried sunny-side-up egg and Mornay sauce, served with French fries. The ham makes it slightly salty and the mixture of cheese, eggs, and Mornay sauce makes it rich and somewhat heavy. I highly suggest splitting this dish with someone else. The mound of French fries does slightly balance out the dish in respect to flavor, but not in calories. Beware that these thinly cut crispy French fries are quite addicting.

+ + BERRY OATMEAL - My favorite oatmeal of all time. I was never a fan of oatmeal, but decided to go with this option after a gluttonous night of eating and drinking. It's served in cute little rustic pots with fresh strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and berry sauce. Add some cream, brown sugar, and voila! The perfect oatmeal with the perfect oatmeal to liquid ratio.

The restaurant itself is always busy during the weekends so expect a wait. It's usually loud during breakfast\/brunch, but tolerable. Occasionally, they'll have the patio open for diners which allows for a great view of the Venezia pool. Tables are a little bit closer to each other than usual, but the restaurant encompasses a casual and comforting feel that ultimately puts you at ease.

It was good, but I dont know how anyone, no matter how hungry, could get through even half the plate.  And the menu description was a bit deceptive.  The dish was described as being accompanied by a fricassee of vegetables, but the only ""veggies"" were sliced potatoes (which seemed an odd pairing with potato gnocchi), pimentos, and thinly shredded and blanched greens.

To our surprise our waiter Kristoff was from Poland as was the birthday girl and 2 others so this set an excellent tone to our dinner.

Starters: House made bread and butter. This was perhaps the best I have had since I left Europe. I am accustomed to cheap excellent bread and we got as much as we could eat which was nice. Never once was there any attitude from anyone, and you could almost forget you are in a fine dining establishment. The house wines were delicious and quite pleasant on the palate. I also had the French Onion soup which was outstanding. 

Dinners: I had the Steak Frites. It was stunningly cooked and the fries were the bomb. I tried my GFs duck and it was also outstanding. Everything was cooked beautifully, seasoned perfectly and beautiful to look at. This is how I remember french cooking. No one had anything negative to say which is unusual in a part of 6 demanding foodies. Hats off

Desserts: We had basically one of everything. It was all good but I think the creme brulee and the custard (flan) stood out to me.

We picked Bouchon as our post-theatre dining venue since it was located at the Venetian and that's where our show was.  The restaurant gave an initial impression of a typical bistro, what you'd typically see alongside the streets of Paris.  We got there about 20 minutes earlier than our reservation so we made ourselves comfortable at the bar.  The bartenders looked actually a bit unorganized but whatever.  As we got our cocktails our table was just getting ready.  

We were seated at the table with a beautiful view of the Venetian gardens.  We started the evening with an assortment of fresh seafood - some lobsters, prawns, oysters, and clams...delicious all the way.  

Just as the waiter cracked open our bottle or Reynolds Pinot Noir, we got our dishes, we ordered a dish of the boudin blanc with warm prunes and mashed potatoes, beef wellington on top of a bed of white bean cassoulet, and the classic moules\/frites dish.  All three were delicious, but I'd have to say that the beef wellington that my friend ordered was out of this world.  The meat was tender and matched perfectly with the white cassoulet.

The desserts were also delicious, the creme brullee was a bit cold for my taste and the coconut dessert was good,.  The real winner was the beignets with the berry filling with the chocolate ice cream.  I died and went to the doughnut heaven at that moment.

I'm VERY looking forward to keeping my hopes up to finally getting a reservation at the French Laundry after this pleasant introduction to Thomas Keller's culinary point of view at Bouchon.

I personally had to get my clients drinks and water, set food on the table and continually ask the dedicated wait staff to help my clients.  Maybe the implied tip means they don't have to provide any real service?  In addition they shoved the bill in front of us while in mid conversation with clients demanding to be paid.  

To make this all worse as we tried to address these with our event planner she basically slammed the door on us.  I guess once she gets paid she could care less!!!

I highly recommend management to get involved in these kinds of interactions to ensure clients are well taken care of!!!

For a customer that paid 7k ish in lunch and dinners I would expect significantly better service for our clients!

We started off with some bread, goat cheese, nuts, a bowl of squash soup, and a couple of salads (see my pictures).  The goat cheese was great but everything else wasn't too memorable.

I was scared the rest of the meal would head in the direction of the salads, but luckily that was not the case.  For entrees, we had the croque madam, the pork belly (a seasonal special), and the trout.  The croque madam was so delicious, but then again, how could one ever go wrong with a grilled sandwich with a fried egg on top?  The trout was superb--light, flaky and tender, pairing well with the sauces veggies and almonds (yes, almonds).  It was also humongous!  We barely finished it!  The pork belly, unfortunately, was probably the biggest disappointment (mostly because the waiter kept raving about how good it was).  The cooking traditions of Taiwan and Japan must have spoiled me, because I am used to expecting the satiny sensation of pork fat melting in my mouth, but the braised pork I had that night was on the dry side.  The potatoes and vegetables were still good, though.

For dessert, we ordered the eponymous bouchons, which came with three different ice creams\/sorbets (see my pictures).  Not something I would come just to this restaurant to order, but it was still yummy (for dessert, I personally think you are better off finding the Bouchon bakery stand next to the Phantom of the Opera theatre in the Venetian proper and buy anything that's there and enjoy it in the comfort of your hotel room).

Now, this restaurant isn't cheap...but I think if you want to splurge and experience fine dining, then this is the place to do it.  Huge portions, high quality food, the Thomas Keller brand name, and a pleasant atmosphere totally make the extra $$$ worth it!",7,5,5

We started off with mimosa which were delicious but it's hard to mess up mimosas. I had a Smoked Salmon baguette which was served simply with cream cheese and capers. However, the fread was so fresh and delicious. The flavors just blended perfectly. I also had a side of bacon, which was good thick and delicious and my breakfast also came with fries. I know fries for breakfast, but these were great fries. I couldn't stop eating them even though I was already stuffed. The perfect breakfast. It wasn't heavy but it was filing. It was well presented and the service was excellent at this hour.

The place has a lovely outdoor patio that overlooks one of the pools. I love this little garden area and in my opinion it's so beautiful in the morning.

Next was the house bread, and I loved it. You can't beat any bakeries, warm and crispy like fresh out of the oven.

Then, raw oysters and bloody mary. Raw oysters are... raw oysters and there wasn't much exciting to mention as long as they are fresh. Blood mary was spicy and refreshing. It went well with the oysters.

My main course was pan fried trout with roasted almonds and french beans. The flavor was influenced by butter used for frying. Other than that, it wasn't made with complicated spices, and was kept simple. Roasted almonds were crunchy and kept with the aroma of almonds.  French beans were soaked into the butter sauce used for frying. This is a nice offering for brunch because it was not too heavy, yet too light.

I suppose, though, that each hotel has to have a multitude of ethnic restaurants in order to keep the guest from actually leaving the hotel\/casino in which they are staying.  Anyway, we attended a private dinner party at Thomas Keller's Bouchon (in the Venetian) this past weekend.

Sometimes it's nice not to have too many options when dining out.  You know, like when you're attending someone else's event and they've already chosen a limited menu for the guests (including yourself) to make a selection from?  That way you can just focus on the others who are dining with you rather than salivating over every detail of the entire menu, going back and forth, trying to come up with the best possible way to taste as much as possible without stuffing yourself like a goose.  Ok, I'm totally lying.  I'd much rather scour the menu, up and down, imagining combinations of courses and anticipating what the real thing will bring compared to the vision in my head.  I mean, cummon!  That's almost the best part!  I love reading menus!  I even love reading them with no intention of eating.   

But that's not what I got to do this time.  Sigh.  Oh well.  I guess I'll tell you about it anyway:). 

First was the 2-tiered cold shellfish platter;  wonderfully clean and light and fresh.  Nothin' fancy but neither was the rest of the meal, intentionally.  Chilled steamed lobster, crab, prawns, mussels and clams as well as raw oysters rested on a bed of those cute, little mini ice cubes with a couple of sauces on the side for accompaniment.  It was good and honest and unadulterated.  That's Bouchon's style.  Once I read somewhere that Keller opened Bouchon (the one in Napa, of course) so that he'd have somewhere to eat after being at the French Laundry all night.  It's kind of a funny statement but one can only eat so much fancy food before they crave something uncomplicated and comforting.  And our meal at Bouchon was a true expression of that.

Along with the seafood was a plate of charcuterie which I found quite plain.  Just a few slices of barely differentiable salumi with some cornichons, pickled onions and dijon.  The little jars of salmon rillettes was a nice addition which is why I didn't understand the reason that they were hardly touched.  People are afraid of unfamiliar things, I guess.  Most Americans would rather just have the salami.  I'm sure someone in the kitchen was annoyed when the servers re-entered with 3\/4-full jars of deliciousness to be tossed directly into the garbage.  I know I would be.

Then came our chosen appetizer course.  My dining partner-in-crime and I ordered both options, of course.  I won.  Actually, the cauliflower veloute may have been my favorite thing on the table all night long.  It was ugly as hell, which you can see from the picture below, but very flavorful.  To account for its unappetizing color and depth of flavor, I assume that the cauliflower was roasted before being made into a soup since the server informed me that there was, in fact, no chicken stock in it.  Its green olive tapanade garnish lent a salty brightness to the smooth, mouth-coating veloute.  We both thoroughly enjoyed it, as did the other recipients of it at the table. 

Beet salad was our second appetizer and we both agreed that it needed help.  For me, it was just (naturally) overly sweet and could have benefitted from a salt or acid component (or more of what was already there).  The strategically composed bites of sweet beet, bright orange, toasty hazelnut and salty frisee were the best.  But the complimentary components were gone long before their protagonist, leaving us with a big pile of beets and nothing to eat them with.

Now, please don't hold my entree order against me.  It is a very rare occasion that I find it appropriate to order chicken.  For the most part, I shake my head in disappointment at the chicken orderers of the world.  But that's because it is most often their safety net.  And if there is ever a time to order a half of a roasted chicken, I thought it would be at Bouchon where I was hoping to be delighted with browned, crispy skin and tender, juicy meat.  And it was almost there.  Nicely browned but not as juicy as I'd hoped.  Keller is a big believer in brining so I was expecting ridiculously juicy meat.  But it wasn't.  Better were the roasted oyster and shiitake mushrooms with fresh (yes, fresh) peas that my bird sat atop.  And I couldn't help but butter a thick-crusted baguette and let it rest in the plate's deep, rich sauce before devouring it.  I was very happy with that part.

The lamb loin was fine.  Nothing to write home about.  A perfect medium rare but not juicy which leads my to believe they used one of those temperature holding ovens.  I guess you can't expect them to sear off 15 orders of meat at once for a private party.  It was served simply with turnips and carrots (meh)....",1,0,1

We made reservations months in advance, and somehow we were placed in the back corner of a tiny room, when we had requested main dinning room. 

Service was so sub-par. Drinks were extremely slow to come out (thinking both empty water and wine glasses for quite some time). I physically had to walk to the front hostess area to ask where our server was for drinks before the food came out. 

Three people ordered the quiche, and it was absolutely uneatable. Two sent it back, and it was apparent the server was annoyed by it. We ordered some of the potatoes, and fries came out instead. Steak and eggs were decent and the croquet madame was good but nothing to write home about. 

We never saw a manager until the very end when he took off a round of mimosas, even after having to go find someone to help us and sending back not one but TWO dishes.

I truly wish I would have went here for their brunch because that is what seems to be spectacular about this place.

First off the service was amazing. Our waiter made fantastic suggestions and joked around with us. He made the meal just that much better.

I honestly adored the way they bring out the fresh baguette and simply place it on the table. I've never been to France but in my vision of a small cafe, this how they would do it.

They had introduced a new menu about a week before we arrived, probably gearing up for fall, which doesn't show it's face around Vegas. 

While we waited to be seated we watched the chef's prepare the raw bar. It was amazing to watch how much lobster flew out of this place. 

Naturally , after seeing everyone else indulging in the raw bar we ordered oysters. Unfortunately they did not impress us.

We also ordered the olives, they were completely amazing. Do yourself a favor and order them.

My parents ordered a salad- Salade Frisée aux Lardons et Oeuf Poch
frisée lettuce, fines herbs, bacon lardons, a soft poached hen egg & toasted brioche. I was utterly jealous. This looked and sounded amazing. This made me wish I went back to eating meat for the night.

My mom and I both intended on ordering the gnocchi. I sat back and wondered what the hell we were doing at Bouchon eating gnocchi, so at the last minute and with the encouragement of our waiter we changed our minds.

I ordered the mussels and frites and was promptly told that if I was going to eat seafood I needed to get the trout. My response? Really trout? I grew up eating trout, ok here goes nothing. It was amazing. I just can't eat a lot of fish because I'm not used to eating it, but I'm happy I tried it. It made me appreciate trout in a new light.

My mom ordered Poulet Rôti, roasted chicken with quince,charred radicchio & truffle emulsion. She was very happy she ordered this dish. The chicken just melted in your mouth, well according to her. This dish also made me wish I ate meat. 

My dad decided to order to appetizers as his entree because he couldn't choose between them and nothing stood out too much as an entree. Veau Braisé en Crépinette, braised veal tail with forest mushrooms, soft polenta & sherry vinaigrette. And Confit de Canard, duck leg confit, French green lentils, matignon of root vegetables & red wine duck jus. Once again I cannot comment because I do not eat meat. 

I think the fact that I expected so much because all I heard about was Bouchon it did not live up to my expectations. It was really good, but nothing about it really knocked my socks off especially for the price.

Or is it when at the Venetian do as the French do?  Very confusing. So as I swaggered out of the hotel in the morning to my trade show at the convention center I made a 6:30 dinner reservation for later that night. Oh man it smelled good, I almost stayed for breakfast.

After a long day at the convention center, it came time for dinner and man I couldn't wait to dive into Bouchon and do a French belly flop!  

I was immediately seated and my first (of many) waiters came to get me started off. I'm not much of a wino so I asked about the beer selection they had to offer and settled on a dark pumpkin spice number.

The 2nd was  bringing some bread shells and pistachio's  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?select=w-8xsdNVt1DXAJhXaGNLsw#gQ8-2YOTknwRmAxwp1fVEw   as the 3rd waiter was showing me the menu. A newsprint deal that wrapped around the cutlery and napkin.  Crap! I told the waiter I don't have my glasses and can hardly see. The restaurant was dim and oozed romance too bad I was alone and blind. But waiter #3 to the rescue! He had a mini LED flashlight and I was able to read the menu and find some choices for my dinner!

The servers team worked like a well oiled machine.  We probably had 4 servers tend to us, like they worked as a team to make us happy.  As a former server, I LOVE when that happens.   The servers, informed us well on the specials, asked to prepare the foie gras for us, always had our water glasses filled (very important after a Saturday night\/Sunday morning in Vegas), and were attentive without being to nosy (love when this happens as well).

From the taste and presentation, the food was spectacular.  The bread comes out in the shape of leaves.  Then starting out the foie gras appetizer was decadent, 2.5 oz, would have been enough for us, the mussels were so fresh, and even the olives in the bloody marys had a freshness to them.

Bouchon is my favorite place for breakfast in Las Vegas.  I've had breakfast here more than a dozen times, and still look forward to going.  I've also had dinner here once, and was very pleased.

Bouchon is very bright and cheerful. It combines formality with informality: tables are graced with white tablecloths, but a piece of white paper is placed on top; some men arrive in business suits, others in shorts.  This is a good place to bring your newspaper.  When the weather is nice, consider asking for a table outside.

I've found service to be efficient, friendly and relaxed.  However, I've read a couple of accounts which described inattentive service.  I haven't noticed this, but then not much service is needed at breakfast.



**Breakfast**
I've eaten my way through much of the menu:
*   French Toast Bouchon style.  It's a cylinder of something like sweet bread pudding, with apples, and a crisp glaze on top.  I thought it was good, but not memorable.  However, I seem to be in the distinct minority, as I continue to read rave reviews of the stuff.

*   My personal favorite is boudin blanc with scrambled eggs, croissant and beurre noisette.  Boudin blanc is a large white sausage, soft and smooth, with a distinct acidic tang.  It's unusual enough that the server sometimes cautions you if you order it, but I think it's delicious.  The scrambled eggs are a perfect example of what I mean by ""simple food, prepared very well.""  The eggs are standard scrambled eggs - but are delicious:  cooked through but still soft and creamy, with lots of flavor.  The croissant has varied between very good and truly excellent.

*   Omelet with chicken, piquillo peppers, onion confit, tarragon and swiss cheese; sausage links served on the side.  This was a daily special.  The sausage was very good, although no match for the boudin blanc.  The omelet was really good.  The egg was cooked through but still soft; light but not too airy; rich.  The tarragon flavor was strong but not overpowering.  There was a lot of onions, soft but not squishy.  The chicken was not dry.  Lastly, there were two thick half slices of toasted brioche.  A winner!

*   Steak hash with eggs any style, and brioche toast.  Another daily special.  The hash was very good, with lots of tender diced steak.  The scrambled eggs were well prepared, and I liked their brioche a lot.  Again, simple food prepared very well.

*   Croque Madame.  Toasted ham and cheese sandwich on brioche (a rich bread made with eggs and butter), with a fried egg and mornay sauce on top; served with a mountain of french fries.  I know it sounds a little strange, but it's very good.

*   Waffles with strawberries and applewood smoked bacon.  The waffles were light and fairly crisp.  The bacon wasn't as crispy as I would have liked, but the flavor was very good.

*   Bouchon's croissant is always worth ordering, as are the sweet pastries.  The one I remember the most was a blueberry muffin, flavored with blueberry juice and with bits of fruit, and a top made crunchy by a glaze of sugar.

*   Yogurt parfait.  Rich and creamy yogurt, crunchy home made granola, and fresh berries.  The one time I ordered this, the yogurt was very good, but the berries were unripe and too sour.  Perhaps I'll give it another try someday.



**Dinner**
I've only eaten dinner here once.  It was a little more animated, and a little noisier, than at breakfast.  My meal consisted of:
*   Beignets de Brandade de Morue.  Three small balls of mashed cod, covered in a thin coating, and fried.  In essence, a grown up cod fish cake.  Very, very good.
*   Braised Lamb Shank.  This was a special, recommended by the server.  It was a large piece of meat, so soft it fell off the bone.  Served on a bed of potato puree, along with micro chives, capers, lots of garlic cloves, and pimiento strips.  The lamb flavor was strong, the garlic soft and sweet.  Also very good.
*   Pommes Frites.  There was no need to order them, but I had heard such good things about Bouchon's French fries that I had to give them a try.  They were good French fries, but I was a little disappointed.  Perhaps all the hype made for unrealistic expectations.
*   Bouchons.  Three small chocolate morsels, like brownies but crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.  The chocolate flavor was dark and intense.  Served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream, it earned its name.
*   Mignardises.  A few sweets at the end of the meal.  This is becoming more and more common, and is a nice touch.

When I first read the menu, I was underwhelmed.  There were no knock-your-socks-off fancy dishes.  However, like breakfast, the chef concentrated on simple dishes, and executed them very well.  This was a very good meal indeed.




A trip to Las Vegas wouldn't be the same without at least one breakfast at Bouchon.  I always leave in a good mood, ready for the rest of the day.",4,0,2

My wife and I stay at The Venetian Palazzo Resort three times a year, twice for business and once for a family vacation. We like Bouchon so much that we eat breakfast there every morning of every stay. We recently attended a short conference at the resort, and since the rest of the conferees were unfamiliar with The Venetian Hotel, I posted several reviews on the conference Facebook page, about different attractions at the resort. My most enthusiastic review was of Bouchon. I am re-posting here, essentially a copy of the review that I wrote for my fellow conferees. 

For breakfast, no one should miss eating at Bouchon, on the 10th floor of the Venezia Tower at the Venetian Palazzo Resort. Bouchon is not just for quality-seekers who don't mind paying for the best, but also for the budget-minded who are looking for a deal, and for everyone in between. At Bouchon, you can experience the feel, the service, and the environment of fine dining, without paying a fortune for your meal. Their perfectly cooked eggs, potato croquettes, toasted brioche and your choice of bacon or sausage, is just $13. Sourdough waffles, served with fresh strawberries, maple syrup, and vanilla bean butter are just $12 (my wife doesn't like waffles yet she often orders them at Bouchon - for many they are a life-changing experience). Their oatmeal is $7, served in a hot metal bowl with a house-made apple or berry compote drizzled on it, and brown sugar on the side. And somebody at your table has to order the quiche, which is the smoothest, lightest, and most delicious I've ever tasted, for just $13. Bouchon also has more expensive options, including Fois Gras, Salmon Rillettes, a magnificent platter of fresh fruit in season that will serve four or more, trout, mussels, steak, smoked salmon, and some of the best pastries you'll ever eat, the kind that wipe out a man's free will.

""I'll buy dinner and the wine"" says Lucas, my poker bud from France, ""as long as it's French"" then giggles.

""Ever heard of Thomas Keller?""  I remark.

""The dry cleaning guy?""  he quips in his thick French accent, as if the chef of one of the greatest restaurants in the US, the Michelin three star French Laundry, can't compare to the French.

""Bouchon it is but if you like the food, you pay the check and twice that to me in cold, hard cash"".

""Book it"" is the smug reply.

Truly French, baguette, chewy, expertly baked with a crisp crust.  It's required to carry the delicious ""stuff"" that is to follow:

(1) Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard - Velvety smooth with a clean foie taste, balanced saltiness and a kiss of Sauternes sweetness.

(2) Pate de Champagne; a country style pate akin to a finely ground head cheese.  Delicious tasty bits of this and that.  Perfect with grain mustard and cornichons that elevate it's natural sweetness.

(3) Rillettes aux Deux Saumons (a combination of fresh and smoked salmon rillettes, prepared in terrine and topped with a layer of clarified butter.  Rich, fatty, salty salmon bits begging to be spread on some crusty bread.

Finally the must have, Brandade de Morue ala Provencal.  Not the traditional whipped salt cod and olive oil, this interpretation is deep fried into crisp, light balls of goodness.  Incredible.

A nice selection of creamy goat, sheep, and cows milk cheeses finishes the meal.

Service is French casual and Vegas friendly.

This dinner was supposed to be our amazing dinner for the weekend. Amazing it was not. First off, our appetizers took 20 minutes to come out. I loaded up on bread and pistachios waiting patiently. Once our food arrives, our waitress comes over and apologizes about the long wait and let's us know that she was aware of the issue and informed the manager. The manager then comes over asking us if everything is ok but not mentioning the wait time on the apps. 

The food:
We ordered the bone marrow, the bacon salad, the foie gras, and the leg of lamb. The bone marrow was delicious! It was so delicate and flavorful. Once I incorporated all the components in the bite (marrow, roasted garlic and the sauce) everything made sense and it was great! Very rich though... Should share with someone. The bacon salad was my bf's app and he says it wasn't anything special and too greasy. I had the seared foie as my entree and it was good. I found it under-seasoned and the sauce too sweet. It was seared perfectly though and I don't regret ordering it, I just think it could've been better with a little salt. My bf had the leg of lamb and was utterly disappointed. The potatoes that came with it were horrible, they tasted as it they went bad and they were trying to ""save"" them by covering them up with sauce. The lamb itself was under whelming and he kept saying, I should've gotten the steak.

The dessert:
We originally didn't order dessert, I was full from my very rich meal and my boyfriend was so disappointed with the lamb that he didn't want anything else. But on a just note, we were given the dessert specials complimentary because of our long waiting for the apps. That did help with my bf's opinion. 
We were given the creme brûlée and the profiteroles. The profiteroles were covered with chocolate sauce and my bf loved it. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate so I had a bite and that was it. The creme brûlée was classically done to perfection and I enjoyed what I could eat of it because I wAs so stuffed.

My friend and I ordered the escargots a la bourguignonne ($17.50 - red wine braised Burgundy snails w\/ garlic butter & Bouchon pastry puff pastry);  petite plateau ($65 - a seafood tower w\/ a 1\/2 lobster, 8 oysters, 4 shrimp, 4 clams and 8 mussels; gigot d'Agneau ($33.95 - roasted leg of lamb w\/ wilted cavolo nero, garden rhubarb, nicoise olives, crispy panisse and lamb jus); and saumon poele ($36.50 - sauteed Scottish salmon ministra w\/ manila clams, salsify, oyster mushrooms and young artichokes - not pictured).

The escargots were the best ones I have ever had.  In most restaurants the garlic and butter overpower the snails.  Not in this case.  The snails were large, uber fresh, super tender and their was just enough sauce to flavor the snails:  5 Stars.  The seafood tower was also excellent.  The seafood was uber fresh and the star of the tower was the oysters and clams.  The brininess of the ocean where each oyster came from stood out:  5 Stars.  Our entrees were very good.  The gigot d'Agneau was very well thought out by chef Thomas Keller.  The lamb was medium rare and the combination of sweetness of the cavolo nero (an Italian kale), and the tartness of the olives went well w\/ the strong flavor of the lamb.  The crispness of the panisse (a chickpea flourcake) also contrasted nicely.  I did not snap a pic of my friend's salmon but he said it was very good also.

To accompany the meal we ordered a 1\/2 bottle of Louis Jadot Beaune Theurons Pinot Noir ($50).  My friend is a wine connoisseur and he never steers us wrong.  The wine was excellent and the winery is one of the renowned ones in this region in France that produces light, fruity wines that go well w\/ meat, seafood and cheese:  5 Stars.

The only downside to the meal was the service was spotty.  We arrived early and we went to have drinks in the bar.  We didn't see a waiter so I went to the bar.  There were two bartenders and one managerial type.  It took a while for one of the two bartenders to notice me.  In addition, when I asked to charge it to my room, the bartender said I had to fill out some slip - WTF?!?!?!  When I checked in the person said I could use my keycard to pay for meals, et al.  I ended up using my credit card.  Secondarily, when we were seated the hostess tried to put us in a table for two next to a post.  The seat next to the post did not have much hip room.  My friend and I are both 6'2"" and 225+.  We asked to be seated at a table for four and the hostess displayed a bit of displeasure.  Come on girl!!!  It was not that busy and we were going to drop $300 - We deserved a large enough table to hold our Petite Plateau!!!  Lastly, the shrimp were not peeled and the lobster was not cracked.  We understood the foregoing because the chef wants to demonstrate the freshness of the seafood.  However, when we mentioned it to the waiter, all he did was apologize vs offering a solution.  I said OK, and ate the lobster head like a ""Hombre de Cavernas"", much to the chagrin of some clients.  F*ck em!!!  I wanted to get all the meat out:  2 Stars on service.

The ambiance is excellent.  There is a fresh seafood bar on your left when you walk in.  The bar is also very nice with a large clock in background.  Lastly, the restaurant reminds you of Bistro in Paris:  5 Stars.

This is a beautiful space that make you feel like you are in a bistro in Paris (with a lot of personal space).

The sauce for the moules-frites was slightly tangy which was very appetizing and before my husband and I knew it we had gone through the entire dish! Good for my palate but bad for my diet! The veal was cooked to perfection with a melt-in-your-mouth juiciness which contrasted nicely with its crispy outer crust. Our server was really attentive and kept stopping by to give us new plates (for the shells) and refiling our beverages.

All in all, there's really nothing I have to complain about! Note that the servings are kind of huge so it might be a good idea to just share an entree and appetizer if you don't eat a lot.

It has a little patio outside by the pool area, but by the middle of my meal I wished I had sat inside because the Vegas heat was just too much for me to enjoy the sun and the cocktail.

At first I ordered 1\/2 dozen of oysters, and they were delicious. So then I ordered Petit Plateau, which comes with 1\/2 lobster, clams, oysters, shrimp, and mussles. They were all very delicious. I was way too full before my main dish, trout, came out. If you're one of those people who are sensitive about animal rights, don't order the trout. It was good, but the fish comes out with its head attached and the body cut in half vertically, which made me feel as if I were dissecting that thing every time I took a stab at it.

Next time I go back to Vegas, I would go back to Bouchon and just order a bunch of oysters. So yummy!",0,0,0

Steak Frites for Jim G: not a cheap version of steak frites, but a full on hunk of steak, hence the necessity for wine!

It is a little difficult to find, but once you know how to get here (parking structure elevators) it's pretty easy.  There was about a 20 minute wait, but the hosts were very good at communicating with us to let us know how much longer even after we put our name in.

I will start off by saying that the only bad thing here was that our server seemed to be MIA a good portion of time.  I attribute this to her having been sat a 8-10 person table just after us.  However, even the lack of service was made up by the quality and quantity of their food.  Each table gets bread, butter, and homemade jam to start.  I am not a huge fan of apricot jam but this was delicious!  The presentation was there, too.  Each butter came out pre-covered with a Bouchon logo, which was unique and reassuring for quality purposes (and a little for show).   

For the main course, two of us got the Croque Madam, one got the corned beef hash with eggs and toast, and my husband got the sourdough waffles.  Every single dish was amazing - especially the waffles!  I didn't think waffles would be any different, but they were.  Sourdough waffles topped with bananas, walnuts, syrup, and butter were pretty close to heaven.  My Croque Madam, which is essentially a ham and Swiss sandwich topped with an egg and mornay sauce, was absolutely mouth-watering.

I will say that Bouchon is a classy establishment through and through.  Everything from the dirty Vodka martini to their desserts are world class and amazing.

Starters:

Petit Plateau -  A small assortment of seafood goodies.  The oysters were amazingly good.

Escargots de Bourgogne - Escargot in a garlic-parsley butter with a puff pastry on top.  If you like escargot, you'll love this.  The puff pastry lends this simple dish a perfect textural complexity.

Pommes Frites - What can I say?  These are the best french fries I've ever had.  Perfect in texture, beautifully crisp on the outside, still soft in the inside, these are the fries of legend.

Entrées:

Carré de Porc - A prefectly tender and juicy pork tenderloin paired with summer stone fruits, it was sweet and savory.

Steak Frites - Nothing surprising here, just a perfectly executed steak.

Braised short ribs - The special of the night, this dish was AMAZING.  Basically an extravagant pot roast, it was put over the top by the addition of a small portion of marrow.  Phenomenal.


Desserts:

Creme Brulee - Nothing out of the ordinary.  It was pretty good and loaded with little bits of real vanilla bean.  

Trio of Gelato - The flavors were peanut butter, raspberry, and hazelnut.  While I usually love all things hazelnut, this was not that great.  It really didn't taste like anything.  Overall, I actually wasn't terribly impressed with the gelato but it may have been that I was already incredibly full by this point.",5,2,4

Having had lunch at the Bouchon Bakery in NYC, and thoroughly enjoying it, I assumed that Bouchon, it's upscale cousin could only be better.

I went there with my wife for dinner.  Poor signage in the casino [Venetian] made finding it difficult [casino directory\/maps extremely outdated.] 

We sat outside overlooking the pool area - nice. But problems soon began.  Our server seemed to disappear after salad was served, even though other tables near us received their food and finished before we received our entrees.  It was likely  nearly a 60 min delay between salad and entrees.  

Then the food was not very hot when served.  Maybe the food had been sitting our for the 60 min delay.  I ordered a classic French dish - steak frites - with a flat iron steak.  Granted flat iron isn't the best cut of beef, but when cooked right, can be quite flavorful . It arrived unevenly cooked [well done to medium] even though I had ordered medium rare.  The beef flavor was overpowered by the shallots covering it, which I eventually scraped off.  I was warm, not hot.  I felt especially ripped off that I was charged $36 for a flat tron steak.  A princely sum for a pauper's cut of beef!  My wife's mussels were not very warm either.  The fries were over salted. After waiting so long, I was afraid of another hour wait if I sent it back.  It would have been nice if I had the option, but our waitress [redhead] was ignoring us.

I left a restaurant angry for one of the few times in my life.  Not only was the food disappointing, but the service was poor [except for the stewards who kept our water glasses full.]  It took forever to finally get the check.  

Having had tasting menus before, I know when a meal should take two hours.  A salad and entree should not have taken 2 hrs.  I tipped the waitress less than my usual 20-25% - I only felt bad that the other servers [bread, water] would suffer for the waitress's poor attention.

Moules frites (mussels in white wine came out in a Staub cast iron, with tons of fries): this dish was very good

Croque madame: again, this dish came with a lot of fries. Everything tastes better when you cut the yolk on the sunny-side up egg. I liked this dish more than the mussels.

Goat cheese and greens: the salad was decent, although I would have liked something crispy or crunchy to contrast the warm goat cheese or nicely-dressed greens.

While probably the least popular of his culinary trifecta of Bouchon (vegas & yountville), French Laundry, and Per Se, starting off with this restaurant is nothing to be ashamed of.

If you scroll down to Seth W.'s review, I was also in his party of 12 that drank the absinthe and easily had one of the best dining experiences of my life, with good food, good drink, and excellent company.  

The first thing that showed me this is a quality restaurant was the excellent, attentive wait staff.  Starting off with a very knowledgeable waiter (who else can explain why castrated chicken is more tasty and juicy?), to a well-versed sommelier who taught us the history of absinthe, we were taken care of through the entirety of our meal.

We started off with an amuse bouche of salmon spread with salmon cooked a few different ways (smoked, pureed, etc.).  Had I known about this, I probably wouldn't have ordered the salmon tartare appetizer, as this tasted a little bit better.  The consistency was such that you could take a butter knife and spread it across the biscuit.

The salmon tartare starter had a similar taste, except it was surrounded by bits of hard boiled egg.  I can't say that it did or didn't complement the tartare well, but the amuse bouche was definitely better tasting without any extraneous tastes that the egg brought.

Never fear though, as I'm confident that I got the best main course of the table.  The Epaule de Porc is a braised pork shoulder with glazed root vegetables, celeriac remoulade & pork jus (quoted from the menu).  In everyday speak, this is the most tender pork that exists.  Saying that it melts in your mouth is an understatement.  Think about a warm tasty porky marshmallow that gives you feelings of the first time you made love, but not as short lasting.  That's about as close as I can put into words to describe this amazing dish.

Putting it in perspective, having this kind of amazing meal for under $100 in Vegas (not to mention in the Venetian) is quite a steal.",2,2,1

Conveniently we stayed at Venetian on the 10th floor during our trip, so we literally walked across the hall to the restaurant. This saves SO much time when you're in Vegas!! 

Came in on Sat at 8:30am for brunch. To my surprise, there was hardly anyone there. I was expecting a wait (even that early) since it is one of the most ""sought after restaurants in Las Vegas."" This is per the concierge, but I totally believe it.  

Sat outside on the patio overlooking one of the Venetian pools. (I believe it was the canyon creek pools). 

Service was Great and pretty attentive. 

Croissant- good. But unfortunately I just came back from Paris so it's hard to be woo'ed when you've had a croissant at the best place in the world to eat one. Anyways... 

Fruit salad- wanted some fruit to cleanse my palate but this was mistake. Just got a few pieces of blueberries, cantaloupe, and melon. I mean, where are the strawberries and kiwi or something else cool and tropical? Totally underwhelmed. 

Chicken and waffles- didn't eat this but cousins ordered it and said it was quite the dish! 

Madam croque- a bit underwhelmed considering this is a classic French dish. I honestly could've made this at home, but I was curious to try it at bouchon and it was ok. 

Salmon with capers and bread. Bf had this and it was solid.

So seeing how prices can be crazy expensive, we decided to visit for Brunch\/Breakfast. Bouchon doesn't take reservations for Brunch or Breakfast, and is based on a FIRST COME FIRST SERVE. 

The wait doesn't seem to be too bad, I think for our party it was about a half hour, and they have little muffins to nibble on, while you are waiting and a pretty decent waiting area, with cafe tables and banquettes to sit around while you wait. They also have Thomas Keller's published cookbooks to browse around so killing time here isn't too much of hardship, although if you want to explore, make sure you leave one of your party behind to wait, while you do so, since they don't operate on a buzzer system  and they do it the old fashioned way, with someone calling out your name, which makes it beautifully organized chaos.

Food was extremely excellent and quite filling. Our party ordered the Benedict of the day (short rib eggs Benedict), chicken & waffles, Sourdough waffles; the Croque Madame; along with their pastry basket.

The pastry basket was pretty excellent, you get to choose a selection of what they have on the menu, in addition to what they have the board.  I loved their Pear Danish and their chocolate almond croissant the most, because they left me craving more of it.

I'd say definitely order the chicken & Waffles, which are chive and bacon waffles with half a roasted chicken which was so beautifully amazing, you could eat it on its own, as well as with the vanilla bean butter and their gravy that came with it.. I'd say skip the maple syrup that comes with it, since it really doesn't need it.

Well, at Bouchon, we and our guests not only had awesome wedding food--it was just awesome food. Many of our guests said it was the best fish and steak they'd ever had. And the pastry chef offered to make two flavors of cake, and each plate was served with a macaron and scoop of ice cream. What a sweet touch!

But there was one thing that outshined the food--the service was impeccable. The sales manager Debbie had such great attention to detail and helped us organize the ceremony and reception to perfection.

first and foremost! great decor, location and atmosphere, It being a Thomas Keller signature restaurant at The Venetian Hotel and Casino i had full expectations, however its not what i got! and for those reasons i can rate this only 2 star based on my personal experience.   The night my Sister and I had decided to have dinner at this location, we got seated right away near the Seafood bar, 5 minutes later a couple was seated next to us. at this point we still had not received any complimentary bread & butter like most restaurants would do at the time your seated. 

our neighbors had received their's first in addition they were already ordering their appetizers, by this time we were barely getting our bread and drinks were being ordered. easy to notice that our service was becoming very slow and delayed on our table.  ""ill remind you we were seated first, and this couple was seated 5 minutes later, after our arrival""  at this stage they are having their drinks and first order of appetizers were being served to our neighbors, Yet we were still waiting on our appetizers. 

minutes after our neighbors are having their entree's where we are still working on our first course. 15 minutes had past our neighbors are getting ready to pay their bill and go on with their night. YET, we still have not received our entree's waiter did come out and say what was happenings, 20 minutes later, i decided to call the manager on duty and explain what was going on, that our service from the time of arrival had not being going well, our neighbors who were seat next to us arrived 5 minutes later, and had already left..  at this stage i was very upset and very unhappy, that a 2 course dinner took nearly 2 hours! WTF

the food was good, but nothing extraordinary or worth the wait, meh, at this stage the manager decided to go and speak with the back of the house and all sudden 2 minutes later our waiter comes out being very applogetic about the service, and offered us complimentary desserts on the house. which my sister and I opted out! which just wanted to leave!!!!!!!!!!!

In fact, I enjoy the casual yet upscale atmosphere of this brasserie (and the original in Yountville, CA which fairly makes my heart sing) so much that I would venture to say that my last meal on earth might very well occur at Bouchon if I have a choice in the matter!

Often I travel alone for business, and this restaurant has a fantastic old school marble topped bar which is beautifully conducive to dining solo and enjoying the people watching and friendly banter of the bartenders as I slurp decadent perfectly seasoned and piping hot French onion soup crowned with gooey melted gruyere cheese along side a mixed greens salad with a simple vinaigrette and a round of toasted goat cheese. Simple, yes, but perfectly executed. The epis bread, baked in house, is a delightful accompaniment as it has a shatteringly crisp crust but a soft, chewy, warm interior.

When I have dined with colleagues or a date, I usually order steak frites as my entree and it comes slathered (just a tiny bit too heavily slathered, honestly) with a shallot and garlic studded red wine butter sauce. Mmmmmmmmm.... so delicious though!

The ""Bouchons""  for dessert are the best choice: little cork shaped chocolate cakes served with housemade fresh mint chocolate chip ice cream last time I had them. A refreshing way to end the meal!

Cocktails are professionally crafted and there is a well chosen wine list featuring a variety of price points.

Sunday my wife and I had dinner at Bouchon in the Venetian. Food was absolutely divine. Two notable dishes are the escargot, done our favorite way with the puff pastry cap - this is our go to appetizer and we think it is done best here at Bouchon. The chicken entre is hands down the best chicken any where! Moist and flavorful, apparently the brine and seasoning makes this their signature dish. If you haven't tried this, treat yourself next time.

What puts this rating over the top is the wait staff. Plenty of celebrity chefs in Las Vegas, but the restaurant's people make the experience for the customer. I want to note our waitress, Kayla Maytum, was exceptionally knowledgeable in the food and wines; not pretentious but clearly an expert.

I came here with a friend who's been here many times and highly recommended it and I'm glad I checked it out.

I ordered Idaho trout which was very light and tasty and then I sampled a side of olives, which were not what I was expecting but still edible.

Then the best part was that our whole table got hooked up with samples of champagne and Moscato paired with almost every dessert on the menu except for the chocolate cake, which is fine because I don't really eat chocolate anyway. 

Wow, this was definitely an overwhelming amount of dessert for just a table of 3... but I'm not complaining... Speaking of the desserts my favorite was the lemon tart pie. Wow! That was the best tart I've ever had. All the other desserts were a little over the top on sweetness and dairy, which I'm not a fan of but still good.

Not only was the food fantastic but the service was accurate, friendly and humorous. It was nice to see all the workers getting along and poking fun at one another. I liked it that because it was unexpected and it says something good about the establishment. 

A crew that gets along provides exceptional service and it's very true. The menu was very simple and not as expensive as I thought it would be, which made this meal all the more enjoyable. 

Overall everything was great but my only complaint is that the hostesses could have done a better job with their lack of friendliness\/poise and assigning tables. We had a table reserved at 9:15 and did not get seated until 9:40 which was unprofessional.

Was excited to try Bouchon as a Thomas Keller fan.  To be upfront, Bouchon is no French Laundry.  The latter blew me away whereas, Bouchon was excellent but unremarkable.  

I had the chicken and waffles, which were superb and the waffles threw me for a happy loop with the bacon specks cooked in and the flavored butter.  Other folks in our family had rave reviews for the Tartine de Thon, Bouchon French Toast, and trout dish.  Gravlax and Croque de Madame were said to be good.

Service staff was very nice, though remarkably slow in their execution.

Couple criticisms: 
(1) Service was exceptionally slow!  Ordering took about 25 minutes.  It was about 50 minutes before food was on the table.  And paying was the equivalent of a race with your chunky buddy on your back.  All in all, our dining experience took about 2.5 hours.  
(2) The Bouchon Pastry Basket was grocery store caliber.  Two of the flavors came back as unavailable.  Then, when the platter did arrive, they all had cold centers.  Seriously, for $13 for four pastries, I would expect thorough reheating.
(3) We sat in the back right and with things taking so long, the sun was hitting us hard.  My cousin and I started eating lunch with our sunglasses on.  As the temperature on my phone crossed 90-degrees, I called over the staff and asked to either move or have them pull some kind of shade.  They kindly put an outside umbrella against the window which helped greatly.  They were very kind in responding.  I would have liked it more if they had thought ahead reacted to our discomfort without being asked.  We aren't the only ones who have eaten at the table.

In sum, excellent food, slow service, nice staff, a few knocks on food preparation, and a some small doubts on quality for the price.",0,0,0

I LOVED this place. i had high expectations coming in, and they were met.  I was able to get a picture of everything we ordered, after nearly threatening to throw down anyone who touched their perfectly presented dishes without a picture to document the experience. The best part about eating with a group of people is the sharing. I'm the kind of gal that WILL try something if you offer. I guess in this case, I sort of offered myself on them. when it comes to great food, i have no same, baby, no shame.

We had the perfect table outside, and the weather was could not have been better. The place didnt seem as pretentious as I thought it would be (we had people with shorts and a t-shirt and we were fine) The place was semi causual, but the wait staff was 100% professional. Our server was super cool, and was very attentive to us at all times. 

After regretting not ordering the bloody mary at Mesa, I had to order one here (expecting it to be just as good) It was tasty, but I have to say that the Mesa bloody mary was just a tad more delicious. I believe coffee and perhaps OJ are complimentary (or they just didnt charge us for it, sweet!) 

I had the chance to try the Croque Madame, French Toast, Sourdough Waffles, and the Corned Beef Hash.

Croque Madam was superb. It was a ham and swiss sandwich between two pieces of brioche grilled and topped with a fried egg and a hollandaise. I usually don't like hollandaise, but the sauce was fantastic. It was lighter than I expected, and really made the dish for me. It was served with a heaping side of fries (which were pretty dang good as well with the jam says Rhett S!) The only thing is I'm lactose, so I couldn't eat the whole thing because of the sauce, but otherwise, it was definitely worth it!

French Toast. ($11.95) I'm usually not a sweets person in the morning. But this french toast was absolutely decadent, and would satisfy any sweet tooth. It was not your usual bread dipped in egg french toast. It was prepared like a bread pudding, with fresh custard and apples layered in between the pieces of brioche. It also came with maple syrup. YUM-O. 

Sourdough waffles with Strawberries, Candied Walnuts, and Tahitian Vanilla butter. ($11.95!!!) Our friend also asked for a side of whipped cream (which was also infused with vanilla). I can honestly say this was the absolute best waffle I have ever had. It was light and crispy, and the hint of vanilla whipped cream with the tartness of the strawberry was a serious jam sesh in my mouth. I would order this myself again when I go. 

Corned beef Hash was a hearty serving of potatoes and corned beef with two eggs any way you like with a side of toast. The corned beef was hearty, but not fatty like most places I've had. Really delicious stuff. 

All in all, I am so happy i had a chance to taste the food from the kitchen of thomas keller. It was a truly pleasurable experience, and I would highly recommend it!",2,2,2

I made reservations on Open Table and they have us a table at the far corner of the restaurant so we could observe the entire place and all four of us fit onto the wall seating of the table--cafe\/bistro style. 

We ordered the mussels as a light app--they were a bit small but perfect and slightly sweet. I had the steak frites--I ordered it medium rare but it came medium. It was yummy anyway and since it was my birthday I didn't make a peep to the waiter about it. It came with a mountain of french fries--very nice and 2 of my friends were munching with me.  YL ordered the trout which I thought was the best dish that any of us had ordered.  A whole trout filleted and quite tender, topped with some green beans and sliced roasted almonds. The combination was divine. 

The best was that after our meal the waiter presented me with a cake with a pink candle (I love pink!)  that said ""Happy Birthday"" and had my name on it!   It wasn't just a slice of cake for me, but a long elegant chocolate hazelnut cake for me and my friends!!!  It came from the bakery downstairs in the Venetian.

I really could gush all day about how wonderful an experience it was to dine at Bouchon. Start to finish it was a flawless meal. From service to location to the meal itself, I couldn't have been more satisfied.

To start, I must give a personal section of this review to our server Doug. Sir, you understand what people are looking for from waitstaff during their dining experience; calm, charming, attentive, and knowledgeable. All the right notes to leave a pair of ladies never feeling bothered or frustrated, and wishing they had more time to visit again. 

Next, location. Although I found Bouchon a bit difficult to find - had to ask for directions - I was very pleased with it's quiet location after arriving. Instead of being among the hussle and bussle of the rest of the The Venetian, Bouchon is tucked away from the traffic of The Grand Canal Shoppes and casino. The perfect location for my taste, especially if I'm visiting before my first cup of coffee. ;) 

Last, but far from least, the meal. Being that my mother and I visited during the brunch hours, we both partook in one of the hot beverages to start. I opted for my go-to latte, and my mother chose the hot chocolate. Both were perfectly heated and offered balanced chocolate to milk or espresso to milk ratios, in both our opinions. I definitely wouldn't mind starting more days with one of those lattes, for sure! For our entrees, my mother ordered the Belgian waffle and I ordered the special of rock shrimp hash. Sadly, she didn't give me one bite of waffle (so greedy!), but the hash was superb. The shrimp were sweet and abundant, the sauce was amazing sopped up with the toast points, and the potatoes were nicely crisped. Absolutely no complaints.

I'm so glad I got to experience Bouchon on my most recent visit to LV. The hype is truly an accurate portrayal of this gem of a restaurant.",2,0,3

I lived by this mantra for a very long time, but allowed myself to slide a little bit when I booked a table at Bouchon.  I'd been to Thomas Keller's slightly better known restaurant in California, and had been so completely blown away that I figured Bouchon should offer something damn good in its price range.

Not quite.  We had an attentive, polite, and gregarious waiter who made us feel very much at ease and gave enthusiastic recommendations.  There was nothing he could do to deter us from ordering the half lobster (which my friend wanted to try) and the foie gras (which after two outstanding experiences at FL was a must order for me) and he recommended the halibut entree also.

He warned us that the foie gras was large and a terrine rather than a single fried piece, and suggested we order not too much more.  I should have listened.  Somehow 5 oz of foie gras didn't strike me as a massive amount, but it was, as in enough for a table for six.  And not particularly good.  It tasted more like patee than the foie gras.  Serving a massive overpriced portion of mediocre food goes completely against what I understand TK's philosophy on food to be.  Keller says you should give customers not quite enough of something, so that they can enjoy just a taste of several things while remaining hungry for additional offerings.  But this was easily the least rich, least buttery foie gras (including terrine) I've ever had, and there was just way too much for two people.  In fact, there was enough that we gave the rest of it to the couple next to us, who dug into it with enthusiasm, and they still left more than a third of it by the time they were done.  Instead of making their best waiters hedge to the customers on the foie gras, they should just take it off the menu.

Anyway, the lobster was excellent albeit pricey, and was served with a buttery mustard sauce that was simply a perfect match.  This was by far the most successful savory dish that we tried.  Again we were reminded of the not-quite-top-quality dining experience by the amount of fighting required to extract the half lobster from its shell.  I'm not the world's slickest guy with a lobster cracker, but this got damn messy, as in almost for our neighbors too.

We also ordered the halibut on waiter's suggestion which had a nice texture but near zero flavor on its own.  Fortunately, it was served on top of some vegetables and a sauce that matched it nicely, and brought the flavor into detectable range.  

As for the complimentary bread and highly not-complimentary house blend of red wine, both were reasonably pleasant.  The bread didn't stack up very well in terms of flavor or freshness compared to what we'd enjoyed at Olives earlier that day.   Upon our request, they also brought out some locally carbonated water they made using that special Norwegian machine.  For fear of sounding like a yuppie @$$hole I usually don't go bonkers about water, but this water tasted particularly crisp, clean, and cool.  Is this psychological or is it actually better?

We finished with a wonderful creme brulee dessert which had the perfect level of sweetness and crispiness.  The top layer seemed thinner than usual, and this was a good thing.  Bravo.

Anyway, despite the heroic efforts of our waiter, Bouchon scored bigger failures (foie gras, halibut) than successes (water, creme brulee).   This is no tragedy, but given the $200 cost including two glasses of wine and tip it's tough to justify going back.  Mon Ami Gabi and Olives both had more knockout items at a substantially lower price.  TK, I believe in you!  Fix this!",2,1,1

Duck Confit- Texture, Crisp, and moisture of the duck was good. Flavor\/richness left something to be desired but not bad.

Salmon Rilette- Never had rilette before. It was just ok for me but i have nothing to compare against really...if ur a fan of pate you can try this

Salmon Tartare- This was very good. I think I was imagining bigger pieces of salmon for some reason but that shouldnt be the case as this is a French cuisine. I feel like the salmon portion was just ok but what really made up for it were the surrounding ingredients. Good nonetheless

Roasted Chicken- Waiter recommended the chicken and pretty much hyped it up that it was the best chicken ever. Maybe it was hyped up too much. Id say it was chicken definitely done right but i dont think it was the juiciest chicken ive ever had nor was it the most flavorful.

Croque Madame- I had to get this just for sheer uniqueness. This is basically just a glorified ham sandwich lol. Probably the best ham sandwich ive ever had but still at 19 bux i dunno. My recommendation is to get it just to try it but i wouldnt get it again.

Desserts were good but nothing amazing. I think I enjoyed the chocolate mousse the most. 

Service was good but a lil up\/down for me. For some reason before the entrees came, no one came to check up on us. I could have totally used another drink and by the entrees had come out maybe 10-15 mins later I had decided against it so if this is happening at all tables thats a lot of missed drink sales.

Lamb was cooked perfectly. It was tender and so buttery, and not gamy at all. Again, the sauce is rich and flavorful, but a bit too salty for me. The portion was a bit small. 

The white fish special (forgot the exact name of the dish): 
The fish is a bit dry at the edges but the center is cooked nicely. Sauce is good, but I wasn't super impressed. 

The brownie dessert special (forgot the name again): 
3 rich delicious brownie with hazelnut ice cream, mint ice cream and raspberry sorbet on top. The brownie was perfect with the warm gooey inside. The raspberry sorbet was very tart but I liked it. The ice cream was just OK. 

For wine I had their Merlot and it was very rich and smooth, loved it! I just wish I wrote down the name of the winery. 

Overall the experience was nice. Service was attentive, friendly and polite. However, with the final bill of $100\/person, I just wish there was something that was more memorable.",1,1,1

the bread is the most delicious baguette ever. same one they serve at the yountville location. so so good.

appetizer- seafood platter!!!! the oysters, lobster, etc. were TO DIE FOR. the sauces complemented the seafood beautifully and the seafood was so fresh it tasted sweeeet.

entrees- the trout with toasted almonds and green beans- DELICIOUS. the atlantic char I had at the yountville location was also the standout. I really think bouchon's seafood is their strong point.  per the waiter's suggestion we also got a chicken entree. it was good but nothing life changing.

dessert- again per the waiter's suggestion we ordered a lemon tart type ditty. it was meh. at the yountville location we ordered the caramel flan which was also meh. I think bouchon's desserts are definitely their weak points.

Can I just say, that the fries in Bouchon are ADDICTING and PERFECTION. Think of their fries as the bougie version of Mcdonalds' fries. A little more refined, less greasy and more expensive.

FOOD!
Escargot Dish with puff pastry: (4\/5) If you love snails like the French do (or if you're a Korean\/Chinese mix like me) then ORDER THIS DISH. It's so buttery and the puff pastry complements the soft texture of the escargot so well. I'm used to fishing out the meat from the shell with a little utensil but they already did the work for you. The only problem with this dish is that it can be too rich and buttery for some. 

Beignets with Nutella and marmalade: (3.5\/5) The doughnuts itself were a little too dry and bread-y for my liking, but the cinnamon sugar coating was delightful.

Ham and cheese crepe (4\/5) Soft, chewy and cooked to perfection. I can't say anything bad about this dish, but at the same time couldn't give it 5\/5 because it didn't amaze me.)

I've eaten at Bouchon in Vegas probably six times now; we stop in whenever the opportunity presents itself, most recently this spring.  

While I've had better cuts of meat, the steak here is seasoned in a remarkable way.  I was warned about the gnocchi being different, ordered them anyway, and liked the change of pace.  The stand-by's on the menu will always be there for you so take a listen to the specials because this is a Keller joint and it's truly going to be something of the moment.  I'm not an oyster aficionado so I can't speak with authority on the raw bar.  Go through all the courses -- I had a wee slice of lobster on a few mixed greens here that re-defined salad for me.  The macaroni and cheese is heaven in a cast iron miniature pot.  The pot du creme may be a little better than the chocolate mousse, but I think the flavor changes.  If you have a sweet tooth, do not be afraid or ashamed of having two desserts, preferably one with the house-made ice cream..  

Breakfast here may well be the most you'll ever spend for bacon and eggs and it's worth fighting through the hangover and waking up early for it.  The eggs florentine were to die for and do not skip the pastry.  Definitely sit outside while you sip your fresh OJ and coffee as it's probably the only non-recirculated air you'll be able to enjoy in Vegas.

I really like the look of the place; the zinc bar and the tiled floor has a certain charm to it, but it might be a little cliche.  I like the fact that you have to wind your way through the Venetian to find it; it's a hideaway that provides you a two hour respite from Vegas.  The dining room is open, though, and as such is crowded and noisy.  You're not going to have any intimacy here.

I have had both stellar and service that wasn't so much here, but at it's worst I wouldn't say it detracted from my enjoyment too much.

For breakfast I enjoyed the Croque Madame. Sounded neat, tasted phenomenally. Toasted ham and cheese on brioche. I can drink the Mornay sauce as if it was water to live.

I particularly enjoyed his influence on the Pixar Movie Ratatouille. However, after my early evening Bar meal at Bouchon, I was reminded of a Ronald Reagan quote when dealing with restaurant (or any other) hype - Trust, But Verify.

I was looking for something classy and far away from the hordes of the Venetian's Grand Canal. So I happily made my way up the Venezia Tower to this very handsomely appointed Bouchon French Bistro. Bistro of course is in the eye of beholder, but to me this place had a smart City feel. Contrast that to La Ferme in Genoa NV, that puts you in the French Countryside and with a Basque twist and a Servant's heart.

My service experience at Bouchon also reminded me of Paris in that it was at times distant, aloof, and even snarly. That's on top of my initial seating choice at one of the round tables behind the bar. I was simply ignored, until I figured that service only came at the Bar. Silly me, this simple peasant should have known!

I figured that Bouchon was not the kind of place that you paid big money to be insulted, so I hung in there.

However, I still wanted to try it out and I was indeed very pleased.  Our waiter was very kind and attentive and always made sure that we had a fresh cup of coffee\/water.

I went to Bouchon for brunch and my father and I started off by sharing an order of one of the seafood specials and boy were those oysters good.  Forgot what types there were, but there were at least 4 different types, all with a distinct flavor.  For the main course I had the omelette special of the day and my father had the french toast.  Both were quite tasty.  They also gave us complimentary epi baguettes from Bouchon Bakery, but I recall they weren't as good as the ones I ate in Yountville (it could be because these weren't fresh from the oven).

I have yet to visit the main restaurant in Yountville, but I'm hoping the food will be tastier there.  I guess I can see why this one wasn't given a Michelin star.  I wasn't blown away by the food like I have been by other 1 Michelin star restaurants.  Still though, Bouchon is definitely a great place for brunch.",0,0,0

For this visit, we decided to skip wine and just order cocktails.  My husband had the absinthe, which is served the traditional way with a spoon, water, ice and sugar.  I had the Bee's Knee's cocktail, which had gin, honey and UP.  Both were pretty potent.  

To start off our meal, we decided to get the foie gras terrine.  Although somewhat pricey at $50, this can easily serve 4 people (we decided to indulge ourselves this time).  And out of all the different preparations of foie gras I've tried at different restaurants, Bouchon's foie gras is easily my favorite because it's not seared and doesn't have a lot of other accompaniments.  The waitress suggested having Sauternes with the foie, and we had a glass each.  The one selected for us was waaay too sweet for us - even for a dessert wine.  

Main entrees were the lamb for him (only slightly gamey but was nice) and the short ribs for me.  The most delicious part of my meal was the deep fried marrow that came with my entree - so yummy!  We didn't have dessert this time because we were so stuffed, but I remember their profiteroles being pretty good.

We arrived around 1pm and, after about a five minute wait, were seated at a table across from the open patio door (the patio overlooks the pool of the Venetian's Venezia tower).

Our server was a really pleasant, helpful guy who was on top of things throughout the meal.  We received our menus and he asked if we wanted a drink to start.  I asked for a St-Germain cocktail (not on the menu, which had your standard mimosa\/bellini\/bloody mary brunch fare) and he was a little unsure of what it was, but seemed ready make sure I got what I wanted.  He gave us time to peruse our menus and shortly thereafter we received a visit from, what I assume was the restaurant's booze expert.  He was also unsure about what exactly a St-Germain was (which was a little surprising) but offered to whip up some drinks for us.  The conversation was a little awkward and he didn't seem to want to take my word for what was in a St-Germain, but we wound up with two different cocktails using the liquor and they were very good.

Anyway, I ordered some oysters, a very tasty sweet corn soup, the ouef and boudin blanc (which also comes with a croissant), and my boyfriend opted for the omelette o' the day.  Everything was very, very tasty.

We only had 40 minutes and the staff was super accommodating with our schedule, taking orders from 1\/2 of us who had to leave and bringing out the food quite quickly. My coffee took a big longer to arrive but they were hustling for the most part.

The place is just beautiful, bright and open with tall ceilings, and leading to the outdoor area of the Venetzia tower patio, it takes a trek to get there from any of the other Venetian towers, but after your first bite, the 15 minute maze-like walk through suites and visits to multiple elevators easily becomes worth it.

Strawberry croissant was THE pastry of the day and it lived up to the hype. i I figured...come on...a croissant is a croissant right ? Some butter and strawberries in a flakey crust. been there done that, many times over. Heck No. 

When this thing arrived, split in half lengthwise, topped with strawberries and jam and then some sort of crumbly top crust which had then been baked, it was an ooey gooey yummy mess of strawberries and flakiness with a sweet crumbly topping--reminded me a bit of strudel topping. Sweet cinnamony goodness. And that was just the pastry that came with my 'breakfast americaine'. 

It also came with eggs (whites for me), a huge container of pomme frites, brioche toast, sausage AND bacon, orange juice AND coffee. It was more food than even *I* could put away in one sitting.

This Bouchon location at The Venetian is open for breakfast Monday thru Friday, dinner nightly and brunch on the weekends.  I believe the Beverly Hills location is just open for lunch and dinner so it made sense to give this Vegas spot a try for a nice brunch.

Bouchon is located on the tenth floor of the hotel.  They seem to have three dining areas--a classic indoor brasserie, outdoor dining and a private room for private parties and larger groups (which is where we dined on this visit).  I haven't been to their outdoor dining area, but the private room lacks the classic French brasserie feel of the main dining area.  The tables though are still nice (white table cloth) and the seating is comfortable.

For brunch, they started us off with a complimentary epi baguette that was served with butter and a smooth\/thick cherry jam.  The epi baguette (a wheat stalk shaped bread where you rip off individual baguettes) was good.  The bread's crust was good and distinct while the center had a good chew to it.  The butter spread easily and the jam was flavorful.

I went with their signature roasted chicken and bacon and chive waffles.  The roasted chicken was very good.  It was a half chicken.  The breast was tender and moist.  The skin had a great flavor and was nicely crispy.  The thigh and leg had much more flavorful meat as well as crispy skin (not too greasy or fatty either).

They served the chicken with a Sauce Chasseur.  The chicken was very flavorful and did not need it, but the sauce was a great accompaniment.  The sauce was similar to a brown gravy and was very flavorful.  The sauce had a good white wine taste to it and there were chunks of good veggies in it including mushrooms, carrots and onions.

The bacon and chive waffle was fluffy.  It was an interesting flavor combination.  First, you taste the vanilla (they used a good amount of it in the waffle).  Then you get the crispy and savory bacon taste.  Then you get the onion-like chive taste.  The waffle was garnished with a creamy Tahitian vanilla butter and maple syrup.  I am not sure if the flavor combination would be for everyone, but I liked the waffle.

I also had some of the bacon a la carte and it was pretty good.  Flavorful and crisp though maybe not as good as some of the premium bacon out there (like the Niman Ranch bacon they serve at Huckleberry).

Service was good.  The waiter was friendly, polite and attentive.  The rest of the staff was attentive too.  Food came out an okay pace (maybe slightly slower than we would have liked).  Still, despite being a large party, all the food came out at about the same time.

For brunch, pricing was high here, but then pricing is high at a lot of Vegas restaurants.  Entrees run anywhere from about $15 to $25 here.  The good thing is that portions on most of the dishes are big enough that you do not have to supplement your order with any sides or pastries (they were providing a complimentary coffee cake-like dish in the waiting area and it was good).

This was my second visit to the Las Vegas Bouchon.  I've also been to the Beverly Hills one.  The roasted chicken and waffles was the best thing I've had here at either location and I would most likely come back here again for brunch if I was in Vegas for the weekend.  Service and food have been decent enough on both visits that I would also consider them for dinner.

There is a free parking structure at The Venetian.  The free parking structure has elevators that conveniently take you to the Bouchon restaurant without having to walk through the casino.",24,15,20

Full disclosure: I ate here three times during my 4-day vacation in Vegas. I'm not ashamed. Why would I eat anywhere else when I could have such great wine, food, ambiance and service right here?

Ambiance: Light, airy and oh-so French. Bouchon is next to the third-floor pool at the Venetian, so the din from the casino becomes a distant memory quickly. The evening crowd can be a bit see-and-be-seen, but that's also part of the charm! True to Vegas form, you can come here in full black tie or shorts\/flip-flops (or a mixture of the two!) and have a wonderful time. 

Service: Although the staff was well-dressed and informed, and the sommelier in particular was helpful and fun, don't come expecting the same finer points of service as you might at French Laundry or Per Se. Although they achieved a high level of service, we had a few moments (reaching across a diner to fill water glasses, etc.) that spoke to some inconsistencies. But hey, it's Vegas, and I was wearing shorts.

Food: Delicious! French brasserie food done right. Elegance! I was so taken by each dish that I had to try all the others! Particular stars of the meals (and remember, I had three here) were the Waffle with pineapple, the escargot, the French onion soup, and the trout almandine. My mom is still talking about the French onion soup. What is shocking is that the pricing is imminently reasonable, particularly in the context of the rest of Vegas! You're going to pay $15 a plate for breakfast or $25 for lunch at any restaurant in Vegas, so may as well make it something from Keller's kitchen. 

Drink: Wine list is French and very exciting. Pricing is to be expected for a high-end spot in Vegas, but there are definitely some values to be had. We enjoyed a Condrieu that is particularly difficult to find, and it was actually less than double retail pricing. Impressive. As mentioned before, the sommelier was extremely helpful.

From 5 stars to 1. I might give it 0 if I could. :-(
This is more about the service than the food.

Had lunch at Bouchon. What a train wreck. I'd indicated we were in a hurry and was told we should be able to order and eat in 30 minutes.
25 minutes later, the food came.
Salads. Minus the salad dressing.
Tiny little $16 salads.
I ask for the manager. He says he will personally make sure they are remade and wont take a half hour
He brings them back in about 10 minutes.
They now have dressing but they are missing cheese and avocado.
$40 comped meal and even being comped didn't make it any better.

Hopefully your mileage varies. Bouchon is capable of so much more.

Old review:
Every dish was exquisite and worthy of gasps of foodgasms. I thought i'd died and gone to foodie heaven.

Upon arrival, we were shown to a very nice table on the patio. After ordering our drinks, we were presented with a complimentary order of bread\/butter and warm pistachios. The bread was fresh and delicious, the butter was insanely creamy, and the pistachios were addictive. So it was a good start to the meal.

We decided to start with a couple of hors-d'oeuvres: Oeufs Mimosa (4 deviled eggs) and Fromage Blanc (served with grilled walnut bread). The former was certainly one of the best deviled eggs I've ever eaten (even if the mustard taste was a little too prominent) while the latter was pretty much mindblowing in its simplicity (the smooth, creamy cheese was served atop a fresh and thoroughly delicious hunk of walnut bread).

From there, I started with the Soupe à l'Oignon (caramelized sweet onions with beef jus, country bread & comté cheese). French Onion Soup is one of my most favorite things ever, so I had high, high hopes for this dish. And while it certainly looked the part, I must say I found it to be a crushing disappointment. Nothing here really worked: the cheese was one big clump, the bread was a soggy, tasteless mess, and the broth was overly thick and not especially flavorful. A shocking disaster, honestly.

Fortunately, the main fared much better. I went with the Truite Poêlée (sautéed Idaho rainbow trout with broccolini almondine). The presentation was pretty spectacular, and so was the taste. The fish was cooked perfectly in a rich, buttery sauce, and the accompanying broccolini and almonds worked exceptionally well. I was incredibly full before I took my first bite but I had to finish every single bit of the dish.

For the main entrée, the boeuf bourguigon - red wine braised short ribs with French round carrots, Tokyo turnips, pearl onions, bacon lardons, and fingerling potatoes - was savory and tender. The veggie accoutrements helped soak up some of the juicy goodness emanating from the beef.

My party ordered the: Croque Madame, Breakfast Americaine, and the Crab Gratin. All three were absolutely amazing. I found virtually everything that we had from the entrees to the brioche itself perfectly executed and fulfilling for my timmy too. The portions look small, but everything was very filling. The Breakfast Americaine is a bargain because you get: 2 eggs, sausage, bacon, brioche, a choice of pastry, juice and tea or coffee for $22. I enjoyed my Croque Madame so much. I'm picky when it comes to eggs and in all honesty, I hate fried eggs. A lot of times I just hate the taste of yolk on its own, I know, crazy, but I do. However, this Croque Madame was too good to be true! The Crab gratin was amazing! To have cheese, scrambled eggs on top, and truffle sauce, but still taste a strong crab flavor is amazing! There were small pieces of crab all over, but the small sizes were packed with flavor. So yummy, I'm salivating writing this review.

The kitchen also gave us some courtesy raspberry beignets which were divine! Nothing like biting into a beignet and seeing mouthful of raspberry jam ooze right out!

After scrambling around, we got there at 6:05pm to  find out the restaurant was rather empty. We sat down and had a beautiful view of the private Venezia pool for guests staying at their suites. 

Our waiter came and offered us a drink menu along with bread placed directly on the table. We didn't have plates for it... is that normal!? 

We ordered:

Salade Maraîchère au Chèvre Chaud - Shared a plate of this salad. It was pretty much a mixture of argula, herbs, red vinegrette, and a large chunk of goat cheese which I thoroughly enjoyed.

Moules au Safran et à la Moutarde - For $26, I got a laaarge basin of mussels steamed in white wine! It was delicious. I probably had over 30 mussels in a short span of 35 minutes (considering we had to RUSH dinner to catch our show at Cesar Palace). The trick is to take the fries and dip it into the mustard & saffron broth. Delizioso!!

Poulet Rôti - Our waiter recommended the roasted chicken since we were at a French restaurant. I had a bite and the chicken was tender. $29 was a steep price for chicken though.

The service was great. Our waiter was very helpful at choosing out my drink (a cocktail with gin and blueberries. Yum!) and our entrees.

This restaurant was opened by Thomas Keller, who founded the French Laundry in California's  Napa  Valley. He didn't go to school but bounced around from place to place, picking up knowledge as he went. By the time he got to Napa, he had a strong idea how he wanted the restaurant to be.

We were seated at a great table and were instantly welcomed by our waiter.  He was very friendly and helpful, helping us make several selections, and was always attentive but never overbearing. 

We selected a fabulous wine from their list and the half carafe turned out to be the perfect size.  At the conclusion of our meal I also ordered one of their cocktails- the Bridgette Bardot- which was phenomenal.  I was nervous it would be overly sweet but it had a perfect apple flavor, a real apple flavor, not a sickly sweet syrup.  I highly suggest it.

We started with the escargot in pastry puff that was soaked in oil and garlic.  It was one of their specials for that day so I'm not sure if it's always on the menu but if it is, I would highly recommend ordering it.  I ordered the gnocchi for dinner which was absolutely extraordinary.  The gnocchi is made differently from Italian style gnocchi, with no potato but instead pastry puff.  The portion was very generous and the combination with tomatoes, leeks, and goat cheese was perfect.  My husband ordered the slow-cooked lamb shoulder, also a special not on the menu, and couldn't believe how amazing it was.  The lamb literally fell apart with the touch of the fork and was perfectly seasoned and was complimented by the garlic risotto. The waiter informed us that Keller actually pioneered a new method of slow cooking that was so different that he and a few other chefs had to devise the health code regulations that govern the new method because there was no standard for it.  The waiter informed us that they always offer some special slow roasted dish - whether it be meat, vegetable or even fruit for dessert.  I would highly recommend getting whatever dish features this amazing technique.

For dessert we chose the beignets, which are cream filled fried dough pastries that came with chocolate ice cream and chocolate sauce.  They were the perfect way to finish off the meal.  My husband enjoyed a very good cappuccino and we both enjoyed the plate of mini cookies that they brought to us.

  Once you get beyond the hostesses looking down their noses and being disorganized, the service was great! Loved the wait staff. 

   After being seated at a great table, we were immediately greeted and asked about our drink order. I asked if they had regular black tea, was told yes and got a fruit flavor tea. No biggie, I still drank it. 

  I had a simple breakfast of smoked salmon & baguette. Can't really go wrong with this.. presentation was nice and everything was what I expected. 
   My friends ordered the quiche - said it was delicious, another eggs and hash, she said was good, and the other eggs with sausage. The sausage appeared homemade and she ate every bite of it. 

   Why I am not giving this a 5-star is the hostesses and the loud music. It was so loud it was very hard for the woman across from me to hear what I would say and vice-versa.  It was not that loud the other night at dinner, and when asked why it was so loud they said they do it because brunch is so crowded. Not the answer I would have expected.

They are two different menus so I will review both. For brunch we ordered one of the signature dishes chicken and waffle.  The chicken is not breaded nor fried, but nonetheless was unbelievable. The chicken was moist and full of flavor and was served alongside a gravy which was also excellent. I tasted the gravy, but it was wasted on me the chicken was so flavorful I didn't think it is as necessary. The waffles were very light and airy and made of sourdough bacons and chives served along side vanilla bean butter and syrup. It's a winning dish and a must have. Other dishes which were also great:

-Omelette with cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, sausage 
-Omelette with ham and cheddar cheese
-Bread pudding with pineapples and toasted marshmallows

All were excellent. I thought the bread pudding brioche was a take on French toast but it was more like a bread pudding dessert.

Stuff I crushed and wished I could have crushed more:  the petit plateau (seafood platter with oysters, clams, mussels, lobster) was fantastic. 

Stuff I crushed but may not crush again:  main course was not too impressive:  the lamb was great but the grilled polenta that came with was kinda tasteless -- it didn't add much to the dish other than to provide some visual contrast on the plate.  

Was running tight for a show, so didn't really have time to do dessert justice, but the raspberry cobbler was really good.  Service was on point.

When entering the restaurant, I felt like the host was looking down at us as if we were inferior and didn't have money. However, the other staff members were really friendly and helpful. There was a minor wait which didn't take too long and we were eventually seated.

It was Sunday during brunch time so we ordered a ""Croque Madame"" and the daily special of the day, ""Lobster Egg Benedict"". I love egg benedict and this was absolutely delicious! The mass amounts of fries on my friend's Croque Madame caught us by surprise. They literally put handfuls of fries on any dish that contains fries. I'm not saying that's a bad thing but my friend was too full to finish it all. My friend originally wanted the fried chicken and waffles but they ran out of it! We were sad and even more depressed when we saw the table next to us have one of the few last ones. Another thing that caught me by surprise was the bread they handed out. It was shaped like a weapon used in ancient times. In addition, they lay the bread in the middle of the table with no plates to eat it with. I was carefully eating the bread without leaving crumbs all over the place. For a somewhat fancy place, I would've expected small bread plates at least.

Service was average and can be a little better but I still tipped the waiter good. I can't justify tipping low unless the service was super bad.

Food:
I was starving, so I ordered two meals: (1) French toast and (2) eggs, potatoes, and sausage.

All of the food was great, although the potatoes were a little too greasy for me!

The French toast, extremely rich, was just enough for me. I hurt myself eating the eggs, potatoes, and sausage.

I was more impressed with the French toast, since I think I can cook decent eggs, potatoes, and sausage on my own. The four stars is really for the french toast; good stuff!

Ambiance:
If it's not super hot outside, I recommend you sit outside. The restaurant is situated by the pool; ambiance is impeccable.

Friends got the french toast (which is supposed to be their signature) wasn't that great. It looked like dessert!!!! It was super sweet and just doused in sugar that it was almost inedible. Why would you ruin french toast and construct it to be like a dessert cake? 

I got a side of bacon with my omelette which is the only good thing about the meal because they piled the bacon on. The side of toast was good too, very eggy in flavor. But I don't think I'll be back, it wasn't worth going to just to have mediocre brunch.",2,0,0

We shared Classic Beignets, she ordered the Eggs Benedict special (artichoke hearts, heirlooms tomatoes and other veggies), and I got the chicken and waffles. We also each ordered mimosas!

Okay, the food was awesome. I want to eat those beignets every. single. day. for the rest of my life. Seriously. They come with nutella and homemade jam! How can you go wrong?? They're also the lightest and fluffiest beignets I've ever eaten. FIVE STARS for those!

Special Benedict: I only tried a bite, but the bite I did have was awesome. perfectly creamy sun-dried tomato hollandaise! Also, the potatoes that came with her dish were awesome. Not sure what they were called, but they were cubed and looked\/tasted deep-fried. :D 4 STARS! She also ordered a side of bacon, which was generous, and TASTY, though can you really go wrong with bacon?

Chicken and Waffles: omg. HOW do they keep that chicken so moist and tender and delicious?! Best roasted chicken ever. The waffles were good, but for having bacon and chives inside, were a little light in the flavor department. Doesn't matter though, because the gravy that's served with the dish (alongside your typical maple syrup, which I passed on) is AMAZING. Rich but tart, with pieces of fatty meat (I'm thinking pork belly?) and little chunks of indiscernible veggies. Incredible flavor. 5 STARS, easy.

Mimosas were 12.50 each, which I thought was steep, but I guess that's Vegas for you! No stars off for this, but I'll pass on the mimosas next time.

As for ambiance, it could have been a teeny bit better. We were seated outside (no one asked if we wanted to or not), and while I LOVE dining al fresco, sweet baby jesus, THIS IS VEGAS. THE DESERT. How can you seat people outside when it's 100 degrees out?! No outdoor fans\/misters either, just umbrellas and the shade of the hotel. 1 star off for this.

First course - Corn Soup + Salad. I had the corn soup and I must admit it looked like a full bowl of mustard. Let me just say - it was quite simply AMAZING!!!!!! There was not one person in the house that didn't love it.

-the chicken was super tender and the sauce complimented well
-the lamb was pretty good and amazing ! Texture was just perfect 
-foie Gras in a jar was good it was tasty and paired well with the slight salt .... but I actually really liked it with jam it off setted some of the saltiness

As for food, here are my 2 cents.

- Garlic sausage appetizer: Amazing!  Tender and savory.
-Chicken & waffles: The roasted chicken compared to your usual fried chicken gave it a more sweet taste so when you add the maple syrup & waffle, it was a little too sweet.  Waffles were good on their own since they had little pieces of bacon & chives.
-Quiche du jour: Thick & fluffy egg custard.  Delish!

One odd little note: while the frites are pretty good, my husband read an article recently (1\/09) that Keller buys frozen fries, that making so many of them uniformly would be nearly impossible. This surprised us. Food snobs, even snobbier than us (Anthony Bourdain, for example), revere Keller for his simple, fresh ingredients.

This place is pretty big and has plenty of wonderful lighting coming from outside with some windows having the view of the Venetian gardens. During our wait we decided to go roam around and check out the beautiful pool and hot tubs in this area.

FOOD:
*French toast $12- I love that this french toast wasn't like your typical french toast slices. This stack is bread pudding style with some sweet apples layered in it along with some custard. The french toast was soft with just the right amount of sweetness.


*Pastry Basket $13- Beignet, apple crisp, almond and chocolate and muffin. The beignet was alright (I've had better.. ahem disneyland ahem). It was a little on the tougher side rather than being soft and fluffy. The apple crisp was good but it didn't blow me a way. I wish it was a bit sweeter. The muffin was probably one of the bestest muffins I've ever had haha. The almond and chocolate pastry though, amazing!! Totally loved it. The roasted almonds, just enough chocolate hints in the delicious pastry to make me swoon. 

*Coffee: not as bold as I would like it but it was refilled a good amount of times by our server. 

Would love to go back and try out their omelette or maybe even their croque madame which is a grilled ham, egg and cheese sandwich. 

The reason why I deducted a star was the service. Although our server was on top of our order, I felt like they were a bit distant and not as friendly as I would think they should be during our brunch, she was extra nice to the table next to us though which made me feel like she didn't value us as much.

We decided to come here on Valentine's Day. Since this was our first time, we didn't know that we had to take another set of elevators from the parking garage up. Luckily we asked someone fairly quickly and we were able to find this place. I was pretty impressed with the decor when we walked in.

I wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't know who Thomas Keller was except for the fact that he had a Bouchon in Napa Valley too. We decided to start with Rillettes aux Deux Saumons. Smoked salmon and fresh salmon in a cute lil jar to spread on crunchy bread. This was delicious and a good way to start off our meal. After going back and forth between the special and the trout, I decided to go with the trout (Truite Grenobloise). It normally comes with the head attached, but I requested for the head to not be there. I wasn't a big fan of the toasted brioche, but overall the fish was tender, moist and just a tad bit too buttery for my liking. The fiancé ordered the Gigot d'Agneau (lamb with lamb tongue). His lamb was a overcooked, which made it a lil tougher to eat. The tongue you couldn't even tell it was in the sauce, but it comes with beans and we are both not a huge fan of beans. For a side dish, we ordered the Mac and Cheese which was nothing special.

Overall, I thought our bill was fairly reasonable, less than 150 bucks for 2 drinks, an appetizer, two entrees and a side dish, but I wish the food was better. Maybe we will come some other time and try other dishes....",4,2,1

The waiter brought us warm, crunchy epi bread. Slather some butter and fruit preserve (with real cherry? plum?) and your day is already that much better.

Coffee was dark and strong, so much that it created a pleasant head buzz. 

The roasted chicken was moist. The accompanying gravy was very flavorful and chock full of mushroom and meat bits. The vanilla bean butter was heavenly. The three pronged flavor attack of vanilla bean butter, gravy, and rich maple syrup almost made my head - and heart - explode. I only wish that my slight hangover hadn't prevented me from fully enjoying and engaging in this meal. 

The waffles had a great brunch and were very light. The potatoes were golden from every angle. They were very well cooked - firm, starch intact, glistening.

Croque madame was the best dish. Next time, I'll definitely order this one, especially since I crave eggs on hazy Sunday mornings. Layers of ham giving way to a slightly crispy brioche, topped with a lovely egg? This may now replace fried chicken as my pick for Last Meal On Earth, should I ever find myself waiting on the executioner's block.

It's been quite a while since I've been here... Waaaay back when Olivier(Baguette Cafe) was still the manager here. 2005 B.Y.(Before Yelp) to be exact. A bunch of us came out to celebrate Terri R.'s birthday, and what a great time it was!

I've only dined here for lunch and dinner, so I was excited to dine here for Sunday Brunch because breakfast\/brunch is my favorite meal time. What I like about brunch is that you have both sweet and savory options available and the menu selections here did not disappoint! We started with a pastry assortment of a Blueberry Streusel Muffin, Apple Danish, Almond Croissant, and Pecan Sticky Bun. Each one had its own distinct flavor and was very good.

I must add that our waiter Homero was a SUPERSTAR from beginning to end! The service provided by him and his team of runners and busers added to our stellar dining experience. Everyone's entrees looked delicious, and I went for the Corned Beef Hash which came with two eggs and brioche toast. Wifey got the popular Croque Madame which has been on the menu since day one(I helped open the flagship location in Yountville) the taste was the same, but I think the brioche slices have gotten thinner.
My Corned Beef hash was delicious and a very generous portion too. A very good choice if you choose to dine here for brunch.

 Towards the end of our meal, we were also surprised to see that checks were split(we had a party of 15) and no auto-gratuity wasn't on the bill which is totally unheard of these days, especially on the strip, I just hate auto-grat period, and we've all dealt the calculating BS when a restaurant doesn't honor split checks when it should be part of their job...no headaches on this day, and it was done with no problem.

I've eaten at quite a few high end restaurants, but Bouchon stands out as having some of the tastiest food I've ever eaten.  We had a reservation for six people and were seated within minutes of arrival.

We started the meal out with cocktails -- if you haven't maxed out on free casino drinks, I would definitely recommend ordering one here, as they have exceptional bartenders.  I had a sazerac on the recommendation of the waiter, and was very pleased.  We also ordered the foie gras appetizer, which was AMAZING.  It was incredibly creamy, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness, and the portion was very generous: it comes in a five oz glass jar, and even with six gluttons eating it, it was more than enough.  A must-order if you have four or more members of your party (and surprisingly thrifty!).  We also split a small order of gnocci, which is not your typical Italian potato dumpling. This gnocci was flour-based, and fried in butter.  It was incredibly rich, so I definitely would advise against ordering it as a main dish; however, as an appetizer it was nice to try.

I split a mixed greens salad with my boyfriend, and this was the only low point in the meal.  By the way, the waiter did the sneaky business of asking ""And what salad would you like with that?"" as you ordered your entree, making you feel semi-awkward if you didn't order one.  I would definitely skip the salads: at around $10 a pop, they are not very tasty.  Our mixed greens salad had a very very sour vinaigrette that made eating the dish rather unpleasant.  The accompanying medallion of goat cheese was so-so, and was too overpowering.  Other people at our table ordered the beet salad which was very pretty, but lacking in flavor.

However, the main course more than made up for the subpar salads.  I ordered the lamb, and it was incredibly tender and flavorful.  It came on a bed of peas and mini tokyo turnips, which were not only cute but delicious.  The lamb was quite gamey, but since I'm a fan of that, it didn't bother me.  After finishing our entrees, we were far too full to think of dessert -- but if I ever came back here again, I would skip the salad and get a dessert instead.

Overall, the total bill came to about $70 a person (one cocktail, split small gnocci and foie gras 6 ways, half a salad, one entree, plus tax and tip). Despite the salad being only okay, I left very satisfied with the food, the service, and the restaurant in general.  I would absolutely recommend this place as a splurge during your next Vegas adventure!",1,0,1

I had the smoked salmon plate for breakfast.  It's just a plate with good-quality smoked salmon (lox-style), tomatoes, raw onion, capers, a small baguette and cream cheese.  But the baguette was so good that the little sandwich that I made from this plate was out of this world!  I can't believe that I'm gushing about the bread, but it really did make that much of a difference.  My wife had their french toast, comprising cylindrical layers of french toast, maple syrup, apples, and just general goodness.  With a side of good quality ham (not too salty), this was also a great treat.  Sit outside in the patio area near the pool and enjoy the quiet side of Las Vegas in the morning.

Dinner was also pretty good.  I had the steak frites, which came with grass-fed steak (yes, one can taste the difference -- grass-fed is slightly gamey, while grain-fed is not).  The meat tasted good, but they added this weird fried onion and a pat of butter, which seemed a bit like gilding the lily.  The fries were pretty good, too, but the waiter talked them up a bit too much (I've actually had better fries -- at the Bread Line in Washington, D.C.).  As for dessert, we had beignets.  They were good, but didn't really send me over the moon.

First off, the cute baguette and butter\/jam. Fresh and crunchy and soft and warm and that butter was amazing.

My TRUITE GRENOBLOISE (pan-roasted trout w\/cauliflower florets, sultanas, toasted brioche, truffle cauliflower puree) was devastatingly flavorful and perfectly cooked.

The restaurant is tucked away on the 10th floor of the Venetian, so unlike most Vegas hotel restaurants, it has huge windows and is away from the craziness.

Only negatives was that the trout came with a lot of bones and we had to wait 30 mins for Saturday brunch for a table.. and I would have happily sat at one of the many empty hightops if I was told that was an option. They're well-staffed but not very friendly.",0,0,0

We flew into Vegas, our flight was delayed, we called and easily changed our dinner reservations (we were at 2nd seating). Our service was professional and non-hurried. We had a great leisurely meal. The Cod Beignets were fantastic! The Atlantic Fluke with lobster Hollindaise was really delicious.

The best part was when they found out it was my hubby's bday, they brought out some profiteroles with a candle and just very classily left if and wished him a Happy Birthday. Additionally, my hubby wanted to take home a menu, they not only gave it to us (it is only just paper) but sealed it one of those postcards they seal your wine label in. 

Great service, great food.

Only complaint - pain in the ass to find inside the Venetian hotel. You definitely need to know where you are going (it is not located on ""restaurant row"") and when we asked several people who worked for the Venetian where it was located, we got mixed and poor directions. Bouchon has a separate elevator, off the parking structure, I believe it is on the 10th floor, and allow about 10-15 min to find it if you walk through the Venetians main doors.",3,0,1

Appetizers (9 out of 10) - had an endive salad with toasted walnuts and roquefort which was straight forward but well presented and very fresh.  The half dozen oysters were small, but very sweet.  The cocktail sauce and mignonette sauce were just OK.  The star of the appetizers was the marinated beet salad.  Yellow and red beets stacked with some mozarella cheese.  It was the special appetizer of the evening and it was awesome.

Entrees (7 out of 10) - I had the leg of lamb and my friend had the duck breast.  The lamb was well cooked with a nice sauce on a bed of arugula.  Parts of the meat were a little tough.  The duck which I tried had a nice glaze and that layer of fat just under the skin that adds a ton of flavor.  I guess expectations were pretty high since it's Thomas Keller, so maybe the rating would be higher if I didn't know it was him.

Desserts (10 out of 10) - Phenomenal dark chocolate mousse and they threw in a ""chocolate dome"" filled with hazelnut ice cream.  These were both insane.  The table next to us had fresh profiteroles with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce that looked great too.  There really were too many to choose from here.

Overall I'd give it an 8 to 8.5

One thing that turned me off is that I called the number listed on this Yelp listing to make a reservation for Bouchon Restaurant. To my dismay, the person that answered the phone said I had dialed Bouchon Bakery and could not help me whatsoever. I kindly asked her if she could redirect me to Bouchon Restaurant but she immediately snapped at me and said she could not help at all. Being the passive aggressive person I am, I was shocked at how caddy she responded to me and told her to have a ""nice rest of the day"" even though I wanted her to experience the exact opposite. A bit of a bad experience to start off the night, but I ended up making a reservation just fine.

Going into the actual review of the restaurant, I can say it was an average experience. Coming from a immigrant Taiwanese family, my parents and I aren't too accustomed with the palate of authentic French cuisine. Unfamiliar with the menu, my parents were initially confused with what to order, but the waiter was more than willing to help explain the nuances of each dish.

My father ended up ordering the Leg of Lamb, my mother ended up ordering the Salmon and I ordered the Steak with Fries. Each of our dishes were accompanied with a French Onion soup.

Our dishes came out fairly quickly, and my mom was ecstatic to try the French Onion soup (one of her favorite French dishes). Her first reaction was ""Wow this is really salty."" My father followed suit. Maybe it's the fact that both of my parents suffer some sort of Heart Disease or High Cholesterol that they are so sensitive to high sodium dishes. It got so bad for my mom that she had to add her glass of water to the soup to assuage the sodium. A bit embarrassing, but that's the length some people go...

Each of our main entrees were fairly good. My father's Lamb was tender and full of flavor. My Steak was a bit on the salty side, but literally melted in my mouth and was cooked to the PERFECT medium rare. My mother's Salmon was so-so. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, my family loved the texture of the Salmon (along with the color). The only turn off was the saltiness of the capers. Considering that most French meals are supposed to be accompanied with wine, I totally understand the sodium level of their dishes. But WOW, I don't usually complain about salt, but those capers were extremely salty.

Aside from all of that, Bouchon Restaurant was an enjoyable experience. The staff was super helpful and constantly refilled our water (a problem I constantly face with other restaurants). Although this restaurant may not fit my family's palate, the management of this establishment is superb. I would give them 4 stars, but the experience I had with the lady from Bouchon Bakery will always leave a stale taste in my mouth.",0,0,0

My skate was bland, albeit too salty, and seenmed soggy in the center but dry on the outside.  I ordered the potato puree side which could have used MORE seasoning as it was very bland.   As I mentioned, my husband's steak was way way too salty and, frankly, the cut of meat was not good.  

We did order a pork & shiitake mushroom appetizer which was actually very good so I was surprised with the poor quality of our entrees.

We went for dinner, and my boyfriend got the eye of the ribeye, and I got the lamb. Now keep in mind that when you order these items, you're getting a small portion. To be exact, you're getting about five slices of meat atop some type of delicious bed of vegetables.

My lamb was a little raw. I ordered it medium and it came out rare. It was still very good though, and my boyfriend ate the more rare pieces. He loved his ribeye and loved the bean mixture that came with mine.

For dessert we got the Bouchons, which were brownies topped with three types of homemade icecream: coffee, mango and peanut butter. It was deeeeeelicious.

Looking over the menu online before I visit, I was fairly surprised at how affordable most of the items were (for Vegas standard). 

We ordered quite a few appetizers - the grand plateau, (waiter recommended) crispy pork belly, and a creamy lentil soup. The grand plateau was exactly what I expected, FRESH, quality seafood from different parts of the country. The sauces that they paired with was interesting. If you like raw seafood, I would highly recommend this. The crispy pork belly -WOW, just WOW. Let's just say this, I put a piece of it in my mouth and my only reaction was to close my eyes and smile. I don't use this term very often, but the pork belly was definitely ""slap your mother good"".  I am not usually a fan of lentil soup, but the reason why I ordered it was because it was served with a horseradish maple bacon creme fraiche. The soup was alright (but then again I've never really been a fan of lentil soup). The creme fraiche, as I suspected, brought this dish to a whole other level. The texture of the lentils and the flavor of the bacon was definitely enhanced by the hint of horseradish. For a guy that has never liked lentil soup, I definitely ate a lot of it.

For entree, I got the steak frites just because Anthony Bourdain raved that these were the ""best fries EVER"" on his show on the Travel Channel. Were they the best fries ever?? I don't know about ever, but they were pretty good but it wasn't mind blowing like I expected it to be. The fries are similar to the *perfect* McDonald's fries (I love Micky D fries), but not to soggy ones. The whole batch was crispy and well... perfect. I guess I just don't really know where the ""best fries ever"" are... In the end, it's just french fries... The steak was cooked perfectly to order. Meat was tender. Seasoning was spot on.

I had the profiteroles for dessert. It was pretty cool that the waiter actually poured the chocolate sauce in front of you. The dessert tasted awesome.

The service was great. Waiter had a lot of suggestions and was friendly. Everything was served in a timely matter. Bouchon Bistro is a must if you're in Vegas.",4,2,4

I have been DYING to eat at a Thomas Keller and I had waited a long time.  Unfortunately, the good things never came.

The place has the feel of a true French bistro, except that it is huge.  The hostesses have the l'attitude parisienne down cold.  The service staff are very good, except for the trainee who dropped everything he brought to tables around us, pistachios, knives, plates.. etc.  You get the picture.  Back to the hostesses.  One came by our table every 15 minutes with a clipboard, a pad and a pen to check where everyone was in their meals.  I understand the workings of a restaurant and the need to know what tables are close to being finished so you can project your seating.  But there is something VERY offsetting with a clipboard hovering over your table taking notes.  I would have preferred someone with some discretion.

NOW all these things would not be a huge deal if I wasn't at a KELLER restaurant.  I honestly expected to be WOW'd and I wasn't.  So I was super hyped for the food, I thought for sure that would put all this to rest.  And yet I was disappointed again.  Yes the food is good, but nothing to really bring attention too.  The escargot was palatable, the puff pastry on top very floury, so I had to push those aside and only have the escargot.  I have had better in small non notable cafes.  My husband's steak was just ok, and the truffle fries were horrible.

I am so sad as I write this review.  I was positive that THE Keller would have a lock down on the French experience and then some, but since this is the only restaurant of his I have been to, I am greatly disappointed.

It is too pricey to put out just good French food.",4,1,1

My friends and I had made reservations for 6:30pm on a Sunday night so the place was pretty empty. We were seated after about 5 minutes of waiting, which still surprised me I guess since we had already reserved a table.

The decor and ambiance of the place is very appropriate; dimly lit and nice chairs\/booths.

The menus surprised me a bit: they were made out of tissue paper and were used to wrap the napkins. Is that typical for a really nice restaurant? 

After ordering, we were given bread, which was plopped straight onto the table along with some butter and pistachios. I thought that was a bit awkward. We also had no bread plates. I guess Bouchon can't afford enough plates? 

After a bit, we were also served some marinated olives, which confused us a bit since we didn't order any olives. They turned out to be really salty and I only ended up spitting one out after trying it.

The wait for food wasn't too bad and our orders all came out at once. I had ordered the leg of lamb (about $33). The portions aren't especially big but it filled me up. The lamb was very good and flavorful and it definitely ended all too quickly. The thing that looked the most appetizing of all my friends was the chicken, which had a much bigger portion than the other dishes and smelled delicious.

For dessert, everyone had ordered one of everything on the menu (caramel custard, lemon tart, chocolate mousse, meringue, and chocolate bouchons) and we went around tasting all the desserts. Overall, all the desserts were really good.

We were having a pretty good experience until the bill came and it turns out that those olives they served us were not complimentary. Somehow they ended up serving us olives (which we did not order) and charged us for it. We told our waiter and he was very apologetic and immediately took it off our bill.

Other than that mishap, I would say overall I had an OK experience at Bouchon. The waiters were nice, the decor was nice, and the food was nice. But with all the little details that were missed, Bouchon did not wow me, especially for a Thomas Keller restaurant and for the price we paid.",0,0,0

They drop off fresh French bread to your table that is served with butter and homemade jam.  I am not a fan of jam, but my boyfriend couldn't get enough of it.  I was already sold on this place drinking fresh squeezed OJ and eating the bread.


My boyfriend had the Breakfast Americaine, and I ordered the chicken and waffles.

This is no Roscoe's chicken and waffles; it's MUCH MUCH better.

The chicken was roasted and came with a delicious sauce.  The waffles had bacon and chives, which sounded questionable, but totally worked with this dish.  It was accompanied by warm maple syrup and Tahitian vanilla butter.  YUMMMMMMMMMMM

We started off with a salad it was decent but it was a heirloom tomato salad. They dont joke around with the tomatoes because it had some big ones in there. 

As for entrees the best one was the day boat scallops. It was so tender and not at all overcooked. It also didn't smell like the ocean so that was good. My other sister tried the steak, she said it was decent but not the best steak ever. I opted for the fish of the day, i forgot what it was, But i can say it was pretty decent. There was a good amount of flavor but its not as if i wouldnt be able to make it at home. 

The most disappointing part was dessert. The server said it was a apple tartine on a puff pastry. WRONG, when we got it, it was an apple tartine on a shortbread.

The waiter brought over the pastries first, and explained what each one was. They gave us a sweet and savory selection, which was really nice. Both were spectacular. Another item on the menu I highly recommend are the donuts. They are covered in cinnamon sugar and served with berry compote, vanilla, and chocolate sauces. A little decadent for breakfast but for brunch, I'd order 6!

The salmon (don't really remember the name), but it comes in a jar and it has been preserved and was served with toasted baguettes. This was the highlight of the evening. It was super different and mild but with the smoky after taste. Absolutely wonderful.

My bf's trout was just wayyyyyy too buttery! the first bite was super but a couple bites after that pretty much went down hill. It was so rich that it made me and my bf sick to our stomach. Really hard to get it down.

My pork chop was good but the pork was a little tough and I've definitely had better pork chop. NOPA in SF gets it right when it comes to pork chop.

Service was seriously lacking. The waiter was friendly - OVERLY friendly. It is taking it too far when we asked for a different table (we were the third party in the entire restaurant: yeah it was empty at 7 PM on a Saturday night) after they sat us at a very small and uncomfortable table near the bus station. The waiter then played games with us and sat at our table and pretended he was a patron and we were the waitstaff?! okay...we have humor but he took it too far. He realized it I think and he did apologize later in the evening.

We ordered. The soup was worthy of 5 stars - pear and fennel. 
The cheese course arrived at the same time as the soup?! wrong... and we ordered three cheeses and got two. hmmm... problem. 

We then had the arancini - delish. Then our entrees. Since when do you have to cut short ribs with a knife?! never... until Bouchon. My husband had to pull out all the utensils and they were not that great. We are short rib aficionados - I seriously questioned if they were short ribs or some other cut. Flavor was okay not great. 

My lamb was amazing though - they said it was leg and neck with barley. No. it was probably a tenderloin broiled medium rare and sliced - served over barley that was cooked ( braised) in lamb broth with the neck bones that were removed and served with shredded meat. Lambness clearly came through. Loved it.

I came here starving and psyched for pastries. My usual ""everything is awesome"" standards were as low as they get, and I was just selectively impressed at best.

The good: nice location, great beer on tap, IF THE FRENCH TOAST WAS A RELIGION I WOULD CONVERT. There was ""a lot"" of service, but they weren't as prompt as I would've hoped and forgot my beer list. They did scrape the crumbs off our table, which I guess was a nice touch. The mixed drink we ordered was also exceptional. 

The ""bad"": most of these things weren't terrible, just completely out of place at a restaurant of this caliber: The bread. The bread was tough, unflavorful and overall mediocre. And by this I mean the Baguette, the Croissant, and even the Beignets aren't the best I've had. I expected to be awed by the bakery confections and I was not.

But there were plenty of service missteps, awkward moments, and food fumbles... not exactly the kind of memorable meal I expect from a Thomas Keller establishment. 

Our waiter was sweet, but not ready for prime time. As C said: ""He has the raw skills to be a great waiter, but he's not there yet."" Awkward check-ins, stammering recitations of the specials, and a rather graceless handling of a bar mistake... plus one outright ""WHA?"" moment, when he described ""soubise"" to the couple next to us as ""kind of like a risotto."" Um, ah-no.

The space suffers from a lack of coziness. I know, I know... it's Vegas, but the high ceilings feel less like the Grand Hotel and more like the Grand Canyon. On the positive side the decor is cute without dipping into cliche, and the host staff and managers were right on top of things, both as we arrived and as we departed.

The food, alas, was similarly hit and miss. After placing our order, shatteringly good bread and a welcome bowl of pistachios accompanied our drinks, a signature Bouchon cocktail for me (slightly overdone on the peach liqueur for my taste -- but hey, it's their recipe) and a glass of Sancerre for Mr. C.

Moving into the appetizers, C's onion soup came out of the kitchen terribly undersalted (and, of course, no salt on the table meant he had to ask our gawky waiter to bring some). My frisee salad was top notch -- perfect egg, lovely lardons -- but slightly overdressed. 

We both opted for nightly specials for our main course. C's dayboat scallops were perfectly seared, served in a creamy but not too heavy sauce gilded with tender pieces of crab, and accomplanied by a light-as-air potato gratin. (Sounds impossible, I know... but true.) My pave de veau featured meltingly tender veal breast, assembeled into a cube and crisped up with panko bread crumbs. Underneath: Lovely roasted brussels sprouts, a slightly overpowering soubise (an onion-infused Bechamel sauce not at all like a risotto, thanks), and slightly odd but definitely tasty chestnut ""pain perdu"" sticks on top of the stack.

For dessert, we chose after-dinner drinks and an order of beignets to share. The pastries themselves were cold and leaden, like they'd been made well ahead or service, and their cream filling turned out pasty and too heavy. An unbilled scoop of chocolate ice cream was the dessert's saving grace. 

Our waiter stopped back after our dessert arrived to let us know it would be a few minutes before the bar could serve my requested glass of Poire Williams, as they needed to get a bottle from storage. I didn't mind the delay, but his fumbling and stumbling around the whole episode left me more annoyed than the actual missing drink.

I know how tough it is to make a reservation there. For now, I just have to wait and find a very special occasion for that.
  Apparently, during a week-end rendezvous with my family in Las Vegas- Venetian, a fine looking Resto near the hotel's lift caught my eyes. Little did I know that it's proprietor is D' Chef Keller, my role model, per se.
  Enthusiastically, called in Bouchon and made a reservation and tried it for Brunch. I believed this place really gets packed during lunch. Perhaps, it got something to do with the Menu prices compared to their Dinner Menu that could cost you I would say an average of $70plus pp w\/o wine and the full enjoyment of a full classic French Course.
  The place for me looks very conventional, not too much frills. It has its own character of simplicity especially the way the dining tables are being draped with white paper linen, maybe only during lunch, I hope.
  As far as my food reviews:
- Beignets du jour (2 pcs. mini Raspberry doughnuts)
- Florentine Quiche (classic French Tart with savory custard filling)
- Chicken Waffles (Roasted chicken, bacon and chive waffle, Tahitian 
       vanilla bean butter & sauce Chasseur)
- Steak Frites (pan seared prime flat iron served with maitre d'hotel butter

Honestly, I wasn't really thrilled on my menu selections because I did not  
 get a chance to challenge my palate for a real epicurean treat but I was thinking of my 14 month old grandbaby girl's appetite and not mine. It was indeed a dazzling treat for my picky eater baby. She loves the steak and I can tell why. It was perfectly cooked medium and seasoned well. It was a simple food that is carefully prepared. In France this would be called ""la cuisine grand mere"".

poulet roti:   the cabbage and mushrooms that came with the chicken were excellent.  I love mushrooms and these ones were super flavorful and it was a nice balance with the cabbage.  Chicken was okay.. not the best chicken i've had but it was tender and cooked well.   I personally think the chicken at costco is good so maybe I wouldn't be the best critic of chicken entrees ;)

homemade ice cream atop brownies:  mmm mmm good.   Although the brownies tasted like the packaged brownies that I can make at home.  The ice cream was very rich and delicious.  nice presentation.

foie gras:  i didn't order this but friends did and they seemed to enjoy it.  be forewarned though that it is a huge portion - 5 oz!  the salmon appetizer is similar.   Both tasted pretty good and came with toasted bread that was fresh.

BUT they charged me for the rabbit dish! So essentially I paid like $40 for 6 strands of plain fettuccine pasta, minus ANY sauce. And instead of steamed veggies on the side, they gave me steamed FRUIT. Yes, really. Steamed apples, pumpkin...it was disgusting. I specifically asked for steamed veggies like asparagus, broccoli, spinach etc bc I'm pregnant & need my daily greens. The server said ok, and brought out soggy fruit without any explanation or apology.

When I asked for a variation on some other dish (can't remember which one...sorry I've got pregnancy brain), I was given the same unappetizing response: sorry our food is pre-made, all we do is heat it up when you order it. Jeez, for $40 an entree I'd like more than a microwaved meal please. Other meat-eating patrons were very turned off by this information.

We started off with 3 orders of the chocolate dusted beignets, that arrived freshly fried to order with a side of two sauces: nutella and a rasberry jam. Fantastic. Fresh and airy, lightly dusted, and with sweet sauces (save the sauces for the bread you'll get later). Which by, the way, is also very good. 

We also ordered a variety of fresh baked goods. i went with the cheese danish (which was a little thicker than I was used to, but still fantastic with creamy cheese in the center), we also had the sticky buns, which was just ridiculously good. Not too dry, not too sweet, perfectly sticky.

Our table ordered a variety which included the Sourdough Waffles with Strawberry, the French Toast (signature dish), the chicken and waffles (with bacon infused batter, which basically tastes like cocaine), and the tuna salad sandwich. Everything was served with decent portions, well executed, clean, and very tasty. I found the sourdough waffles to be light and airy, served with strawberries that were sweet but with that hint of tart, so good that i didn't even have to put syrup on my waffles!

Although I found the prices to be a bit steep ($13 for mimosas and champagnes, although try the French 75 and the hibiscus champagne), we got out of there, with gratuity included, for about $40 a person.

* Escargots à la Bourguignonne  - Burgundy snails, parsley-garlic butter & Bouchon Bakery puff pastry. The escargots are heavenly. Highly recommend.

* Seared Scallops - The scallops are delicious and seasoned perfectly.

We also ordered the following. Each dishes below were good, but not great.

* Salade Maraîchère au Chèvre Chaud - watercress-endive salad, Fuji apples, Roquefort & walnuts with walnut vinaigrette
* Seared Ahi tuna - The seared ahi tuna is good but not great. I've had better seasoned ahi tuna elsewhere
* Lamb - The lamb is good, but I've had better seasoned lamb at Greek restaurants.
* Flatbread - The flatbread is also just OK

Overall, we had a solid meal and enjoyed the ambiance. The menu is good and their recipe is well tested, but wasn't quite as creative as some of the other restaurants.",0,0,1

My husband and I went to Bouchon for brunch on a Saturday morning. The wait wasn't as bad as I anticipated considering the fact we were there the weekend of the CES Show. The warm and toasty baguettes they place at your table help make waiting for your meal a non-issue. I have never been a fan of french toast, but after impulsively ordering it at Bouchon, I am now french toast's biggest fan. Bouchon's french toast is a cinnamony, sweet, cylindrical stack of pure goodness. 
The only reason I give Bouchon a 4 star rather than a 5 star is because my husband's $26 Breakfast Americain was really nothing special. It was a glorified Denny's breakfast (i.e...scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon). The only thing that saved it from being amongst the rank of diner food was the addition of a Bouchon pastry of your choice. O...M...G. We got the pain au chocolat, but really, they're ALL good. The almond financiers they were passing out at the entrance made me want to linger until lunchtime. Even if you can't eat a full meal here, the pastries are definitely worth checking out.",0,0,0

I wanted to leave singing praises as most people have done in their reviews, but I found that Bouchon did not quite live up  to all the hype.

For a french restaurant it had the feel of every other steakhouse in the city, the ambiance was not very cozy or intimate.  The oysters were excellent and the server was attentive and friendly, but I didn't feel wowed at all.  Although I loved the wine, my martini was heavy on the juice and the bread was stale (I know the difference between a good, hard baguette and stale bread if you are wondering).  

The risotto was crunchy as if it had been made in a hurry and my friend's steak was obviously not medium as it was still bleeding.  When asked to recook it, the server brought back another steak that was, again, bleeding.  Sometimes I let things go, but this was horrible and we sent it back asking for no additional tries.

The only thing that is saving my review from being two stars is the amazing french bordeux and the phenomenal desserts (dark chocolate mousse and creme brulee).

We visited The Bouchon and it did not disappoint. Prior to flying to Vegas, I researched into the top Brunch spots and people on both on yelp and trip advisor raved about the Bouchon, so I knew we would have to check it out.

We attempted to eat here Friday right before 2:30 PM because the concierge at the Palazzo had said they didn't close until 2:30 PM and so we had run over there. Unfortunately this information was incorrect, as they stop seating at 2 PM. We returned on Saturday at around 12:30 PM and there was a HUGE wait. To be clear, the Bouchon does NOT take open table reservations...they only take walk-ins. That being said, there is a high probability your wait will be an hour or more (it's TOTALLY worth it though).

In our case, we were told the wait would be an hour, but it ended up being longer and so we just finally decided to eat at the bar. To start, I had a much needed cappuccino to give me some energy after a night of partying. My friend who also ordered one and is a coffee addict told the bartender that this was ""literally the best cappuccino she has ever had."" 

The bartender recommended either the Roasted Chicken with Bacon and Chive Waffles (Poulet et des Gaufres) or the Oeufs Benedict. I was a little hesistant to order the chicken with raffles the food sounded a little heavy after a night of drinking, but he convinced me when he said it was personally one of his favorite dishes and that when you are eating in vegas you shouldn't order food that you can get at any regular old brunch spot place...you should try things that unique to that restaurant. 

Let me tell you, boy was I glad I ordered that plate! It was absolutely amazing. My friend, who also ordered it, and I could not stop talking about how good it was. They give you a special gravy for the chicken that was fantastic. I couldn't get enough of that sauce. The bacon and chive waffles were also mouth wateringly delicious. The other two people in my party ordered the Oeufs Benedict and also enjoyed their food. The general consensus was that all 4 of us absolutely loved this place.

The first thing I noticed was that the tables are designed really well so that, even in big parties, you can have a solid conversation with anyone else at the table. Most places only offer long tables, which splits the group in two unless you walk around the table to talk to the other side. So, I definitely recommend this place for larger groups. 

But, the service at this place was really weird. The lady insisted that we tell her our order consecutively and she was really anal about that. I didn't like her attitude. They were really slow in bringing out my cousin's mimosa after everyone else received theirs. This could partly be because one of our party was being a little tenacious about every little thing. Still, part of great customer service is to deal with it graciously.

I really like their Bellini wine drink. 

The pastries were amazing. My cousin ordered the French Toast, and it looked a little soggy.

We started with a few things to share, and the Salade de Scarole aux Lardons et Oeuf Poche was probably our favorite.  It's a salad but there's an intense smokiness from the bacon and that poached egg was perfect.  Warm & cold.  Awesome.

I went with Steak Frites.  Good options always.  Steak was cooked to my liking without any issues.  I upgraded my fries to truffle fries, which is a must.  No bearnaise sauce here with the steak frites.  If you want the sauce, the Steak Bouchon is the one.

A few got the special, which was a steak roast.  It was suppose to be medium rare, but all came out medium-well.

First off, the service was very friendly and accomodated our party of 12.  He was very knowledgable about the wine and gave us some tips on what to order.  We had a very tasty house Cabernet.  The bread that they serve is fantastic.  I've been to France and the bread here is certainly up to par.  They dump the cactus looking bread in the middle of the table.  I think I ate enough bread to last a whole week without going hungry.  Anywayz, our party ordered similar dishes, it was either the lamb chop, salmon, or steak.

The hostesses were a little spacey, (they seemed like trainees) but were very nice and we technically didn't run into any difficulties being seated.  They even dialed Pinot Brasserie so we could call and cancel our reservations.

Food wise, I was satisfied.  Four stars satisfied.  I think I'm a little harder on my restaurant scoring because I've dined at a lot of places in Asia and America so I've got a pretty good idea of fabulous dining.

Although my party did not sample the much hyped raw shellfish selections, I did take time to notice the prep and display area.  A large sushi kitchen circular glass case with two (I think) sous chefs working away.

Given my critical rating, these four stars are well earned.  Our server was quirky but knowledgeable.  Our sommalier was friendly and very helpful - pretentious is not a word I would use for any part of this experience, even though the service and presentation was nearly first class.

An old french favorite of mine has always been French onion soup.  Yup, old reliable.  As commonplace as [it] can be, I've definitely has my fair share of screwed up FOS.  Bouchon does not screw this up.  Both of the required cheeses were adequately layered and baked on top.  The broth was salty but not moisture drenching and there was the perfect amount of breading.

This review is for a dining experience exactly one week ago and my entree is a little fuzzy (I'm sick right now).  I do remember that I definitely wanted chicken but they definitely didn't have a sauce compatible with my allergen list.  The waiter switched the sauce and used the duck sauce which worked out quite well and my fuzzy memory is one of happiness and content.  Although salads should be bullet proof, they  too can be weak or ruined and I remember being impressed with the ingredients and presentation.

As a wrap up, I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone that is looking for a reliable fine dining establishment away from the noise and the crush of the Venetian restaurant row or for anyone on a mission to sample the establishments of America's finest chefs across America.

It took 15mins for our server, James, to even acknowledge we were there. He was aloof and condescending and not pleasant in the least. I get it, you're a waiter at Bouchon, oh my! We ordered and hoped for the best. It was only downhill from there. The appetizers were completely average, I mean just blah. Everything was devoid of flavor. You know you're in trouble when the best thing on the table is the bread and butter. Like the title says, we could have been at any formula food eatery. Yet, we held out hope. 2 Steak Bouchon arrive looking fabulous, and cooked to a perfect medium rare. I was excited to see this whole thing turn around, it didn't. While cooked perfectly, the steak had no seasoning and was anything but tender. Accompanying the steak was a Bearnaise sauce that was watery butter with some tarragon thrown in, just awful. One of my guests ordered the Gnudi dumplings, quite possibly the greatest travesty ever perpetrated on a truffle in the history of cuisine. Completely flavorless, not even the truffles could save these balls of nothingness. When the waiter eventually graced us with his presence I commented that the dumplings were disappointing and lacking in flavor, he rolled his eyes and said, ""Gnudi means naked"". Thanks for the Italian lesson, however, Gnudi does not mean ""tasteless, texture-less, horrific ball of goo"". Double espressos all around so we can the hell out of Dodge. What arrived was tepid brown water, no crema, no flavor. As if they got all 6 from the same puck. I was so embarrassed that I suggested Bouchon to my friends; that I introduced first-timers to one of the greatest American chefs and what we got was a bad Bennigan's experience. Another great sells out. Shame on you.",1,4,0

I arrived towards the end of its lunch hours and was seated immediately without wait.  I ordered the Croque Madame with a slight amount of hesitation because at its core, I was ordering a ham and cheese sandwich covered in sauce an an egg.

Being a Thomas Keller restaurant, I expected great things, but instead had one of the worst meals of my two week vacation. You could say it was just my meal, but my husbands was sub-par as well, the bread was tough, and the service was very slow and inattentive. 

I made a mistake of not going with a ""classic"" french meal, but the papperdelle with short rib ragu sounded interesting, so I decided to try it. I literally felt like I was eating one step up from dog food. I'm almost certain the kitchen had some leftover short rib dish that they reused, added WAY too much oil, and threw it on top of some broken up, leftover pasta. BLECH! 

It has always been a dream of mine to eat at the French Laundry, so I was excited to try one of Thomas Keller's restaurants. For a chef as renowned as he is, he should really pay more attention to the quality of his restaurants or else it is going to tarnish his reputation.

It ultimately differs based on your Vegas age.  During your first dozen or so trips, you probably drank alcohol excessively whilst listening to an edm DJ at one of the dozen or so nightclubs on the strip.  You also probably blacked the F out. Morning comes and you're rolling on the floor, moaning in pain, and trying to make sense of all your life's decisions - hoping and praying for an answer as to why you thought double fisting two AMFs was a ""good"" idea.

Brunch is not on your itinerary. 

Then, somewhere along the way, your priorities shift. You see all the Instagram posts displaying all the glorious cuisine Vegas has to offer.  You read all the Yelp reviews about fine dining on the Strip.  You watch Gordon Ramsay teach the contestants on MasterChef how to cook a filet mignon at his Vegas steakhouse.  And it hits you.  You want to eat like a king while you're in the city of excess, gluttony, and sin.  It also helps that you actually went home from the club as a coherent human being and at a reasonable hour.

For me, there was no other place I wanted to visit.

Two weeks ago, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to dine at Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bistro in the Venetian.  I reviewed the brunch menu in its entirety, and I found myself going back to one item: their famed croque madame with truffle fries.  I was blown away.  The sandwich was creamy and rich.  The egg was perfectly cooked.  Coupled with the BEST truffle fries  I've ever tasted, the croque madame is a perennial favorite for good reason.  The pastries were also excellent.  I ordered the raspeberry filled beignets.  Perfection all around.  The next time I'm back in Vegas, I'll make sure to stop by and try their chicken and waffles.

When you leave California to go to Vegas, to eat the best that CA has to offer!

That totally makes sense right? I take a hour plane ride to try this place, before I actually drive an hour to go to the original location. Anyways, life happens in mysterious ways.

I've had some delicious goodness from the Bouchon in Napa, but never sat down in the restaurant. Luckily, on our last night in Vegas we made the genius decision to do so! We used Open Table to secure a spot, but it was unnecessary on an October, Tuesday evening in Vegas. Luckily we already knew it was in the Venetian and didn't have an issue getting there. When we did we saw that the inside was virtually empty and the patio was pretty full.

We decided to share a few appetizers:
Oeufs Mimosa - 4 deviled eggs
Formag Blanc - cheese on walnut bread (my descriptor not theirs)
Fromage du Jour - selection of cow, sheep or goat artisanal cheese, served with seasonal garnishes, & pecan-raisin crackers - 3pcs

We were a little confused by the waitress and we thought she was asking about the formag blanc when she asked about additional cheese, so that's why we ended up with the third appetizer. All of them were amazing, in addition to the fresh baked, cutest loaf of bread we were served with soft, delicious butter. Seriously, the creaminess of the formag blanc was heavenly. I want to smear that all over everything I eat! The walnut bread wasn't my favorite and you can for sure feel the texture of the walnuts, despite what our server said. The deviled eggs has great flavor, but were really cold.

Easily, I knew what I was having as my entree - Steak Frites, pan-seared flat iron,
caramelized shallots & maître d'hôtel butter, served with French fries. However, totally copying my co-worker I also upgraded my fries to their truffle fries - BEST DECISION EVER! The server said they only recommend this plate served medium or rare, so my option of medium to well done was not preferred. She said if you like your meat prepared like that, they recommend the Steak Bouchon, since the cut is larger. I put on my big girl panties and ordered it as medium as possible and went with it. Our other co-worker ordered the special for the evening, which was a rack of lamb.

I can't even talk about how good my meal was! The words that I try to use will never justify the flavor of truffle amazingness that occurred at the table, within that plate! The steak was not a thin piece of steak as waitress mentioned, it was a nice block of steak, covered in fries. Seriously, the French have it so right with Steak Frites! The french fries were crisp to perfection, flavored with just the right amount of truffle. Not too much and not too little, seriously I ate myself to a stomach ache they were so damn good. As I sit here, I can vividly remember the taste, if only I could accurately describe it to you...

We had to dessert, it was a must! I can't remember the exact names of what was ordered, but I'm pretty sure it was Pumpkin creme de pot and the crepe cake. I hate pumpkin, but had to try it. The server said the pumpkin flavor was light, but again, she was wrong. It was a lot of pumpkin flavor, but the shortbread cookies were tasty. Not anything I'd ever order, but glad to have tried. My cake was good and the crepes were amazing, but I expect more flavor from the filling part (sadly, I can't remember if it was Nutella or chocolate). The Crème fraîche that it was paired with was lovely and refreshing.

The service was beyond amazing, exactly what you'd expect from a TK restaurant. Although I didn't agree with some of our server's assessments of the menu, she was awesome, attentive, and not overbearing. She covered anything and everything we needed. She was sweet, cordial, and helpful for any questions we had. Everything was as good as I would have dreamed from a TK location!

The PERFECT meal to say goodbye to Vegas with!",4,3,4

We ordered 5 dishes (main dishes).   

- White Sausage: W.T.F. $28 bucks for one piece of sausage and some mashed potatoes and puree?
- Rib Eye, medium rare.  $58? for a mediocre piece of steak. Not tender. Not juicy. They give you a bunch of fries like we're kids.  Alright, this place is not a steak house, but seriously, it's just a normal piece of meat.
- Chicken - was okay.  Meat is cooked perfectly and sauce is good. But the waiter told me it's the ""signature dish"" of the restaurant.  I took a bite (along with the bacon, sauce), and it's good. But nothing impressive.  It shouldn't be the signature dish.  Signature dishes make you want to come back.  This was good, but I wouldn't come back.
- Salmon - nothing impressive.  It's very very mediocre.
- Croque Madame - absolute junk.  Search ""How to make Croque Madame"" on youtube and you can make it better yourself. Croque Madame = grilled cheese plus a fried egg. Yea, it's not fancy, but for Thomas Keller, we expect it to be ELEVATED.   

This is supposed to be one of the best restaurants in Vegas.  I expected ELEVATED food, not simple food you can cook at home watching youtube videos.

These dishes would not pass the first episode of MasterChef.

If this wasn't hyped so high, I would give it 3 stars.  But because they couldn't live up to the hype, I give it 1.5.

Perhaps a little too much so. 

I've never had the privilege to dine at the world famous French Laundry in Napa, but when you're pimping your ""other restaurant"" with the name and reputation you established at the first, I think it's completely understandable for people to expect something special from the ""other restaurant"".  

While everything we had was very good and impeccably prepared. Nothing was what I would call special.  Especially not for the price tag that comes attached. 

Maybe my expectations were a little high, but I expected something more...  well, ""Wow!"", and what we got was something that many hobbyists could have executed with equal success.

I had a white sausage made from veal and chicken with a beurre noisette, which was served with eggs, and for this I was charged $25. 

The sausage was extremely delicate but also very mild; to the point where you were looking for some flavor. This is fine if the sausage is to be accompanied by a sauce or something else, but this was given just a smidgeon of beurre noisette, which was also extraordinarily mild to the point of being also barely perceptible. 

And the eggs were, well eggs.

The breads were excellent, the service was excellent, D'Artagnan also excellent, but it was not anything more (nor less) than I would have been able to get at any other nice hotel restaurant serving breakfast\/brunch. 

In fact there is a semi-high restaurant not too far from me in Newport Beach that doesn't have the benefit of a James Beard Award winner as their owner, and for that same price, I can get unlimited mimosas, and brunch items like salmon, or even venison, that put to shame Bouchon's sausage, and their brunch is also usually accompanied by a jazz combo or piano.

In fact, anything from Sauternes or Barsac was conspicuously absent from the wine list which is very odd given that they serve an excellent Foie Gras.  Suduiraut hit their target with the Lions (lighter, brighter, and probably best drunk young), but a classic Sauternes like Chateau Suduiraut or even a second like Carmes de Rieussec would have paired much better.

Overall the first course was very good and only slightly marred by the poor Sauternes selection.  If this was all I ate, it would have been a 4-star review.  Unfortunately for that 4-star first course, my dinner was essentially ruined by my next course.

For my next course, I tried the Soupe à l'Oignon.  It was a disaster.  The flavor was pretty good, but it was so salty that it was inedible, the crouton was so tough that you couldn't cut it with your spoon, and it was so short on wine that I wonder if there was even any in it.  In my opinion, this soup is one of the hardest dishes to make well and I find that it is an excellent measure of a restaurant.  Bouchon Bistro failed this test so miserably that I would have preferred to drink a glass of sea water.  The only saving grace was that the waiter took it off my bill.

The second course was so bad that I'd give it negative stars if I could.  After eating a few spoonfuls, I couldn't get the salty taste out of my mouth no matter how much water I drank.

Finally for my entree, I decided to go for something a little lighter and ordered the Croque Madame.  For the price, I was expecting european-style ham with a flavorful mornay sauce.  It was a passable rendition with pretty good brioche and decent mornay sauce.  Unfortunately, it was made with what tasted like prepackaged grocery store thin-sliced deli meat and bland mornay souce.  It was like you took a croque madame and turned the flavor down by half to two-thirds.  At least it wasn't too salty.

Since the entree column was headlined with Steak Frites, I also had high hopes for the side of fries that came with the croque madame.  They get good reviews on Yelp, but they were only on par with McDonalds fries.  I was expecting proper double fried potatoes that are explosively crisp on the outside and fluffy and tender on the inside.  About half the fries were slightly crisp, but the balance were floppy and soft.

After the entree, I decided to cut my losses and skip dessert.  I'd give the entree 3 stars because it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't spectacular either.

After walking through the quiet and elegant Venezia Tower lobby on the 10th floor, I thought I would get a nice quiet restaurant at the end of my walk.  Boy was I wrong.  The restaurant was so noisy that I had a hard time communicating with my waiter.  Not only were the patrons rather loud, but it was made even worse by the fact that the music was cranked way up.  

In closing, the waitstaff was fantastic, but the food was not.  I don't recommend going if you have any idea what French food should really taste like.",2,0,0

---

I've had this place on my Vegas foodie radar as it was well known for their brunch menu. No1DP and I wanted to grab brunch nearby before my scheduled pickup to the aiport.

CONCEPT: Bistro fare from Thomas Keller, known for his restaurants at The French Laundry in Yountville and Per Se in New York.

VENUE: Located in the Venezia Tower you have to take an elevator from the Venetian to get to a bridge that will take you to the entrance of the restaurant. Though you can look out from the bridge there isn't much of a view of the outside.

SERVICE: When the No1DP and I arrived at 1:00ish there wasn't much of a wait. Approximate wait was ~25-30 minutes and I gave my phone number to text when our seats were ready. Bar was open seating and we went to actually eat at the bar but 5 minutes later I got a text alert saying our table was ready. 

At the beginning of the meal your server will tell you about the daily specials, but for reference there are blackboards scattered all across the restaurant that lists what those specials are. Service throughout the meal was good.

FOOD
After your order, you get epi bread along with butter and jam. The epi bread was a bit tough on the outside yet slightly soft on the inside. Butter was very smooth and creamy and was close in composition to the butter I had at The French Laundry. 

As the waiter was reading off the specials the No1DP and I heard about a special that caught our eye - the rock shrimp hash. Shrimps came with a poached egg and more importantly the brioche bread that Bouchon is also known for. 
-Poached egg was PERFECT. Sauce was creamy but not heavy, the egg is SOFT and yolky but not RUNNY so that your hash won't turn into a total mess.
-Shrimps were soft and flavorful. 
-Hash was full of vegetables and little potato. This ended up being one of the lightest hash dishes I've eaten. I really like a hash when it doesn't make me feel too stuffed due to the potato.
-Brioche bread was a bit crispy but it was slightly chewy on the center and buttery, similar to the brioche I've had at The French Laundry (which was the best brioche I've ever had).

No1DP and I also had freshly squeezed orange juice. The amount of pulp was just right.

After a sub-par dinner experience I would like to come back here to try more of their brunch dishes, especially the croque madame and chicken and waffles. This is also a must-stop if you are staying at the Venetian or Palazzo.",2,0,0

This place was not close to being in the same vicinity as Thomas Keller's sister restaurant.  The food is good but not great.  I ordered a salad to start- and to be honest with you, all I remember is that the salad had way to much vinegar.  It was one of the specials of the evening, and frankly didn't find it that special.  For my main entree- I ordered the steak and frites.  The steak was prepared nicely.  Definite taste of shallots.  Anthony Bourdain recommended the frites.  I've tasted better fries.   The coffee to end the meal had a not so freshly brewed taste to it.  The service was A-1.  From the host to the waiter and his assistants.  Very attentive.

The decor is very French Bistro, down to the plants and brass railings. We ordered the appetizer, which was braised pork cheeks with a pearl barley risotto kind of thing. The cheeks were luke warm and the barley had a little too much acidity. When we commented to the server the the cheeks were just luke warm, he commented that ""we don't really serve anything hot here.""  HUH? Does Thomas Keller know that? The bread was good, I ordered roast chicken because Keller said that was the reason he opened the first Bouchon in the first place. To find a good roast chicken after work. The skin was crispy and it was cooked well, but it was a little bland. Truthfully, Costco's roast chicken has better flavor and is a sixth the price. The server seemed kind of distracted and a little out of sorts. The highlight of the whole meal was watching how good our server assistant was. He was everywhere at once and did a great job. I actually went and tipped him seperately because of his obvious work ethic. Wish he would have been our server.",0,0,0

It's definitely a hidden gem that's worth locating.  In order to find this fantabulous establishment make sure you ask!  it can be a bit difficult to find and in order to get there you MUST use guest elevators ( to my knowledge). So... Let me begin..at the beginning..  :)
Once we finally found the place we were promptly seated and started with our drinks.   We were greeted as you would normally be greeted at an upscale restaurant.  The establishment is very clean, great lighting and has that ""Good morning people ! Let's grub !"" feel to it. We started off with the Great Plateau which is a seafood tower of greatness.  I would definitely recommend this as it seemed to be the best option for the dollar amount if you are looking for a seafood option. I would also highly recommend the Foie Gras to accompany ANY starter.  The Foie Gras comes out in a little jar with a plate of toast you can spread it on.  It's very light and buttery and will satisfy the fat craving in any meat eater while leaving you ready to do some serious damage on the other plates.  Sweet baby jeezuz just thinking of the Foie Gras is making my mouth water.  If you order it be sure to put a good amount on your toast so you can REALLY savor the flavors of it as it melts down in your mouth.   Ya know, come to think of it..  I don't think there was a bad dish on the entire menu.  I had the brioche french toast and my family had other items on the menu and all I can say is that it was a huge hit.  I may not be able to fluff a review like an elite but I know most definitely you are gonna love this place.  I can't wait to come back !  Heads up Venetian.. I usually stay all over the vegas strip but I am now considering making the venetian my home away from home because of this restaurant !   Also a tip.. I noticed at the bottom of this review it asked for certain things to confirm or deny and it states good for kids?

I'm a TK fan of epic proportions and consider the French Laundry to be THE meal against which all others shall be compared. So, during our stay in Las Vegas we, of course, made reservations at Bouchon. It was a last minute trip and we were happy to get a seating for later on the night of our arrival. That should have been my first clue. 
To go to the French Laundry in Napa, you need to have been born there, be related to Mr. Keller or, like me, plan a trip around the first date they can fit you in. Mine was a 3 month wait. I hit high season, I guess.
So, we got a prime 9pm seating on a Friday night at the last minute (!). We arrived and saw that it was maybe half full. It's a pretty spot inside the lovely Venetian hotel. Very clubby, masculine room with a beautiful wood paneling. We were seated right away.
The staff began to serve us out of order- water then dinner order then drink order then meal delivery THEN wine order. There are definite drawbacks to large waitstaff teams.
So, after all these years of waiting, what did I order? Soup. Why? They sold out of the other things I wanted to have! 9pm in Vegas is early. How many short ribs plates did you have - 3? What was left was a fairly large collection of dishes that did NOT interest me. It was very heavy in the fois gras, pate, caviar for appetizers. The remaining dinner options weren't that varied: trout, halibut, salmon and collections featuring mussels, octopus, crab. When you have an allergy to shellfish, sometimes even fish turns you off. I used to adore seafood but since I developed an allergy that can kill me, it's taken the bloom of the rose, so to say.
The menu did have a chicken offering (accompanied by mustard spaetzel), gnocchi with vegetables and - weirdly - a Croque Madame.  My husband ordered the steak. I ordered the soup du jour: cauliflower. The other specials? Salmon tartar and some other fish. I was sad, bordering on angry. Fish? I didn't realize they only served FISH and then throwaways if you didn't want fish. Oh, you can get accompaniments: shellfish. And fish. 
So, the steak arrived. It was cooked perfectly, tasted very good. It shared the plate with a mound of shoestring potatoes. Yes, Ore Ida fries, pale and lovely. No garnish. Nothing else. $51 for a 12oz. Rib eye and shoestring fries. My soup? White puréed cauliflower with a plop of crime fraiche and a couple foraged florets. They apologized as soon as they served it to me saying that his steak took so long to cook. Basically, ""we screwed up, sorry it's cold."" At this point, I was so heartbroken that I just wanted to leave. The soup wasn't good (roasted vegetables aren't at their best when sitting on a hot liquid for 20 minutes!), I only had water to drink because I didn't order wine and they never asked me if I wanted something else. Actually, I said I'm ""just a Diet Coke girl!"" but that wasn't enough of a hint - and I wasn't trying to be subversive to see if they'd pick up on it. It was just a comment when served with water that I'd be ordering something else.
The bill: just about $120. For ok steak, Ore Ida fries, bad soup, a glass of wine and water.
BOUCHON, YOU KILLED ME! I was waiting with anticipation to go to you! It was part of my agreeing to go to Vegas: a Thomas Keller restaurant. It was AWFUL. I felt like I was a know-nothing Neanderthal that didn't know what ""good food"" was. I'm allergic to seafood. Sorry about that. I thought I'd order the short ribs or the lamb but you didn't have that. Sorry for not adapting to your desire that I should eat more fish.
Soup and water. Wow.
UPDATE:
They made good on their promise to fix it (after I complained to the manager and the Venetian customer service people. Everyone was shocked that I was unhappy.) and we went to breakfast the next day where we were inundated with very expensive goodies -  granola yogurt, a tray of pastries, mimosas, whatever we wanted on the menu, etc. Those were all good except....I can't eat sugar. The 2 things in the world I can't eat, shellfish and sugar, and that's what I got. I felt so picky but I know I'm not really. In the end, I really couldn't eat anything at BOUCHON. It was nice for them to offer to make up our horrible dinner experience to us but how many people want a 4-star $120 breakfast for 2""? We should have gotten another dinner. As it was, I ate my scrambled eggs and a few bites of yogurt. That makes it mighty expensive scrambled eggs.

The venue reminds me of a very sophisticated New York eatery.  The decor and details are exquisitely done. 

We had a sweet female server & she was very nice & kept the code cups mostly warmed up.  

She told us about the crab & egg special with the Hollandaise sauce. Our host requested a minimum amount of the sauce.  Somehow the request did not make it & both of our breakfast were equally doused in the sauce.  The eggs with lump crab & Hollandaise sauce were really tasty, but a little bit past being desirable as they were both swimming in butter.  I think it comes from the oven baking part of the recipe. The Hollandaise breaks down to liquid butter.  We didn't bother sending them back as we were planning on attending the next seminar and it was not going to work out time wise.  Our sweet waitress did not seem flustered by our asking about the sauce & she told us she was sure Brian's serving had less Hollandaise. OMG. That was crazy talk, but it was a beautiful Fall morning in an exquisite setting... So who wants to focus on the lake of butter. Better to enjoy the crab & eggs and let the butter drip off. 

My smart husband had the steak & eggs. He really enjoyed that!  Side note for big guys: the steak was pretty tiny. 

Bread was a very nice little French type creation & the French butter for the bread was fresh & tasty.

I have wanted to eat at one of Thomas Keller's restaurants for a very long time and haven't yet got organized enough to book The French Laundry 6 months in advance!

So it was on a May Saturday night in Vegas that my better half and I finally got dinner at Bouchon (we have had a very good b'fast here before). We didn't know before we sat down that Mr Thomas Keller himself was in attendance that evening which I have to believe between the Laundry and Per Se in NYC is a pretty rare occurence in Vegas. 

The decor is impeccable and as authentic as anything can be in Vegas. The service was very good but I think I have been in the States so long I expect more prompt service than I was used to living in Europe. There were a few moments where we waited for our glasses to be filled just a moment too long but no sooner had I commented on the fact the waiter appeared (are the tables bugged?!?!).

The food and wine was what you would expect. A poached mackerel first course with Serrano ham was sensational. I was going to go for Moules but ended up with my old weakness Steak Frites. The Frites were 100% amazing but I have to say I have had a much better Steak (accepting the cut of the meat is always flank\/skirt etc) at Les Halles in NYC. That momentary lapse aside I continued with traditional French choices by ordering a perfect and I mean textbook perfect Creme Caramel, Alongside a glass of Sauternes the meal could not have ended better.

It was when we finished our desert that we noticed Mr Keller by the long Oak bar and figured even if he didn't cook our food personally you knew his team were bringing their A-Game with him looking over their shoulder!

As soon as I can get another $350 together we will be back (yes, as Stella Artois put it, Bouchon is reassuringly expensive!!!).",0,0,0

Now Thomas Keller is famous, I know about his restaurants in the Napa, and I have to stop at one of bakeries whenever I'm in the area (NY & Vegas). But who knew you could dine at a Thomas Keller restaurant for a decent price. Entrees ranged from $9 to $35. We came for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. The wait was about half an hour. It's not a big place and we ended up splitting out group of 25 into three mini groups. So we had a suspicion that we would be charged for water since that's what most fancy places do and we also forget to ask for TAP water. We thought we were ok when it came out in clear unmarked bottles. But in the end the bill charged per bottle for the flat water and the waiters are good about keeping your glasses filled so you can go through bottles pretty quickly. Just an FYI to limit your water intake or hopefully you can ask for tap water. 

As for the food, in addition to the regular menu, they have specials which looked really good. There were red velvet pancakes, rock shrimp eggs benedict and raspberry beignets among other things. Based on yelp, I had the croque madame, which is basically a grilled ham and cheese sandwich with a sunny side egg on top. There was also some white sauce on top as well a huge side of fries. It wasn't my favorite because some parts of the bread were burned and it was too thick for the amount of ham and cheese your given. I left some pieces of bread on my plate. The fries were skinny and a little too salty for me. No matter how many I ate or shared with other people, it didn't look like we even made a dent in it. Such a waste. It's better to share this meal, I think. On the other hand, I think I filled up on the bread and appetizers prior to my meal. We split the foie gras en terrine. Since it's banned in Cali, we had to get it here. I've never had foie gras so this was a treat. I know it's bad for the animal but I found it delicious. It tasted like a rich and super flavorful kind of pâté. You eat it with these little strips of toasted bread and it was scrumptious. 

Other things I tried: Complementary bread that they just put on the table. It's shaped like leaves and you can rip it apart. Served with some super delish butter and berry jam. The rillettes aux deux saumons is a fresh and smoked salmon spread that I quite liked on mini toasted pieces of bread. Red velvet pancakes - not as sweet as say red velvet cupcakes but a little dry. The syrup helps and don't forget the vanilla bean butter. I think next time I will try the chicken and waffles though I'd rather have his original fried chicken (this place is grilled). Or something sweet like his sourdough waffles or French toast.",1,1,1

The smoked foie gras terrine was spectacular!  Rich and decadent yet still totally balanced in both proportion, presentation and flavors.  No kidding, the foie with it's garnishes of citrus poached olives and sweet onion vinaigrette made for just about the single most delicious bite of food I've ever enjoyed.  My wife had the lamb, which was incredible and perfectly cooked, and I had the scallops, which were divine in their own right.

The (oh-so-very-minor) downsides that prevented a full five stars: Service seemed somewhat rushed, which I attribute to our early seating time (i.e. Trying to turn our table before the proper dinner rush hit), and also a bit disjointed.  We could have done with a couple more minutes between the foie appie and our entrees, and the mains were brought out before our table was cleared and re-set, so I had my main course but no silverware with which I could eat it.  Also, since the mains were rushed out we didn't get to fully enjoy our first wine selection before the next glasses were at our table.

Again, very small dings on the report card, IMO.

It was primo Sunday brunch time, about 11 AM, but the wait for 2 people was only about 10 minutes, and I liked that they took your number and texted you when your table was ready. I also LOVED that they had mini almond pastries set out for you to nibble on while you waited. GREAT touch.

Located in the Venezia tower near the pool, Bouchon is far removed from most everything else at the Venetian, which means you're not flooded with casino sounds, but there's not much around if you have to wait. Also, if self-parking in the garage, turn LEFT once you exit the parking garage elevator on the third floor. You will see giant letters informing you to go right to the Casino, so your inclination is of course to go that way. However, you will then have a ridiculously long walk to try to find the place. If you do turn left, though, you will see a much smaller sign above the archway that notes that the elevators next door lead to the Venezia tower and Bouchon Bistro. I'm pretty sure most people do not even see this sign until they are returning to the parking garage from their second long walk back from Bouchon.

Once seated, the meal and service were quite good. Complimentary bread with butter and a delectable strawberry jam starts things off. They have a wide array of pastries as breakfast ""starters,"" and the entree selection was good as well. There were plenty of savory and sweet choices for any taste. My boyfriend and I ordered the quiche of the day and the brioche doree (a bread pudding style French toast with pineapple). The quiche was PHENOMENAL. Perfect blend of flavors and great textures to the eggs and crust. The brioche doree was good too, but I didn't think it was as stupendous as some write and did not hold a candle to the quiche. Honestly, it was a bit soggy for my taste. The bloody mary and bellini we had were decent but nothing to write home about, and while I thought the food was decently priced, the drinks, in my opinion, were a bit expensive, especially considering that if you wait until you get to the casino, you'll get them for free.

Overall, I would definitely come back here and would recommend this place to others too. And if you come, you MUST get the quiche - whatever it may happen to be that day.",1,0,0

Yes they make a lot of money because the hotels practically pay them to open a restaurant, and yes, they can get away with it because most of the people who come to Las Vegas are not particularly attuned to great cuisine (there are certainly exceptions, but just look around).  

I went there with a group of 15 on a Tuesday evening, and the place was not even close to full.  The service was attentive, but it took forever to get any food out of the kitchen, and what came out was mediocre at best.  The clams and oysters on the seafood towers were gritty, and did not taste fresh.  The Pate' was served too cold and my steak, while not over-cooked, was also not properly seared.  The vegetables were entirely taste free.  

The only good thing I can say about the place is that the wine list was reasonably diverse and well priced  (We finished off 7-8 bottles of wine while waiting for our food.)  

I spoke to the wait staff several times about how long it was taking to get food to the table and they said they would send a manager over to talk to me, but they never did.

I will admit from the outset that I was expecting to be impressed. My friend had recommended Bouchon from her experience at the Bev Hills location and my Darling surprised me with a friday reservation at this location. Perhaps I was expecting too much...I am from a city where French bistro food abounds. Bistro fare is meant to be ""meat and potatoes"" french fare where the technique and the quality of the ingredients shine at fairly reasonable prices. When the prices are more ""haute cuisine"" than bistro, I expect to be dazzled. Suffice it to say, the food did not live up to the hype nor the gold-plated pricing. 

The evening started out with much promise as we began with a salmon tartare dish and onion soup. The soup would have been perfect if it had been slightly less salted. Otherwise, it was very flavorful. The salmon tartare dish was incredible. We had never seen it presented in such a way (in circular flat layers, the salmon, capers, and cream were laid out on the plate...I don't think I'm doing it justice in my explanation) and it was really brilliant. For the main course, I ordered the skate fish special and my Darling had steak frites. The skate was a little on the oily side. Basically, it was good but not great. My Darling's steak frites was also good but not great. I do have to say that the portions were quite large, almost overwhelmingly so. For dessert, I had the mousse au chocolat noir. Absolute heaven! 

While the food definitely sparkled at times, overall, it did nothing more than maintain a consistent level of competency. Unfortunately, this is not what should be expected out of a restaurant that purports to be in the pantheon of elite restaurants.

Our three day getaway to Vegas our plans were simply to lounge around the pool\/beach at our hotel while She sipped a pina colada or 4, enjoy our 34th floor suite, see the Lion King stage show and to have dinner at Bouchon.  Good thing we followed our itinerary!  We could have missed the dinner at Bouchon.
Dinner started out with a nice, attentive server bringing us bread and butter along with pistachios to snack on while we waited for our wine and decided what to order.  The bread was crusty on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside as good bread should be.  The pistachios were a nice addition.  
Appetizers we shared were a half dozen Fanny Bay oysters and a grilled octopus and white bean salad.  Both were very good.

Now I've returned nearly 2 years later with a bit more taste, perspective and experience under my belt, and having eaten at many french influenced places, bistros and brasseries, I can say Bouchon still does it right and maintains its well deserved reputation.

Coming here for a late dinner on a Fri night due to a friend's delayed plane flight, the management was gracious to let us arrive later than our arranged time and to be honest we might have been the last diners of the night coming in the door around 10pm.  Getting to the restaurant is a relative maze and fortunately having been their before I helped guide us thru the treacherous mazeways that is the Venetian hotel.  Taking a dedicated elevator up to the 10th floor, you walk down an ornate and sumptuous hallway leading to the restaurant entrance, hinting you are in for some kind of occasion.

We sat down and starting attacking the menu with a series of orders that go something like this:

Marinated octopus salad with grilled eggplant, cucumbers, parsley & mint vinegrette - This was a pleasant surprise as the octupus tentacles were sliced, cooked to near perfection meaning  they were tender to the bite, not rubbery in the least and unless you see the suckers you would have no idea you were eating mollusk meat.

Escargots in puff pastry - I'll be honest, while I always order escargot, its not because I love or even like snails that much, its because of the rich, buttery, garlic sauce that I soak up with the accompanying puff pastry and any bread that maybe leftover on the table.  Ah what a delicious heart attack in a mini baking tin

Cod brandade beignets with tomato confit & fried sage - I had no idea what to expect but these weren't like the beignets I've tried before, almost like a light, crispy potato or taro fritter and also really good.  Something reminiscient of Indian pakooras or samosas but much more delicate.

Kurobuta pork loin with summer stone fruit - Juicy and tender pork loin, I love pig, this is prepared very simple without and excess of sauce and garnish.  

White sausage with potato purée & French prunes - I'm a fan of boundin noir, french black blood sausage so I decided to give its mirror counterpart a try.  Again, fantastic and with a totally different flavour to black sausage it tasted quite meaty like any good breakfast sausage and something I could see myself enjoying with eggs and a french toast.

Steak frites - Now I've been to NYC Brasserie Les Halles which prides itself on its steak frites, but to be honest theirs seems like an overcooked, flat piece of meat compared to what Bouchon serves up, good lord, you get a surprisingly thick and juicy piece of steak for surprisingly not a bad price.  Sadly the pommes frites are cooked in peanut oil and not duckfat like the NYC counterparts are.  Gotta love the lardons canard...

I feel like any Vegas trip should be crowned by one destination meal if budget allows and Bouchon certainly did the trick on this trip.  Wonderful for a casual or more intimate meal with friends or loved ones, highly recommended.",3,2,3

We had a group of 8, walked in a few minutes before our reservation, the hostess said our table is being setup right now and we'll be seated in 10 minutes. 30 minutes we finally got seated. 

The bread and toasted pistachios were delicious, but that's all we had to munch on for another good 20 minutes before the waiter came over and very rudely interrupted our table's conversation to read us the specials. Another 15 minutes to come back and take our orders. 

I ordered the daily special, braised short ribs with polenta, caramelized shallots, spinach, and shiitake mushroom fondue. By then I was famished, couldn't wait to eat my amazing meal, but after the rest of my table all got their dinners, mine still wasn't out. Short ribs already braised for 12hrs should have been the first thing on the plate! Nobody came to check if everything was ok, we had to flag down a waiter to let them know that we're missing a plate. The manager came by to apologize that the waiter forgot to put my order in, by the time I finally got my meal, the rest of my table's dinners were getting cold. These are the times when I would reduce the tip, a tip is purely for good service, but of course they have a ""mandatory"" 20% already added to the bill. 

While the food was good, I would probably never come back here again. Now that I think about it, haven't had a great experience with service at any French restaurant.",0,0,0

We started with onion soup, which didn't have much of an onion taste. Very strange. The soup came out promptly, but we waited for about 30 minutes for the mains. For entrees, we had steak frites and the roasted chicken. Both dishes were on the bland side. Had to request salt for the table.

i ordered the bread pudding style french toast. the first bite is good since it's super hot, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. however, as you keep eating it the syrup becomes too sweet and the french toast gets cold. personally i think i would like regular french toast better because after a while the brioche became too soggy.

i also ordered the beignets and i was pretty disappointed. they tasted like churros and didnt were too crispy and no softness on the inside. (im just big on crispy on the outside and soft on the inside). it also came along with a blackberry jam and nutella.

the steak and mushroom omelet was pretty good. the toast was ok. however if you order bacon they do give a handful of bacon strips and the sausages are also pretty big. no innuendos intended. 

i wasnt a fan of the sourdough waffles because of the aftertaste. i didnt try it with the vanilla bean butter which supposedly made the waffles taste better.

because there was a problem with getting our food served to us, the waiter offered us complimentary mimosa or bellini. the mimosa were ok nothing special. the bellini reminded me of a peach snapple. the caramel bouchon coffee was basically coffee with caramel syrup but wasnt too sweet.

all in all i enjoyed my dining experience, however i didnt think the food was superb but its concept of french toast is very innovative. i did wish we were served bread because i really like bread. gotta love them carbs. the greatest part was receiving complimentary mimosas and the atmosphere was also nice. the waiter was even generous enough to offer my friend a complimentary refill on the caramel bouchon coffee for the road! i guess it helps if your waiter thinks your friend is pretty (the waiter even stopped while describing the specials to compliment my friend; luckily he didnt seem too creeperish).",0,0,0

Quiche du Jour - creamy and not too heavy
Charcuterie plate - one of my favorites, I love all kinds of charcuterie plates and Bouchon's had a wonderful array of cheeses and salumi
Marinated Olives - not a huge fan of green olives, but these were nicely presented and tasted, well, like salty green olives
Salmon Rillette - melts in your mouth, simply amazing and I don't even like salmon

For my entree, I had the their renowned Poulet Rôti. This was SO GOOD! I never thought roasted chicken would blow me away like this. It came with chanterelle mushrooms, caramelized figs, pickled ramps & their chicken jus. This sauce just brought everything together so wonderfully.

For dessert, I indulged in one of their port wines, the Fonseca. By this time, I was probably 2-3 glasses of wine in from dinner, so needless to say, the port wine ended my alcohol streak on a nice and sweet note.

We has cocktails at the bar first before dinner because why not? Let me just say, every single staff was perfect from the bartender to the food runners. The server was the best. I don't know how he did it but he was spot on. He told us the strengths of the menu and a real honest opinion and of the dishes. So refreshing from when you ask for a recommendation, they answer ""what do you like"" or ""everything on the menu is excellent, you can't go wrong"". Yes, yes you can!

A few of us had the delicious piping hot French onion soup. Slightly sweet and rich, this soup can be a meal in itself with their braided French bread. I had a bite of the duck confit, tasty as any I've had at any Parisian bistro. It was crispy, melty and so tender. On the server's recommendation, I had the trout instead of my usual steak frites. So glad I listened because it was buttery perfectly cooked and with crunch of sliced almonds in the middle. I will remember that dish for a long time. 

Even though at this point I was full, the girls had to have dessert. They decided on pillowy, fresh delicate beniets. Can you say heaven in your mouth?

If you love carbs, you need to come to here.
I am not going to tell you anything that the hundreds of other reviews have not already stated.  Bottom line?  This place is GOOD!
Celebrating the b\/f's birthday weekend and having already eaten way too much, we walked from our staycation hotel to the Venetian early Sunday morning to beat the brunch rush.  Arriving at precisely 7:52am, there was no wait. We thought they opened at 8:00am, but they are actually open at 7:00am on Saturday and Sunday.  
This was our first time here and we may not be coming back for a while since it's such an indulgence for us, so we decided to just go for it.  We began with the pastry basket, where you can order four different pastries.  We chose a croissant, pain au chocolat, raspberry beignets, and the lemon and currant scone.  BUT, before that, our fantastic waiter, Aaron, brought us some Epi bread and butter; let's get this carb party started!  There were crumbs all over the table, but there's no elegant way to eat flaky croissants, not to mention the other delightful pastries in the basket.
For the main course, I had the Croque Madame, a dish I'd only read about and seen pictures of until this point.  It did not disappoint, with the ham, the cheese, and the egg. I even ate some of the frites, something I try to avoid in real life now. The b\/f had the chicken and waffles and that was also so tasty, a wonderful combination of flavors with syrup.  
The restaurant itself is decorated just like a French bistro that you could be in Paris, not Vegas.  The service was top-notch.  All I needed to make the experience complete was to hear ""La Vie en Rose"" playing on the music system.",7,8,11

My date had the half-chicken, which was super tasty. I wished the skin would have been more crisp, but the flavor was terrific.

After weaving through foot traffic for half a mile we followed the winding path through the Venetian to bouchon's beautifully understated front door. (Found out later we took the longest route possible.) Sweaty but determined we rushed the host stand and were greeted like royalty even though I'm sure I looked crazed from the effort. We were sat and though the table was not the best, it gave us a wonderful view of every thing happening. The front of house staff moved in perfect harmony. Not a single wasted motion or hair out of place. Our server gave us the run down but we had already chosen a few items of interest, namely the foie gras torchon, caviar, smoked salmon rillette. Our server (a stately gentleman, bespectacled and good at his job, early 40's) complimented us on our drink choices and asked if we were in the industry, we shyly admitted, we were in the home of a king after all. He became even more friendly, affable and warm after that. The work of the kitchen staff is the reason bouchon is the best french meal I have ever had, but this server (sadly cannot remember his name) completed the orchestration. He knew everything there was to know, even anecdotes as to the why's and where's of particular ingredients. The food came out well paced, water glasses always topped off, as if by magic. I nearly smacked a plate that was being served by the quietest human I have ever encountered. He dodged my arm and the plate landed safe and sound. He turned out to be a nice touch on the evening as well. After our plates were tasted and talked over we ordered from the raw bar, our server (let's call him brian) chose a selection of East and west coast oysters after a lengthy discussion. To this point everything was perfect. He asked if we would enjoy a tour of the kitchen. Would we? Goose bumps, dizzy brain, I know keller isn't in there but to see how his mind works from the inside would be an amazing treat. Brian said we would have to wait but he would get us in after the rush. I must admit I almost said no, out of respect but he seemed to think it was fine so I went along. We ordered another round switching things up a bit, we also ordered the bone marrow and escargot. I feel like it goes without saying that all these dishes were absolutely flawless, from the plates up, each had been imagined with nothing lacking, nothing superfluous. A lone example of what each dish could be. Plated with confidence nothing to muddle flavor or distract from perfect technique. After we finished our second round it was time to tour the kitchen. I was excited and elated, we walked through the doors and the first thing I noticed was it was silent as a tomb, second it was clean, like no one was there clean, not a crumb or splash of sauce, nothing, the restaurant was in full swing but it might as well just have opened. As we rounded the stations everything was labeled, EVERYTHING. Sauce pots, all mise, everything, dry storage was no different, everything labeled and sealed in jars. Neat racks of pastry waiting to be baked off. Nothing out of place. All the equipment was top of the line, save for a single knife I spied with that tell tale henkels logo, tsk tsk. The tour concluded with a walk through the private dining areas. Simply walking through has changed some of my habits in the kitchen forever. Thomas keller is a genius. Coming back into the dining room my whole perspective changed, I noticed details that I had overlooked, like Kubrick, nothing is accidental, or out of place, everything a deliberate masterpiece. By this time I told brian we trusted him for desert and we had the signature, little financiers with a almond\/burbon (if I recall) creme anglais, topped with a crisp. If I was able to live in the desert I would spend the remainder of my days toiling under these conditions but such is life. As far as I have seen Thomas keller is the best thing in vegas (haven't been to db's spot). As we left we said a warm goodbye to brian and his fearless assistant. I doubt I'll make it to Vegas ever again, but if I do, I'm eating at bouchon. 
P.s. we went to the bakery the next morning, it was open a few minutes early, the staff was amazing and put up with my rapid fire order, and cheesy jokes, I had to put a cap on what I could spend or I would have purchased the whole case.

The ambiance is good, kind of like a chic casual French bistro. They do have some nice outdoor patio seating, which we missed because we were just a couple minutes late in getting to the restaurant.

Our server was friendly though not overly into small talk, which we really did not mind. The menu has a lot of your standard brunch options, but they also have a large selection of champagne based brunch cocktails. We tried three different ones (don't remember the exact names) and they were all delicious.

For the food, they give you this amazing warm baguette to start with marmalade and butter. It was wonderfully soft in the center and delightfully crusty outside. One of the nicest ways to spend time waiting for your meal. For brunch, we ordered the Chicken and Waffles, the French toast and the Eggs Benedict. Unfortunately once our order was placed the waiter told us that they had run out of the chicken and waffle batter and we would need to wait for about half an hour for them to prepare more. We compromised and went for the omelette instead, which was a shame since we really wanted to try their signature dish.

The food did not disappoint once it arrived. The french toast was nice and fluffy, and just the right amount of sweet. The Eggs Benedict came with one of the thickest cuts of Canadian bacon I've had anywhere, and the Hollandaise sauce on it was good. The omelette we ordered was flavorful and packed with veggies. We also got a side of bacon which was thick cut and tasty.

I'll start with the strengths.  The restaurant itself is perched up in the Venetian, and is spacious and airy.  The brunch menu is a full french brunch menu.  So many delicious items to choose from, but I went with some easy standbys.  I ordered the Petit Déjeuner Américaine--
two eggs any style with bacon, sausage & potato croquettes with toasted brioche & a Bouchon Bakery pastry,fresh juice & Bouchon blend coffee.

This is where it was frustrating... $23 for the lot, and a beautiful brioche...and freezing cold butter.  Which ruins brioche, and doesn't spread.  I know it is a small thing, but so simple and one of actual importance for its use.  When a restaurant serves ice cold butter to spread on toast or other pastry, its causes an eyebrow raise, at the least.  And Bouchon is one of the best.  Attention to detail is expected here.  Also, servers were not very attentive.  Had to ask multiple times for cream, and additional coffee.  It was strange, as the expectations were so much higher.

I probably eat burgers once every two-three months. But I would definitely eat this kobe burger again. Just in case you were wondering, it was $25.

In case you were looking for Bouchon Bistro, it is on the 10th floor whereas the Bakery is on the 1st floor. Just to note, there is a slight price difference for the pastry if you get it at the Bakery vs. the Bistro. It is a little cheaper.

Our brunch ended up being about $50, but so worth it! I'm very particular with my cappuccino.

Before going there, I already reviewed the menu, like, 10,000 times, drooling over the descriptions of its amazingly sounding dishes.  

And the date has finally arrived!  Hidden all the way on the 10th floor in the Venetian, getting to Bouchon was quite a trip.  The decor is reminiscent of a typical Parisian bistro\/brasserie, dim light, long bar counter, and checkerboard tiles.

Perhaps my little note to the maitre d' through opentable.com actually worked (that it was my bf's birthday and we'd like to have some privacy), we were the only 2-person party sitting in the leather booth that night.  

And the dinner went on:
1.  Petite Plateau (1\/2 lobster, 9 oysters, 3 shrimp, 3 clams, 6 mussels): Heavenly.  How can anyone not like this?  When the seafood platter is bigger than my face, I am definitely smiling.
2.  Apple and Celery Salad: Knowing that Bouchon was only the first stop for my Vegas gastronomic indulgence, i opted for the healthy special of the night.  What a simple concept, celery and apple--- yet what a refreshingly delicious combination.  Both the fruit and vegetable were shaved into thin strips, dressed in a perfectly balanced vinaigrette, with chestnuts to garnish.  It was the most refined health food I have ever had.
3. Duck Leg Confit: The French can do ducks, that's all I have to say.  Cripsy, rich duck flavors, sitting on a small side of beautifully sauteed mushrooms.  The mushrooms were woody and intensively flavorful--- so good that it was not just a B-rated sidekick to my duck leg, but a star-worthy cameo. 
4. Bone in Ribeye with Truffle Risotto: Both mah man and I agreed--- it was the first time we wanted the side just as much as we wanted the steak...  While the bone-in ribeye was so amazingly good, the side risotto absolutely blew our minds away!

But the service is awful.  Where to begin.

We arrived and were sat promptly.  The FIRST person to come to our table wasn't a server.  Nope.  Wasn't a bus person.  Nope.  It was the sommelier and that was after a good 10 minutes of being seated.  We were all in great moods after seeing a show and went with it making wine our main focus.

Approximately 5 minutes after we ordered our wine we were served water.  Still no server.

Another couple minutes and we have warm bread and butter delivered.  Still no server.

Now, honestly, we should have seen our server 20 minutes into being sat.  We are now poured wine and are enjoying it along with the warm bread.  

Finally, we stop someone and ask to find our server.

I cannot remember what everyone had, but here is what I can--- onion soup was unbearably salty, the poulet roti was dry and over-cooked, the steak bouchon was tough and wayyyyy too fatty (exactly----how does a fatty steak become tough) and the mussles were tiny.  That said, the trout was pretty good.  

So here is the main reason I think I need to leave only one star.  Way over-rated, and the waiter was absolutely awful.  He took our cocktails away when we were not done, tried to pull some very shady shit with our bill.  Then this DB proceeded to make sure to collect each person's receipt before we left the table----and checking to see if we added an additional tip. Hence, the ""Eek!  Methinks not.""

We came for brunch, and as all girlie brunches start, we began with bellinis. Good sparkling wine with peach puree. It was brunch, but my like minded ladies wanted to try the oysters here and they were the quality kind, not too oversized and lacking that fishy flavor.

Then between us we ordered the croque madame, french toast, and the piece de la resistance... chicken and waffles! Can you believe Bouchon has a version of chicken and waffles? I blinked twice in disbelief looking at this menu item. 

Everything was not bad, and the service was impeccable. The runny egg on the croque madame was cooked to perfection, neither being too runny or too over cooked. The french toast came in a mini tower much to our surprise.

Breakfast was by far my favorite meal here.  I think my expectations for dinner were simply too high, and frankly there are way too many fine dining options in town to bother giving dinner here another try.

Initially I balked at eating breakfast here, but truth be told, after spending $45 for two at the Grand Lux Café (your basic small buffet experience, not unlike a business Marriott buffet), I figured how much pricier could it be at Bouchon?  Answer:  An additional $5. That's a bargain for the upscale environment, attentive service, and made-to-order food.

Their breakfast beignets are not to be missed, especially with their homemade peach jam.  Their fresh baguettes with butter and jam are also delicious.  You could easily be chowing down in a Parisian cafe.  I was especially happy with the yogurt parfait, which consisted of a layer of sauced berries, topped with vanilla yogurt, topped with granola, all served in an adorable mason jar.  Perfect way to start the day.  The Bud enjoyed the boudin blanc sausage, which was plump, juicy, and well balanced with spices.  The coffee refills were quick, and the coffee wonderfully strong.

In a nice way, so is the Vegas Bouchon as we are all fond of The uber popular chef Thomas Keller's famous French Bistro place in Northern California.

The Vegas Bouchon is living off the fame of its older brethren in Yountville and New York where it gathers huge array of Michelin stars. It didn't get one here for Vegas and I seriously don't know if it ever will deserved one after my dining experience here.

First, it's hard to find this place. As many reviewers pointed out, it's located on the 10th or 11th floor with a balcony garden on the outside of the restaurant for a breath taking view. It's not shown on the hotel directory map and some of the employees thought we were talking about Bouchon bakery instead of the restaurant. 

Seriously, if they don't want you to find it, they are doing a great job of hiding this place. Ask the front desk personnel at Venetian for assistance in finding the restaurant as they seemed to get that question all the time.

The restaurant tried to bill itself as being a fine dining restaurant. It looked the part, but does it play the part? Well, that's when we sit down and found out it's not all it cracked up to be.

The menu was rather unimpressive with the selections. Maybe I was a little jaded since I had a much more fabulous meal in Delmonico's. So I went ahead and ordered a soup, a main course and a puree to match what I had earlier in the day.

Their soup that was recommended to me was their Spinach cream soup. That was actually that best part of the entire course of meal. (you could pretty much guess how the dinner went that night). The soup was very creamy and done right at the seasoning. The texture was very smooth even the color was very bright green to suggest the elegance of the ingredient that mirror of where the veggie came front. I was rather impressed with the start of the meal.

Then in a weird twist, I got a bread on the table. I noticed the cover on the table was a piece of seamless paper and the bread was placed without a plate on top of that paper. It gave me the impression of eating at a cheap 2nd tier restaurant like Buca Di Beppo.

When my Steak Frites came, it started to go downhill from there. Maybe I was placing too much value on a steak that I thought they could have done better, but I was really unimpressed by it. Although it was not bad, the fries itself was not the out of its world that my dining companion tried to convince me all night. I think he was more enamored by it and considering that Anthony Bourdain loved it on an episode of ""No Reservation"" where he was engrossed on how much he loved the fries at this same exact restaurant.

No dice for me on this one.

The puree was even more of a disappointment for me. I thought it was overcooked and very blend. It's like cold mashed potato that is missing gravy. I was very subdued by this point.

The service itself was a miss and maybe the reason why I could never see this place get awarded a Michelin Star. Our waitress disappeared most of the night and when I did spotted her, she was chatting with her coworker at the drink station. They were not really detail or attention oriented as they looked like they are just going thru motions.

The decor itself of the place was not bad as it was classy and have a really nice touch in the elegance department. However I just couldn't get over the tourist trap portion of this place as it is pack like a sardine where our tables are so close to our neighbors. It can get really chatty and loud in this place as we are so close to everyone. The ambiance is really not there when you sit down and tried to have a conversation with your tablemates.

Overall, I wasn't too impressed at this place at all. After dining a few more of other fine dining places, I have to honestly say the service here for the price you are paying are really lacking in this establishment. The food itself you really want to pull for it to do well, but it just taste like a ho-hum with not a difference to seperate itself from the pack. For this kind of price you are paying, it's really upsetting when you think about it.

For Delmonico, I wound up paying $70 for one of the best steak I ever had, an appetizer and a soup that was well worth the fine dining meal. In here, I paid a little bit more around $78 and had one of the biggest let down I have ever had in any dining experience.

Just like we love Elvis and love pulling for Vegas Elvis. It's just that you are pulling for him because you are in Vegas and want to relive its famous glory for what he's known for.

Sadly, it's better off not taking the Vegas version and go for the real deal (as in it's better going to the original Bouchon at Yountville).

Luckily there was no wait, and the decor\/ambience are absolutely gorgeous in a classic, old world charm sort of way -- tucked away on an upper floor in the Venetian, it's a welcome change of scenery compared to Vegas' other fine dining establishments that have a not so discreet view of the casino floor, and yet you're still in the midst of the action on the strip. Unfortunately, the positives of my experience at Bouchon end here.

Service was god awful -- inattentive, unaccommodating, and generally disinterested in making my evening a pleasant one. After being completely ignored for 15 minutes upon being seated, I got up to use the restroom only to find that my table setting had been cleared away by the time I returned. No apology whatsoever. When I finally got my waiter's attention after another 15 minutes of being ignored, he didn't bother to walk me through the menu or the special of the day, and he was unwilling to help me choose a dish\/work with the kitchen to prepare something that would suit my not uncommon dietary restrictions. I finally settled for the trout, although at that point I shouldn't have bothered. The dish was just as bad as the service: the fish was entirely unseasoned and flavorless, and the rudimentary, unmemorable cauliflower amandine felt like an afterthought thrown on top. What the plate lacked in flavor it more than compensated for with a completely gratuitous amount of added fat: as if being served in the veritable pool of butter in which it was pan-fried wasn't enough, the top of the filet was slathered in enough oil for the trout to positively swim in (if it wasn't already fileted down the middle). FYI Mr. Keller: oil is not a substitute for flavor!

Blegh -- meal was such a disappointment that I wasn't even interested in taking the 15% off coupon for the similarly mediocre bakery. Next time I remotely consider patronizing Thomas Keller, it's French Laundry or bust.",1,1,0

Reservations were at 10:15, our party of 6 arrived early at 9:15. No open tables yet which is understandable, but the hostesses reaction was not. She just looked a little confused but was not friendly or accommodating,  just said, no we'll have a table closer to 10:15. We left and 4 of us went back at 9:50. Plenty of tables open, but still would not seat us because we were missing 2 people. Instead of being at a table ordering drinks, and spending money, we just sat and waited messing with the ""bouchon"" embossing machine. really cool toy, you should play with it if you go. just dont get your finger caught in it, or else you will have a pancake for a finger that has ""bouchon"" embossed in it. 

Service - I was expecting 5 star service, but our waitress brooke (at least thats the name on my receipt) was very unfriendly. did the bare minimum, probably because bouchon includes 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more. i would give her 1 star for service. she was only around to take the order, offer desserts and deliver the bill.  She also acted condescendingly towards us when we did not properly pronounce the names of some dishes, and very rudely corrected us. 

Food - I had the trout. Good but not great. probably 3 stars. it had a pretty light flavor and the meat was tender, but it wasnt fantastic.  My GF was adventurous and tried the blood sausage.  It was surprisingly good.  Another friend got the steak frites and it was a little strange to see a steak covered with a heaping mound of french fries. The meat was average.  My other friend got the ham and cheese sandwich and said it was the best ham and cheese he had ever had. I dont know how much that says and unfortunately i didnt try it.

Ambiance - the place was just not inviting to me. It is casual, but the dining room reminded me of a large bathroom or something. Not the kind of place that I want to be having a nice meal. I would definitely say that this is not a romantic restaurant. 

The only highlight of the meal was that they gave us 2 desserts to celebrate the our 2 birthdays and just threw in 2 more desserts for the heck of it. Probably because it was about midnight by that time and they werent going to sell those anyway.

It is served with a Chaucer sauce (correct spelling?) which to me is basically the most tasty gravy I have ever had. The waffle is a sourdough (though not overly so) waffle with bacon and chives in it served with vanilla butter. Very light and fluffy. I enjoyed it so much I came back the next morning to have it. I tried to order it a third morning, but it was Monday and alas they only serve this piece of perfection on the weekend. The coffee is also a standout here. My wife said the pastry she order was really good as well. The service was on point every visit and the decor was tastefully done without being overbearing.

Elegant setting, Thomas Keller, lots of good excitement and beautiful table scrapes. The waiter was very formative. I was with a party of 3 and opted for the sea bream special. 

The table ordered the famous salmon rillette and the house deviled eggs to start. The salmon rillete was unimaginative, lacked seasoning and spice, other than salt (which was in abundance).  Had here been a side of lemon or a splash of freckle minced chives the dish would have been wonderfully better and worthy of a mention to my colleagues who did not join. Again the deviled eggs, beautifully presented, were over salted and underwhelming. I'm a fairly decent chef. Part of my experience with eating out, especially at fine dinning locations, is the wow factor, the discussions that the experience evokes, and going home and trying to recreate the experience. Nothing about the first two plates did that for me.

The main course arrived and looked and smelled amazing. Whole pan cooked seam bream with a side of some sort of corn\/cheese\/bread pan perdu. Three bites into the fish I find the center to be extremely under cooked. I asked the waiter for his interpretation of the cook, as I was unsure if his is the way they serve who fish at 5 star French restaurants. He was embarrassed and took it back, put it under the. Roiled and returned in 5 minutes later. The fish was delicious and that side was out of this world, but the experience was ruined.

Dessert of the the lemon tart with pine nut crust was phenomenal. I would order that again. I will be talking about that one dessert for a whole, but will try to forget the rest of my dinning experience.",0,1,1

We strolled in and were seated promptly, ready to order since we were starving. My wife picked the quiche, while I went straight for the chicken and waffles that a lot of my Yelp friends were raving about. The waiter asked if we wanted a mimosa, and I blurted out yes. I don't usually order and drink mimosas, so I'm not sure what happened.

I was probably just in the moment during brunch. At any rate, the mimosa was good -- as it better be at $12.50 a glass. The complimentary baguette was as hard as a rock, and even the waiter was scratching his head over why many people loved the baguette. Any food that cuts my lip and\/or gums just isn't a good sign.

My chicken and waffles arrived, and the chicken just looked uber juicy and tender from the outside. I could only imagine the inside. It didn't disappoint. Well seasoned, full of flavor, and wafting with aromas, I licked every bone squeaky clean. I had no shame in picking up the chicken with my bare hands and eating it finger lickin' style.

The waffles were okay to me. I was kind of disappointed the exterior wasn't as crispy. But it was the accompanying whipped butter and syrup that really amplified the waffles. I had a bite of the quiche and that was good as well. Overall, a bit of a splurge but a nice brunch.",4,4,4

Wife and I decided that we deserved another day to ourselves in this year of 2011.  For the second time this year, we ditched the two kids to the grandparents and took off to Vegas for the night.  Based on Hazel Q and Hazel F's glowing review and 1520 other mostly positive reviews, we decided that Bouchon was the place to be.  I was so excited to try it for the first time.

Interesting walk up to the restaurant since it was not on the main floor of the Venetian casino.  on our way up the elevator and through the hallway, A and I both realized ""hey, we've been here!""

It was 6-7 years ago and we didn't have a memorable experience here...  upon arrival at the restaurants entrance, we had confirmed our memory of our last experience at Bouchon.  The fact that I didn't remember having dined here spoke volume about our last experience...  only vague memory I had was ""overpriced, under-portioned.""  

We looked at each other as we were being seated and said ""lets keep an open mind and let this experience speak for itself.""  After all, we were not the foodies are now 7 years ago.  Plus, if memory serves me correct, we didn't order a lot of the courses as we were with a large group years ago.  So with a bottle of Sea Smoke in hand, empty stomachs, and open mind (yeah, i stole that from the Chairman on Iron Chef), we sat and decided to really experience Bouchon.

Oh my, and what an EXPERIENCE it was.

The restaurant itself is fairly casual.  After all, it is a French ""bistro.""  what I am trying to say is that it isn't a stuffy highbrow joint.  you can relax and dine in peace.  one minor knock is that there isn't a lot of privacy.  tables are pretty much right next to one another.

The service was top notch.  Our server Julie was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about food and wine.  We even shared some of our prized Sea Smoke Ten with her as she was able to spot it and comment on its cult value.  

After some discussion amongst ourselves and Julie, we decided to go with:

Petit Plateau (1\/2 lobster, 8 oysters, 4 shrimp, 4 clams, 8 mussels)
Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard (2.5 oz)
Roasted Bone Marrow
Salade de Cresson et d'Endives au Roquefort, Pommes et Noix (mixed green salad)
Moules au Safran (mussels in wine and saffron)

Julie asked if we wanted to have the starters together or staggered, we opted for staggered...  a wise choice, more on that later.

we started with the seafood platter.  served with four basic but extraordinary sauces.  cream mustard, vinegar, horseradish, and cocktail.  All the seafood were very fresh, each sauce or combination of sauce and seafood item, provide an unique experience for the taste buds.

Then came the most extraordinary, silky, buttery, food porn like jar of foie gras I've ever had in my life.  served on french bread and sprinkle (self) some sea salt...  I am talking HEAVEN.  I love foie gras and this was the best I've ever had.  the 2.5 oz jar was way more than enough for the two of us.  we asked for more bread and I made sure that every ounce of that salty goodness was eaten...  with no shame.

Now I feel a little sorry for the roasted bone marrow.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVED this bone marrow.  roasted, sliced lengthwise, topped with black pepper veal jus.  BUT, served after the foie gras did it an injustice.  We even debated this point with Julie since I thought the flavors of the foie overpowered the senses and therefore the marrow should have been served first...  however, being that the marrow was the hot dish, the ""proper"" course was to serve the foie first.  In addition, we were already getting really full from the seafood and foie at this point.  So while the foie gets a 11\/10, the marrow ranked 9.5\/10 on my list.

by this time we were already stuffed.  I mean bursting at the seams.  I asked Julie if the chef had fired up the main and if it was possible to cancel the remaining dishes.  Since we elected to have our courses served staggered, they were able to cancel the remaining dishes, no problem.

I LOVED this dining experience at Bouchon and will not forget it for a long time to come.  If for nothing else, one must come to have the foie gras.  it is to die for.",5,3,6

*Elevator from the parking structure directly to the restaurant is a nice touch, especially when you're hungry.

*Went there for Sunday brunch on Mother's Day, so we expected a long wait... and got it.  Was told 1 hour.  Nibbled on a complimentary pastry while we waited and were seated in around a half hour. (Read: don't get discouraged if your wait is long---it's worth it.)

*Stellar service.  It felt like we had 3-4 different people on standby just waiting to refill our drinks, bread, practically anything or ask us how we were doing.  Amazing, considering how busy they were.  The only thing we had to ask for was the check.

*The food took a bit long to come out (then again hunger has a tendency to slow time), but they kept us occupied with bread and this delectable peach preserve (definitely tasted like it was made in-house).

*Everything we had was fresh, expertly balanced, cooked perfectly, and just plain delicious.  You must try the RILLETTES AU SAUMONS (appetizer of fresh\/smoked salmon with baguettes), MOULES AU SAFRAN (mussels in a wine\/saffron broth), CHICKEN & WAFFLES (self-explanatory; far and away the best I've had).

*The prices were very reasonable.  Our appetizer was about $15 and the entrees were about $25.   

*The only down-side was that the tables felt too close together.  It was kind of distracting hearing other conversations loud & clear when you're trying to have your own.  An acceptable inconvenience once you get your food and you're too busy enjoying it to talk much!

3. My main steak frites dish came LOADED with fries (not complaining) accompanied by a cold and depressingly undercooked lump of meat (complaining).
4. I asked to have the dish wrapped to go. I opened the bag this morning to find only that sad brown lump..with no fries (and there were tons left on the plate).

I ate here over the summer so I can't remember everything I ate, but the dishes I do remember are the pork belly, escargot, french onion soup and desserts. 

Pork belly - This was was cooked perfectly. It had about a half inch of fat on it, but the thing melts in yo mouth. So good. 

Escargot - This was the first time I ever tried escargot. It basically tastes like seafood, like a clam or mussel, but dunked in buttah. Oh, and I believe it also came with a small, buttery biscuit. Pretty good. I would try again. 

French onion soup - I loveeeeee FOS. This one was amazing. I think it really comes down to the cheese and broth. This one in particular stood out to be bc of the beef broth they used. Wow, it was sooo good, but sooo bad for me too. 

Dessert - In addition to the cake Bouchon made especially for my mom, they literally came out with eight other desserts for my family to try. It was overwhelming. I don't have the biggest sweet tooth, but they got me with the homemade PUSH UP-like ice cream and creme brulee. I think the best part was the vanilla\/raspberry swirl PUSH UP ice cream. Sent me straight back to my childhood. (This is not on the menu.) Lastly, creme brulee is the only dessert I'll have. The one here was pretty good. (I've uploaded a dark photo of all the desserts that came out. You can see just how much we ate that night.) 

The service here is exceptional. Oh, and I can't forget this night bc this was Game 7 of the NBA championships. Thank God Bouchon had a TV in the waiting area. After dinner, my family and I caught the last 10 minutes of the game. It was a great way to end our dinner.",1,1,1

I had the special appetizer -- slow roasted pork belly with pickled vegetables. It'd disgust a vegetarian -- a hunk of pork fat so creamy that it dissolves in your mouth. I also had the roasted short ribs. This dish was incredible until i got to the strange bed of mystery vegetable underneath it. We drank two bottles of wine, Beaujolais.

SERVICE- We went on a Sunday morning during a long holiday weekend and I would definitely suggesting making a reservation beforehand. We called that morning and waited around an hour. The service when we were seated was great. Our water was always filled and the only ""complaint"" is that the waitress seemed a little miffed that our large party had so many credit cards to split. 

FOOD- Food is where I unfortunately have to dock a few stars. I ordered the eggs benedict which comes with a side salad and three gherkins. While it was good and I ate the entire dish, I didn't feel like there was anything exceptional about it. The salad tasted under-dressed in my opinion. The gherkins were good but not the best I've had, and another friend confirmed it. Maybe my standards are a little high, but considering it is a $$$ restaurant in Vegas, perhaps I expected a little oomph. They do give you a ton of knotty bread with butter and marmalade that you can take to-go, which is awesome because they sell that at the bakery and you have to pay for it. I found that the marmalade went well with my under-dressed salad. 

PRICE- I paid just under $30 for a no frills brunch dish. The price is reasonable considering items are inevitably overpriced on The Strip, but I was more underwhelmed by the food rather than the price.

I can never say no, and will have to come back to Bouchon to check out the dinner service.",0,4,0

I dined at one of his restaurants, Bouchon in Vegas, but I have never written a Yelp review about it. Better late than never, I suppose!

I had all kinds of expectations and for the most part, I was happy. I didn't have that high high of expectations though. After all, most of the big chefs' restaurants in Vegas aren't exactly the same as their main flagship place. I have never been wowed so much in Vegas compared to their original place. Not once.

Bouchon is located at The Venetian Hotel and Resorts. We were there the night before our brunch meal at Bouchon to watch ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and we had sampled some of the goodies from the Bouchons Bakery. We got some Macarons and some other pastries that were pretty yummy. I thought it was better than Jean Philippe at the Aria, and it looked much better than Payard at Caesar as well. I couldn't wait to sit and eat at Bouchon, the restaurant. We got there early around 8:00 AM, and the place was pretty empty. Everyone was probably either still sleeping or too drunk to eat breakfast at 8:00 AM. It was fine by me. The restaurant had a very bistro look to it, and there were some patio seating facing a fountain. It was pretty and not overly fancy. 

We were a party of four and we were in a time constraint as one of my friends needed to leave for his trade show stat at 9:00 AM, and we needed time to go back and gamble some more. I won $329 the night before playing penny slots, and I was hooked and wanted to go back to the Aria resort and played my machine before leaving town. Oh I was treating too because I won ""BIG."" LOL.

The menu wasn't overly big and I found what I wanted to order almost right away. We started with ordering Cappuccino and I couldn't wait for the baguette, butter, and jam. I always expected those goodies if I ate brunch at a French Bistro. It's probably my most favorite thing ever in this world, just a fresh warm baguette, with butter and jam. The bread service was simply superb. They served the bread with homemade cherry jam, and it was so good!! I ate the jam like there was no tomorrow. Well, literally, I wouldn't have that cherry jam tomorrow so I ate all I could that day. It looked like I just broke fast after being on a hunger strike for women's equality for a month looking at the way I ate. It was a sight to be seen apparently. 

When the coffee came, but our Cappuccinos came as Lattes. Obviously our server didn't really pay that much attention to detail. However, I was feeling kind and I just let it go. 

We ordered Salmon Fumé, which was a plate of smoked salmon with toasts, onions, tomatoes, and capers; the moules or mussels cooked in a mustard and white wine sauce; Croque Madame - which was a ham and cheese in between slices of brioche bread, topped with sunny side up egg and Mornay sauce (Bechamel with added Gruyere\/Swiss Cheese); and the corned beef hash. I know right, corned beef hash? So not French. However, Thomas Keller is known to be a pioneer in American cookery influenced with French technique. I thought it would be the best damn corned beef hash I would ever have. All the meals were great. The Salmon was nice but there wasn't that much cooking in that plate. The mussels were pretty incredible but a couple of my friends didn't care for the mustard taste. I liked it. However, The best plate to me hands down was the Croque Madame. It tasted French and it tasted great. It was a simple ham and swiss but yum yum yum. The Mornay sauce really added that extra tang from the Swiss cheese. They knew how to make a great Croque Madame. The corned beef hash was definitely delicious; however, I was a little disappointed that it wasn't minced. The corned beef were cubed and it tasted chunky to me. 

I also ordered some bacon and it never came. Our server was not a good representation of a Thomas Keller's restaurant. He might have lost all his money last night and had to work there to get some food or pay some of his debt. He wasn't born to be a restaurant server. I was also surprised that the food came at different time. I wasn't expecting a service where all the dishes would be unveiled at the same time; however, I thought it would be somewhat together at a place like Bouchon.

Other than that, I thought it was a great meal. I loved it and I wanted more of the cherry jam and bread. If you're in Vegas, do try Bouchon. The prices were so reasonable for a Thomas Keller's restaurant. One suggestion though if you didn't want to gain weight while in Vegas trying all these delicious food - try to walk everywhere! Between the sun and the walking, you surely wouldn't pack up the pounds. You can cool off and burn some more calories at the pool! Only in Vegas I hit 22,000 steps on my fitbit in a day. Whoohoo!",3,3,4

The complimentary bread they gave us was hard and chewy. They couldn't even get the croissants right. Honestly we have a local bakery here in Sandy Utah that does a much better job. The only bread that we thought was good was the cheese danish of our selection of 4 items.

The meat crepes were way too salty and tasted like the ham was full of nitrates and nitrites it was over the top with sodium. 

The smoked salmon eggs benedict was pretty good, it too was a bit salty for some reason.

Now everyone in the restaurant business knows about the Last Meal question. Now Bouchon Bistro may not be my last meal it would be the perfect start for my last day on earth. To me Thomas Keller is one of the culinary gods which is the reason I ate breakfast three times, Dinner once, and snacked at Bouchon Bakery twice. Everyone has that one place where they just feel relaxed and comfortable and they feel like no matter what time it is or whats going on in there life they can feel free at that moment in time. For me its here at Bouchon Bistro. I don't know if its dining outside on there peaceful patio hearing the sounds of the fountain or there impeccable service I receive every time I dine or the food that may not have that WOW factor but makes comfort food taste AMAZING! Or maybe its there coffee that a doctor could classify as crack because its so good. Whatever it is it will keep me coming back and leaving with a smile!

BREAKFAST #1: I ordered the Boudin Blanc which is white sausage with scrambled eggs and there Almond Brioche. To be honest I don't know the difference between white sausage and regular sausage but all I know is the taste difference. It was so juicy and melt in you mouth good that cut like butter. I'm not a big sausage lover but once I put a piece of that big, juicy, and so good sausage in my mouth (Get your mine out of the gutter) it was like love at first site with my mouth and that sausage! Of course the eggs were cooked to perfection!!! The Almond Brioche was sweet and savory and loved every bite of it!!!

BREAKFAST #2: I ordered the Oeuf Au Gratin which is Baked Eggs, Mornay Sauce, Bacon Lardons, tomato confit, petit champignon, and pomme salpicon. In short, this is Thomas Kellers version of Eggs Benedict. The Mornay Sauce is much like Bearnaise Sauce which to me overpowered the dish WAY to much. It was a OK dish, my least favorite of my breakfast choices here, the Mornay Sauce just killed the other ingredients in the dish making it the only ingredient to really stand out.

BREAKFAST #3: Aw this was my favorite! The Sourdough Waffles! It consists of 4 perfect little Sourdough Waffles topped with Fresh Bananas, Toasted Walnuts with Maple Syrup and Tahitian Vanilla Bean Butter on the side. Wow how can something so simple be so good. There Vanilla Bean Butter adds a nice touch from the ordinary butter which I think makes it stand a lone from the rest of the Waffles out there. There maple syrup is oh so good and the toasted walnuts add a nice earthy taste to it along with the bananas. I have a hard time deciding between the French Toast or the Waffles for my favorite dish!

Dinner (Snack): Decided to have a small snack here before catching a flight back to Atlanta, GA and ended ordering a couple glasses of wine, to help with the long flight home :), and the Beignets de Brandade de Morue which is Cod Brandade with Tomato Confit and fried Sage. To me it tasted like a Rolls Royce version of Hush Puppies. Being that it was fried I found it to be a very light dish which I don't find to often with deep fried foods. The Tomatoes and Sage, EAT THE SAGE, goes perfect with the cod. For some reason people put the sage off to the side but they don't put it on the dish for nothing. Overall a good dish!",0,0,0

I don't head out to Vegas often, but when I did go out there, I had heard that the Vegas restaurant was the best. So coming into the restaurant was quite nice in that it's located inside the Venetian hotel(of which on it's own is a nice hotel). The restaurant itself Is a nicely decorated and bright place allowing for lots of natural sunlight to enter through the large windows. 

I had the corned beef hash plate, and it was really really good! It's homemade and served with a fried egg on top, served in a personalized metal pan with a side of toast.  The waiter was professional and provided me individualized Tabasco containers for my party.

I had the steak frites ($36), which was an ample size steak covered with a buttery sauce and with french fries.

I'm not the biggest fan of French food, but I do enjoy it from time to time, and I was in the mood for something different.  I have to say that the whole experience was a disappointment.  

Finding Bouchon can be a challenge.  If you're looking for it, go to the front desk and look to the right. There is a sign with elevators, and thats what you want to take to Bouchon.

Now that we go there, we sat at the bar while they prepared our table, and sat down pretty much on time.  I let the waiter chose for me, as I was feeling optimistic.  I ended up with Veal Cheeks for starters, and the Sea Bass for the main course.  

The Veal Cheek weren't bad, just a disappointment.  The Sea Bass was a bigger disappointment.  I have had much better at much lesser restaurants.  They don't offer a soufflé, which was a little disappointing for a French restaurant.  Sine the meal was pretty lacking, we decided to just catch desert somewhere else.  

The biggest disappointment was the service.  Our food took a long time, over an hour!  And it was really not worth the wait.  If you're looking for fine dining, check out Alize at the Palms.  They treat you a little better, have soufflé, and make a much better food.",0,0,0

I believe this experience changed his view on French food forever.

We decided to go all out. It was my birthday dinner too, so the boyfriend really wanted to treat me out.

Server was great. I loved that they came and explained all the different foods so thoroughly. It was an educating experience as well as a memorably delicious one as well.

We started off with various items:
- Bread: Of course, they have bread. I loved that it was in the shape of leaves.
- Wine: We had the sauvignon blanc from Sancerre... not too sweet, not too dry. Paired well with the various food we ordered.
- Salmon tartare served with these fluffy egg whites, shallots, chives, capers, and creme fraiche: It had so much flavor! It wasn't my favorite tartare, but it was definitely one of the best I've tried.
- 6 oysters and 12 mussels: The oysters came from different regions and they had different flavors. Actually, you can see all of the seafood when you come into the restaurant. The mussels were steamed, then served cold. They were absolutely delicious! They served the seafood with lemons, horseradish, and cocktail sauce. Honestly, I don't think the mussels needed any of that.
- Foie gras saute: It is a pan-seared Hudson Valley foie gras and that day it was served with an apple cider reduction sauce. This in itself is a reason why this Bouchon beats out the Bouchon in LA or Napa Valley. California sucks in the fact that foie gras is banned. But this foie gras saute MELTS in your mouth. The few minutes it takes to eat this up will be the best few minutes of your life. Its fatty consistency is like jello, but once it hits your lips, it just becomes pure joy. The apple cider reduction was sweet and filled with spiced flavors, and just went so well with the foie and the toast. I can eat this all day. Next time I want to try the Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard... Next time.

Entrees:
- Steak Bouchon: It's a 14 oz. New York strip, and it was grilled to a perfect medium rare. It was served with a bearnaise sauce. The sauce wasn't bad, but it wasn't necessary because the steak was aged so well and was flavorful by itself. And of course, it came withe frites. Anthony Bourdain claims that the Bouchon french fries are the best he's had in his life, including the ones served at his own restaurant. I see what he means. We upgraded to truffle fries and the frites themselves were so crispy and delicious. Somehow the entire fry itself seemed to be bursting with deliciousness. Absolute frites perfection.
- Braised pork belly: It was served on top a red wine braised cabbage with vegetables and sweet potatoes. Honestly, I have had better pork belly and the sweetness of the sides were a bit much. I feel like it would have been perfect with a bit of brightness.

We were so full after the meal we couldn't even eat a proper dessert. We were able, however, to get a few items from the Bouchon bakery to take home. We bought an assortment of muffins and cookies. I loved the banana nut muffin as well as the coffee cake. They were all so very delicious.

Honestly I can't wait to come back here and feast on more delicious goodness again. Actually, now I'm dying to go to Thomas Keller's even-more-famous restaurant, The French Laundry, in Napa Valley!",4,2,2

Dinner was great. Waiter and sommelier both very knowledgeable and helpful. And as far as the wine service that's really saying something because the couple dining with us live in SAN Fransico and spend close to one weekend each month in Napa touring and tasting wine, and travel Europe and the world frequently for both business and pleasure. 
Now, on to the food.  Escargot app ...snails a little ""mushy"" , but sauce not overly garlicky and puff pastry ""biscuit "" on top perfect.  Entree.... roast chicken was described as sublime, best chicken they had ever had. Lamb cooked perfectly, with veal demiglass, large portion was delicious. I had the cheese platter for dessert. 3 cheeses,toasted cranberry nut toast points,honey,and walnuts was excellent. Wife had the creme brûlée recommended by the waiter which also was excellent, but my wife makes fantastic creme brûlée at home with raspberries that can't be beat so I almost never order it when we go out. Waiter was ""shocked"" when asked if the dessert wasn't the best ever and I informed him that even though it was excellent, I feel my wife's is better with the addition of a raspberry. 
The wives preferred white wine by the glass, one dry and one semi-sweet, and wine Stewart had them each try 3 before choosing. That level of service almost never happens when ordering by the glass. The husbands were looking for a red for under $100 a bottle to go with the lamb. Many choices, though many more for ever $100 if so inclined. Settled on an excellent California red blend that I enjoyed but my knowledgeable wine hobbyist felt was too alcoholic (15.4%) to pair with the lamb. But I enjoyed even more the banter and knowledge between him and the wine sommelier about the 750 acre vineyard, the wine maker (whom they both had met), and the weather that specific year! Wow, very impressed!
Only complaint was that it was too damn dark to read the menu. Felt Silly that the waiter pulled a flash light out of his apron that we passed around. Fix the lighting!  All in all an excellent meal , excellent staff.",0,0,0

We put our names down, were told it was a 30 minute wait and had a seat in the lobby. There were these mini almond cupcake things to to munch on as we waited.  30 minutes seemed like forever with an empty stomach.

When we were seated, I noticed that the floors were a little dingy and the velvet seats were a bit run down and itchy. Maybe they were going for that old school vintage look. Who knows? I ordered the hibiscus cocktail, which had an actual hibiscus flower in it. I was told by our waiter Aaron that it was edible, and I do have to say that who knew flowers were so tasty? The free side of bread was nothing to rave about. It was served warm, but it was hard and really chewy on the inside.

 The chicken and waffles were TDF!!! The chicken was roasted, but still had crunchy skin. The meat was juicy and tender. The waffles had bacon pieces throughout, which made them savory and sweet with the syrup. It was also served with vanilla bean butter, which I pretty much devoured with my first waffle. I didn't care too much for the gravy. Too salty and took away the taste of the chicken. 

The corn beef hash was also good. It was a good amount of food. Good ratio of corned beef to potatoes. Corn beef wasn't too salty. Two eggs were mounted over this pile of yumminess, which we got over medium. The egg yolk added that extra richness to the dish.

Our server Aaron was the final touch to our experience here. The wait times were a little long for the food, but he assured every one of his tables that the food would be arriving soon. When our meal ended, he took the time to chat with us and tell us about their 3 bakeries thorough out the casino.

Instead we decided to check out  Bouchon, a French restaurant located in the hotel. Bouchon can be found at the Venezia tower of the Venetian so it's a little far from the entrance, but very close to the hotel room elevators. 

As soon as you walk in, you'll notice a small lobby area to perhaps have some coffee or dessert. You're immediately welcomed by a friendly host who has someone escort you to your table. The restaurant is nicely designed with beautiful colors, mild lighting, and nice high ceilings. It  brought back some old memories of my Paris trip years ago. 

At your table you have your obvious choices of waters, from house to sparkling. I never liked Pellegrino so we had the ""house"" water. Bouchon has some damn good filtered watered. A server quickly comes with a warm baguette and butter. The baguette was terrific. Not overly buttered and so crisp. 

For our entrees, the wife had the Canard (Duck) something something. I can't remember the full description, but it was a roasted duck served with spinach and some small vegetables. The spinach was sauteed in some sort of tart sauce that we just couldnt get used to. But, the duck was magnificent. The meat was cooked perfectly, it was juicy and the skin was so flavorful and crisp. Probably the best duck I've ever had. 

Pour moi, I had the Steak Frites. It's a pan-seared flatiron steak served with a pile of french fries. This steak is a chewy steak, but if you get it Medium rare to Medium, it'll be perfect. I loved my steak, but I think they got carried away with the fries. I wish there was some vegetables with it. I had to order sauteed spinach on the side. Still, I really enjoyed it. I suggest getting a glass of red wine to go with this dish. 

For the grande finale, we had their dessert special, if I recall correctly, called the Bouchon. It's 3 brownies topped with 3 different ice creams. Vanilla, Cinnemon, and Mint. The brownies were so good. The ice cream were pretty simple, but had the texture like they were homemade. The mint one was horrific though. It was like putting a bush of mint leaves into your mouth. 

I wish we ordered the French onion soup. Everyone around us was ordering it. It must be their popular item. Still, nice atmosphere and delicious food make Bouchon a new favorite. If you're staying at the Venetian, look out for a 15% off coupon in your room. We totatly missed it. damnit...",13,7,8

My wife and wandered in for a late brunch on a weekday and had a simply superb brunch. I ordered the garden breakfast (eggs, pastry, brioche toast, potatoes, spinach, fruit, juice, coffee), and she the eggs (eggs, meat, potatoes).  

We were blown away, especially by the pastry and the potatoes.  
Hers:  fluffy, savory potatoeness wrapped in the perfect coating and fried to crisp perfection.  Mine, skillet potatoes fried with onions and so much butter that ""caramelized"" takes on a whole new meaning.  Truly a delight, and truly something you can't get at any run-of-the mill diner.

Oh, yeah, and the brioche toast and croissant.  Let's just say that Bouchon is known for its pastries and you know why.  I think the only better croissant I'd had was in France, and that taste memory was probably enhanced because I was in France.  Once again, though, I think if you add a creamery's worth of butter to any dish, you get good results.

We ate outside next to the fountain, and the atmosphere met the cuisine perfectly.  Service was friendly and easy.

What we really noticed is the price:  Our total bill was about $40; my meal INCLUDED coffee and juice.  When you go to a fine dining restaurant, one can expect to pay about 4-5 times what you'd pay at a ""family"" restaurant ($10-20 steak and potatoes at Chilis = $50-80 steak and potatoes at Morton's... you get the idea).  But here, if you'd go to Country Kitchen and order eggs, meat, potatoes, coffee, and juice, you'd certainly pay $10-15 a person.  And this is WAY better than Country Kitchen.

How do you rate brunch?  Can you compare a delicate croissant and perfectly creamy potatoes to an awesomely greasy chicken fried steak, eggs, and biscuits and gravy that you ate as recovery food at some mom and pop diner for $5.99?   Both are excellent at some level.  I think what makes Bouchon's brunch so excellent is that you can't just get it anywhere, and while Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives food may be an equally good find, the Bouchon experience is one you must try.

And order potatoes.  And bread. And pay no mind about the butter.  Even when you get home from your Vegas vacation and learn you've gained 2 pounds in 4 days.  It's totally worth it.",0,1,0

I'd been to Keller's French Laundry in Yountville years ago, but this was our first time in Bouchon Las Vegas, highly recommended by my business partner\/editor Michael Perlis, and conveniently located in the Venetian where we planned to stay for my husband's recent November birthday. 

It started like this:

Sommelier Eric, who also served as our very attentive waiter, opened a 2000 Lynch Bages at our table. We had brought in the wine, which was not on their wine list (wine 101ers note that it is not in good taste to bring in a wine that is available on a restaurant's wine list) and Eric offered to decant it. I told him I preferred to let it open in our glasses as once it's decanted there's no going back. (Not every wine needs decanting, which can age a wine significantly, so if I'm unsure swirling is safer. It took the wine 10 minutes to open up, and when we got to the last glass, I agreed with Eric, it could have been decanted.)

Now, back to our meal, as we decided to order oysters Eric suggested we go with a nice Champagne. I agreed, and it would give our Bordeaux more breathing room. After that Ed ordered the French onion soup. Then, compliments of the Chef de Cuisine Josh Crain, much to our delight we were served some incredibly mouth-watering appetizers:

Assiette de Charcuterie - served with pickled vegetables, Dijon mustard & petite baguette.

Pâté de Campagne - country style pâté with watercress, cornichons, radishes & Dijon mustard.

Saucisson du Jour - house-made sausage.

Dinner happened like this:

Mama Bear had: Steak Frites - pan-seared prime flat iron, caramelized shallots and maître d'hôtel butter, served with French fries. (I had the sautéed Brussels sprouts instead, another of Eric's suggestions. I couldn't finish every scrap of my dinner...but I really wanted too!)

Papa Bear had: Steak Bouchon - grilled Snake River Farms' eye of the rib and sauce Béarnaise, served with French fries. (Ed dipped his fries into his Béarnaise too...we all did.)

Baby Bear had: Pâtes du Jour - fresh hand-made pasta that night was made with veal, Wagyu beef, leeks and fennel. (My daughter commented that she had never had pasta like this in her life. We agreed. It was incredible.)

Desserts to Put Us Over the Edge:

Again with Chef Crain's compliments, our group of three was served these oh-so-delightful treats:

Profiteroles - vanilla ice cream & chocolate sauce.

Chocolate Mousse.

Pear Tart and sorbet.

Pumpkin parfait.

The next day, as we were missing Bouchon, we had the ham and cheese croissants from the Bouchon Bakery!

The Surprise Kitchen Tour:

If you follow along this public photo album link from Facebook https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.10204323641438583.1073741889.1455706632&type=1&l=a8bf3835d8 you can get a pretty good idea of the food, and the incredible tour.

We started in the well-lit and sparkling clean kitchen where we met Chef Crain and dozens of kitchen staff preparing and plating the dinners. Also in the same kitchen was a monitor showing three kitchens all at once - live video of other Thomas Keller kitchens! If that wasn't enough, there was a case that held the daily menus for the other restaurants too.

From there, we happily pretended to work off our dinner by strolling past chefs preparing leg of lamb, vegetables and dozens of pastries that would also be served up in their bakery.  

We strolled more...passing giant mixers, meats, cheeses and more pastries...until we came to the end of our tour in one of three private dining rooms, for both intimate and large meeting groups.

We had come full circle. We were back at the entrance of Bouchon, with nothing left to do but thank Eric and the management for getting us started on a gastronomic discovery we had no comparison for.  Bravo Bouchon.",1,1,1

My go-to is their $23 breakfast, which comes with eggs, bacon, sausage, potato croquettes, toast, your choice of pastry, juice, and coffee.  So worth every penny - it is delicious and filling!  The last time I went, I chose their strawberry croissant for my pastry.  Just one word to describe it: WOW!  So very tasty :)  On my last visit, I also got their yogurt parfait, which came with berries and granola.  I really, really liked it.  To top it off, service here is top-notch.  

I was going back and forth between 4 stars and 5 stars.  I decided on 4 because although the food and service are top notch, I like when the ambiance is either cozy or luxe, and it's neither here, but rather has a bit of a casual feel for the type of restaurant it is.

FYI, the restaurant is in the Venezia tower, and there are separate elevators in the Venetian lobby near registration that you can take to get there.  Once you get off the elevators, it's a nice walk down a really nice corridor to the restaurant.  There is also another way to get there from the Venetian parking garage, if I recall correctly.  In the past I've had to wait for a table, but I went at opening on a weekday on my last visit, and there was no wait whatsoever.

The dish also came with 4 slices of waffles. I was a little thrown off by the bacon and chives baked INTO the waffles, but they were still good because of the fluffiness. The 2 sauces really completed the dish - savory gravy for the chicken, maple syrup for the waffles. HUGE portions - can't really see anyone finishing this on thier own... 

French toast - presentation was beautiful!!! Hello french toast tower!!! Layers and layers of french toast with cooked apples squeezed in between each layer! Just a warning - small portion and very sweet!!!

Foie gras was bland. Some of the worst I've ever had. Wtf? Tasteless and like refrigerated lard. Lacked the wonderful textures and nuanced flavor that good foie gras has. Sigh.

Alas, I got food poisoning and couldn't eat for the rest of the week. Look up ""DSP."" Yep, that's what the ER told me I got. In fact it's Sunday now and I'm just barely turning the corner. Dining here dampered my Vegas vacation to say the least.",1,0,0

My wife and I got there early and were expecting a friend to join us.  They originally told us the wait would be about 40-45 minutes, but actually were ready to seat us after about 15-20 minutes.  At the time, it was just the two of us, since our friend hadn't arrive yet.  We told the hostess (a younger woman) that we wanted to wait a while, so our friend could arrive.  The hostess was nice and said that would be fine.  To me, it actually benefits the restaurant more, because we wouldn't be taking up space just sitting at a table waiting.  So we waited in the waiting area for another 15-20 minutes for our friend at which point she said she was about 5-10 minutes away.  So I went up to the desk and told the hosting person there (an old lady who appeared to be the supervisor) that we were ready to get our table... but she rudely told me that all 3 of us had to be physically present in order to sit us at a table (and\/or put our name back into the mix).  After another 5-10 minutes passed, our friend still had not arrive and my wife went and talked to the original hostess who was going give us a table (with just the two of us, even though we were a party of three), and discovered that our name had been completely removed from the waiting list, but luckily she remembered us and sat us anyways (still without our friend being there).

I had high expectations for this place, because I have another friend that is into cooking and thinks that Thomas Keller is one of the greatest chefs...  One of the cool things for my visit here was that Thomas Keller was actually in the restaurant, but unfortunately it wasn't him who was cooking the meal.  He came in during the middle of my meal and was actually a customer (although, he probably didn't have to pay for his meal).

We went during the weekend brunch.  Our friend and I had the chicken and waffles (since according to my friend,  the chicken is supposed to be a signature dish at a Thomas Keller restaurant).  My wife had a ham steak and eggs...  The chicken and waffles was good, but the gravy sauce got pretty salty towards the end.  My wife's ham steak and eggs looked pretty normal though.

To me, this place falls under the whole name branding marketing tactic...  You can find similar quality items for a cheaper price elsewhere, but here you're basically paying more because it's a Thomas Keller restaurant.  The food was good, but just wasn't impressive for the amount that you pay.  And for me, there wasn't a ""wow"" factor where it would make me want to go back here again unless someone I go with wants to try it out.",2,0,0

Then I had the pork belly main.  The pork had zero taste.  It was made sous vide which means that whoever seasoned it screwed up the entire batch.  I returned it.

This happened on 7\/26.  

Whoever is reading this at Bouchon please forward to Keller.  The guy who prepared the pork belly needs to be reamed out.  Keller is arguably the top chef in America.  This was an embarrassment to him and to American cuisine.  I can understand if a dish seasoned at the last minute in the heat of service is off but a sous vide dish?  Basically no salt at all???? Inexcusable.

So I returned it (no charge) and got the bone marrow.  The toast was burnt.  OK that happens.  I got new toast.  The bone marrow sauce (red wine vinegar I think) was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  Truly spectacular.  Keller is the man.  

The chocolate mousse (which was in a terrine) was amazing.

The red wine by the glass was too woody.  Get a better producer.  People drink cru bourgogne young - it should not be woody.

Keller needs to visit Vegas, get  a megaphone and scream at the staff.  Bouchon is an American treasure.  These kinds of mistakes should not happen.",1,2,1

I honestly did not expect to go there this weekend since I was spending my MLK weekend with a bunch of college students on a budget (myself included - and I am even more broke now) but after debating, we realized we did want to eat at a nice restaurant - I was thrilled.  However, I was also super nervous since not only were we all on a budget but I was with a bunch of boys who can't stand small proportions (they didn't complain thankfully). Naturally, Bouchon was completely booked so we showed up at 5:00 and crashed in the lounge.  It was actually kind of comfortable, we just hung out on the couches and snacked a little until we were hungry enough for dinner.

After nibbling on some of the bread (so good! warm and fresh), drinks, and the smoked salmon terrine (amazing! - they also brought out more croutons for us), we finally ordered dinner. Wow, the fries were so good. I usually don't eat fries but I was munching on everyone's fries around me.  I shared the trout with a friend, it wasn't too oily and the green beans were nice and tender.  I got to sample some of the steak, gnocchi, and mussels as well and all were superb.  I didn't get to try the salmon but my friend and fellow yelper, Doug K, who is normally a quantity over quality kinda guy said it was so good that his meal was definitely worth the quality over quantity.

Overall, service was pretty damn good for being a group of boisterous college students who weren't even seated at real tables.  I had a bad cold so they kept coming by to refill my pot of hot water which was really sweet :)  Our waittress came by to check on us several times to make sure we had enough space and whether or not we were ready for our food.  We were honestly there almost 3 hours just hanging out and they were super nice and made us feel very comfortable.  I can't wait to go back again except hopefully, I'll be able to get reservations next time.

Edit: Went here again with the boy WITH RESERVATIONS THIS TIME. It was amazing. Again. Lamb dish was a little too small but the duck confit hors d'oeuvre was incredible. As for the dessert, our waiter brought us something ""off-the-menu"" (Bouchons) and we gobbled it up in 30 seconds. absolutely delicious.

I am impressed.  I didn't what to think initially but there was not one item that I, or any of the other girls, ordered that we were not pleased with.  The oysters we got were an assortment but by far the best oyster would have to be the Chelsea Washington oyster.  It as though I slurped up a piece of buttery goodness.  My mouth is watering thinking of it.  If I could go back in time, I would order a dozen more of those.  My flat iron steak came with a mountain of fries.  The meat, which was medium, was SO good considering it was a flat iron steak.  The girls tasted my steak and were in love.  The endless fries were crispy and a delicious compliment.  I had a bite of the pork chop, which was amazing.  Tender, succulent, juicy...the way pork should taste.  As always, any where that serves cheese will always get me so I ended my perfect meal by ordering the three cheeses for dessert: Vallée d'Aspe (sheep's milk), Mt. Tam (cow's milk) and the Onetik Bleu (sheep's milk).  They were magnificent!  I thought the prices were incredibly reasonable, service was friendly, and the food was absolutely delightful.

oysters
drinks
service


Their duck breast is salty and to be honest for $35 I'll buy 2 whole chinese ducks which are more flavorful and 1\/10th the price (per pound).

Everything else imo is overpriced so while it's a good place to relax the food is not that well executed as one with a good palate and the recipes from the Bouchon cookbook.

The baker split the croissant and placed sliced apples topped with a cinnamon sugar crumble and baked the pastry to a toasted consistency. Absolutely amazing! The cream cheese danish was a flaky pastry shaped similar to a cupcake and filled with a cream cheese filling. Again, absolutely amazing.

I have been hearing good things from friends and other about this place, so I decided to place reservations for my friend bachelor's dinner. First I must state that the service is impeccable, that's why i gave it 3-stars. The bread was awesome, I loved the way they presented, twisted-style french bread. So we started with a few appetizers, french onion soup, endive salad, and fois gras. I got the french onion soup, and OMG that was sooo freakin' SALTY. That immediately tainted my taste buds, i thought it was just me but my other friends that had it also agreed. So, i was like ok, maybe that's just how they do it and it just not for me. My other friend got the salad, and he said that was way overpowered with dressing and bleu cheese. He said that it was like each sliver of endive was drenched in dressing, yuck! Maybe the favoring is just not for us? The fois gras, is a spread, not actual fois gras streak, so read carefully before you order that.

Moving on to the main courses, we had 3 different entrees. I had the pan roasted leg of lamb, another had the trout, and 5 others had the rib-eye steaks. I was intrigued by the leg of lamb b\/c it was accompanied by hen-of-woods mushrooms, which I had never had. I took a bite of lamb with a little bit of sauce, and it was good a little salty but it was cooked well. I took another bite with a little bit of the spinach and mushrooms which layed in a pool of sauce, and OMFG that was once of the SALTIEST things i had eaten. It honestly, made my stomach cringe. It tasted like i was eating a pack of the flavoring you put into your instant ramen noodles. YES, it was that salty. I'm not a that much of a picky eater but damn that was not good at all. I had all my friends taste my dish and they all agreed. And the steak, wasn't that impressive either. Rib-eye? Where's the marbling of the meat, and the flavor?

Have you ever had a ho-hum experience at a place and thought afterwards, I just made the wrong choices? I strongly feel that the mediocre dining experience I had at Bouchon fell into this.

I am a Thomas Keller devotee. I watch him cook on Youtube, I buy his cookbooks, I'd like to shake his hand. I was excited for my 1st dine in at one of his restaurant group.

I'm a dinner type of chap and made a reservation for such, despite a majority of Yelpers reviewing the brunch offerings.

Debut: 
An amazing wheat bread twist with imported butter came compliments of the house. I ordered the Terrine de Fois Gras de Canard to start. Chilled Fois Gras Pate served in a mason jar, with toasted baguette and coarse salt. Never had Fois in this fashion and I must admit it was a smidgeon too intense.  Not to be discouraged, I selected the Fois Gras Saute and it was very good. Pan Seared Fois in a savory brown gravy.

Plats Principaux:
For supper, the Truite Poele. Sautéed rainbow trout, on a bed of greens and sunflower seed, in a brown butter sauce.
A very average flavored offering.

Le Dessert:
Chocolate Mousse Ice Cream, vanilla creme anglaise, short bread dusting. Uninspired.

So my friend, her bf, and I were in town to run in the half marathon. We were trying to locate the restaurant and of course, we got lost. We finally found it in the Venezia Tower. We made a reservation for 9PM, a late dinner, really a midnight supper for someone who had just arrived from the east coast.

We arrived slightly ahead of schedule so we were told to wait until our table opened. After a few minutes, we were promptly seated.  The menu is what you expect from a really good bistro.

Since I was running 13.1 miles the next day, I decided to pass on the booze, which was a bummer.  They do have an extensive list as expected.  So the next time I'm there, I will definitely order a bottle.

For me onion soup is a staple at any French bistro.  I love onion soup!  Who doesn't like the melted cheese on top? Mmm...so good.  (And bad for you.)

My friends's bf had the chicken. You have to have chicken at a Thomas Keller restaurant. My friend got the mussels. All were great bistro dishes. I got the trout with toasted almonds. It was done perfectly. The only problem I had was that it may have been too much, which is a good problem to have.

Unfortunately, it was very salty which made it difficult to eat.  The cranberry sauce was excellent, with just the right amount of sweet and tart flavor, and the mashed potatoes were, well, just your standard mashed potatoes (albeit freshly made).

I love Bouchon. I really do. I frequent the Bouchon in Beverly Hills, but we came here on my last Vegas trip. We were seated on the outside patio and service was completely LACKING. A good amount of time passed before our server even popped up. We placed our orders and she dropped off some jam and butter shortly after. What was missing was the bread. I'm also not sure why we didn't have bread plates because I've always had them on my table on prior visits. Our bread came way later and just a bit before our entrees. My chicken and waffles were great as usual (they've changed it a bit since my last time ordering them. They add bacon and chives to the waffles now). But back to my main point, water glasses would sit empty for a good amount of time before being refilled. It was hard to catch someone's eye to get their attention. We sat around waiting to grab someone's attention just to get a box. I'm not sure if service would have been different inside, but it was extremely lacking at this location compared to my previous visit about a year and a half ago (or to their other locations for that matter).

I'll have to give them another chance since I seriously adore their food if I'm in Vegas again, but for now, I'm sticking with the Bouchon in BH for my weekend brunches.

Note: They do not take reservations for brunch at this location either.",1,0,0

I went here yesterday (Black Friday).  The only time that could make it here was for breakfast.  I tried to make reservations but Bouchon doesn't take reservations for breakfast.

My friend and I arrived at around 8:30am and were seated immediately.  It wasn't very crowded.  Where I was sitting I had a terrible view.  I was facing the entrance area.  I didn't even know that there was a pool view because we were so far back.  If I had known there was a better seating area, I would've asked for it.  Anyway, we ordered coffee and water as we looked at the menu.  Our waitress Arleen A. was nice and told us the specials.  My friend and I looked at the online breakfast menu before we went to the restaurant, so we had already decided what we wanted - Le Jardin and Petit Déjeuner Jardinière, but the restaurant wasn't serving the breakfast menu.  They were only serving the brunch menu which doesn't have what we wanted, so I ended up ordering the Petit Déjeuner Américaine and my friend got the French toast with blueberries.  The Petit Déjeuner Américaine comes with the following:

two eggs any style (I ordered my over easy but the yolk was a little over done) 
3 baked bacon strips
2 country sausage links
1 sliced toasted brioche
2 potato croquettes
1 pastry (I ordered the apple croissant which was absolutely the best!)
fresh juice (I ordered orange juice - really good)
Bouchon blend coffee

The best thing was the apple croissant - so delicious!  The breakfast itself was good - typically eggs, sausage, etc.  The bread - brioche - was nothing special.  I noticed that the online menu is slightly different than the restaurant menu, so if you're planning your meal based on the online menu - DON'T.  The prices don't even match.  Online my breakfast is listed as $22 but at the restaurant menu it's $23.

Once we were done eating and ready for the check, our waitress Arleen asked if we wanted the coffee to go.  I did but my friend didn't.  I also asked if it would be ok if I took the baguette too (I didn't get a chance to try it because my breakfast was so big).  Arleen got us two fresh baguettes with butter and jam along with the coffee to go!  Sounds like a wonderful end to a nice breakfast, right?  Well it's not over yet.  Arleen asked if we'll be charging the breakfast to our room and I said no I wanted to pay with my Amex.  I get extra points when I use my Amex at restaurants.  Arleen - who is very loud - then asked for my ID.  I've never been asked for my ID at a restaurant before so I thought that it was weird and I was bit annoyed that I have to go through my purse for my ID.  She quickly glanced at it and walked away to charge my card.  I felt like I was being profiled.  There was no need to loudly ask for my ID.  The people sitting right next to us who could clearly hear what she was saying.  My friend was really embarrassed for me.  If I had known she was going to ask that, then I would've just charged it to my room (yes I was staying at the Venetian).  It's in poor taste of Arleen to end a nice meal on a negative note.

Overall, I would come back here again but for dinner and I would charge it to my room or just pay in cash.",0,0,0

My husband and I reserved the Bocuse Room for our wedding reception. We communicated mainly through email with Debbie, the Private Dining Sales Manager and met with Aaron, the dining operations manager, in person a few times to see the restaurant and such. The arrangements were completely seamless and stress-free.  Debbie was so so perfect in everything that she did (thank you, Debbie- so love you!).  In fact, choosing Bouchon for the reception was the best and easiest decision of the entire wedding. We didn't worry about a single thing nor did we have to do anything. Debbie asked me in advance where we wanted everyone to be seated, emailed me a PDF of the room to fill out for seating, as well as had me bring our place cards and wedding favors the day before and they set up everything perfectly. I cannot stress how impressed I was with their process.

Aaron facilitated the running of our event.  The whole time, all I was told was, ""It's your day... Of course, it's your day"" from both Aaron and our servers. They kept making sure that we knew how special our occasion was to us as well as to them and that they were dedicated to making us as well as our guests as happy as possible. Our wedding was small- only a tight group of 31 guests and our family of six. There were four tables with a maximum capacity of 40 people, so it was perfect. The room was a good size, very spacious for all of us yet small enough so that everyone was just a few steps away from the other table for socializing.

We had our two toddlers in tow, neither of whom slept much that day despite waking up at 5:00 that morning, so they were not easy to deal with. Not to mention they were making the rounds and hitting people up for goodies, like the handmade chocolates one of the my besties did for the wedding. So they were both sleep-deprived and hyped up on sugar. What a really bad combination. The staff was very forgiving and really patient with the two of them constantly running around the room. Our server gave us crayons and coloring paper and even though it probably only occupied them for 15 minutes or so, it was still a much-appreciated reprieve.

Everyone had so much fun at both the ceremony and the reception. Our guests also could not believe how on top of everything the staff was. Never once did anyone have to request a refill. My aunt and mom loved their bread so much that I asked if I could have some to-go for them and was given a large bag full of warm bread. It was wonderful. Even though I was just okay with most of the dinner, most of my guests were really happy with the food, which is most important. I had people talking about the wedding for days. Several wanted Vegas weddings after that.

My bestie wants to write a 5-star Yelp review just because of the service and wants to have her anniversary dinner there as well. Thank again so much for everything, Debbie, Aaron and the entire staff of Bouchon!",2,2,2

Breakfast day one - omelette with tomatoes, spinach and cheese. Three egg omelette that came with a delicious leafy green salad. The omelette was cooked perfectly. Fluffy and tasty all the way through. The salad was dressed with olive oil and herbs, perfectly seasoned. I have a weakness for bread so I easily consumed a full loaf of the fresh baguette that was delivered warm warped in linen. The butter was the best I'd ever eaten. 

Our server Elaine was tremendous! Incredible attentive, friendly and professional. We were so thrilled with breakfast that we asked her to help us with reservations for 7 that evening and she took care of everything. A great representative of your company!

Dinner later that evening- pasta of the day with a salad. Homemade pasta mixed with fresh vegetables. Delicious! Two desserts one chocolate mousse and the other ice cream. Fancy names for both but my foodie abilities are very weak. Incredible dinner with again fantastic service!

The next morning I got the same omelette and salad and it was ridiculously good. I asked to wrap the remaining bread and my server brought me two fresh loaves, cut up and in a carry bag with two small cups of butter. I ate the entire bag during my flight home.

I am so not a morning person, otherwise I would brunch more often.  Since this was a special occasion, I rolled out of bed and met our group at The Venetian for breakfast.

There were 15 of us!  You'd think that the service might be lacking because of this, but that wasn't the case.  Our server was awesome, our drinks were always full and everything was great.  No easy feat with a large group.

The restaurant is very cute.  It's pretty big, and they also have a patio.  Next time I want to sit out there.

I found the food prices to be very reasonable, especially for the quality of the ingredients and the portion sizes.  However, I do think their beverages are overpriced.  $12.50 for a small bloody mary? I know this is the Strip, but that's crazy.  My waffles were only $12!

That aside, the food was fantastic! We started out by sharing some of the pastries and the beignets du jour (choice between raspberry or cinnamon sugar).  The beignets were larger than I expected and very good.  They came served with a thick chocolate dipping sauce and jam on the side.  Definitely worth the $7!

The special of the day was crab hash with summer vegetables and topped with 2 eggs.  Quite a few people in our party ordered this, and it seemed like everyone enjoyed it. I had the ""Gaufres au Levain,"" which was sourdough waffles topped with fresh strawberries and served with maple syrup and Tahitian vanilla bean butter (OMG!).  These were quite possibly the best waffles I've ever had - and only $12! There were 4 small(ish) waffles and it was plenty of food.  I would definitely order these again.

I have eaten at several Thomas Keller establishments around the country, and while in Vegas for a convention, I decided to escape the endless corporate buffets I had been subsiding on all week and seek out something a little more satiating.  I managed to con one of my co-workers into coming with me; she was very pregnant at the time.  I was a little bit concerned as it has been my experience in many Las Vegas 'clone' haute cuisine restaurants that the price is certainly high, the food is passable, and the service can be abysmal.

The restaurant is in the Venetian, and is a beautiful recreation of a French Bistro.  Black and white tile floors and nice display cases show off the pastries and the fruits de mer.  We were seated immediately and were engaged by the server in very short order.

He was fantastic, I wish I could remember his name, but he was truly passionate about the food and very knowledgeable.  He was very quick to supply my colleague with some fresh bread of her choosing to satisfy her needs.  He also was well-versed in wines and was able to explain menu items to my dining companion, who was a fine-dining novice, in terms that did not intimidate or patronize her.

My first course was the charcuterie plate, which was fantastic.  A very healthy portion of a number of fresh, house-made sausages and confit with some amazing pickles and spreads.  They were also generous with the mini-baguettes, I hate it when charcuterie plates are stingy with bread.

For the second course, I went with the waiter's recommendation of a platter of a half-dozen or so oysters, again, very great suggestions and very fresh.

For my main course, I had the short ribs, which evaporated into rich, meaty love in my mouth.  The waiter paired up a fantastic red to go along with it, played off the marrow perfectly.  One of the best servings of short ribs I've ever had, including my own, which I can make pretty damn well.

For dessert, we had a selection of pastries, among them profiteroles, which were perfect with the very fresh dark coffee they served me with it.  The waiter was kind enough to call an ambulance which whisked me away after I entered a post-dinner food coma.

Disappointing to be honest.  The creme brulee had almost a soupy texture, not a custard and the top sugary crust was minimal.  Also went with their daily special which was 3 petite brownies, peanut butter crumble, peanut butter caramel, ice cream and baked apples.  It wasn't very cohesive and the dish wasn't very French.  I should've went with the profiteroles.  Maybe next time.

A complimentary baguette is served first with creamy butter and smooth jam - yum! I had the HACHIS DE BOEUF (merguez sausage hash served with two eggs) and it was savory and flavorful.

We should have known when we walked in that Bouchon would not be the appropriate brunch spot for a bunch of hungry grad students with a limited budget. But we were enticed with free samples of very yummy bread and a friendly host that changed our wait time from 20 minutes to ""we can seat you shortly."" 

Once we were seated, it didn't take us too long to figure out how out of place we were. Then we took a look at the menus and I can only speak for myself by saying that my jaw dropped a little. I mean, this is the level of fancy that you let your boyfriend take you to because you know he's paying. The night after Vegas partying I could have been satisfied with the dollar menu at MickeyD's.

Our waiter neglected to bring us our bread until we had to ask. This might have been partly our fault because we were waiting on two more people to join our party. I find it partly ironic that the bread is eaten on the table. Do fancy people really allow their white linens to have crumbs all over it?! 

I had the corned beef and it honestly wasn't anything to write home about. I liked that it was the chunky kind rather than a hash, but the diced corned beef was dry. It came with potatoes and topped with an egg whatever way you like it.

I'm simply tired of overpriced and poorly executed celebrity chef restaurants that look dressed up and ready for the prom, but deliver a night at home in front of the Playstation. 

There are however a few exceptions that consistently bring it because they focus on the basics. Now before all you Vegas snobs get your underwear in a knot; I base my Vegas dining on what I know, what's recommended and what I read. I'm willing to branch out and try new places, but I can't justify spending $400 on a 16 course degustation menu at Joel Robuchon on current budget.

With that said, I was fortunate enough to be staying at the Venetian during my last trip and upon arrival, immediately dumped my bags and headed downstairs to Bouchon for a seat at the bar. Bouchon is the vision of world-renowned chef Thomas Keller of Napa's French Laundry fame. Fashioned after the original Bouchons of Lyon after which it was modeled, Bouchon just delivers great rustic bistro classics with only the best seasonal ingredients.

Dinner was roasted leg of lamb with a ragout of coco beans, piquillo peppers, merguez sausage and lamb jus. Everything was spot on and i washed it all down with several glasses of Hall 05' Cab. 

Basically Bouchon was so good, I ended up there for breakfast the next three days in a row. It won best breakfast in Las Vegas for a reason. Breakfast eats included: corned beef hash with two eggs over medium and brioche toast; white sausage with scrambled eggs, croissant and beurre noisette; and a spinach and bacon quiche. And the aforementioned bread and butter was also taken down at breakfast with crazy good in-house cherry preserves. 

Bouchon is about as good as Vegas dining gets. Big fan. Will go back again and again when in town.",2,1,3

Down to what really matters, what we had..

DRINKS:
Bouchon & Nirvana - both were okay. My friend wasn't too impressed with her Bouchon, but I liked my Nirvana. Tasty froth that reminds me of Orange Julius. I can't find their drink menu so I can't tell you the ingredients.

FOOD:
MACARONI AU GRATIN (6.50) - Superior macaroni. Baked just so the cheese is slightly crisp, the pasta perfect. I could've eaten that all night.
HARICOTS VERTS (6.50) - Kids, eat your veggies. But these were overcooked, therefore, sat untouched for a while until I realised I needed to be eating greens.
STEAK FRITES (33.50) - Well seasoned, nicely cooked and perfectly paired with frites. And dang, those were some seriously addictive fries, but then again, I am a french fry addict.
MOULES AU PISTOU (27.50) - Whoa. Talk about mussels. Tons and tons of them which were sweet and delicious. I love seafood drowning in white wine. And more pomme frites. God help me.
CROQUE MADAME (18.95) - I thought it was tasty, but my friend thought it wasn't as good as other croque madames she's had. Again, more fries. Thank goodness our waiter talked us out of getting another side of them. Whew!

DESSERTS:
PROFITEROLES (9.50) - I thought the puffs were a bit hard, but they were fun to eat. I liked the ice cream a lot but I think it was more that it felt good in my mouth.
BENEIGHTS (?) - These aren't on the menu but were a special for the night. Yummy. They reminded me of malasadas!
PETITS FOURS SECS & FLAN (complimentary) - Because it was my friends birthday, Bouchon gave us a plate of petits fours secs and flan. We liked the petits fours a lot. Every single one had a fun texture and light taste. The flan was yummy. Not too heavy with a really smooth consistency.

SERVICE: We were promptly seated as we arrived at our reservation time of 8:30pm. Our waiter (I forget his name) was attentive, knowledgeable and quick. He brought my friend and I navy blue linens instead of going with their house white, he explained the cheeses to us which we were going to have for dessert but ended up going with major sweets, and he didn't linger or not come around enough. Our water glasses were always filled, we didn't want for anything as far as service went.

Bouchon didn't disappoint I'm glad to say. I am looking forward to French Laundry, someday. . . .",1,1,1

Shoutout to our server Gina. Thanks for being awesome. 

It's so strange because I never give out 5 stars unless the business blows my Popsicle stand over. Tonight was somewhere near exquisite and legendary. My girlfriend and I spend a lot of time eating at various restaurants and we try the best we can to enjoy ourselves based on the chefs recommendations. Of course we check our fellow Yelpers, but we always try to be as objective as possible when exploring new territories. It has become a constant struggle with expensive restaurants to really see the value in what we are tasting. With that said Bouchon was truly a great experience. The price point was medium compared to a Mastros, or Nobu, but the quality was fantastic. I couldn't believe the goodness. We got a ton of food for a great price. 

House bread - crispy on the outside with a nice gooey inside. We had 2...

House Toasted Pistachios - See description.. 

Oysters - So good that we had to order another half dozen! We tried super hard to differentiate each of the three little homies, but they were all so so so good, so it didn't matter haha. They were on point. 

Charcuterie - Came with Coppa, Prosciutto, Salami, and Pate. Holy God. The Pate was our favorite and went perfect with the house bread. I could have eaten a pound of it. 

Flat Iron Steak Frites - Served medium is the way to go. This piece of meat was sexual and for a flat iron it was pornographic. The night before I had a dry aged ribeye and this rivaled it. I can't believe how tender and juicy it was. Fries were perf. 

Mussels - The entree portion came with about 90 mussels, no shiz and we opted for the mushrooms in lieu of the frites because of the streak frites dish. Man, this could have fed an army and super good too. 

Bouchon Dessert Special - 3 chocolate bouchons with melted chocolate chips inside topped with a pretzel ice cream. Wow! It also had an amazing browned marshmallow like cream with a delightful warmed bubble of salted caramel core. My mind was blown.",13,9,11

I started my meal off with an Iced Caffe Latte, which after taking the first sip, made me think that I should have gotten a mimosa instead.  We ordered the French Toast, Sourdough waffles with strawberries, an omelet with bacon, and corned beef hash.

They started us off with the French Toast and waffles.

We had a reservation and were immediately seated. It didn't looked too packed when we went in, and we were immediately asked if we wanted drinks? Yes please! We knew what we wanted so we ordered when the drinks came.  AND THEN: THE BREAD ARRIVED.

I can not get enough of the bread.  It is just the right amount of crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.  A little delight that you twist off the rest of the roll, spread butter on and stuff in your f****** mouth.  We finished the bread AND THEN: MORE BREAD.  No, seriously...our food was taking a long time so they gave us more bread and we ordered another round of drinks.  We finished that one as well, but the appetizers still weren't ready.  We were starting to wonder and look around.  Like I said before, it didn't look that busy, but perhaps because of the popularity of the weekend they were having a hard time keeping up with orders? Just when I was about to flag down a waiter, the manager came to our table and gave us his sincerest apologies.  They were behind on their orders and had an unexpected something with the escargot, but we need not worry because the appetizers were on the house. Ummm ok! My beautiful date and I were locked in conversation anyway, so we could wait a few more minutes for free appetizers.  The escargot and tuna tartare were delicious!  I would have ordered more, but I didn't want to wait, and besides my Steak Frites should be out soon right? Wrong, we had to wait a little while longer.  When it finally arrived, I devoured every last bite.  My only complaint is that I ordered the fries with truffles for $10 dollars more, and the fries were nothing special.  I packed them up to go for later, and asked for MORE BREAD!  They gladly gave us more.

For a group of 7 people without reservations we waited only a few minutes which made me feel a bit uneasy at first because I knew it was a popular place amongst the Yelp community as well with Thomas Keller groupies (after Per Se and FL, I'm one too), so why no wait?  On route to our table, my high expectations quickly returned as I peeped the many lavish looking items other patrons were devouring.  

If it is Spring or Fall and you have the option to sit outside I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it.  The outside portion of the restaurant is in the courtyard and is way nice.  Due to the shape of the Venetian, the courtyard is warm but without the sun beating down on you.  

I can only speak for our waiter but let me tell you he was way cool and very nice.  Whenever we needed him he was there.  My coffee (which I might add was perfect) was always filled and he helped the non-decisive ones with recommendations (which all turned out for the best).  

We all enjoyed the french bread with jam and butter which was a nice palate prepper for the goods to come.  For the most part, we all ordered something different which we all got to try snippets of.  Everything I tasted was really good.  I was in the mood for something sweet and the waiter recommended their French Toast.  It was not the typical french toast I have been accustomed to but nonetheless was much better.  It was round and layered with brioche, custard, apples, and bread pudding and was baked and topped with fresh apple slices and maple syrup.  At first glance it looked a bit small but let me tell you I was stuffed when finished (and I shared some).  Other items which deserve honorable mention were the corned beef hash (wow) and the Croque Madame (decadent).  I must also mention the vanilla bean Tahitian butter because I just about put it on everything it was that good.

We arrived hungry and left full but lighter by about $22 per person.  When you take into account the ambiance, food, and service this was probably my best brunch to date.  When you take into account price, there is just no comparison to anything in Vegas or Orange County, CA.   I will never ever ever do another buffet in Vegas while places like Bouchon are out there.

Croque Madame is perfectly done. Soft brioche grilled, yummy ham and cheese topped with an egg whose yolk oozed seductively over the brioche.  Perfect balance of softness and crisp & of taste. 

My companion got the Oeuf Benedict that has similar ingredients as Croque Madame- eggs, ham, cheese. But its taste is surprisingly different from Croque Madame. Personal preference is the latter. It has a more balanced in taste while I find Oeuf Benedict too salty for my liking. 

Iced coffee from drip works well for a hot day in Las Vegas.

We've had breakfast here multiple times. On our most recent trip, we decided to have a late night dinner since we were staying at the Venetian and it was very convenient for us. It was only an escalator ride away. 

Their dishes are good, but nothing really wow'd us besides the fresh oysters and seared foie gras. We enjoyed our experience in Napa Valley much more. 

So far we've tried..

For breakfast\/brunch~

Poulet et des Gaufres $26.50 -roasted chicken with bacon chive waffle, maple syrup, tahitian vanilla butter and sauce chasseur. Delicious! 

Hachis de Merguez $19 -house made merguez sausage  hash served with two sunny side eggs and toast. Meh..not my type of breakfast.

1\/2 dozen fresh oysters $18.00 -amazingly fresh! Probably one of the best oysters I've had. 

Rillettes aux Deux Saumons $17.50 -fresh and smoked salmon rillettes served with toasted croutons. This was good, we always order this. (You can also buy a a jar of this at Bouchon Bakery for $25.) 

For dinner~ 

Pate de Campagne $14.50 -country style pate with watercress, cornichons and radishes. Good, the pate was surprisingly soft, tasty and spreadable on bread. 

Parfait de Foie Gras $28.00 -comes in a jar with toasted baguette. Very distinct taste of foie gras (which I like) but it was salty this time around. The toasted baguette was way to hard too...similar to a crouton. I like smearing my foie on lightly toasted bread. 

Foie Gras Saute $28 -so good! Perfectly seared..but I wish there was more. 

Steak Frites $37 -pan seared flat iron steak, caramelized shallots, maitre d' hotel butter served with a heaping load of french fries. This was okay, tender steak, cooked medium rare but it tasted basic to me. My BF liked the fries but I thought they tasted a little old. (Btw..you can add truffles to your fries or substitute it for another side for some extra $$ but our waiter didn't mention this to us. I overheard the waitress mentioning it to the table next to us. -_-) 

Since it was our anniversary, we got a complimentary creme brûlée. The sugar was nicely torched on top but the overall dessert was a little too sweet. 

Bouchon used to be one of our must have breakfast spots back then, but now I think we're over it. What kept drawing us back was the convenience of it from our stay at the Venetian and they offered fresh oysters, parfait de foie gras, pate and seared foie gras. Not many places offer all these dishes all at once.",12,18,11

I came here on Sunday for Brunch since I had heard that that was the meal to come for.  My friends and I were seated promptly at around 12:30.  Our waiter seemed inexperienced, awkward, and hasty throughout the meal.  My first complaint was that we didn't even get water or bread until practically 30 minutes into the meal because our waiter forgot we hadn't received it yet.  We received the spreads pretty quickly, but had no bread to eat it with.

I was really excited to see that they had chicken and waffles on the menu.  My friends and I decided to all get the same thing except...they were out of chicken and waffles.  MAJOR disappointment.  First of all, how do you run out of chicken and waffles when it's not even that late into brunch? That wasn't even the biggest thing that made me frustrated.  After not knowing what to order, we just decide to ask for the special which was Chicken Rilletes.  The waiter proceeded to tell us that they were out of the special as well.  HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF CHICKEN AT A PLACE LIKE THIS?? and why would you keep it written all over every sign on your walls?? wouldn't it make sense just to erase it off the board if you're out?  I should have left by now, but I felt too bad to just leave the restaurant especially since we had already been sitting there for about 20 minutes and attempted to order food twice.  For our third time ordering, we just settled on steak frites, hamsteak, and the croque madame.  The steak frites was mediocre at best, with the fries being the dish's saving grace.  I had requested that the steak be medium rare and the steak came so rare that I could barely cut into it without the entire table rocking back and forth.  I asked them if they could reheat it a little more to a medium and the waiter hesitated to even fulfill my request.  I didn't understand why it would be difficult to do that, but in the end, he was able to do it.  Too bad it took so long that my friends had already finished their dishes before my steak even came back so I ended up having to pack it to go.  

Sad to say, the bread and fries were probably the best part of the meal.  I expected better from a place with such high ratings and comments, but I guess it's possible I just came on a bad day.  For $45 dollars, this was definitely not worth it.",4,1,2

What can I say that hasn't been said already?  This place is amazing.  Thomas Keller is a culinary genius and his restaurants and their menus continue to reflect that.  

The thing I like best about Bouchon in comparison to other fine restaurants is that it's totally NOT pretentious!  It's genuine and it keeps it real - you get what you pay for.  You're not only going to get some of the best seafood and french cuisine you've ever eaten, but you're also going to get plenty of it!

We started with the Grand Plateau ($110), a giant tower of iced seafood.  Believe me when I say this is the greatest combination of fresh shellfish you will ever consume.  It has one whole lobster, 16 raw oysters, 8 raw clams, 9 raw mussels, and some stone crab legs.  Absolutely DELICIOUS and a great starter.  

After you finish your seafood, you're gonna wonder how anything is going to be able to top that.  Well, don't you worry about that.  I ordered the Steak Frites ($36.50), a prime flatiron steak and french fries that Anthony Bourdain said were the best fries ever.  The steak was unlike anything I had ever tasted when it came to beef.  Really unique flavor.  The fries were tasty - not sure if they are the ""best"" I've ever had, but they had to be top 3.  I also tried one of their specials that night - a roasted pork belly with the creamiest mashed potatoes.  That.. was equally amazing.  With each bite, you get a bit of the cripsy outer crust and that succulent, juicy, tender middle.  Oh man, I'm salivating all over my keyboard right now.   

To end the night, we ordered the Pot de Creme ($9) - their daily infused custard.  That night the flavor was coffee.  It was very delicious and not at all filling, which was great after a huge meal like that.  

Service was on par for a restaurant of this caliber and although it may sound pricey, you definitely get what you pay for.  Hurray for great food and big portions!  I can't wait to return to Bouchon again!",2,1,2

The ambiance of this place is awesome. Very French, and glamorous. 

I had Champagne, and it was wonderful. Not too sweet, dry, delicious. My boyfriend had beer and he loved his too.

We started off with the Oysters. OH MY GOD. They were so good....that we ordered another round! I've never had oysters like this before. I want to go back and just order oysters.

Luckily for us, the main courses were just as wonderful. My boyfriend ordered the Steak Frites, and I ordered the Saffron Mussels and Frites. Our server let us know that we would be getting a lot of fries, so she substituted mushrooms for one of the fries. The steak was amazing, cooked perfectly. They were perfect and full of flavor. The mussels were just incredible. The saffron really came through, and they just tasted heavenly. And the frites were the best we'd ever had.

They do not take ressies for brunch, but was told that if you arrive pre 11am, or post 1pm, you should not have an issue getting a table; just be seated before kitchen closes at 2pm and you are golden. Given my love for brunches waaaaay late in the day, obvi my group of 7 and I arrived a little after 1pm and only waited 5 mins for our table to be ready. 

The atmosphere is light and airy - reminding me a bit of Balthazaar in the city. The menu was extensive & everything sounded amazing, but I knew I HAD to get the chicken & waffles [$25] as well as the croque madame [$19]. A few of us started with some coffee which was rich and aromatic. 

They began by placing 2 ""branches"" of olive bread on our table. They legit looked like branches! Super cute - we all just grabbed a ""leaf"" and pulled. It was like having a wishbone moment at Thanksgiving, except we were all winners! ;)

The plates arrived soon after, and the portions were very very very generous. My friend and I split the C&W and CM and could not finish our meal at all. The CM comes with like 5lbs of french fries! I was pleased to read that the C&W was not fried but roasted, as I had given up fried food for Lent. The chicken on that dish was SOOO succulent, moist, and tasty. It came with gravy, but was juicy enough to eat on its' own. Each dish comes with a dark meat and a white meat piece - both of which were amazeballs. The waffles are infused with BACON(!!) and chives, and had the right amount of crisp in them. The CM was good, but nothing amazing. I did enjoy the slippery egg on top and the perfectly runny yolk.

The other girls ordered the Salmon Baguette [$16] (which you have to assemble yourself - cute, but I like my food done for me, thx), pot of mussels [$25.50] (lots and lots of lots and mussels!), and the sourdough waffles [$12] (the girl who ordered this is a waffles fiend, so she def liked it =D)

We had read plenty of professional raves but it was Anthony Bourdain's recommendation that genuinely solidified the decision (Bourdain is an idol of mine). 

As mentioned by others, it is (by all means) a ""hidden"" gem. (See my ""tip"" for how to locate it). Once we made the circuitous trek, we were politely greeted and had less than a ten minute wait for a table (for brunch). And, the brunch menu is wonderfully diverse.  Those who wish to indulge will find plenty of options ... likewise for those who wish to eat lightly or heart-healthy. Happily, the menu is extremely inclusive.

The atmosphere is airy, immaculate, and welcoming. The servers are immensely helpful and charming (they even humored our not-so-sparkling French). 

Our party's large order was brought simultaneously (so there was no awkward wait-time for all food to arrive ... no cold eggs, no chilly fries). This seems a rarity and we were incredibly pleased.

Every single person at our table enjoyed their selection. My ""Le Jardin"" was a lovely combination of freshly sliced (perfectly ripe) tomatoes (I cannot even tell you the last time I received a ""perfectly ripe tomato"" at any eatery), cooked spinach (lightly salted with a touch of garlic), brioche, and eggs. It was a nutritious, yummy way to begin a day of otherwise indulgent behavior. Interestingly, one particularly voracious eater noted an initial disappointed with the ""portion"" and quickly realized how the amount of food is actual ""just right."" He was accustom to American excess ... you will not see that here (with the exception of the French fries ... which arrive in a massive pile and were delicious). 

The cuisine was delicate, nuanced, and (ultimately) tasty. The experience was an absolute delight ... completely removed from the din and chaos of this frenetic area (which we love and completely immersed ourselves in the second we left Bouchon).

We ended up ordering the kumamoto oysters which are my favorite. They aren't grimy like oysters can be. They are simple, fresh and delicious, complimented with a red wine vinegar, pepper and scallion sauce makes them out of thie world. Then came the pork belly and crab fritters.

They had an amazing wine menu, we ordered a chianti that was lightly crisp and delicious. 

My main dish was the Steak Diane a hanger steak in a red wine reduction sauce with mushrooms and layered potatoes. I also tried the steak frites cooked to perfection with a sour cream and chive topping. The fries were even amazing.

My husband is a chef (if you follow my reviews you probably know that by now!) and a huge fan of Thomas Keller (the chef of Bouchon). Once we got to the Venetian and checked in we saw a bunch of signs advertising Bouchon and immediately husband decided we needed to eat there.

We made reservations for dinner and came with a couple friends. One thing I think most people will appreciate about Bouchon is that it is an accessible fine dining experience. Meaning, their menu isn't completely loaded with French terms (although there is a good amount of that) that the average person wouldn't understand and therefore be intimidated by. One of their dishes is steak and fries... you can't get more down home American than that!

I ordered ""Blanquette de Lotte"" which is ""roasted monkfish with a fricassée of glazed root vegetables & lobster spaetzle."" I really enjoyed it, everything was cooked wonderfully. 

Husband ordered one of the day's specials, Chicken Rillette, for an appetizer. It looked like a crab cake, but it was made of chicken, sitting on a risotto with a yummy sauce. For his entree he ordered the ""Poulet Rôti"" as the waiter informed us that Keller's chicken dishes were well known and loved. It was a ""roasted chicken with quince, charred radicchio & truffle emulsion."" Again, the sauce on this one was amazing and my husband really enjoyed it.

Their dessert menu was holiday-ified, unfortunately for me since I don't care for most things holiday: peppermint, ginger, etc. I'm not sure what the dessert I ordered was called, but it was served with peppermint ice cream so I asked for vanilla instead. It still had peppermint dust on the side though, which I had to carefully avoid as I ate. Husband ordered ""Île Flottante"" which was really interesting and gave him some ideas for his own cooking. 

Wine: we ordered the Russian River Valley Pinot Noir and both of us really enjoyed it.

The service was very pleasant and attentive. They'd top off drinks even if the container was on the table and cleaned the table often. They also made sure that the plates were positioned the correct way.

In addition to replenishing my body with much needed liquids, I was feeling mighty peckish, as well!  After much deliberation, our group decided on a calm & relaxing sit down Saturday brunch at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. 

Located on the 10th floor inside the Venetian, the restaurant embodied what I've come to expect from a fine French bistro. The vibe was chic & refined yet relaxed and unfussy.  There were comfortable banquettes throughout the main dining area as well as outdoor seating in the patio area. We were subsequently seated inside. At 12:00pm, the sun was beaming from the patio, so our location filtered the intense light perfectly, which suited me and my solar sensitive eyes just fine. 

Complimentary house made jam was magnificent! The jam is freshly prepared each day and depending on the chef's mood, a different flavor variety is served. Today, he was feeling strawberry, which is my personal favorite! They served us an Epi baguette to share and it was fantastic, as well. Warm, buttery crust with perfectly chewy texture. Coupled with the soft butter and sweet pucker inducing jam, it was a match made in the stars.

The entrees were orchestrated perfectly as we didn't have to wait long at all.

Chicken n waffles - The waffles were made with bacon n chives and sourdough batter. It was airy and crisp with a lightly sweet flavor and a savory finish. It was so good i almost forgot to use the syrup!
The chicken was roasted perfectly and it was insanely moist & tender! The chasseur wine sauce was rich and flavorful with an alluring aroma. Some of my guests enjoyed the savory flavor so much they poured the irresistible sauce over their waffles, too!

Pork belly was fatty and incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Accompanied by the creamy hollandaise sauce, it was absolutely delicious!

Corned beef hash was phenomenal! Well seasoned pieces of corned beef mixed with all the traditional fixins that will impress any die hard corned beef hash purist!  Trust, this was far from canned! 

Short rib was tender, the fontina cheese was fragrant and the whimsically tiny jingle bell peppers added a pleasant little kick to this fantastic dish!

Beignets were served fresh out of the oven but they were quite dense and tasted more like doughnuts IMO Overall, they were very moist and with the added raspberry preserve filling, they added a sweet finish to our savory entrees.

Our service throughout the meal was very consistent with coffees, water, and juices always filled to the brim.

By the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed!  But I didn't mind at all :D

My friends and I had a wonderful time and it was great feeling totally replenished and revived with good quality food that was masterfully prepared with fantastic service to boot. The strong coffee didn't hurt either!  I'm not quite sure if this particular location was ever awarded a Michelin star but IMO Thomas Keller deserves praise for a dining experience that was unpretentious, comforting and very enjoyable!

There were 4 of us total that had dinner last night at the bistro. The menu is filled with French classics and perfected dishes. This place sure did deliver. Here's what we had:

To start
*crusty and tasty Epi Baguette, butter, and pistachios
*3 piece tasting portion of cheeses- we chose Barely Buzzed (cow's milk rubbed with coffee), Humbolt Fog (goat's milk), and Idiazabal (sheep's milk). The sheep's milk cheese was very mild compared to the other 2, while the goat's milk was my favorite. The cheese is accompanied by thin slices of apple, herb roasted olive loaf and the most devilishly delicious honey.
*French Onion Soup- so rich in flavor. And the layer of cheese on top is thick and melted just right.

Entrees
*Steak Bouchon- 2 of us chose this New York strip steak with green asparagus, Lyonnaise potatoes & sauce au poivre. The steak is flavorful, the asparagus are sweet yet buttery, and the sauce adds a whole new flavor dimension to the beef.
*Crispy Skin Arctic Char- this was the special of the night. The skin on the fish was unbelievably crispy, which I love. Another love on this plate: the morel mushrooms. Each bite of mushroom was meaty with an incredible BUTTER flavor. There was a vegetable puree, carrots and gnocchi as well.

I am sad to say, we were too stuffed for dessert. And I didn't want to hold back the party and eat a whole dessert on my own. So next time...

I had heard about Buchon on the Food Network. I was really excited, because I had been wanting to find a genuine French cuisine restaurant. My husband and I decided to go here for Brunch on Sunday, since I've been whining and begging to be brought here since I saw it on TV.

For starters, I had never been to the Venetian, and this place was utterly gorgeous. It didn't take us long to find the place, thankfully, since we running a little bit late. The wait time wasn't bad at all, I think about ten minutes before we were called. We sat up against the gorgeous windows, overlooking that seemed to be a poolside. The place was definitely crowded, but I was ecstatic about trying some of the plates recommended on the Food Network.

So, we started off with some water and the pastry basket. My husband and I got two Cheese Danishes, a Chocolate Croissant and the Sticky Bun. The Cheese Danish was to die for, hands down the best pastry I have ever had in my entire life. I was in bliss, eating gingerly through this flaky, cheesy, and soft bread. YUM!

I ordered the Croque Madame and WOWZA, this plate tasted as good as it looked! Had my husband help me out with the ton of pomme frites, but what made this dish so special was definitely the sauce. It was out of this world! Besides that, I had a glass of cranberry juice and some water.

About the only ""complaints"" I have about Buchon is that the water tasted horrible, and for some reason the waitress kept offering me alcoholic drinks at 11 in the morning. Honestly, who the hell is going to order a bottle of wine that early for two people? I had to straight up tell her I didn't want anything alcoholic and that if she had any juice.",2,2,2

The servers were friendly, helpful and accommodating, funny and personable without being overbearing.  They offered tastes of drinks and were happy to describe anything on the menu in vivid detail.  These were our dishes, and my thoughts.

1.  Oysters:  These were from New Brunswick, and they were good.  I've had good oysters and bad ones, and these were among the best.  But that's to be expected.

2.  Terrine de foie gras:  This was rich.  Very rich.  It was a struggle to finish, which is not how I've ever felt eating foie.  I also prefer a seared piece of liver, rather than the terrine.  It was a little salty.

3.  Cheese plate:  We ate 6 cheeses, and 3 of them were fantastic.  The others were average for a restaurant of such caliber.  I'll give them this one.  It was a great selection.

Appetizers were good.  If the meal had stopped here, I may have leaned toward five stars.

4.  Steak Frites:  This was run of the mill.  The pommes frites were tasty, but the cut of steak was tougher and less flavorful than I had hoped.  I wouldn't recommend this entree.

5.  Roasted chicken:  It was moist and well cooked, but seasoned too heavily.

6.  Pan seared skate:  This was my first time trying this dish, and it may be the ingredients rather than the cooking, but I was thoroughly unimpressed.  It was tough, dry, and way too salty.  I don't usually leave dishes unfinished, but this was one.

7.  Lamb:  This was the best item I ate that evening.  It was moist, flavorful and accompanied by a delicious sauce.  I'd recommend this to diners at Bouchon.

As I said earlier, it wasn't a bad meal.  I just had such high expectations, and I was let down.  It was not the best meal I had during my two-day visit to Las Vegas.  Not bad, but proceed with caution, especially for Keller fanatics.",0,0,1

I had very high hopes for Bouchon, and while it did meet some of those hopes and expectations, it failed to meet my overall satisfaction.

Unlike other fine dining establishments, this particular locations is a lot noisier than others.  It could be cold stone tile that tends to reverberate noise more, or it could just be the spacious area with vaulted ceilings  that allow sounds to travel farther.  I was expecting a more private\/intimate type dinner, but felt that it was interrupted by other guests' conversations or the clomping of shoes on tile.

The food however was fairly good.  It wasn't French Laundry good nor Gary Danko's good, rather it was maybe on a even keel with Alexander's.  We had the veal and the trout, which mixed reactions for both.  The Veal was very tasty, extremely tender and a wondrous mix of flavors.  The pickled shitake mushrooms complimented the veal nicely along with a plum risotto.  The trout was very average, just seasoned, bakes, and topped off with peas and butter.  It really wasn't anything to write home about.

I'm really surprised at how many people ooo and ahhh over the steak frites.  Hello?  Am I missing something here?  Isn't that just another term for ""Steak Fries""?  All they are are seasoned and served on top of a steak of in a huge container.  When it comes down to it, it's still a 'french fry'.  I really didn't see how so much excitement and hype could come over a simple piece of fried potato.

Overall the service was good, portion size was OK.  Prices are fairly reasonable for the quality, presentation, and variety of dishes you can choose from.  The Ambiance is nice, and on a nice day, I'm sure the patio seating is great to dine and relax at.

So, I settled for their casual offering at Venetian in Las Vegas.  

When I visited them last month, I was expecting something great from Thomas Keller.  I was pleased with the food, but I was a bit disappointed with the waitress that we had (reason to receive 4 stars instead of 5).  The timing for the different courses were completely off.  The appetizer came before they opened our bottle of wine.  And the entree came before I finished our appetizer.  However, the quality of food made up for the lack of proper service.  

The dish that is memorable is the smoke salmon appetizer.  They serve it in a tight-sealed jar with croutons.  While opening our wine, the sommelier made a great suggestion to use mustard with the dish.  If interested, see the picture that I posted.  By the way, their bread, as simple as it is, is one of the best.

Boy, I sure forgot about the slow service.  To their credit, things went well for about an hour until we were ready for our entrees when we waited...and waited...and waited.  Our server walked back and forth, observing my impatient posture and look but never once came over to let us know ""Oh hey, guys...your entrees will be right out!""  Okay...now that we have the gripe out of the way, let's get back to the business at hand:

Food (in order of appearance)
1\/2 Dz Oysters + 1 Dz Mussels - I went with Miyagi oysters which were fresh and briny.  The mignonette was my fave condiment for the oysters while the yummy dijonnaise was best for the mussels.  The mussels were so good, we ordered another dozen!
Cauliflower Soup - topped with fried capers; very rich and creamy and ""cauliflowery"".  The capers did much to provide an additional dimension to the otherwise 1D soup.
Beet Salad - Red beets topped with some fruit, half crispy with small seeds (like a kiwi).  Refreshing!
Duck Confit - Served atop halved roasted brussel sprouts.  The duck was pure and game-y, as duck confit should be as it's cooked in its own fat.  I encouraged my hubby to pick up the bone and gnaw off the crispy parts. Magnificent.
Croque Monsieur - served with shoestring fries; appropriately rich with the sauce and sunnyside egg on top but not overly salty like other versions I've had.
Gnocchi a la Parisienne - I decided on this dish thinking it would be lighter and make up for all the food we had beforehand.  Boy, was I wrong.  First off, these aren't potato dumplings.  They are pan-fried herbed flour dumplings sauteed with fennel, eggplant and other stuff.  I thought it was delicious but  the oil at the bottom of the dish indicated it wasn't the light fare I expected.  

At this point, the 5-6hr drive to Vegas overtook us so we bypassed dessert and requested our check.  We realized maybe a long dinner wasn't ideal after we've been on the road for so long!  We rubbed our bellies as we headed back to our room for a nightcap and sweet sweet sleep!",0,0,0

We went down to the Casino level and walked through the Casino, past the front desk, into the hallway, then up the elevator and down another hall.  No one else was in line, however, they had to get the table ready, so there was a short wait.  Since the World Cup was being played, we didn't mind waiting and watched the TV in the waiting area.
Our table was ready just as the rest of the group arrived so we were seated... nice restaurant...The menu was quite extensive...lots of choices in oysters and lots of fancy offerings.  Fois gras pate, selection of oysters (for breakfast?), fresh fruit was shared by the group....I just split a corned beef and eggs with my son's girlfriend..I really enjoyed that!
My husband had the sour dough waffles, (I don't like sour dough so I didn't bother).  My daughter had the chicken and waffles...her waffles was good with bacon and chives...the chicken was roast chicken thigh and wing...
Service was good and at the end, the waiter offered us water and coffee to go...I thought that was really nice...and since I had a Kouig Amann waiting for me in the room, I accepted a cup of coffee....they don't serve Kouig Amann's int he restaurant, but he did find out how to pronounce it....sounds like ""queen a mahn""....so now you have it!",3,1,3

How could a restaurant known for superb service and delicious food (my trout with toasted almonds and green beans was flavorful and rich without being too heavy) even warrant the consideration of a one-star rating after it already received a four-star rating?

The snooty (or maybe she was just slow) hostess is the reason behind this.  My sister and I showed up for a late dinner last night at a time when there were plenty of empty tables.  After approaching one of the hostesses (the blonde one in her mid-to-late forties), she hesitated as she gave us the once-over and said our table would be ready in a few minutes.  Close to half an hour later, it was not.  She had just simply decided that we weren't good enough to be served based on either age, dress, or race.  Or maybe all that cheap hair dye eroded at her brain and she wasn't capable of remembering to seat patrons.  Whatever it was, management at Bouchon might want to retrain their staff and remind them that the restaurant business is not just about food, it's about service and the overall .  And service doesn't only start when patrons are seated.  It starts the moment customers walk through the door and lasts until they leave.  

The way to circumvent a situation like this is to just make an OpenTable reservation on the spot.  Works a lot better than relying on a hostess to do her job properly.  Remembering to seat people can be way too taxing of a task for some.",4,3,3

The food we ordered was also super wonderful.  We had ordered the sourdough waffles, the omelet du jour, and the mussels with fries and everything was sooooo good!

Several of us ordered the Steak Frites, which is basically a flatiron steak with a pile of french fries.  They were all cooked per taste, but in all, it was just a well cooked steak that you could get just about anywhere.  

One of us got the Pan-Roasted Trout in a browned butter sauce with almonds - that was amazing.  The trout was cooked perfectly and worth every penny.  It was very delicate and light, and fairly large portion.

Another got the bouchot mussels, which comes with frites.  Nice creamy white wine sauce that was good.  Large serving, too.  

I ordered the Leg of Lamb in garlic and thyme, which was also fantastic!  The lamb was so tender and juicy, cut off of the bone for you already, laid over a pile of vegetables.  

The service was a little slow - it took over an hour from when we ordered until our food was delivered.  Our server was nice.  However, one of the bussers spilled au jus all over a leather jacket and purse, which was a little bit of a downer.  

Of note, I'd been there before for the brunch menu, which is much more tastier than the dinner menu.  The famed chicken and waffles is exactly that - roasted chicken and waffles and I was not wow'ed by it.  The best dish was french toast made from brioche - a must try.

The reason Bouchon gets only 3 stars is b\/c though it is very good food, I expected more from Mr Keller, especially for the price you pay and the hype that you hear.

Our waiter was a bit weird; he had a strange sense of humor that we all had to get used to. However, I must say he was nice as all the staff at Bouchon were friendly.

For starters, we ordered the clams (it was one of the specials) and a order of the mussels. I've only eaten mussels served hot, but the mussels at Bouchon were served cold. There were about two dozen mussles served on ice. It's the first time I ate mussels cold. It was yummy. I think all the girls enjoyed their entrees. I ordered their special that day which was pan seared scallops. It came in four pieces with a side of asparagus with an orange dressing. On the plate it didn't look like it was a lot of food, but it was very filling. 

Although all of us were stuffed, we managed to squeeze in dessert. We ordered a special they had that day and they threwn in 5 extra dishes: one of which was a lemon tart. I think it's because they knew we were celebrating our friend's bachelorette.

I'd love to able to say that I've had to pleasure of enjoying the food from the Yountville establishment, but my travels have brought me to Vegas before that.  Greg and I selected Bouchon after looking at the menu (extensively) and the wine list (more extensively) and thought that this would be one of the shining moments in our trip, assuming we didn't win millions of dollars in the casino.  As it turns out, I'd say this was a pretty awesome experience and not anything that felt like were in Vegas at a hotel on the Strip.  After being seated we were given bread on the table, and told that the bread was meant to be eaten with the room temperature butter (hard table butter = loss of a star) and some Dijon mustard.  Absolutely delicious, and continued to eat through two servings of the bread.  Our waiter, who I am TERRIBLY sorry to have forgotten his name, was warm, pleasant, not cheesy and very informative.  He helped Greg select a bottle of wine for us and also helped select a sampling of the fromage from the menu.  Ultimately, we selected the Bleu d'Auvergne, Pont l'Evêque, and the Fiscalini Bandaged Cheddar.  The cheeses were accompanied with some fuji apple slices and honeycomb, along with cranberry walnut toasts.  We agreed that the top two cheeses from the selection were the Bleu and Cheddar cheeses.  The third cheese was a little too stinky for our liking, even with the honey and apples.  For our appetizer, we selected the Moëlle Rôtie, or the bone marrow dish.  

And here is where I completely break down.  This dish falls into the category of dishes I would have no shame in licking the plate.  The bone marrow, served with two bones and toasts to accompany, was soft, delicate, and melted onto the toasts.  The part that blew my mind = the reduction sauce that comes with it.  I mean, this sauce is COMPLETELY out of this world.  The consistency was just a touch lighter than French Onion soup but came with all the wonderful flavors including juices from the bones.  I mean, this dish in itself is worth coming here for.  We asked for more bread so that we could dip it into the sauce, secretly debating whether or not we should go as far as licking the plate.  I was sad when they took the empty plate away.

Our waiter was gracious enough to warn us that the Steak Frites came with a mountain of fries, and since we were both ordering it, that one of us have a side of steamed garlic spinach instead.  Completely insightful and helpful when I saw the Mt. Everest of fries piled onto the plate.  The steak came with an herb butter and was a generous sized portion.  Greg and I literally ate until it became unbelievably uncomfortable, which meant that we had only gotten through about 80% of the steak and 60% of the fries.  I was saddened by the fact that I had overindulged in the things leading up to this, but had no regrets in doing so. Ultimately, the poor little side of delicious garlic spinach sat half done and I really made an effort to finish my plate but had to wave the white flag before it was gone.  Naturally, we passed on dessert although I had a cappuccino to try and start the digestion process and enjoyed being in each other's company for the rest of the time.  

This was a great experience, and we really enjoyed everything about Bouchon.  Previously we had been to Bradley Ogden in Caesar's and was sort of so-so on the whole dining experience.  I'm glad we selected Bouchon, it completely exceeded our expectations and created a new standard for fine dining in our opinion.",3,2,2

Got there 30 mins before reservation time to sit and watch from the bar. Good stiff drinks. 27 for a gin tonic and a dirty martini was a little steep for me. 3 bartenders there not engaging at all. Looks like they didn't want to be there. Hostess picked us up at exact time of reservation, but she like the bartenders seemed a little off. No smiling just very matter of fact about her job. Same thing with our waiter. He fired off the specials in a very memorized and harsh tone. Nothing sexy or tempting about the food we were about to order. You see I am a Vegas local, people come here to be impressed and wowed. Tourists are all on vacation hence they are here to have fun laugh, talk, flirt. That's really hard to do with a crew that looks to be counting down till closing. But Im not bashing everybody, the busser filling up our water was real nice and pleasant.

I was absolutely shocked. I could tell the waiter had seen that look before. No gaminess no texture. It was just like a roast piece of porkloin. And the crispy lamb belly - chewy and old. Like they had just taken it out from a pickling jar. Just a flop all the way around. My wife had the Moules au Safran  28.50 Maine bouchot mussels steamed with white wine, mustard & saffron
served with French fries. Mussels were undercooked. I may be in the wrong here but I like my oyster to have a slippery texture. With Mussels I want a hint of that rubbery texture. We didnt even finish it. The fries were just that, Fries nothing great.

1)The pastry assortment didn't include Almond Chocolate croissant or raspberry filled biegnets (from some of the yelp reviews).
2)They don't have a corned beef hash only the one with the pork\/lamb sausage (not for me)
3) The eggs benedict can be done with salmon instead of the pork loin for another $2 upcharge.
4)They only have the cinnamon spice beignets (no raspberry filled).  Also, these are cake like donuts NOT the yeast doughnuts as in N'awleans Cafe Du Monde.  Very different.

The thing I didn't like about the place was any changes or deviations from the menu was always an upcharge and our waiter was not very helpful in that regard.  Also, when I asked for 2% milk for my coffee, he said I only have whole or non-fat, then brought a full glass of non fat milk.  I didn't want the full glass because it was for my coffee and I felt he intentionally did that since I wanted to drink my coffee with the doughnuts but he said he thought I wanted a full glass of milk with my doughnuts when I already had my coffee in front of me.  Also, when I was making reservations for this brunch, the person on the phone was very snooty.  I was tempted to not go through with this but had already planned on the menu and with such good reviews, we had to give it a try but I think there needs to be discussion from management to staff about the attitude they project and represent to customers.

Bread came out warm with soft enough butter (pet peeve is butter that is too cold and you can't spread it nicely on your bread until it warms to room temperature!).  Our mimosas held us over nicely while waiting anxiously for our food.

I had a hard time deciding between the Croque Madame and the Scallop Gratin.  I finally chose the Scallop Gratin as it was a special and I'm sure i wouldn't order it ordinarily.  The dish was supremely creamy with the most tender and perfectly cooked scallops.  Leeks were a nice addition to the seafood flavor as well as the perfect amount of thick cut bacon chunks, not too much to overtake the flavor, but just enough to cut the rich creamy sauce.  

Tobin's Chicken and Waffles were better than my entree, i have to say.  The waffles were cooked to a outside crunch, with inner softness.  Cooked inside the waffle were bacon pieces and green onion.   Pepper butter accompanied the waffles as well as syrup.  The chicken was a half chicken served with a tasty gravy of bacon deliciousness.  The combination of sweet and savory was amazing and just kept getting better as the meal wore on.

the menus are smartly printed and used as the napkin rings.

wine: this is vegas so expect a decent wine selection with high mark ups. 

1. the crab app was cooked then chilled and served cold. uncracked and without hot butter. instead, it came with some cocktail sauce. that was a little disappointing. 
2. the goat cheese salad was delicious! the goat cheese was soft, smooth, and wonderfully seasoned. 
3. the croque madame was lacking balance. i have a croque obsession and i had such high expectations. but it was too heavy handed in the cream and not integrated as nicely into the actual bread. 
chouquet's in san francisco's version still rules. 
it normally comes with fries but i requested salad. carb+ carb would put me straight to bed and i had some adventuring to do still!

Service: Our waiter was pretty good. He knew the specials of the day and was able to suggest wines that complemented our entrees. He was really sneaky about figuring out who's birthday it was without asking us upfront (did it when he carded us for our drinks). Funny thing, the birthday girl ended up not coming to dinner so he just assumed it was the guy who didn't get a drink that night. LOL...props to him and his detective skills though!

Food: 
Duck Confit -- the duck was delicious. Outside was nice and crisp while the inside was very nice and tender. The accompanying lentils and vegetables were delicious too, but they didn't complement the duck very well.

Veal -- very tender. I can't remember what else was on the plate (left the menu in the hotel room...foodie fail) but the presentation was really nice. 

Roasted leg of lamb -- much lighter than expected. The components worked well together but I was hoping for a richer sauce and bolder flavors. Polenta wasn't too heavily seasoned which actually worked out well with the dish (surprisingly since I love super rich polenta haha).

Sole -- one of the richer dishes of the night. Comes with some clams and chickpeas.

French fries -- were pretty delicious. Our server recommended them since they're supposedly known for their fries (fried in peanut oil). I was really disappointed that they just serve them with regular ketchup though...for the price I was expecting house-made ketchup or a more unique dipping condiment.

Pot de Creme (strawberry flavored) -- good end to the meal. We all wanted something light and fruity. It's a good size for two if you don't have enough room for a full dessert.

Birthday dessert (chocolate cake, mint\/ginger ice cream) -- super delicious. The ice cream was a nice surprise (wasn't expecting that flavor profile) and the chocolate cake was really rich and decadent.

The baguette with sour cherry preserves is a great way to start out a meal.  The bread is crusty, yet soft and yeasty inside.  The sour cherry preserves acts almost like an aperitif; it gets your taste buds and juices flowing.

The Chicken & Waffles is an upscale take on the southern favorite.  Instead of the fried chicken, the chicken is roasted and comes with sauce chasseur, which gives the dish a deeper, richer flavor because of the demi glace, herbs and mushrooms.  The waffle is also upscale, as there are bacon bits and chives imbedded in the waffle.  Nice and crunchy on the outside, the waffle is soft and fluffy inside.  Along with the pure maple syrup, the sweetness doesn't overpower the dish, but adds another layer of flavor.  When eaten altogether in one bite, there is an explosion of textures and tastes going on.  Oh yeah, the thing that puts this dish over the top is the Tahitian vanilla butter!

  The ambiance is beautiful of course, your in the Venetian, but the service was a tad off and the food did not make up for it.  I had the croque madame, which was pretty good with a ton o fries.  But I felt bad for the hubby.  He ordered the breakfast americaine and you could see more of the plate than food.  And he said the cheese danish from the random coffee shop in another hotel was better.

After reading all the great reviews, my friend and I decided to give this place a try. Made reservations before our show of the Blue Man Group (which by the way was AWESOME). It was a bit confusing finding this place since we had to go up the elevator then follow the tiny signs leading to the restaurant.

Upon arriving we were promptly seated at a small table near the windows. Our server was extremely personable. Love that in a server :) Menu was pretty simple and is given by a folded pieces of paper... I suppose.

What we ordered:
Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard (2.5 oz with toasted brioche & crème fraîche) - $25.00 Wasn't too pleased with the taste of the Foie Gras.... not sure if this particular dish is supposed to be an acquired taste, but I can not see myself liking it. My friend couldn't even taste it. Pretty bummed with how this turned out. It was definitely rich, but lacking flavor. The best part about this was the bread it came with...
Fiscalini Bandaged Cheddar (cow's milk served with served with honeycomb) - This was super delicious. First time having honeycomb and didn't know what to expect. It was super sweet and delicate and was perfectly complimented with the cheese. Recommend!
Truite Amandine (pan-roasted Idaho trout with haricots verts, toasted almonds & beurre noisette) - $28.50 Saw this dish on the travel channel with Anthony Bourdaine and was super excited to try it. Presentation was beautiful and the trout was cooked perfectly.
My friend ordered the lamb, which is said wasn't very good... he was expecting so much more for the price he was paying. Can't really comment on that since I didn't try it! He's not very picky...

In all it was just an OK experience. Was expecting so much more for the price and hype.. not sure if i'll come back here again. However, service was spectacular!",1,0,0

The pastries live up to the hype. After looking at the reviews, we came here for brunch, as many others did. This place is pretty hidden inside the Venezia tower. I like that it's a little quieter than the rest of the Venetian though. The space is nice, airy and overlooks the pool.

We ordered:
-Beignets: delicious and jam filled. I liked the chocolate sauce better but both were good.
-Four pastry combo: You select the four you want. We chose:
Croissants: plain, blueberry and pain au chocolat: quite possibly the best croissants I've      ever had. They were perfectly flaky and buttery. The flavored ones were very on point and not too sweet.
Cheese danish: tasty and it's heaviness was a good contrast to the croissants.

Entrees:
-French toast: I tried some of my dad's and it was oh-so-delicious! The flavors were spot on.
-Salmon du jour: my mom and I shared this dish. It came with smoked salmon, butter lettuce, tomatoes, house made chive cream cheese and a baguette. This was ok but nothing special...besides the bread (seeing a pattern?!), which was a perfect loaf.
-Croque monsieur: didn't try but my brother liked it
-Classic breakfast platter: didn't try but my friend liked it

The service here was also great and they were very accomodating.

I just want to say that if your looking for a slice of heaven, this hits the jackpot.

When in Vegas, go BIG. 

Bouchon is known and advertised as one of the breakfast\/brunch places to go. My buddy and I chose to eat there for dinner. What a choice. Located in the Venice themed hotel ""Venetian"" we hunted down the elevator and walked the halls to get to the restaurant. 

Seated without a reservation, (only two of us though) we began our meal. Menus are folded over your napkin making you fold them out like a treasure map. Cool. Our waiter greeted us with such kindness saying he was just ""peachy"".  Seeing Anthony Bourdain eat here I had to order their fresh prawns and pomme frittes(french fries). I wanted to taste the hype about there fresh seafood and almost as good as Les Halles french fries too. 

Our waiter spewed out the specials with ease and we were both enticed by the Braised Short Ribs (cooked for 3 days slowly!!!!) with potato gnocchi, sauteed cabbage and carmelized rutabagas. Say no more.

The prawns were HUGE and fresh and the fries lived up to there expectations, crispy and light. My buddy also order the French Onion soup which was absolute perfection with croutons and gruyere cheese bake to a nice crust at the top of the bowl. The soup was strong in flavor and not too salty or sweet.

Last but not least, taking a bite out of the fork tender beef was just....uuuh fabulous! Everything in the plate complemented each other. The sauce for the beef, light butter cabbage with crispy garlicky gnocchi, and sweet\/savory rutabagas. I'm salivating for it again already. My hat's off to the chef\/owner Thomas Keller!!!

It was delicious but I couldn't finish it - and it is RARE for me to not eat all the pig on my plate.

I was super excited to try this restaurant as I've had the Yountville location bookmarked for some time now--and of course, Thomas Keller is one of my favorite celebrity chefs.  I'm still working my way through his cookbook but to this day, several items in there are my go-to recipes and are my most favorite.

We were lucky enough to get a booth on the back side of the restaurant. I was pleased with this seating arrangement because the tables in the center did not look as cozy and the bench seating provided us a lot more room to spread out and get comfy.  It's probably not so ""french bistro"" but in the end, It proved to be more private and much more intimate for our group. 

For starters, the Epi (branch leafed bread) they immediately deliver to your table is irresistible and clearly made in house.  It was so fresh. We cleared both loaves before our appetizers were even out. The warmth of the bread, the crunch of the crust and perfect center -  along with the creamy, room temperature butter left me with no self control. It must've been obvious because the bus boy brought another loaf and even gave us an entire bag of bread on our way out along with a little wink. Cute. 

While we all ordered our own dishes, we all kind of tasted each others plate so i'll give you the low down for each item ordered and what I tasted:

* Bone Marrow Appetizer (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#IFq8fcrtUt9SsxQm6DbpQg): We ordered this for the table to share (minus my hubby since he doesn't do what he calls,""weird"" food).  He missed out because this was so rich and full of flavor, I could've had this as my meal. We licked that plate clean. I could not get enough and craved more!  ORDER IT!  

* Endive Salad (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#sfV5ar3nyCDXMd2dYIRn6w): Since my hubby didn't indulge in the marrow, this was his appetizer. It was very tasty and the presentation was beautifully done with the endive leaves placed strategically on the plate as if a house of cards. The vinaigrette was not at all overpowering.  With the roquefort cheese and the nuts, it was nicely balanced. 

* Smoked Salmon Appetizer (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#kaFzihNKLmZyvcT5RR92Bg): Good things come in small packages. Presentation was simple - served in a small glass canning jar along with baguette slices.  I actually stole an endive from my hubby's salad and the salmon actually went really well with it. This appetizer was tasty but if I had to choose between this or the Bone Marrow, this wouldn't stand a chance.

* Trout (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#2xOHkIxvWabr3zIB1ITElw): Seriously...this dish was off the hook! My friend also ordered this dish and we both agreed it was unbelievable.  We were both full but we kept going until every last morsel of fish was in our belly. The buttery croutons sprinkled on top were an unexpected addition but couldn't have been more perfect. I might have to steal that from him next time I prepare fish at home. Also, loved the presentation with the head on. It made my husband squirm but hello...he married a Filipino!  Get used to it!  

* Roasted Chicken (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#CijX0I2eVnH2eXejPOrk4A): Hubby ordered this one. I got a bite and the skin was nice and crispy, the meat was tender and had lots of flavor. He loved it and I enjoyed the bite I got.

* Short Ribs (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#dmhLzxDCxt-KbyYgkG1FSg): My girlfriend ordered this and loved it. I was so stuffed, I couldn't take another bite of anything else. She was very pleased with her order. 

* Dessert (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#VZNaOGdvtZbpA2dw-8gmjw): Our awesome waiter wouldn't let us leave without dessert and insisted we get one that wasn't on the menu; Mini chocolate cakes with zest from a blood orange. This was served with a generous helping of vanilla ice cream on top, slices of flesh from a blood orange as well as several julienne candied orange zests. If you really like orange flavored desserts, you'll enjoy this.

The dining experience here was fantastic and I just think Chef Keller is a genius with how he approaches his menu. Everything we had far exceeded my expectations and made me one happy and full girl.  I look forward to coming back and trying their brunch next time...and of course, dinner (again).

The eggs Benedict which used to be spectacular are now just totally average. Now they're using shaved ham which tasted cheap, and I think the muffin changed, no longer thin and crispy.

They also seem to have changed the cheese Danish and about doubled the filling. More of a good thing doesn't make it necessarily better. Now the filling is so overwhelming there is no balance with the pastry. Like a gob of frosting.  Didn't help that the waiter who served it announced ""cheese Danish made with Philadelphia brand cream cheese"". Not that I really care it was just off-putting somehow. Tacky

Went for brunch which only required about a 10 minute wait for seats (better than I'd anticipated tbh).  Like she mentioned, we ordered the pastry basket which was  worth it.  The gratis bread was a little too hard for my liking (though I'm to understand the harder the bread, the better it is in France I guess).

For my entree I got the quiche du jour, which for the day ended up being Florentine.  It was good, I'll give it that, but for $13 I was expecting something like a small personal size quiche or something, not a ""slice"" with a small handful of salad greens on the side.  Comparing it to Tam's $18 Croque Madame which easily had a full pound of fries as well as the entree, I felt somewhat regretful of my decision.

Biggest reason I only gave it 4 stars was the water.  If the waiter is insisting you get alcohol, that's probably because the ""house water"" is from a toilet bowl and the ""sparkling water"" ($7 btw), is carbonated toilet water.",1,1,0

They have that 'wow' and surprise hidden in their dishes that you don't get in often in Vegas fine dining. Too many places serve the same old steak or seared poisson in a very generic fashion. Bouchon would have none of this.  Everything from the appetizers, entrees and desserts was delicious. I had the beef conssume (a soup) with oyster half shell, lamb, and bouchon with ice cream for desert.  Be weary of the sea bass if they still serve it, it's not up to par.

The delectable combination of the bacon and chive flecked waffles, vanilla bean butter, warm syrup, and chasseur sauce was incredible and unbeatable.  I have returned two more times for the same meal!  We also enjoyed the beignets, and especially loved the accompanying jam.  The servings were plenty big enough to share.

The interiors is very classy and old world Europe. The waiters had a suit on which added to its ambiance. The clientele, however, was a bit too casual for my taste on that particular evening. I was expecting dressy and stuffy. But I got shirts and shorts. But as it is Vegas and summer, I guess I was expecting too much. Some people were dressy so it balanced out my expectation for that evening. 

With Zin in our hands, it was time to finally order. They have a limited but good
menu. Not a lot of variety, but I prefer quality over quantity so I was perfectly fine with the menu. After putting on our order, we had to wait for a long while to get our actual orders.

We had a reservation and they ran 20 minutes past.  Our server was delightfully low-key and the appetizers were delicious.  Fresh pea soup, bib lettuce salad, and oysters. Yum!

The main course was where things started to go wrong.  All entrees were too salty to enjoy.  I ate about a quarter of my trout and my husband had about the same with his gnocchi.  Also, the portion sizes were HUGE.  I know this is America: Land of Large Portions but again, I was expecting something a bit more refined.

Add to that the fact that the restaurant terrace backs on to the pool at the Venetian which remains open until 9pm....(which means you'll be treated to whoop whoops of drunk party goers if you dine before 9pm)...it felt a little 'average' and not 'amazing.'

While I still aspire to try French Laundry, I thought that I could sample Keller's fare at Bouchon to appease me until I can get that elusive French Laundry reservation.  

We decided to have dinner at Bouchon before we went to see Le Reve at the Wynn.  I thought it would be a nice way to start off the evening.  Boy, I was wrong.

I ordered an arnold palmer.  When I tasted it, I thought it tasted off.  It was tropical iced tea with lemonade.  I asked our server if they had plain iced tea and he said no.  Who the hell makes an arnold palmer with tropical iced tea???  It was all downhill from there.

The soup special was chilled tomato soup.  With the temps in Vegas topping 110 degrees, a chilled soup sounded great.  When it arrived, I was puzzled.  I was expecting a pureed tomato soup or a gazpacho.  What I got was a clear broth, with pieces of small, pear shaped red and yellow tomatoes and croutons.  It would have been fine had it tasted good.  But the soup tasted nothing of tomatoes and had this strange oiliness to it.  

I ordered mussels and fries and my BF had steak and fries.  I have to say, like the previous reviewer, the best thing I ate that night was the fries.  The wine sauce with the mussels was too salty.  I tried the steak and it was nothing special.  A large part of it was also severely undercooked for what was supposed to be medium rare.  My BF left a good portion of it untouched.  We also ordered a side of mac-n-cheese, which was an abomination.  The pasta was so overcooked that it was soggy.  No toasty crust, no cheezy goodness.  How hard is it to make mac-n-cheese?  At $6.50 for a tiny portion, you'd be better off buying six boxes of Kraft's mac-n-cheese and making it at home.

We didn't have time to have dessert and decided to have coffee instead.  It came with a side of steamed milk.  I asked for cream and the busboy insisted that it was cream.  No, it was milk.  I've drank enough coffee to know the difference between milk and cream.  Whatever, I was done with Bouchon anyway.

I didn't see much of the restaurant and of what I did see, it was nicely decorated.  Our server was largely indifferent.  For a restaurant of that caliber, I expect better service.

I didn't quite remember the other things we ordered form the first time, but I remembered the service and food was exceptional. 

the second time around was a different story, I came in with my girlfriends. there were about 8 of us and we decided to have a fancy dinner for one of our friend's bday. we were staying at the Venetian, so I recommended to go to Bouchon because of my previous stellar experience here. 

once we arrived, were seated at the round table and the server came and greeted us. he explained the menu, and some of us decided to share plates (typical girls). lol. 
anyways, I was really looking forward for the scallops, but he said that they didn't have it. I was pretty bummed out and decided to try the fish that was on the special. I also asked him to recommended one of the sweeter wines, but I didn't like the first one e recommended, so he brought out a dessert wine. it was really strong and tasted like liquor and I felt bad to return it, so I just passed it around the table. my food finally came, and it was just ok. the fish was slightly overcooked and under seasoned. the only highlight I had was the brownie I ordered for my dessert, which I also had the first time. my friend got a slice of the key lime pie for her bday, and it was really sour! I mean, I liked it because I love key lime pies but no one else did. the server was acting a bit snobby the whole night, and I can tell that he didn't liked it when some of us said that we're gonna split the plates or when we were asking him questions about the menu.

Le Boyfriend & I finally had a day to spend some quality time together after a busy birthday weekend and so based upon his love for chef Thomas Keller we decided on brunch at Bouchon.. Well it was more like breakfast because they don't serve the brunch menu on weekdays ;[[[ No worries though!
We were promptly seated upon arrival by the friendly hostess. Our table was by the window which gives you a view of their pool or in our case a view of an older gentleman sunbathing in his speedo :O The atmosphere is pretty with the natural sunlight peaking through the windows and is casual but still nice. Our server, Drumaine, (I think that was his name haha) and the server assistant were AMAZING! 

We got:
*Bouchon Pastry Basket: $13 - the strawberry croissant was to die for ahhhh; the cheese Danish was just ok; and we took the pecan crumb cake & the chocolate croissant to-go ...which my mother later told me were delicious!
*Corned Beef Hash: $18 - comes with 2 eggs however way you want them cooked (I recommend sunny side) & 2 mini pieces of toast.. I really loved this dish! Perfectly seasoned and the corned beef and potatoes were perfectly cut.. The best corned beef hash I've ever had! 
*Croque Madame: $18.95 - a fancy ham and cheese sandwich topped with a sunny side up egg and creamy mornay sauce... comes with a mountain of pommes frites.. How can you go wrong with this? Although, I will say after indulging in the pastry basket, I really couldn't have more than 2 bites of the CM.. 
*Coffee: They use a delicious roast that I enjoyed black.. I did notice that it was not served piping hot.. must be a French thing? LOL

Afterwards, we were going to walk over to Bouchon Bakery to pick up some macarons but we were just way too stuffed!!!

We will be back to try the Steak Frittes, Chicken & Waffles (both are only served during the weekend brunch) & the Gravlax!!!

Half the time it's been pleasant and half the time it's been just ""meh."" Sometimes the food is good but service is subpar or other times service is excellent and food just doesn't cut it.

I am rating this with my most current experience in mind. We arrived at about 6pm with no reservation. They were kind enough to make a table available for us outside near the pool. The servers were very attentive and our waitress thoroughly went over the specials as well as her menu favorites.  I appreciated the fact that she let us take our time and answered all of our questions. 

What we ordered: 

Deviled Eggs ($5) deliciously simple, can't really go wrong with deviled eggs. Just enough mayo with the egg yolk.

Steak and frites ($37) server was kind enough to help us split this since we were sharing. She indicated that the steak was typically served medium. I wanted medium rare, my dining partner wanted medium well, we compromised and got it medium. Definitely way too well done for my liking and ended up being quite chewy. It also came with fries, regular or truffle, we chose regular and they weren't anything special. 

Pork belly ($41) special of the day. Ridiculously over-priced for what it was. I don't usually talk about food in measurements but this is kind of necessary. The pork belly was a block about a 2x1.5 inches; about half the size of my iPhone. Half of which was all fat. I think I was swindled. Bouchon robbed me of my money and I kinda want it back. Oh well.  What little bit of meat I did eat was good, but not great.

My last trip in March was marked with a scar. I left a comment on their website and have not heard back so I decided to post here as well.
If you have been there you would know that the food is good and prices are on the expensive side. So what stunned me when I got my bill is the charge of their house water for $7 a carafe. ($21 for 3). Seriously! You are charging me for tap water at a place where we pay more than regular prices for food. Shame on you for trying to rip off your customers. And btw I didn't ask for any special water, I said tap water when I was asked what do I want to drink.

The value is better for dinner.  I see some reviews saying it was expensive or overpriced - this is a celebrity chef doing French food in the Venetian.  If you are looking for cheap, look elsewhere.  As far as value, it is excellent at dinner.  Nowhere in that stretch of the strip has quality french in the '$$$' range, they are almost all '$$$$' or not as quality.  Many Vegas major casino restaurants are going the way of small entreés with sides that are really accompaniment\/garnishes, and are sized for you to add on a lá carte sides either individually or family style, plus apps.  This helps their check size but also allows diners to try more things, that being said it is way more expensive.  You can get a delicious classic steak frite with a mound of fries and be out of there for $30.  I had the special, New York strip, with a delicious bernaise, and subbed the gnocchi as a side.  I even had the steamed mussels served chilled over ice with a creamy dijon (impressive presentation) for $7.  The sourdough boules at the start of the meal have a fun presentation in a chain to tear off.

Hands down the best breakfast in Las Vegas!

Sometimes it's hard for a restaurant review to live up to such superlatives, but I don't think that such words do Bouchon enough justice.  To be fair, I haven't ever eaten at Bouchon for dinner, so this review may be a bit incomplete.  The strange thing is, I don't really ever intend on doing so.  But without fail, any trip to Vegas will not be complete without a visit to Thomas Keller's french bistro (ironically found in a casino of Italian origin). 

The last visit there, I had my usual, Boudin Blanc Sausage, perfectly seared and tender to the touch of my lips.  My friend had the corned beef hash, which was wonderfully whipped and served in a cast iron skillet with two eggs hugging the top.  Of course, they were not of the canned variety, but freshly made, and perfectly salted (unlike some that are overly done).

His girlfriend had the french toast, which almost looked more like a puff tartlett than your traditional french toast, but easily made up for it with a delightfully fluffy and richfully sweet taste.  

The food here is almost to die for, and even if you can't do a full breakfast, I suggest coming here for a ""continental"" affair.  The pastry sampler should suffice, and the coffee...wow, the COFFEE!  As any gambler who stayed up too late the night before, nothing in Vegas gets you going all over again than the coffee at Bouchon.  It's so rich and full of robust flavor, it's almost a travesty to put any sugar or cream into it.  If you must, go ahead, but if you'd care to venture out, I suggest taking it black, and ordering the pecan roll.  The sugar from that should more than offset the bitterness from the coffee.

I can't say enough about Chef Keller's perfect addition to the ever growing culinary landscape of Vegas.  There may be other dinner spots to rotate through during my many stop overs in Vegas, be it Guy Savoy or his mentor Joel Robuchon to Bradley Ogden.  But there will always be one place I can't skip over....the most important meal of the day, Breakfast at Bouchon.  Bon Appetit!",1,0,2

I'm preggers, so no cocktails for me, but the cocktails ordered at my table looked great (an aviator and a Moscow mule). 
The birthday girl and I started with the foie gras because I had been wanting to try the stuff for years and she had eaten it in Paris years before. It was ridiculously amazing. The 5 oz. that they brought us felt like a bargain (it was $48.50) and we struggled to finish it (the others at the table were not into the force fed goose liver thing) and managed to get down about 4 oz. I had the lamb, which was cooked perfectly (nice and pink) and was served on an additively delicious bean cassoulet.

Better than my experience at the Napa Bouchon, this time went for brunch.  We had a party of 9 ladies and instead of being able to seat us in the beautiful space that is the actual restaurant, we were seated in a private banquet room out back with no windows and literally could have been in kansas -- not in the beautiful venetian on a sunny spring day in vegas!!

Their epi bread with butter and jam was probably a highlight of an experience at bouchon for brunch.  i think i had 3 pieces, delish!

must try:
- chicken and waffles: pricey but very tasty. the waffles had bacon and chives cooked in which is something i've never seen!  the chicken was well cooked but the sauce that came with was a highlight. very savory, and for one person, perhaps too heavy of a dish but enjoyed it!

so-so:
- tried a pain au chocolate (chocolate croissant) and was not impressed.  not flaky, seemed almost day old.

Chef Thomas Keller of the highly acclaimed world famous French Laundry brings his top rated restaurant to Las Vegas!  This restaurant was also featured on Anthony Bourdain's show on his best of Las Vegas which intrigues me into checking it out.

SERVICE
We had dinner on a Sunday night at 6:00.  To my surprise the restaurant was a bit empty.  Fine in my books, that means hopefully better service.  And yes, it was GREAT service beyond my imagination.  The staff was really helpful and knowledgeable of the menu, what was good and what you should really pass on.

FOOD
I love gourmet meals while my husband is more of a meat and potatoes guy.  So you can only imagine that he cringed when I said that we were going to a French restaurant.  To my surprise, he loved it and couldn't believe that he was eating French cuisine.  Here is a breakdown of our dinner meal.

-Roasted Fig, Beet, Leek Puff Pastry: This was a special hors d' oeuvres for the evening.  Simple, yet tasty.  Mental note: I think that I should try making this at home.  Seems pretty easy, but good.
- Moules and Fries (aka Mussels and Fries): Ok, I saw Anthony Bourdain feast on these and had to try it.  He mentioned that they were the best fries he had ever eaten--ever.  The verdict?  If you like McDonald's fries, then these are about 3 times better.  They aren't by any means soggy and each one is cooked to perfection.  The baby mussels were great as well and simmered in a wonderful light broth.  Wayyy too much for one person!
- Macaroni and Cheese: We substituted this for one of our fries orders.  This was like a grown up version of Mac N' Cheese.  Sooo good, creamy and perfect, and without the orange powdery stuff.
- Mint Chip Ice Cream: What?  Yes!  Think gourmet.  Not like Baskin Robbins mint, but fresh mint leaves, the same kind that you find in mojitos.  I don't think that I can ever go back to having artificial mint chip ice cream again.

TIP # 1: If you and your dinner date have dishes that come with fries, ask to switch one of the order of fries up with one of their other sides.  There will be plenty of fries to share with 2 people.

TIP #2: It's not on the menu, but you need to ask for the vanilla bean crème brulee.  OMG, the best.  Made to perfection and it tasted like a freshly toasted marshmallow.  It's big enough to share and is bigger than your typical crème brulee serving.

TIP #3: This place is soooo hard to find!  I kid you not.  Here is what you do.  Go to the parking garage elevator.  There you will see a special elevator.  Take that to the 10th floor.  Voila!  The restaurant is not accessible through the casino or Grand Canal Shoppes.  You need to take this special elevator which will take you pretty much up to the restaurant.",0,0,0

* Oysters on half shell $18 and Clams $1.95 each. There were multiple oyster choices to choose from, but at the end, we choose kumamotos. The oysters were small, sweet, fresh, but I really didn't like their condiment choices. It was either ketchup or balsamic vinegar. I would have preferred some mignonette dressing and\/or tabasco sauce and\/or raw horseradish. Clams were also sweet and fresh. No complaints there.
* Steak Frites $36.75 (4 of 5) - pan-seared prime flatiron, caramelized shallots & maître d hôtel butter, served with French fries. Traditional steak and fries done perfectly.
* Gnocchi à la Parisienne $26.75 (5 of 5) - sautéed gnocchi, with a fricassée of garden vegetables & brown butter sauce. Amazing!!! The gnocchi tasted like clouds. It was light when you bit into it but heavy tasting in the belly because of the butter sauce. The complimenting vegetables were tasty and balanced with the gnocchi perfectly.
* Sole Marinière $36.75 (4 of 5) - sautéed fillet of sole, caramelized baby artichokes,
 Manila clams, oyster mushrooms, & coco beans.  The sole was delicious pan fried. It had a crispy outer layer and a soft inner layer. The sole was fresh and very tasty. 
* Moules au Tolouse $28.75 (4 of 5) - Maine bouchot mussels steamed with white wine, Tolouse sausage & tomato oil. The mussels were fresh. The mussels were steamed in a strong white sauce. I absolutely adored the pot it was served-in. There was a metal mesh on one corner of the pot and you could dip your bread into that corner, without brushing the mussels to the side. It was a minor detail, but it was obviously very useful. Rather than having to take all the mussels out or finishing the mussels to get to the white sauce, Bouchon created a nook to dip the bread. And, it doesn't hurt, their complimentary bread, is none other than, their popular Epi Baguette. Yeah for free yummy bread.

I actually like Bouchon Las Vegas more than Bouchon Yountville. I like their restaurant spacing & menu selections in Las Vegas. If you are in the neighborhood of Las Vegas strip, I strongly recommend brunch or dinner at Bouchon.",1,0,0

My friend and I made plans in advance to have brunch here. Unfortunately, we later discovered that brunch is only served on weekends. Instead, we chose to have a late breakfast. Bouchon only takes reservations for dinner, so it's first come, first served for breakfast and lunch. We arrived at around 11:00am on a Tuesday. The restaurant wasn't busy, but we did have to wait for about 10 minutes in their sectioned off wait area. 

APPETIZER
Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard (2.5 oz) with toasted baguettes: I hate liver. Naturally, I had some qualms about trying foie gras, but I was still game for it and kept an open mind. The foie gras' flavor really surprised me: It's smooth, buttery, and it didn't taste anything like liver with its irony ""twang."" I really can't describe its flavor other than it gets better with each taste. Spread it  on a slice of toasted baguette and gently rub some of the accompanying salt -- your taste buds will thank you. The amount we ordered was more than enough for the two of us.

BREAKFAST
Croque Madame: Although located on the lunch menu, it makes for a great breakfast entree. Basically, this is the ultimate ham and cheese sandwich topped with a fried egg. What really makes this sandwich awesome is the mornay sauce, which is a white, creamy cheese sauce that's poured on top. To really push your carb intake to the edge, a large serving of french fries comes with this order. 

For caffeine junkies, order the coffee. I like how it's neither too weak nor too strong. What I also like is how you can have your coffee to go.

OVERALL
Future brunch and dinner plans were discussed between my friend and myself during our breakfast. I think that's suffice to say that we'll be returning. Bouchon is as close to Europe as you'll get in Vegas. There's no rush to finish your meal. The server isn't going to place your bill on the table minutes after your food arrives.

My three girlfriends and I ate here on Saturday night and easily out ate the entire table of 8 anorexic bimbos next to us.  What can I say?  We love good food and we know good food.  

From start to finish, the food was top notch.  We started with the petite plateau seafood platter, the salmon rillettes, and the bone marrow.  Yes, all three.  If I'm being completely honest, the seafood platter was probably my ""least"" favorite and that is in no way to say that it was bad.  It was just fine in comparison to the other two entrees.   The sauce that accompanied the bone marrow was one of the best things I've ever had - simply delicious.  I think all four of us discussed whether it would be inappropriate to lick the plate at one point or another.  The salmon rillettes were also outstanding.  I saw this on an episode of Best Thing I Ever Ate (thanks Tyler Florence) and knew I couldn't come here without trying it.  Definitely not sorry I did.  My only qualm was that Tyler's came with a large chunk of clarified butter on top that he got to put on the delicious bread.  Okay, in retrospect, I probably didn't need that butter and it probably would have caused me to eat even more bread, which I definitely didn't need.  

I opted for the chicken for my entree, given that Thomas Keller is known for his chicken and that the waiter didn't seem to endorse the steak frites too heartily.  This was hands down the best chicken I've ever eaten.  The white meat was juicy, as was the dark - a rare feat.  The skin was crispy and well worth the calories.  My favorite part was the au jus that was served with the chicken.  It was so powerfully flavored but not overwhelmingly so - it just captured the pure chicken essence into a magically flavored broth.  The steak Bouchon was also delicious - cooked perfectly for all of my dining companions.  

The bouchon brownie dessert was very good and the creme brulee was fine, if not standard.  They were a nice touch to round out a great meal, though we were all too full to eat much of them.

We shared a bottle of Cote du Rhone that was somewhere in the $44 range and was an absolutely fantastic wine.  Very smooth and complimented all of our meals (even my last minute change to the chicken entree) incredibly well.   I wish I remembered the name of it because I'd love to get it again at home.

After watching an episode of No Reservations in Las Vegas, you raved about Bouchon's frites, even calling it the best frites you've ever had. Ever since that day, my goal in life was to try it.

I was given the chance when I went to Vegas with my friends and we stayed at the Venetian. Although we had dinner reservations, they wouldn't seat us until the whole party arrived (one of my pet peeves). The food and the service were great! The manger gave us free champagne. My table started out the meal with a seafood platter filled with fresh raw oysters, clams, shrimp and lobster. I then had the endive salad with walnuts, Gorgonzola and pears. For my main entrée, I had the mussels and frites. The sauce for the mussels was herby, buttery deliciousness.

The frites? Well, you were wrong, Mr. Bourdain. Their frites were not very good, even mediocre.  Maybe my expectations were too high? Maybe it was an off night? Regardless, I've had better fries at some fast food establishments. If you want great fries, I suggest you make another trip to the Pacific Northwest. This time, skip Voodoo Donuts and go to Potato Champion.

Despite our explanations, we were told we had to pay for the water we hadn't ordered.

The hostess here needs to find a new job.  I don't think she enjoys her job much and it left a negative feeling with the little time I had to interact with her.  Anyway, she first said the wait was 15 minutes with no one else waiting.  Within 3 minutes she told me my table was ready and without any other communication or doing anything other than setting the menu on the table she left as fast as she could.  Her presence can be described as cold as ice.  Thankfully our waiter was much much nicer.  He was very attentive and shared his suggestions. Too bad I can't remember his name now.

I was excited to try this restaurant after the glowing reviews for brunch.  My husband and I ordered the special of the day - escargot.  It was good and came with a small puff pastry on top of each piece of snail.  It tasted great.  This time I didn't do my homework so we asked our waiter for suggestions.  I love pastries so I got the assortment of 4 pastries.  My waiter informed me apple and almond croissants arent on  the menu but can be ordered.  Along with those two I also got the raisin and chocolate croissant.  The apple is really good and would get it again.  The other three were disappointing as my hometown of Seattle has better.  

For our meal my husband ordered the Poulet et des Gaufres and I got the Croquet Madame as our waiter said they were the two most popular items.  My husband liked the flavor of his chicken but found the breast meat to be dry while the dark meat was good.  The waffles were also great since he loves savory foods and they were nice and fluffy.  My Croquet Madame was eh.  I felt the bread was a bit too toasted for my liking.  Not sure I will be back.  

For those who want to try their macarons you can save your receipt from brunch and go to their bakery on another date to buy and save 20% off their bakery.

This is Thomas Keller's place (of the French Laundry fame in Napa Valley) in the Venetian Hotel, and one of the places I sought out and made a reservation for prior to coming. I have learned that it depends on when you ask someone about their dinner in order to get a valuable answer. Never ask right after - too intoxicated in a good way or too tired\/grumpy\/intoxicated in a bad way. Asking either Mr. V or myself that night how it was, overall, and we would've advised disappointed. Ask us the following day or even two days later, and my answer changes to good and his to meh. 

Immediately, I liked the atmosphere and the layout of the restaurant. We had the option of sitting outside, which Mr. V vetoed because he didn't want to be distracted by the dozens of walking peoples, which I understood. Aside from the fine white linens, a majority of the restaurant was laid out in exposed cherry and walnut wood. The bar, the tables, the ceiling, the dividers were all exposed wood and gleaming. The ceilings were tall, but there wasn't much draft, which was nice, considering I was wearing very little. 

I ordered a house glass of wine and a half dozen oysters, which turned out to be some of the best oysters I've had in a long time. They were so fresh and gritty, full of salt water and so very briny. It was lovely. Even Mr. V thought so. As I sit and think, I probably could've made a meal out of them, and happily, alongside my house wine. 

The tomato salad with ricotta was delish. It had three thick slices of heirloom tomatoes - red, orange, and yellow- and a soft grating of ricotta drizzled on top of some red bibb lettuce, all the while lying in a pool of freshly minced pesto. It really was yummy. I like having to cut my tomatoes with a steak knife and wiping up leftover pesto with the freshly baked bread. The tomatoes has such a smell that it was like they were picked hours earlier (and quite possibly were), sitting and warming in a kitchen ready to serve hundreds of people. 

My entrée was bouillabaisse - which had a pinkish broth. I'm still waiting for that moment when bouillabaisse comes in a clear or white broth, as it's supposed to originally, but this one was the closest I had ever gotten. Wish there was more broth, though. I love myself broth, so the more the merrier. The seafood bits were nicely cooked, and not one was overdone, which is a feat within itself for a kitchen - especially when the food will sit and cook at the table as well. I loved the head-on prawn.

Mr. V ordered roasted chicken - now, inside, I was scornful because it's bleeping chicken. I avoid chicken or turkey as much as humanly possible, mostly because the birds are just not flavorful. And Mr. Thomas Keller, maybe your chicken is notch, but alas, chicken is chicken is chicken. It was half a chicken, which meant that Mr. V had to eat it slowly to avoid mess on his shirt, but he still liked it and finished it anyway. 

I would go back - but probably more so for the wine and oysters than anything.",1,1,0

First of all, the service overall was fantastic. Our waiter was very attentive and engaged with our party. We ordered drinks, which included an absinthe drip for 4. The absinthe drip was a huge hit, and it was easy to convince a few other friends to try a glass of the wonderful stuff. Definitely recommend! 
Now, the food. 
I opted for Cobia as the main course, which was one of the specials of the day. I am not sure if its a regular menu item or not, but I loved it. I have never had Cobia before, but I would certainly order it again. The best way for me to describe Cobia, is a more moist, fattier swordfish. 
For anyone planning to eat at Bouchon, I would highly recommend they try the Pork Shoulder was well. Lucky for me, my friend sitting to the right of me, order this. After a few bites of his meal, I nearly had food envy! 
Lastly, I finished with a sorbet mix, complete with warm waffle triangles. 

Alas, even though the cards never seemed to go my way this last trip to Las Vegas, at least my taste buds were able to come out ahead!",2,0,2

I went with the  ""Breakfast Americaine"" (Two eggs any syle served with bacon, country sausage, pommes frites & toasted brioche) and a mimosa.  As far as what I selected for brunch, i was not too impressed. I understand that my selection of brunch cuisine was a bit generic, but the price versus the quality was not what I had expected. Eggs were done well, bacon was crispy, country sausage was not as appettizing, but the frites & brioche was pretty good. I will say that i have has better frites.

I like nice food, good food.  So when checking into the Venetian, my mouth started watering at the restaurants I could enjoy without leaving the hotel (Mario Batali has two, Wolfgang Puck has a presence, and there's a Delmonico's Steak House).  However, I decided (thankfully) on Thomas Keller's Bouchon.  It was recommended that we sit outside in the courtyard, which we did.

Perhaps it was that my buddy and I were up at Blackjack at the time, and had a few cocktails in us, but the meal was perfect.  The outside dining area is like a French cafe, with a big courtyard and a fountain adjacent to the patio.  The service was great:  attentive and understated.  But the food, oh the food.  The freshly-made bread and butter (fresh butter) were perfect.  The Duck Confit that we split as an appetizer had great flavor, and was beautifully presented.  My main was a special, striped bass; I have only good things to say.  My friend has the short rib, which was juicy, flaky, and melted in your mouth.  Not complaints whatsoever.

At this price level, one can eat a very nice meal in any city on the planet. 

So it stands to reason that with the credentials this restaurant possesses, one should eat an exemplary meal.

I will posit that the food here is average for the price, the service is adequate for the price, and that your general feeling after leaving is that there has been a good deal of  mathematical number crunching and statistical grinding in developing and pricing the menu to create a pseudo-bucolic, semi-gourmand experience while generating as healthy a profit as possible for the ownership. 

For instance, the Croque Madame. 

Everyone raves about it. 

It is certainly delicious. It comes with fries that are super delicious. 

But the components? For what is essentially a $19 ham & cheese sandwich with a fried egg, not so grand. 

The brioche, not so great. A little dry and coarse, and not quite as buttery and cloud-like as you would hope or expect. 

The ham, not so great. It lacks everything that makes a great ham. It's closer to Costco than Iberico. 

A nice egg and that expertly prepared Mornay saves the day and makes you justify the sandwich to yourself and others after you've left the restaurant. 

Is it a truly great sandwich? No. 

Is it delicious? Yes. 

Therein lies the rub. 

We enjoyed were the escargot, thought the terrine was just ok, and spent a good ten minutes raving about the heavenly fries.

 Bourdain famously commented about the fries here. And he definitely hit the nail on the head with his thoughts on the $7 fries here. They are pretty spectacular. 

Are they worth a try? Yes. 

But will $7 fries complete your life? No. 

That's my feeling about this restaurant.

We'd be planning a trip to the French Laundry but got denied to due the size of our party. So we came here so we could try out a Thomas Keller restaurant. I reserved our seating through Open Table with a note that it was my wife's birthday and it would be appreciated if someone gave her a birthday greeting. 

So our reservations were at 8pm, we arrived and we're seated early, we elected to sit outside, it was a bit hot even though it was evening, but as the night went on it cooled down noticeably. There was a wedding going on too so there was playing in the background which was cool. Although I never in my life would've been able to for see hearing Akon, Game and Two Live Crew as we dined haha. 

So after we were seated the waiter (young pinoy guys) wished the wife a Happy Birthday, went on about the soup of the day and entree' of the evening, but he failed to give us his name. He forgot a few things that night, but he was entertaining enough with his weird antics. (Jumping in peoples photos, making weird jokes and him forgetting my mac and cheese...wait that wasn't funny.)

Okay onto the food, we ordered the following:

Fromage (Cheese) Tasting portions, $15.25
- Pt. Reyes Cheese Co. Blue - Tasted like that Kraft cheese in the blue can...you other Filipinos will know what I mean, but it was still good. Can't fade that canned cheese taste.
- Abbaye de Belloc - Eh? This was okay.
- Cypress Grove Mad River Roll - This was our favorite, mix  with honey and put in on an apple slice...yum!
- Sliced apples and honeycomb

Came with bread two kinds of bread, I didn't care for either the cheese was good on it's own or with the apples and honey, but the bread eh...OH that reminds me the bread and butter they served was bomb, if you can manage to sneak the butter dish with the butter, into your dates purse you should do it. Crazy good butter....

Macaroni au Gratin, $5.75 - After enjoying Alexander's mac and cheese I wanted to see a real French chef's version. Couldn't wait for this to come out.....it never did. The waiter whose name we never knew owned up to messing up on this though, rather than pawn it off on someone else, so he was forgiven. Plus I was too full to eat it anyways.

Next up we got our main entree, which was:

Steak Frites, $34.50, a pan-seared prime flatiron served with maitre d hotel butter and french fries. - This was okay I guess. I ordered mine medium rare and it came out that way. My wife got medium but for the most part it was well doen except for a small bit in the center. The fries were pretty good, but I prefer the ones you'd find at a W Hotel or Citrus at the Valencia.

After a while dessert comes and damn since the guy, whose name I don't know but was serving us food, messed up our mac and cheese delight he made up for it in the dessert hook up. He said that birthdays normally get 1 of 3 selections, but since he forgot one of our orders we got 3 of the 3!!!!

Okay dessert time, $0.00, FREE!!!! Prices are just there FYI.
Beignet, not on menu no price - Doughnut type pastry w\/ jam inside plus Vanilla ice cream & Chocolate Sauce
Creme Glacee\/ Sorbet de Fruits, $5.50 Ice cream\/ sorbet
Molten chocolate cakes, not on menu no price - 3 costco brownie bite sized cakes with different types of chocolate inside. Vanilla and chocolate ice cream on the side.

The whole meal was kinda disappointing except for the desserts, with Thomas Keller putting his name on this place I figured it'd be a dining experience to match up to Alexanders...but it didn't. Even though our waiter did a decent job of service and hooked it up for dessert, the lack of introduction, forgetting to tell us about a skirt steak special and forgetting my mac and cheese just made the night not as enjoyable as I'd wanted it to be.

We made a reservation for 8:45 PM. We showed up around 8:25 PM and they said they would seat us closer to our time. No problem, we went and got a drink somewhere, played some slots and came back almost right at 8:45 PM. They had us wait...and wait...and about 20 minutes later my husband had to go up and ask them what the heck was going on? Granted it was Friday night and a major convention in town, but we had reservations and they kept saying tables seating just two weren't coming up yet. The hostess was trying to be nice, but it wasn't until we kind of made it clear we weren't happy that the manager came over with some champagne and said the next table would be ours. From then on their service was really great (albeit a bit slow). I think they knew we weren't going to be a**holes about it, but that we weren't happy. From reservation time to actually getting food it was over 45 minutes. We had somewhere to be too and thought we had more than enough time--we were wrong. Anyway, like I said, they ended up be very apologetic and nice.

The bread they brought out was so good, we had to be careful not to fill up on it, although we laughed that it didn't come on a plate. The loaf was just put right onto the table like they're too cool for plates or it was more ""artistic."" Whatever, we didn't care, it was good! I had the dozen mussels as an appetizer and a salad, Frisée aux Lardons et Oeuf Poché (frisée lettuce, lardons, poached egg with bacon vinaigrette & toasted brioche), as my entree. VERY good, especially the mussels (cold with a dijon sauce, which I was hooked on). I loved the lardons (basically fried pork fat), although I didn't care much for the lettuce--would've liked something with a heartier leaf. Still good though. Hubby ordered the Grilled New York Strip (14 oz) medium and I don't think we've seen a more perfect looking steak. Seriously, the thing was perfectly cooked all the way through. And it tasted AMAZING. It came w\/ Bernaise sauce and fries, but the steak just by itself was incredible. A tad much for us size-wise, but then again we ate it all!

For dessert, they were so sweet, they brought us desserts on the house for our troubles. The Crème Caramel (creme brulee) was probably the most perfect creme brulee I've ever had. Just the right sweetness and so creamy. And I tend to order it everywhere just to compare; this really was the best one. Make sense at a French restaurant I suppose! They also gave us their chocolate cake w\/ ice cream (they sell this cake at the bakery)--also amazing! Everything just had such a rich taste. 

I think the price made sense and the food was amazing. If the service (i.e. wait) is better next time, I would say this is totally would get a five-star review in my book. We'll be back for sure.",0,0,0

I've only heard good things about Thomas Keller so I was pretty excited to try this place out. The first thing that bothered me was how inattentive the service was. It took quite a while before our drink orders were taken and it was ages later that we received our appetizers, which were okay. 

The entrees were the real let down. My meal was just okay and a little on the cold side. My brother's meal was plain cold and flavorless. My friends steak was also cold and very tough. My other friend's croque madame was okay, but nothing special. 

My brother ended up sending his meal back, for which the table was given a free desert of profiteroles. They were okay. 

Overall, the restaurant was quite a let down. Maybe the cold food was the fault of an inattentive waitstaff and not the kitchen, but that doesn't help the fact that our meal was poor.",0,0,0

I ordered the Croque Madame and my husband ordered the chicken and waffles.

The Croque Madame is a toasted ham and cheese brioche with a fried egg and mornay sauce served with french fries. The meal was prepared perfectly with the egg bursting forth when I cut into the brioche.

The chicken and waffles were excellent, and it is considered one of Chef Keller's signature dishes. The chicken was cooked perfectly with crispy skin, tender meat and very moist. The experience of biting into chicken, waffle and Tahitian vanilla bean butter sauce was exquisite. It also comes with fries that go very well with the overall presentation.

The other items we got were pretty good as well - we tried foie gras for the first time, and I think I am now addicted.

4.5\/5 on Food. Came here for dinner on Friday night and the wait wasn't too bad. They over-exaggerated the wait time so it was speedy. I ordered the Steak Frites with macaroni gratin. Two other's in my party ordered the Steak Frites and our waitress was helpful to let us know that it comes with ALOT of fries and told us that we can substitute the frites for sweet corn or spinach. My friend got the sweet corn which was awesome and I totally loved it while I got the spinach. The spinach was not too bad, reminded me of the stir-fried chinese spinach but cooked with olive oil and a tad saltier. Totally random but all this can go with some rice haha. Moving on to the steak, I ordered a medium rare one which was FLAWLESS; I had to savor each bite because it was just that good. I also tried the ratatouille for the first time and I have to say it also blew my mind away because when I went to Wicked Spoon to try their's, it tasted like crap. The Gigot d'Agneau was pretty good too, just seemed a bit small of a portion but oh well. Also the frites? Not too sure what to say but they were legit French fries and were excellent as well!

Service was what made me drop it to 4 stars. Waitress and a server seemed to not be paying attention at times and our server didn't really appear to have a good mood on his face. What was also weird was another party came later than us but got their food a lot faster than we did.

Made reservations for a Sat at 8:30pm, and it was busy but not packed. 

The Bouchon experience started off with warm pistachios and a DELICIOUS serving of their bread. O.M.G. the bread was perfectly crisp and flavorful. I knew great things were going to follow suit.

For my starter, I ordered the pumpkin soup. It was ok. Could have used more flavor.

My entree was one of the specials, pork belly. The pork belly had a nice salty flavor on top, but when I bit further in, the pork was actually kind of cold on the top layer and warm at the bottom layer (maybe warmed up by the vegetables). What the? I ate it anyway insisting to myself that maybe this was the way it was supposed to be served, but every bite was awkwardly cold. When the server finally came by when I was halfway through, I asked about the temperature, and he wasn't sure why it was cold...maybe it was from sitting out too long he said. That just showed poor preparation for this fine dining establishment if it were the case. Despite that temperature issue, the dish was good. The pork belly melted in my mouth.

Another dish that someone got was the roast chicken that the server (and many other people in the restaurant raved about). When we finally tasted it, it was just ok. The skin was deliciously crispy, but the breast meat was quite dry. Not something you would expect for a $30 dish. 

I think the favorites at the table were the steak frites. One piece of seasoned steak with a huge mound of frites.

I was recently in Vegas to celebrate my birthday, and decided this would be the best way to start my actual day of birth. So we showed up (kind of on the late side for brunch) and put our name on the list. Though the host said it would take us 50 minutes to be seated, we were seated in more like 10-15. (Yes, he said 50. Not 15. I checked.) Nice surprise!

After inspecting the menu, we had to go with some of the more famous brunch dishes on the menu. My boyfriend chose the chicken and waffles, and I went with the mussels and frites. We also couldn't resist the salmon tartare appetizer that was on special that day.

First off was the salmon and a couple of mimosas. Both were extremely tasty. The salmon was super fresh, and served with bits of egg, red onion, capers, along with a bit of toasted bread. My only complaints was that we didn't get quite enough toast to eat everything and the small pieces of eggs and such were kind of difficult to get on the bread. The taste was fantastic, though.

Then came the main courses, and they were as good as everyone says. The mussels were a nice variation on the usual preparation, as the mustard in the sauce gave it the kick that it needed. The fries were nicely crisp and perfectly seasoned, definitely in the top five of best fries I've ever had. And the chicken and waffles? I got to try a bit, and it was amazing. The waffle was nice and fluffy, with bits of bacon and chives in there. And they serve it with roasted chicken that was perfectly cooked. Perhaps most surprising were the portion sizes, which were enormous. I wasn't particularly hungry for the rest of the day.

They were gracious enough to give us an appetizer portion of the mussel entree with a giant side of frites! My boyfriend ordered the sea bass special with a wild rice pilaf, the fish was amazing - so fresh and it melted in our mouths. I ordered the short ribs which were very good but I wasn't that impressed. I was honestly a little dissappointed and was expecting a lot more flavor - the short ribs where I work (a Ritz-Carlton restaurant) are way tastier. I wish I would have ordered the lamb. The presentation was amazing on every dish, and the food was very ""homey"" and rustic. The service was very good, and I would definitely return to try something new!",0,0,0

It all started when we walked in at 1:20pm on 12\/29, which I didn't realized they were already closed. The girl at reception desk was on the phone and asked us to wait her finishing her phone. We waited, patiently. The girl hanged up her phone a few minutes later and then picked another phone. We waited, patiently. Finally, she finished her second call and turned around to us, said politely:"" sorry, we are closed now."". I told the girl that she could've told us in first place and not asking us to wait for a result like this. I guess my voice indicated disappointing so a guy dressed in suit looked like a supervisor \/ manger showed up immediately (not sure why he didn't show up while we were waiting). He said ""I'm sorry that you didn't know. But we close at 1pm every day. And the Hours is posted right outside. ..."", which we looked for and found out later the opening hours in very small font posed in a small window outside. This supervisor\/manger sounded like ""you supposed to know. if not, that's your fault. ..."". Very insulting. 

Overall, it was awful customer service experience at a restaurant like this level. So, if you are a kind of person who like good customer service and not addict to Bouchon food at Las Vegas, I'm sure you can find somewhere else for gourmet meals.",1,1,0

To start we ordered
- Coffee, which was not THE BEST coffee we ever had, but strange enough we both had 3 cups nonetheless.  
- Bouchon Pastry Basket, we had our server pick for us, although I was mildly disappointed he didn't give us the almond pastry I was hoping for...his selections were superb nonetheless...plus he gave us beignat, which I totally forgot about and good thing he remembered, because they only make it for weekend brunch.  So our pastry basket consisted of Pain au Chocolat, Lemon Currant Scone, Cheese Danish & Beignat.  The only pastry I thought was subpar was the Lemon Currant Scone, but the fresh jam they provided made that scone great! 

For our entree we ordered ..
- Croque Madame, which was toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce. Served with pommes frites.
This was an excellent dish, such a simple concept, but sOOo good!  
- Chicken & Waffle - the most tender Rotisserie chicken paired with bacon & chive waffle... definitely not Roscoe's. Tasty tasty!

The host is super cute, and the service is top notch, although I think our waiter was a newbie. He kept forgetting the items and blushed a bit as he tried to recover from his mistakes. The restaurant is on the 10th floor of the Venezia Tower, which is apparently a separate building from the Venetian hotel building. We got lost trying to locate the restaurant, and it was extremely annoying to have to walk back and forth through the shopping area.

Having an Absinthe is an experience at this place. It's prepared table side using beautiful instruments. The taste, however, is not my cup of tea (very strong anise flavor). 

2 stars are taken off, because I've had equally delicious French food at 2\/3 - 1\/2 the cost. Having to walk through the crowded mall with pungent performe smell to get to the restaurant is annoying. The corridor leading to the restaurant smelled like the perfume section of a department store -- totally kills the appetite for me. Yuck!

Love love love the financiers (those little almond French cake thingys) for snacking while you're waiting to be seated. It's both a blessing and a curse to have that available when you're waiting 20 or so minutes, but it sure made the wait time bearable and faster. Of course, the table bread they bring out after you wait for your food isn't too bad either. ;] So much carb yumminess before the main meal arrives!

We ordered the popular Poulet et des Gaufres (roasted chicken with bacon-chive waffle, maple syrup,Tahitian vanilla bean butter & sauce Chasseur at $26.50) and the Pain Perdu (brioche French toast with blueberry compote, served with vanilla bean butter & Crown maple syrup at $14). I liked the chicken and waffles more than the french toast, and the sauce definitely brings out the taste in both the chicken and waffles. BF loved that the chicken was lean and not full of fat. 

Bouchon is known for their baked goods, so we added a side order of chocolate croissant ($4.25). We ended up taking it to-go since we were too full from our meal to even try a bite. When I tried it later on that day, I felt a bit miffed that it wasn't anything special for the high price tag! Looked just like the chocolate croissant sold at the Bouchon Bakery on the casino floor of the Venetian and that one cost less too! It didn't taste fresh and flaky, as it would if it come just out of the oven. Baguette Cafe definitely has the better croissant.

MAJOR POINTS for the wait staff here because we told them we had to dine quickly to make it for our show and they rushed everything with the pace we needed and yet no sacrifice of friendly service. 

The food itself is a good solid. It's not pretentious, simple foods done well. We indulged in 5 oz of foie gras as an appetizer (if you read my other reviews, you know I'm a sucker for liver), then I ordered the mussels, my brother had gnocchi and my fiance had steak -- and then I had a taste off everyone's plate. Mussels were delicious, flavorful though some pieces were a tad small for what we paid. The gnocchi is sooo heavy and thick but delicious - several bites and one would be full.

I was a little scared to try Bouchon after hearing seriously mixed reviews (""It's the best EVVAAHH"" to ""I'd rather die than eat there again!"").  But, I gave it a shot.

I arrived at the restaurant and was seated immediately.  The hostess, though on her game, was a little cold. But, whatever, you see the hostess for a total of 15 seconds while she seats you and then you break up forever.  No big deal.

Our waiter was a riot and very helpful.  He steered me away from ordering mussels and soup as it would've been a very liquidy meal.  And, as I don't like ""gummin' it,"" I really appreciated the input.  The service was pretty good but not really a 5-star level.  Our food came out really quickly despite the fact it was a busy Friday night.

What we ordered:

""Special"" Leek and Potato soup:  Creamy and delicious but served a tad too cold.  I'd order again but request it served piping hot.

Goat Cheese Salad:  Awesome mix of greens with a vinagarette topped with warm goat cheese.  A good salad but not life changing.

Moules au Safran (mussels and fries) :  I was sooo excited for this dish after watching Anthony Bourdain get flustered over the fries, spilling red wine everywhere, on ""No Reservations. "" 25- 30 mussels are served afloat in a white wine, garlic broth. Holy crap, delicious, but very intense in the garlic department (if you're on a date, do not order!). They were some of the best mussels I've had outside of Belgium.  The fries, however, were underwhelming.  Crisp at first but quickly morphing into sad, wilty little things. 

""Special"" glazed short ribs:  Delicious bone-out short ribs cooked for 14 hours (or so said the waiter).  Came with the creamiest quinoa in the history of the world and a sweet-ass, hen-of-the-woods mushroom on top. Awesome.  I was a tad jealous of the person that ordered it.

Bouchon dessert:  One of the ""special"" desserts. Three fudgy brownies served with strawberries and vanilla ice cream.  Best. Brownies. Ever.  Each brownie was warm with a fudgy center.  I think I said ""this is ridicuous"" at least four times while eating it.

""Special"" pot de creme dessert:  Mint creme that tasted exactly like freshly picked mint from the garden.  Delicious but really not my kind of thing.  The person who ordered it loooovved it.

Overall, pretty good.  I got my mussel fix but I am totally perplexed why Anthony Bourdain got all hot and bothered over Bouchon fries.  Shenanigans, Bourdain, shenanigans.",1,2,2

It was early afternoon on a Saturday.  After overextending my curfew a little bit too far the night before, Bouchon, with its casual and airy atmosphere, rather quiet surrounding (in the Venezia tower of the Venetian), and a less than 5-minute wait was the brunch spot of choice.  We dragged ourselves there and, as always, were within 5 minutes ushered to a table overlooking the garden and presented with a cup of full-bodied french press coffee.  Bouchon was perfect, it has none of the wait nor the chaos that other (lesser but) more prominent and conveniently located LV Strip brunch spots have, it has no loud thumping music mixed with the cacophonous random sounds of slot machines, and it has no screaming kids or lewd tourists.  

Peace and quiet definitely became a luxury when it felt like I had three heads, all of which were thumping at different beat.  

So were the abovementioned coffee, a glass of chilled freshly squeezed OJ, the pastry du jour - pear danish (which were, quite possibly, the best French pastry I've ever had outside of France), and the eggs benedict and canadian bacon served with heaping of hollandaise on two pieces of homemade crumpets.  

Two hours later we were considering our options: (1) check out Crystals; (2) lay by the pool in the warm late summer afternoon (at this point pool parties were sadly ruled out by unanimous resolution passed by my three heads); or (3) go back to the suite at Augustus Tower and nap.

My girls brought me here for a fancy dinner for my bachlorette party and I had been excited about it alllll week.  Boy was I disappointed....not to blame them seeing that this was my pick but I really had high hopes for this place, for many reasons.  First, I dont think I'll ever make it to French Laundry in this lifetime so am more than happy to settle for Bouchon.  Secondly, it had rave reviews on yelp.  So I am not really sure what went wrong?  I ordered gnocchi which was very flavorful and rich in the first few bites.  However, as I kept eating, the grease just became very overwhelming that it was starting to not sit well with my stomach.  It was simply too heavy.  What threw me off is it isn't the type of creamy pasta gnocchi that I was expecting or use to, it was more pan fried to a crisp over oil.  

So I thought it was only my dish and I tried many of my friend's other dishes, which included steak and frites and sturgeon fish.  I wasn't impressed with any of those either.

The steak was very average (tho the fries were delicious but I'm easily impressed with fries).  One word of advice tho, all the temperature are cooked one less than what you ask.  My friend asked for medium and it came out med rare, another order med well and it came out med, third friend ordered med rare and it was super bloody.  My other friend commented that her fish was a little dry.

I was pretty disappointed with the meal  but luckily, the good company more than made up for it.  The one upside is the bread before our meal was delicious, as everyone said it would be.  Also, we arrived at dinner at 9pm and many of their dishes, including the specials, were all out.  If you want to get a good pick of the menu, go early!  The food is fresh so it will run out.

My sister had 3 flavors of ice cream - coffee, mint (when you see only mint ice cream) and strawberry served over little mini brownies.

I had the best cream puff - light crispy pastries served with vanilla bean ice cream in between, drizzled with warm chocolate! :)

My fiance had the apple tart.

Overall, a wonderful experience and really good food!!! :)",0,0,5

I'm not sure if it was bc we were a large party but the food was not up to par. When we arrived they already had the cold seafood apps on the table. Everything tasted ok but the raw oysters were a little smaller than expected.

For the entree I ordered the steak. It was cooked medium rare and it has got to be the toughest piece of meat I've ever tried. I had to ask the waiter to bring me a different knife bc I couldn't cut through the meat. 

The macaroons were amazing. Not too sweet. Disappointed with the lemon tarte. It was way too sour.

What was supposed to be a 20-minute walk ended up being 45 minutes! So we were 30 minutes late for our reservation, but we were still seated immediately upon arriving. Service is, of course, one of their strong suits. You're given bread, butter, and pistachios to munch on while waiting. I had the leg of lamb (3 stars -- lamb was tender, but I didn't much care for the greens or mushrooms that came with it), friend had the skate wing (2 stars -- a little dry from the bite I had), and other friend had the special of the day, lamb chops (4\/5 stars -- super flavorful and juicy, and I liked what it came with, some sort of starchy thing that wasn't a potato but kind of tasted like it). We also got a melon salad to start (okay, but it's one of those dishes that I think is overpriced just because of presentation and fanciness) and a side of ratatouille during the main course. For dessert, we had the brownies with white chocolate ice cream and it was delicious, but you can't go wrong with brownies and ice cream, now can you? But the brownie was really warm and soft and obviously didn't come from a box (duh).

Finally the perfect oppourtunity presented itself.  After a fantastic time at Phantom, everyone was down for a nice meal and being right upstairs of the theatre, Bouchon was a natural choice.

To begin, the staff was oh so attentive.  We were introduced to the maitre-d, the oyster guy and of course our server.

While we were walking in we were excited by the food being displayed all around us.  

Us three hungry girlies got the foie gras pate to share, the grand plateau, a huge assortment of seafood, shortribs and lamb.

The foie gras, what can I say.  Five ounces of pure heaven with crispy crunchy brioche to share.  Sure it was quite pricey, $50 to be exact, but well worth every penny.  The serving was more than enough for the three of us.  

The seafood was fresh and delicious but very standard.  Next time I wouldn't order just because you can get seafood anywhere.

Now I normally don't like shortrib much, but this was melt in your mouth tender with crunchy bits of parsnip, carrots and god knows what else, probably crack.  The BEST BEST BEST BEST part of the dish was two deep fried morsels on the top.  Deep fried what you ask?  Deep fried BONE MARROW.  OMG.  I thought I had died and gone to foodie heaven.

The lamb was also very good, tender, juicy, on a bed of white beans I want to say.

I love Thomas Keller's recipes, and his food is a solid 5 stars every time. On this trip we came for breakfast & I had the bread pudding. Without question the best I've ever had. Mouthwatering.

So this should be a 5 star review, right? Um, not quite.

For one, the usually great service at Keller's restaurants was sorely lacking. Despite having tables open in the main dining room with the nice views, they scoffed at our group of 8 and stuck us in a back room with no windows or decorations. I felt like we were eating in a hotel conference room. 

As a result, we got ignored a lot. I think they kept forgetting there was someone in the back room. So we waited almost a half hour after being seated before anyone came to see if we had any questions about the menu & bring us water. Not good.

The value is also a rough one here. This place has great food, but good Lord is it expensive. My tiny bread pudding (about the size of a baseball) and a OJ cost me $30 with tax and tip. It was good, but not that good.

So the food was 5 stars, the value and service were about 2 stars. So I'll average it out to a 3. I'm hoping the service was a isolated problem, and am willing to go back and see if the service improves it raise it to a 4 star average. But $30 tiny breakfasts will always hold it back from 5 stars in my view.",4,3,3

He had never heard of Thomas Keller and didn't really care whose restaurant it was...I went in expecting something more.  

We were seated promptly, and were given a choice of still\/sparkling\/tap waters and a wine list. Then we waited, and waited and waited.  About 10 minutes later, someone came to ask if we'd placed our order, we said that we hadn't and then another 5 minutes passed before we were greeted by our server.  He was friendly and I think we weren't supposed to be his table, because they asked if ""she'd"" come over yet.  Anyway, we asked him about the 2 wines we were choosing between and he said he'd ask the sommelier and get back to us.  When he did, we ordered what he suggested, a delicious Cotes Du Rhone- which was lovely.  

Our server listed off the daily specials and we decided to order...I started with the onion soup, which I have whenever I can.  I was disappointed because there was more crouton than broth and I prefer the broth to the bread.  Next, I had the special fall salad (d'orge), which consisted mainly of barley, with a pinch of kale, one artichoke piece, some lemon sections and a lot of currants. The kale was very flavorful, I wish there had been more of it.  I also had a side of macaroni gratin, which was well presented and very cheesey.  I thought it was very tasty, my husband didn't like it because he prefers a creamy sauce, this was dry but good. He had the Moules au safran- a gigantic portion of mussels and he was thrilled with every bite.  It was served in a large lidded pot, with a cone of delicious frites.  

We were seated at a small two top, amongst other small two tops, which meant every time a server would talk to another table, we were squished between the server's back side and a dividing wall.  I understand this can happen, but the table next to us was very chatty with their server, so it got a little claustrophobic.  We also sat with our finished plates in front of us for almost 15 minutes, before they were cleared- again, not a huge deal, but we were out of food and wine, so we were ready to go.

First off, the restaurant is not as nice as the Napa location and the table they gave us, just inside the door was too much in the traffic path and too bright.  And the service was lacking.  When my husband ordered one of the specials, he was told ""oh, we're out of that""  I wasn't bothered however, thinking about the meal I was going to have - the roast chicken - just back from France and having had the chicken before in Napa.  

Well, the chicken was hugely disappointing.  It was very crispy (roasted?), and the meat was dry - overcooked.  The vegetables accompanying the chicken ( mushrooms and ?) were chewy and tasteless and the sauce was overwhelmed by cloves.

Interestingly enough, my sister had also taken friends to the Bouchon in Napa that weekend and had the same experience with the chicken.

The waiter was good, yet crafty... had us order a carafe of sauvignon blanc when a glass would have sufficed.  It was a big up charge.  And it was incredibly floral, when he said it would not be.  We also had to flag someone down to get the wine when our appetizer was already there.  When will servers realize that the wine, or cocktail, comes first!!  That is soooo irritating.

Wish we had room for dessert, but ended up coming back for beignets  and cafe au lait on Sunday morning served by this delightful girl (wish I could remember her name) who always works the weekend brunch bar.  It was wonderful sitting in this beautiful sunlight room dipping the delicious beignets into the warm nutella.

I was fortunate to have dinner at French Laundry once and thought it to be a excellent experience, but the food at Bouchon is just as memorable, even though it is not at the same culinary level.  It is just as delicious, fresh, and well prepared as the culinary haven in Yountville... all at a quarter of the price.

Why 5 stars with the sub par service?  Because the food, host, and management levels were above and beyond most restaurants anywhere.

Having dinner Saturday and Sunday brunch at the bar end of July, and I can't wait!!  Maybe I will remember what's her names name this time.

FOIS GRAS ($25\/2.5oz jar): This appetizer was our favorite part of the meal and came with crunchy baguette bread.  The fois gras was flavorful, rich, and melted in your mouth.

CROQUE MADAME ($19): Basically a fried egg on a ham and cheese sandwich with a ton of fries.  This entree was standard and not worth the price in my opinion. It was recommended in 200 reviews, but I'm not sure why...

BREAFAST AMERICAINE ($22): 2 eggs any style, bacon, country sausage, fries, pastry, and coffee.  VERY standard, nothing was special enough to make my taste buds want more.

CAPPUCINO: although I ordered a warm beverage, it came with a straw?

We walked into a pretty vacant restaurant, and were seated promptly.  This place is very ""fine dining"" but because it is located in a hotel you get all sorts of tourists.  Lets say Thomas Keller might not approve of a diner wearing cutoffs and running shoes, while choking down a $22 breakfast, but hey, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.  My sis and i  both ordered the the breakfast plate that came with  two eggs, potato croquettes, toasted brioche & applewood smoked bacon.  Moments later our food arrived, and my sis took one bit of her bacon, and pulled a face, the food was cold.  We debated just eating it, but if Keller can make oysters and pearls, can he not make bacon and eggs?  We told our server our issue, and she seemed shocked that there was an issue, and returned it to the kitchen.  Our plates came out again, this time they might have been 1 degree warmer.  We didn't want to send our food back for the third time, so we sucked it up.  The manager was very generous accommodating us with a box of pastries for the trouble.

We made reservations for our first night in Vegas which happened to be a Monday evening. 

I received a confirmation call earlier in the day which I appreciate. We arrived around twenty minutes early for our 9pm reservation hoping to get a drink at the bar first. Upon arrival, they told us our table would be ready shortly and pointed us to the bar. 

The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was as I had suspected it to be. Music playing but not too loud and the decor fit well with the french feel but not too old feeling. The bartenders were quick in getting us a cocktail menu and we were served within minutes of sitting down. The cost of drinks was no more than any other high class restaurant and were delicious. My Bulleit Manhattan was delicious and made perfectly. At 9 o'clock exactly, our table was ready and we were seated. 

Our waiter was very nice from the get go and always attentive. He offered up a few suggestions as well. We ended up having a bottle of wine which the sommelier brought to our table. Being big duck fans, we ordered the Confit de Canard which was crispy duck leg with soft yellow polenta, hen-of-the-wood mushrooms & a red wine duck jus. The duck was prepared to perfection and the polenta and mushrooms added some various textures to it with the duck jus giving it a nice bite. We were very pleased.

For our meals, my girlfriend ordered the Gnocci which will melt on your fork if you don't get it in your mouth quick enough and I mean that in a great way. It was probably the best Gnocci I've had. Not too soft and not too hard and the brown butter sauce was simple yet delicious. I decided to mix it up and get chicken which I rarely ever do. It was the waiters suggestion as they are well known for their Poulet Rôti. It was worth mixing it up as I thoroughly enjoyed the dish. 

Being on vacation, we wanted to try as much as we could so we made sure to save room for dessert. We tried the Profiteroles which while being pretty basic, still hit the spot. I have to give extra points to them as well because they have a Cigar To Go menu with the desserts. Prices weren't too bad either considering what you would pay elsewhere on the strip.

Overall it was a great meal. Service was good. Not exactly memorable but got the job done and had no issues. Food was spectacular if you are looking for a good fine dining cuisine.

Before this last Vegas trip I watched an old episode of Anthony Bourdain in Paris. He and Eric Rippert were going around eating in both bistros and super fancy, pretentious French restaurants. Anyhow, this gave me a massive craving for French food that I needed to satisfy.

Knowing that I couldn't afford anything by Joel Robouchon, and could just barely afford Thomas Keller, I went for the latter. However, knowing what kind of experience I was going into, perhaps my expectations were a bit too high. Yes, the food was perfectly prepared and the service was attentive. Yes, I ordered things I did not have the first time around (ordered steak frites, boring but oh so good). Still, after spending 218 bucks for two people, I'm not sure I was completely satisfied. 

Look, the four stars are based on the overall experience. And yes, I was influenced by the fact that Keller has three Michelin Stars. At the same time, I didn't walk out this time feeling I had creamed my pants. My wife was looking forward to scallops (on the online menu by the way). They didn't have a scallop entree, but did have a special scallop appetizer that they told us they ran out of after my wife ordered it. She settled for some heavenly French onion soup. I ordered the charcuterie platter which was enough for 4 people (ate it all myself). If it came with some proper bread, this could've been my entire meal. 

For our main course my wife had the special sea bass, served with gnocci, eggplant, and shitake mushrooms. I thought the fish was a bit bland, but she seemed to like it. I had the roast leg of lamb, oh so tender with barely a hint of gaminess. It came with this block of something. I don't know what it was, but it had a quichelike consistency and it was good. We finished off dinner sharing what we thought were some chocolate covered cream puffs, but the cream turned out to be ice cream. Very nice with coffee. 

Sounds great right? Well, we added a bottle of wine for dinner. I figured if one glass cost 10-20 bucks, might as well get an entire bottle for 50 bucks. Yes, I hate spending that much, knowing it's a 10 dollar bottle, but they all do that. However, online they advertise a new system they call ""vin de carafe."" It says they buy a bunch of ""house style"" wine in bulk, serve it in carafes without labels so that people can enjoy wine with their meals at low cost. This is the essence of bistro fair right?

Once I finally get there, I can breathe a sigh of relief because I just love the breezy, elegant atmosphere. It's airy and bright and has a unique feel from the rest of the strip. Coming here for brunch always makes me feel like I'm on vacation in some exotic location. Portions are small and expensive but that's what you're signing up for with the big name attached.

I had extremely high expectations on this restaurant, as I have been to Thomas' other restaurants, Per Se and French Laundry.  Bouchon seemed like a cross between The Palm and a high end Cheesecake Factory.  Perhaps it was because we were in Vegas,  and Bouchon was in the Venetian with a heavy tourist population, but nonetheless, the vibe didn't scream out ""5 stars"".

The service was slow, probably due to the overly packed restaurant, and the vibe really reminded me of an energetic Cheesecake Factory.

The food itself was good.  There definitely was no comparison to Keller's other restaurants...not even in the same category, but regardless, it was good.  I started with the squash salad, which was interesting and good.  For my entree, I had the special, which was a top sirloin prepared sous vide with a side of spinach and mashed.  The meat was very lean and prepared very well, no complaints here.

The part of the meal that did stand out was the homemade bread.  So good and buttery.

I might give Bouchon another chance and try the one in Beverly Hills.",2,1,0

I finally dragged the bf here, hyping the scrambled eggs.  We sat down, I looked at the next table, and I knew I was in trouble.  Egads!  Not the soft-scrambled eggs of my dreams, but instead the regular steam tray kind of scrambled eggs you can get anywhere.  I asked the waitress if they could do soft-scrambled eggs, and she said no problem.  They came out, and.... disappointment.  A slightly better version of diner eggs.  You think a place that charges $22 for their version of an American breakfast would at least sous-vide the eggs if they didn't want to do them to order.

We were seated, and ordered cocktails.  They brought out the bread and butter and water.  The waiter came and took our order for apps, dinner and the wine we wanted with dinner.  After a bit of a wait a server brought out a dish with a small ramekin of something and pieces of toast.  Since we couldn't hear what the server said (it is noisy in there), we wondered if it was my husband's first course.  And if so, why did they not bring out my salad with it?  

Then two glasses of wine appeared.  Still no cocktails.  We asked about the dish the server brought and were told it was pate, an amuse bouche.  A crock of pate with toast is not an amuse bouche.  It is rich and filling, not a light, two bite amuse bouche.  We asked again about the cocktails and asked that the wine be removed and served with dinner.  It was white wine and we didn't want it warm by the time dinner came around, especially when we were still hoping the cocktails would show up.  

Then a server brought the first course,  a bleu cheese salad and an Alsatian tart.  The tart did not look like what we had envisioned, so my husband asked about it, and the server said, ""you know, the PIZZA.""  :O  So really, it was flatbread.  Tasty enough, but nothing special.  My salad was fine, there were a lot of bleu cheese chunks in it, but it wasn't really good bleu cheese.  Not the good stuff.  Please Bouchon...give me less bleu cheese but let it be creamy and flavorful.  

The waiter came by, we asked again about the cocktails.  They finally appeared after the first course and just before the entrée.  Fine, whatever.  Dinner came, along with the wine.  My dinner was great, moules, fresh, sweet with a lovely sauce, and *that is the only reason this is not a two star review*.  My husband's choucroute was ok, the meat was an odd texture but tasted good, the cabbage was very bland. 

I passed on dessert and had some of my husband's blueberry tart.  It was a tart on a plate.  Tart, plate.  It was dense, bland, and not much blueberry flavor.  But the presentation was sooo lacking...what about some crème anglaise swirled on the plate, topped with the tart and some fresh blueberries and mint, or some little, tiny bit of effort? 

While our waiter seemed pleasant and capable, the timing and the service was off, and it was offputting. There were long intervals between courses.  The food was uneven.  

It seems like Bouchon is not trying anymore.  

It was $180 for the two of us, so I feel they were well rewarded for their lackadaisical service and so-so food.  I really hope that they are not just resting on their laurels, but that's how it seemed to me.  Maybe we will give them another chance, but since there are so many dining alternatives in Las Vegas, we probably won't.",1,0,0

I have yet to have the pleasure of coming here for dinner, but I'm a big fan of their weekend brunch. I've celebrated my birthday here and took the day off from work to do so - which was totally worth it. They do not take reservations for brunch, so you have to come and give your name, but I've never waited too long. Even during my bachelorette party weekend, where they said the table for 8+ was 45 minutes, we got seated in 10 minutes. If there is a wait, they have a cute little seating area and usually pastries for you to sample. They have some daily specials, like a quiche of the day or soup of the day. Their quiches are perfectly soft and pillowy on the inside. I'm actually not a huge fan of their chicken & bacon chive waffles, but since everyone else raves about them, don't let my opinion stop you. One of my must orders is a side of fries - though I do wish they gave slightly bigger portions of ketchup and mayo, I always feel like such a classless fool when I have to ask for more. If you're with a larger group of people, the pastry basket is always a nice way to start off brunch as well while your entrees come in. I was so hungover and sick during the morning of my bachelorette weekend, I couldn't enjoy eating here. I sustained myself on ginger ale and their tasty cauliflower soup, while i watched everyone enjoy their mussels and steaks. I did have some of the foie gras that was ordered for the table - amazingly silky, and a big hit with all the Californians. I was so jealous of everyone's enjoyment, my husband and I ate here the next weekend so I could enjoy Bouchon like how it's meant to be enjoyed. I actually prefer sitting inside since it's beautifully decorated. The outside patio is right next to the pool and some bodies are just not meant to be looked at while you eat brunch. Their champagne cocktails are all really interesting, so you don't have to be basic and get a mimosa, there are a ton of other options. One of my favorite things to eat here is actually complimentary - I love eating their warm baguettes with the mustard on the table while my husband prefers spreading jam and butter on it.

I ordered the mussels and fries (moule frites).  Fries were good, very nice and crispy and properly salty, but were served in a large cone, so that the fries at the bottom of the cone were crushed and steamed by the heat of the fries on top.  The broth served with the mussels was underwhelming and very one-note.  It needed some acid or fennel or something to kick it up.  I've made better myself.

I also sampled some of my wife's chicken and waffles, which were better.  The waffles were really good: a slightly firm crunch on the outside followed by a soft, almost pudding-like inside.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful, but should have had a crispier skin.  It was also served with a gravy that was just too salty, almost like it came from an instant gravy pack.

 One star off for the Absinthe disaster - I was telling the bartender that the de-wormwooded Absinthe is undrinkable, because it tastes like pure anise. The bartender SWORE that they had an excellent tasting version he was SO WRONG! I repeat - I do NOT enjoy drinking pure anise extract, even with ample sugar and water added! Looking at the absinthe cloud when you pour in the water from a special carafe over a sugar cube placed on a special perforated spoon does not make up for the taste!",0,0,0

With Bouchon, he shows us that he has mastery of casual bistro cooking as well, with skillful interpretations of traditional favorites from both France and the US.

We had been to Bouchon for dinner in the past, and were incredibly pleased.  However, Bouchon is the only Keller restaurant to serve breakfast and brunch.  While breakfast is wonderful, weekend brunch offers us a chance to try his chicken and waffles, which is a dish of true genius.  If you're in Vegas on a weekend, go there and get it.

The rest of brunch and breakfast is great too - delicious country sausage, perfect fluffy omelets, pastries and baked goods (including beignets!) that put others to shame.  The attention to detail on even small things is clear - the raspberry jam served with the bread is different from the raspberry jam which fills the beignets; they are covered in powdered sugar, so the jam is less sweet to compensate.

Definitely a pick for dinner too, but I can't imagine going anywhere else in the morning now.  One thing to bear in mind - the portions are pretty heavy.",0,0,0

Our table had the following:
chilled lobster tail- Amazing
Steak frites-Amazing the best frites(fries) i've ever experienced!
Sauteed Salmon- Perfect
Roasted Chicken- Probably the best chicken I have ever had! I try and stay away from chicken when I go out to a nice place because I eat it so often, but I do regret not getting it here. When I go back thats what im getting. Well worth trying!!!! A must, so juicy and the flavor is something I cant put into words. 
Dessert: Profiteroles (like the outside or a cream puff cut in half and filled with ice cream and covered in chocolate sauce) and Im sorry I dont remember the correct name but they were chocolate, chocolate chip mint, and vanilla bean ice cream on top of ""cork"" Brownie's and topped with chocolate sauce! To die for so save room for dessert!!!!
Also I gave this place 5 stars not only because of the wonderful food but also for our waiter Christoph who made the experience all the better. He was very friendly and entertaining. He made us laugh and that always makes dinner even more enjoyable. Great service.

The food here is definitely better than some other places I've rated more favorably BUT to be fair, those other places only cost me 6 bucks versus the $86 I paid here so... you know, to whom much is given, much is required. 

Getting back on track, I spent four days in Vegas and of all the meals I had this was by far the most disappointing. It started with our server's recommendations, which felt very low on sincerity and high on up-sale. It ended with the six primarily underwhelming dishes listed below.

Deviled eggs - really good but limited in the wow department by the simple fact that they are deviled eggs.

Bone Marrow - which I've never tried before but ultimately found to be too sweet for my liking in accordance with my table mate who  suggested the dish based upon positive experiences at other restaurants. 

Pate - fancy spam?

Gnudi - highlight of the meal and the only thing I would've ordered again if given a second chance.

Roasted Chicken - good but if you told me it was from costco I might have believed you

And finally...dessert, which we'll alphabetize under U for un-memorable.

With a bottle of wine my one-third of the bill came to $86. Not only that but now I had no high priced amazing meal to brag about when I got home, so I also blame it for the $111 I spent the next night at Ruth's Chris to make up for it, which BTW was worth every penny.

Terrine de foie gras...OMG! I could've finished all 5 oz to myself if I didn't eat a bunch of other stuff. Their crispy finger-sized toasts made the perfect companions.

Grand plateau....this is their 3-tiered humongous seafood combination platter that include cocktail shrimps, 3 types of raw oysters (including Kumamoto), raw clams, mussels and lobsters! My favorites were the Kumamoto oysters...they were the perfect size (abt a one dollar coin), so creamy and super fresh! Yummmm!!

House special short rib...tender, delicious and FULL of flavor!! It's laid on top of a bed amazingly flavored mushrooms that's been reduced in wine and their special sauce. 

Salade de Cresson d'Endive....delicious and refreshing with perfectly seasoned vinaigrette and walnuts.

Veal Chateaubriand...extremely tender cuts of meat but flavor was nothing too memorable.

Escargot a la Bourguignonne...braised burgundy snails with garlic butter under Bouchon's puffed pastry. Fantastic but very heavy on the butter....the richness of the butter and the pastry may turn some off.

Our party of 9 came here for brunch since it was convenient and I liked my dinner experience here. Our group ordered a multitude of items: croque madame, 3 egg omelette, spinach quiche, salmon baguette, sausage,  and chicken and waffles. The croque madame was definitely the winner - over easy eggs with melted cheese on top of a brioche, sandwiched in between was layers of ham. Came with fries and it was SO DELICIOUS! The other winner was the spinach quiche. 

So towards the middle of our meal, we see the table next to us have the head pastry chef come out and present them with this dessert concotion (SECRET!). We knew it wasn't on the menu and knew that the table knew the chef somehow, but we requested from our waiter if we could possible order that dessert. The waiter said he wasn't sure but would ask the chef for us.

5 minutes later, the waiter, ""I'm sorry, the chef isn't able to make you that since it take a day to make, but he wanted to send out complimentary rasberry ice cream popsicles"". Imagine our excitement as these were vanilla ice cream popsicles NOT on the menu with rasberry filling. HOW LUCKY were we with this free dessert?!

1 minute later, the chef himself walks out and presents us with the dessert concotion and says, ""Next time you're here, just let me know and I'll make these for you."" SO EXCITED! We took pictures with him and shook his hand for his generosity.

30 seconds later as we were excitedly commending our good luck since we got 2 free desserts, 2 busboys come out with 3 creme brulees, compliments of the chef. WTF?! ARE YOU KIDDING?! :)

1 spoon into the creme brulee, we're presented with the Mousse au Chocolat Noir (dark chocolate mousse) and the Pot de Creme (infused custard). OMGOMG we are freaking out.

Halfway into the mousses, a waiter comes out with the Creme Glacee\/ Sorbet Aux fruits (3 different types of sorbets) - the lemon sorbet was DELICIOUS!), AND the Profiteroles (vanilla ice cream & chocolate sauce, which had this breadlike thing on top of the vanilla) and the waiter had to pour the chocolate sauce for us. We were ESCTATIC!

LITERALLY 10 seconds later, another busboy (who has sensed that I was the MOST excited out of everyone, or perhaps I was just the loudest), put next to me, the Tarte au Citron (lemon tart), and a flan. By this time, I have NO IDEA what to eat and am confused as to what I tasted.

The last dessert that they gave us, was the Ile Flottante (meringue with vanilla creme anglaise). This was the only dish I didn't like because it was a creme that was very light...sort of the cappucino creme, that didn't appeal to me so much.

Bill came with no charges to ANY of the desserts. BEST DAY OF MY LIFE! THANK YOU PASTRY CHEF CHRIS HERRIN for making a group of 25 year olds have one of the greatest memories of their lives. :)",8,6,10

It's impossible to get a reservation at the French Laundry and since I was going to be in Vegas over the 4th of July weekend, I thought I would try Bouchon Bistro.  I had heard wonderful things about this restaurant going back to season one episode seven of NO RESERVATIONS--one of Anthony Bourdain's show on the Food Network.  I got a reservation immediately--and maybe that should have been my first clue that something was wrong.

A friend and I went to the restaurant on Monday, 7\/6\/09 a little after 6 PM.  We were immediately seated and the waiter brought us warm pistachio nuts with our bread and butter.  Everything looked pristine and exactly what I would expect from a fine dining establishment.  However, the place was empty except for a few diners seated near the windows.  I just assumed we were early and everyone dined late in Vegas.

We came to enjoy fine cuisine and to be thrilled by Thomas Keller's reputation and didn't hesitate to order the most  expensive item on the menu--the Grand Plateau for $110 plus a side order of French Fries--a dish Bourdain claimed was better than his own.  We figured these two were their signature dishes and had to be the best!. Boy were we WRONG!!!!

The french fries were good but not spectacular.  Shoe string potato fries served in a paper cone is pretty common these days at least in the San Francisco Bay Area.  It's hard to judge a restaurant solely on their fries so we waited for our Grand Plateau.

When the seafood tower arrived, we sampled the raw oysters and clams.  They were fresh and sweet.  Then we moved onto the cooked seafood.  We tried the jumbo prawns and were taken aback.  The shrimps were meaty but had no flavor and were bone chilling cold.  Next we moved onto the dungeness crab.  A fresh crab should have opaque flakes of sweet meat.  The crab we were served had a dense meat and absolutely no flavor.  Ditto for the lobster.  In fact, the lobster tail tasted water logged.  The mussels also tasted a little weak--like mussels at half strength.

I mentioned this to the manager and he suggested that perhaps I didn't understand the texture of East Coast crab or lobsters since I was from the Bay Area.  He also told me that the chef steamed the seafood and it was never plunged in ice water.  Despite the manager's and chef's assurances, my palate knew better.  The seafood tasted like it had been prepped in advance and stored in a very cold refrigerator.  Perhaps it had even gotten partially frozen and that soggy water logged texture was actually the melted ice crystals.

I grew up on fresh seafood.  My father use to work in restaurants and he would buy the fresh catch of the day in San Francisco's Chinatown and my family would wake up each morning to a seafood breakfast fit for a king.  My father's best dishes were jumbo prawns bursting with roe in steamed eggs with green onions and of course the simple cracked crab.  My father never overcooked his seafood and we ate our crab without any sauces because we wanted to savor the sweetness of the meat.

You can imagine how disappointed we were when we were served Bouchon's interpretation of fresh seafood.  In hindsight, it's obvious they had probably stocked up on seafood for the 4th of July holiday and I was experiencing seafood that had arrived several days earlier.  Also since it was over 100 degrees in Las Vegas, it's hard to keep seafood super fresh.  Going back to Anthony Bourdain's book, Kitchen Confidential-- Never order seafood on Monday, especially if it's ""special."" That fish probably was delivered on Thursday, in anticipation of busy Friday and Saturday night dinners. If it hasn't been eaten by Sunday night, it becomes Monday's special.

Frankly I was more insulted by the manager and chef who tried to convince us that our palates were wrong rather than admit their food was not the freshest.  It's unforgiveable to blame the customer for the restaurant's failing.  The manager never apologized or even offered us a complimentary glass of wine or dessert.  When I got back to the office, I told everyone about our experience and believe me, most of my co-workers will think twice before choosing a Thomas Keller establishment in the future.  His food does not live up to his reputation and I'm afraid in these tough economic times, he has lowered his standards!  If Bouchon had ever been upscale, it has truly gone downhill!",6,0,1

Without question there food is phenomenal. Everything we had was cooked to perfection. A welcomed shortcoming was how heavy the food sits in you belly afterwards. They render everything in fat and obviously use a lot of butter. That is in no way a knock. It's what you have to expect from a French restaurant, and it is delicious. 

Having had such a nice experience the first time, we decided to go back on our current trip to LV. This time it was quite comical going to Bouchon. It was roughly 9pm. We asked to sit at the bar, however, we had our infant and were told infants cannot be up at the bar. That was totally understandable. 

We sat at a high top just in front of the bar. We were pretty excited to eat here again. Our server, Kim was very nice and asked if she could move is to a lower table in order to accommodate our child. It wasn't a big deal to us to sit at a high top, but it felt like it would be more comfortable for our server to move. 

This is the hilarious part. There were several open tables throughout the restaurant. I even took pictures to note how many were open. However, instead of being taken to a table, the restaurant took a silverware linen and laid it flat on a small table. Guess where this small table was? They created us a table in the waiting room of the restaurant. LMAO!!!!! We couldn't believe it!!!! They actually brought glasses and silverware to create a table to resemble a table within the restaurant. However, as I said, instead of a table cloth we had a silver wear linen as our table cloth. Hahaha. 

If it wasn't so funny to us that they sat us in the waiting room I would have been embarrassed to have been sat there. As people left the restaurant they stared at us like lowly peddlers. Oh well, it has been to date the most unprofessional thing a restaurant has ever done to us, but it was funny. 

Five stars would be inline because the food is just so good. I was the only one to eat because we had earlier had dinner at another restaurant, but I ended up sacrificing the majority of my meal to my growing 10 month old. At Bouchon I ordered the duck confit and a side of sautéed spinach. Yum and yum. 

It's the kind of flavor that makes you close your eyes and take in all the flavor. If I was a beaver I would store the good in my cheeks so I could ration all that flavor in my mouth for a month. I wish I could describe it with the breath of a snobby food critic to do it justice. I suppose it's only fitting that the guy sat in the holding room writes to all the minions. 

As always, we recommend Bouchon. It's very good. Perhaps next time we will have a table setup in the restroom so as to be able to fill our own water glasses when we require more water. Bon a petit dude!",1,0,0

We were considering visiting Napa and I really wanted to go to one of Keller's restaurants , so eating here was high on the list for dining in Vegas for me.

I ordered the sourdough waffles and a side of bacon, my husband the breakfast american with a strawberry croissant, one of the daily specials, as his pastry. We both got coffee and his meal came with juice.

The coffee was good but didn't stick out in anyway other than tasting relatively freshly brewed. No burnt coffee, yay! The waffles, served with syrup, vanilla bean butter, and strawberries, were fantastic. It was especially glorious to have all three together on a bite of waffle, the flavors melding together. The effect was a light sort of sweetness that wasn't too heavy or overwhelming. Possibly one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The bacon was...bacon. And there was a lot of it. It was actually bordering on too much bacon.

I got a bite of the husbands croissant, which was also incredibly delicious. It had a think layer of strawberry jam and was topped with a crumb topping and served warm. The fresh, tart flavor of the jam kept the pastry from being overwhelming rich. It was really tasty and I wish we had brought some home. Husbands eggs were over easy, cooked perfectly, and he said the flavors in his sausage were very good too.

We made a reservation the day before on Open Table and got the time we wanted (it was a Tuesday after all).  When we got there we asked to be seated outside and with luck, they had a table big enough for our party of 6.  The outdoor seating area is on a raised balcony in the same courtyard as the pool.  You would never know though, because the landscaping and design of the area makes you feel like you are in an olive tree filled Italian Piazza with ancient columns and little nooks for sitting.  In any case, the atmosphere is great and with the weather that Vegas has, you can't go wrong sitting outside.

Anyway on to the food and drink.  They serve some classic cocktails (I had the Singapore Sling), new cocktails, wine and beer.  The menu comes on a piece of brown paper (similar to butcher's paper) and it's wrapped around your napkin.  Great selection of food.  I had French Onion soup and a dish that included scallops and giant capers.

The BF and I made our way out to Vegas for our 1st anniversary. Very exciting!  It was definitely an amazing, hilarous and interesting few days.  I booked most of our meals in advance after extensive research, ending our stay in Vegas with a lovely dinner at Bouchon before he took me to see ""Spamalot"" for my birthday.

It was a lovely evening and we were sat at a nice table by the outdoor courtyard.  I was first surprised by people in ""tourist"" clothing sitting a few seats down, but it didn't really bother me.  I just thought it was odd.  Then, the nightmare began.

Our waiter must have been a struggling actor from Long Island that finally decided to make the trip over to the West Coast in hopes of becoming a back up dancer\/feather boy for Celine Dion.  From the start, we hated this gentleman, who I will call Waiter from here.  BF and I began to look over the menu and specials, as Waiter quickly blew threw each special.  

Quote of the evening: ""Hey, so um, do you guys want any wine? Are you even old enough to drink?""

We are paying over $300 for this meal and this is the first question you ask us? Rut roh.  Now, BF and I are in our 20s and definitely look over 21.  If I recall, we ordered 1 glass of wine each (I white and he red.) Cause, ""Yea, I guess we can use our fake IDs here to get some booze...""

We ordered our meal.  Most of the dishes were recommended by Waiter; and I must say, he was spot on.  Each dish we experienced was wonderfully and perfectly prepared.  The highlight was the rabbit confit to start -- my life was changed at that moment.

Throughout the meal, Waiter would stop by our table, start cracking jokes with his annoying New York accent.  BF and I are both from the East Coast and lived in the NY metro area, so this wasn't strange to us; what was strange was his complete lack of courtesy when divebombing onto our table with some lame ass joke or wise crack.  

We finished our entrees, and thought it would be fun to start the evening off with the absinthe cocktail, which was really meant to be a cocktail enjoyed prior to your meal to cleanse your palette.   I thought it would be fun and silly to try this...the even light it on fire!! So, we ordered it, while we completely understood that it was a bit ""against the grain.""

Quote #2 of the evening: ""Are you guys seriously ordering that? Umm, it's not really an apertif, but whatever...**chuckle**""

As he walked away from our table, I could visibly see steam coming out of the BF's ears.  His face was turning red and his lips were pearsed.  We need to get out of here soon...before he does something even more embarrassing that this waiter's freakshow of an act.

So, we finish our unconventional and apparently LAUGHABLE absinthe and pay the check and leave.  The End.

However, this is something I have NEVER done before.  I've been in many fine dining establishments in my life, but have never been so disappointed by our experience to bring it up to the front-of-the-house manager.  So, I asked the kind hostess if I could speak to the FOTH manager and pulled him outside the restaurant and let him have it.

I told him that our waiter completely ruined our meal and if it wasn't for the beautiful and delicious food that was prepared, I would never recommend Bouchon to anyone. Ever. Again.

Moral of the story: Bouchon Food = 5 stars.

We ate here on the day before New Year's Eve so that may have been why we easily got a reservation at prime dinner time.  Everything from start to finish was pretty much impeccable. 

Sourdough bread in the shape of leaves were brought out immediately with softened butter in a small ramekin.  One thing I hate is when warm bread is brought out with butter that is ice cold and hard to spread on the bread, so I really appreciated that the butter was the right temperature to easily spread.

For a starter, we split the Terrine of foie gras which was delicious.  It has a thin layer of braised beef ground down to a coarse pate texture, then a thin layer of foie gras, then a layer of prune gelee.  Served with crostini and a small frisee salad.  The slightly slightly saltier beef and the creamy foie went so well together. The prune gelee added that touch of cool sweetness that made it all work together.  A dish I would definitely recommend.

For our entrees, I got the Steak frites, and Mark H had the Leg of lamb (Gigot d'Agneau.)  Mine was hangar steak topped with caramelized onions served with a compound butter and a healthy portion of nicely crispy, thinly cut fries.  The steak was cooked to a perfect mid rare and was tender.  The onions and the compound butter did overpower the steak a bit, though.

Mark H's dish on the other hand, was the better of the two.  The roasted leg of lamb was just so tender and flavorful,  the knife cut through the meat like butter.  The lamb was served with flageolet beans and braised escarole.  Our server asked him when he was ordering if he wanted any sides to go with it since it didn't come with a starch but the beans and escarole was enough for an entree portion.  Besides, I know he wanted to save room for dessert.

For dessert, we split the Banana crepe gateau.  Layers of crepes with banana pastry cream between them, served with salted caramel and french vanilla gelato.   This was pretty amazing as well.  I've had some fantasic gateau de crepes in france and this one really reminded me of being there.  The banana flavor was a bit too subtle for me but that salted caramel was like heaven.  Such an incredible texture to it with that bright kick of salt, damn.  The french vanilla gelato was memorable as well.  Nice silky texture and oh so creamy.

the food was simply mahh-velous! i've never had anyone ask me how i wanted my salmon cooked, but being japanese i opted for medium (the rarest she went). the plating was gorgeous and the smattering of veggies underneath was so butter\/garlic infused that i almost cleaned house!

the real treat was that chocolate mousse. it had a great, real chocolate flavor to it that didn't need any sugary assistance. the lemon tart was REALLY sour, but as low as my spice tolerance is, i love the sour! the brownie tower things were cute, and i also liked how the mint ice cream tasted like mint leaves instead of the traditional peppermint essence.

Logistically, the restaurant is incredibly hidden away, and all the signs on the main casino floor take you to Bouchon Bistro which is a casual cafe. We had to ask the concierge where to go and he told us to take the elevator upstairs to the guest floor and then walk down a long hallway? Yikes. After a short wait we were taken to a table by the service station... not ok. Asked to move to a nicer booth (the restaurant was not packed, and it was my birthday after all ;) ) and we were surrounded by couples and other birthday celebrations. 

I started with an excellent glass of sparkling wine and 1\/2 dozen oysters, 2 of differing varieties. My mom and I shared the 2.5 oz. foie gras terrine which was soo smooth and delicious it was basically like eating meat flavored butter (which someone should invent).

He had a ribeye special for his entree, my mom had a HUGE bowl of the most delicious moules frites I've ever had, and I had an appetizer portion of the duck confit because I was stuffed to the gills at that point already! We wanted the bone marrow as well but sadly they were out of it that evening. We also ordered a 1\/2 carafe of a California Pinot, they have a great wine list in all sizes btw, and they brought out a complimentary lemon tart for my birthday.

What's different about Bouchon is they don't drain or wash the saltwater from the oysters once they are open. Slurping one of these beauties down is like a tasting the ocean in your mouth. Delicious. Now to the good stuff. I ordered a rack of baby pork ribs braised in a red wine sauce on top of yukon gold mash potatoes. The meat was so tender it slipped off the bone and the wine sauce had the perfect balance of richness, thickness and complexity that made my mouth water everytime I took a bite.

I think that Bouchon has fallen out of favor in the Vegas crowd =( Our reservations were super easy to get and move for a Saturday night and the restaurant itself was very empty. However it was the perfect, quiet, delicious spot to take my parents for a nice meal before our show!

First of all the bread and warm pistachios are a great start. The bread was fluffy and delicious with a great crust and the pistachios were a hit with our table!! You know you're in for a great french meal when you can trust them to get the bread right.

We ordered:
Escargot: Cooked and served just the way escargot should be with a perfect puff pastry on top! 
Pig ears: MY FAVORITE. And just $11!! If you're a fan of pig ears or chicharrones or anything with pig flavor these are a must order. I wish I could have an order of these every day!!
Foie gras: Perfectly cooked and fatty and tender with no sinew running through. Hubby says it might be the best foie he's every had!
Salmon tartare: Light flavor and a nice balance to all the fatty items.
Mussels: Super chubby mussels and a very flavorful broth! Prepare to ask for more bread to dunk in.
Salmon with spetzle and beet butter: Surprisingly good! Salmon is usually pretty plain but the spetzle was perfect and the beet butter genius.

Service was very good and the manager even came by at the end to apologize for a dish coming out late but we were sharing everything family style and didn't even notice.

All in all a great meal! I will 100% be back for those pig ears!",2,1,2

We came in with a group of five, and the general vibe our waitress made us all feel uncomfortable. It would be understandable if only one or two of us felt this way, but the fact that five out of five of us felt the similar way about her without us sharing our feelings prior, definitely points to the direction that she was mistreating us. It seemed like she was interacting with us in a condescending manner, as if she felt we did not belong there. If that was all it was, then it would not have been a big deal at all.

However, it took us over 45 minutes to receive our food, and we had only ordered three dishes. My friends ordered a medium-rare steak and fries dish, and it was completely raw and the outer parts were burnt. While picking at it, our waitress asked us how our food was, and they responded that it was a little too rare. She proceeded to tell them to ""put it on"" while extending a plate to them. There was no apology nor word of reassurance that the matter would be resolved. When she brought it back, it was chewy, tasted like charcoal, and about a medium well-done. 

My boyfriend and I ordered a Croque Madame, and when we received it (over five minutes before our friends' food) it was completely cold and the bread was stale. Don't get me wrong, it would have been amazing if fresh and warm. However, what was brought out to us was cold, clumpy, and had the consistency of play-doh. 

The other dish we ordered, a pudding-based French toast, was underwhelming and nothing special. 

Overall, I would not come here again. This was not only a waste of money, but a waste of time. If you come to Las Vegas looking to enjoy yourself, do not come here. Bouchon will always be remembered, but as a place of waitresses with attitude, cold food, and extremely slow service.",1,1,0

I normally love Bouchon's chocolate croissants from their bakery, but they served this warmed up slightly and it was divine! The croissant was flaky and perfect and the chocolate was slightly melted. Absolutely delicious! the Croque Madame was delicious! They use brioche toast for the bread -- toasted light and fluffy. I'm normally not a fan of ham, but this ham was actually pretty tasty. Also the fried egg on the top was cooked perfectly runny. Be warned, though, that this comes with a very large portion of shoe string french fries. I thought the fries were mediocre (I'm not sure if i've ever been blown away by french fries...), but the rest of the breakfast was great! The American breakfast is nothing extraordinary, but everything is executed well and a great deal for the amount of food you get, considering this is after all, Bouchon.

I didn't care for the toast, but the sausage was excellent!  I also ordered a chocolate almond croissant, which came out hot and tasty.  The croissant was excellent, I would recommend it and order it again the next time I come!  

My dad tried the pan seared trout; it was served with a side of green beans.  The trout was fresh and cooked perfect, they also had a very good balance of spices to give the fish a little flavor...I wasn't expecting much from this dish, but it was excellent!  The one thing I didn't like was that the fish came head-on, and there were still some bones in the fish.  I think I swallowed a few bones, it's very hard to eat trout because is has a lot of small bones, they should probably work on de-boning the whole fish and serving it without the head.
  
The croque madame was excellent; it is a tad heavy and oily. It's served with a sunny-side up egg on top and a heaping portion of fresh cut fries!  This is definitely the dish to eat if you want a hearty, heavy, oily dish for breakfast...it just tastes great and its deep fried...how can you go wrong!?! They also serve it with a large portion of French fries, which reminded me of In-n-Out fries.   My mom tried the French toast, it didn't taste bad, but it was a very small portion.  The French toast was presented nicely on the dish, and it wasn't overly sweet...it's definitely the perfect breakfast starter, but you would probably need to order a pastry or side dish because the French toast was a tad bit on the small side. 

They charged $3.50 for a cup of tea with cream and sugar...honestly, it was just a teabag with hot water!  Just a tad too pricey for tea here, don't think ill be ordering tea again.

The foie gras is silky smooth once it reaches room temperature and while on my most recent visit, the ""foie gold"" as the layer of duck fat is referred to, was removed and whisked away, it can certainly be enjoyed on the never ending toasted bread that is made available for this delicacy.  While all the dishes I have tried at both the original location and the Las Vegas location are identical in taste, portion and presentation, I do find it amusing that the servers need to educate the Las Vegas crowd as to what certain items are, including certain spices and seasonings, including perhaps taking my ""foie gold"" away as they assumed that I was not educated enough to know what it was - this would never have happened at the original Yountville restaurant, as the Bay Area is foodie central.

So I'm in Vegas for a friend's bachelor's party, Hangover-style, but with more foodies. Outside of our primary goal of giving our friend-soon-to-be-groom one final night on the town before settling down, our secondary goal was simple: find good, non-buffet food on the strip. After some searching and much delineation, we decided that Bouchon looked like the safest choice for a decent meal. We entered the lavishly decorated restaurant with large expectations and appetites.

Perusing the menu, I was torn between getting French Toast (my all-time favorite) and something savory. Although the description of the French Toast (with caramelized apples, maple syrup, and bananas) seemed pretty decadent, my concerns were assuaged by the fact that they are a bakery in addition to being a restaurant, so I ended up splitting the French Toast and the heftily priced Chicken & Waffles with a friend.

Well, that was a mistake. The French Toast came out as a single tiny pillar plopped onto the dish. Surprisingly, it included very little bread, and instead was supplemented by layers of candied apple slices, mortared with custard, and drowned in syrup. Way too sweet, and almost no bounce from the brioche bread; in short, completely unbalanced. Why this wasn't on the dessert menu was beyond me. At least I split it with the Chicken & Waffles, right?

Wait, what? A paltry 1\/4 chicken, and 4 meager waffle slices? For $26? The meat was scant and not even that good, and the waffles--and I don't use this description lightly--tasted more like air than anything else. Sure there was a slight waft from the chives and bacon, but nothing potent enough to make you forget how little substance the waffles really had.

We also ordered a few sides of bacon for the table, but the strips were soggy and not very flavorful. We didn't finish them.

I ended up paying nearly $40 for breakfast for sub-par food and wasn't even full.
Conclusion: Offensively overpriced.

Conversely, service was exceedingly good, almost as if our waiter was attempting to make up for the fact that it was overpriced with his pleasantness, but there was no digging out of this hole. Do not be swayed by the inexplicably numerous good reviews for this place. Avoid.

Looks like my quest to find decent food on the strip continues.",0,0,0

Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. 

We both ordered the Breakfast American for $22 (3 eggs, 2 pieces of toast and sausage). Neither one of us eat meat so we substituted fruit for the sausage.  We also ordered coffee and orange juice. 

The drinks were just OK, nothing special. The OJ was fresh squeezed but it tasted like they old.  There was also no pulp in the glass to let you know it was fresh squeezed. 

As it turns out, I didn't like any of the coffee in Vegas or any other drinks made with water. So my guess it was my taste buds and not the coffee.    

They brought the pastry basket pretty quickly. The pastries were fine, again nothing special. 

When the eggs came they were not as we ordered. I ordered scrambled soft, my friend ordered scrambled hard. When they came out they were exactly the same. 

All in all it was a disappointing, expensive meal.   The service was also fine, nothing special (not that I expect that for breakfast).

I paid $18 for a shitty side salad on top of a BUTTERED toast.

I will not be back at to this location. I will tell others not to go here, but I will say that the baristas at the bouchon bakery downstairs make great coffee drinks, and they don't give you attitude when you ask for almond or soy milk.

After watching Top Chef: Las Vegas for the first time ever, it got me wanting to explore and learn more about the culinary world. Then in my multi-task mode I went looking for places to eat in Las Vegas for my recent trip there. The words ""Thomas Keller"" and ""Michelin rated"" came up and so I was sold on Bouchon. 

With more than 600 reviews I'll just add some nice things for when someone else is on a similar search for nice places to eat in Vegas in hopes that a Yelp review will steer them in the right direction especially if you're not feeling eating buffets all the time...this is a nice change of pace. 

Brunch is excellent here. It's relaxed but at the same time you're experiencing some fine dining. I've had people tell me after I went, that every time they come to Vegas with their family, they go to Bouchon.  

I like pastries and with so many choices I just decided to go with an assortment of four pastries in the Bouchon Pastry Basket. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=mHIby3_tPU4T_b9Jubc7fg
They're all good but filling. Another instance where I was eating with my eyes and not with my stomach.

I had the Chicken and Waffles and they were the best. Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles is great too but Bouchon delivers it like no other. 

The Croque Madame was as good as advertised and the pommes frites were delicious. Leave it to the French to make great French Fries. 

It was all so filling that I couldn't possibly fit dessert. But then I saw the table across from me all come in just to eat dessert and I cried a little bit when I saw the various dessert options. Then they proceeded to savor every bit as if to rub it in my face. I tried to focus on the fact that we had a table overlooking the pool in the Venetian or that our waiter had been especially helpful in providing an excellent dining experience but none of that puts amazing looking profiteroles in my stomach.

However, it should be noted that I just came back from Paris so perhaps my expectations were higher. That said, I have tried French food in the states. As such, I can't go beyond two stars. I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough. The breads were not up to par, the vegetables over saturated, and the meat run of the mill, with no distinction in flavor.  It's like they have a few template dishes and they remake it over and again, with varying quality. To me, the appeal of French cuisine is that a lot of attention and care is focused on the nuance of flavors and the artistry of the final product. I feel like this restaurant is more focused on giving Americans the image of French food but not the substance. But I guess this is fitting, as it is in Las Vegas (note the fake eiffel tower, european replicas). So in that respect, this Bouchon is every bit as kitschy as the place it's located. While Las Vegas' kitsch is part of its charm, this doesn't quite work for Bouchon. Even the staff appear to be part of the spectacle, ad hoc accents all over the place.  Hopefully, someone comes in and will rescue this place from being cruise ship fare  and turn it into a good option for French food on the  strip.",1,1,0

I have also noticed a few changes that bothered me since my last visits.

It can get quite crowded in the morning.  Breakfast is their thang afterall... which ends at 10:30am.  As long as you get your name on the list to the hostess before 10:30am you are safe.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table.  The restaurant itself is beautiful.  The windows are tall and the sunlight pours right in from the Venezia gardens.  You actually feel like you are in a true French bistro.

The sourdough waffles are always a delight.  I pretty much only order this for breakfast.  The dough is light and fluffy with a slight sourness from the sourdough (in a good way).  They don't over stuff you like most waffles and pancakes do.  Every time that I have had them in the past it has come with strawberries and blackberries.  This time however it came with bananas and walnuts... MEH.  We asked our waitress why and she said that strawberries aren't in season... which makes sense except that I saw the lady next to us receive waffles with strawberries and blackberries on hers!  ARGH.  So I push the walnuts off and only eat the bananas which are a lame fruit compared to fresh berries.

I don't like maple syrup so I ask for whipped cream every time.  Usually it is thick whipped cream but this time the consistency is more airy like the whipped topping on a latte.  Another MEH in my book...

I like to order a side of their bacon to go with the waffles so that I get a little bit of meat.  Their side is about $5 but they give you a lot of bacon.  Worth it.

Do not order the Brioche French Toast... it is not what you expect.  My mother and brother have both ordered this and not liked it.  It is more bread pudding than French toast.  If you are a bread pudding fan then this is for you.

Also if you like traditional corned beef hash do not order the Bouchon version.  It is the kind where the meat is all chopped up... my mom felt that there also were not enough potatoes to balance out all the corned beef in the dish.  Just be aware of the variations that Bouchon puts on normal breakfast dishes.

I love the baked goods and coffees.  Their vanilla latte is perfect and their cheese danish is something that we always bring back.  You can get baked goods in the bottom floor of the Venetian.  It is also cheaper than the sit down restaurant of course.

I haven't had lunch here but the pomme frites look delicious.  My family likes the breakfast here but just be careful with what you order and make sure you know what you are getting.  The sourdough waffles are a no fail choice.",1,1,1

My first time there was with a friend of mine.  We started the meal with their homemade jam and bread.  It was delicious!  For our entrée, I ordered their Croque Madame (toasted ham and cheese on brioche with a fried egg and mornay sauce, with a side of fries). It was a simple dish, but with big and great flavor.  However, their fries were okay, nothing too special about them.  I've also tried their corned beef hash and profiteroles, delicious! 

I love this place -  excellent service, impeccable and delicious food, and beautiful decoration.  It's a must try place in Vegas!",2,1,1

This restaurant is mismanaged and the food seems like it's right out of the microwave. I visited Bouchon back in 2009 but didn't remember the name when my friend made the reservation. I didn't like it in 2009 and things have gotten worse.

If Yelp had negative stars, this is the place to award it.

We had a party of 13 last week. The waiter raved about the fresh oysters and how they were flown in daily. We ordered 3 each for apps and 2 out of the 3 oysters were horrible. We were nice and didn't send any back. However we provided some candid feedback. 

The main courses were all $35+ except for a ham and cheese sandwich. I'd the veal which was so-so. My friends had other specials like salmon, steak and fries, etc. Again, nothing special. They all tasted like food from a chain like Chili's. 

At the end of the meal, the waiter grabbed the plates and spilled food residue on my head and didn't even notice he had done so. I'd to call him back to tell him. The waiter didn't offer any napkins or anything to help me clean up. He said sorry and left. When I demanded a manager, the manager again only apologized on behalf of the waiter. The manager kept asking me what I wanted. Common now... What I wanted then couldn't be fixed because my hair is dirty, my shirt is stained, and my whole dining experience was ruined. I could have told him I wanted a shower, new clothes and a ride back to my hotel... but it wouldn't be reasonable. 

If this place was run by a professionals and wanted to be a high end restaurant, the manager would have immediately offered compensation instead of asking me what I want. The manager would have offered a discount or a cab back to my room to clean up, etc. After scolding at the manager, another person came back and waived my $35 plate. Essentially saying we'll feed you if you let us spill dirty food all over you after you've finished your meal. 

So if you want a real dining experience instead of getting abused and dealing with amateurs, go across the street to the Bellagio's Picasso or any other restaurant.",4,2,0

Not in the sense of choosing food (I'll eat pretty much anything in front of me AND in front of you), but I am difficult to impress.

My first visit here was for dinner and I got the mussels. I was really expecting a small portion of barely edible shellfish and had plans to stop at the gift shop on the way back to the room and binge on potato chips. No need, no need. There were enough mussels here to feed a small country. Not only was the portion generous, but I got a huge side of fries along with it. Score! I also had my first foie gras experience, and once I got the image of ducks buried in dirt out of my head, I enjoyed that as well. The desserts were to die for...I have a special relationship with creme brulee that must be revisited on scheduled intervals. Bouchon made it happen, and I was not disappointed.

The service was excellent, with a pair of friendly hosts greeting us and an excellent waiter taking care of us.  Her recommendations were delivered painstakingly and with pride.

Again, was blown away by the delicious food (Steak Frites and large raw seafood platter).  But what really made this trip to Bouchon memorable was how well we were treated with two tired toddlers in tow.  We arrived on a Saturday night at 10 PM without reservations (we just arrived in town, starving, otherwise the kids would have been in bed) looking for a good meal.  Our hostess greeted us warmly and even gave our oldest a Ratatouille coloring book and crayons.  That is how I knew they were truly welcoming to children - great for a French restaurant to take that little step to welcome children!  Tables were spaced well so that when the inevitable meltdown occurred it wasn't disruptive to the other diners (or so their smiles and kind words said).  I left Bouchon even more impressed than before, with plans to visit again soon.  It is always a challenge to find an upscale restaurant with delicious food that will welcome young children.  Already a favorite due to the excellent cuisine, Bouchon may be my new favorite restaurant after how well we were treated.  I will definitely be back.

My first time trying roasted bone marrow and I loved it!  I had no idea there was so much flavor in the marrow of bone.

Salade de Pommes de Terre  *
This was potato salad but pumped up a notch.  It was good but what really made this was the egg yolk on top.

Escargot a la Bourguignonne  *
So buttery & delicious and topped with a super light, fluffy, puff pastry

Confit de Canard  *
The duck leg confit was so delicious and flavorful and the lentils were the best lentils I've ever tasted!

Confit d'Esturgeon
This was a bit of a disappointment.  After starting off with 4 great starters, this dish was a just okay.

Bouchon
Chocolate brownies shaped like corks but BETTER than ordinary brownies.  As you would expect from a restaurant known for it's pastries, these were the perfect balance between rich, chewy goodness but not too chewy with a bit of that crunchy edge that everyone loves.  These are a must!

I can't recall the name of the other dessert we ordered.  Perhaps it's because I could have easily forgotten this dessert.  It was described as almost like a fancy pop tart.  I guess that should have been a clue but I expected more.

I was also disappointed that they didn't have beignets on the menu for dessert but returned the following morning to get my beignet fix.

BREAKFAST:

Beignets  *
FANTASTIC!!  We were lucky enough to get a special treat!  After meeting the pastry Chef, after our delicious dinner, we got a special order of beignets.  Three types, filled with chocolate, raspberry and a delicious vanilla custard.  The vanilla one's were my favorite but all were oh so delicious!

Corned Beef Hash
This was surprisingly disappointing.  It was mostly corned beef and very little potato.  I prefer my corned beef and potato bits to have more crispy edges.  I also asked for my eggs to be 'sunny side up' but they were more 'over medium'.  My yolk did not ooze out over my corned beef, the way I like it to.

Moules au Safran et a la Moutarde  *
This was so delicious!  Better than the mussels I experienced in Brussels but then I think I somehow managed to find the worst place to have them when I was in Belgium.  Anyways, these were so buttery, garlicky and TASTY!!  We hardly touched the fries, although they were thin, crispy and perfectly fried.  The rest of the food was just too good to fill up on fries.

It's a small restaurant but the tables weren't crammed together. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and drink menu.

The food was good, it wasn't amazing but still tasty. Here's a quick review of what we ordered:

1. Chicken and waffles (one of their popular dishes)- the chicken was average but the waffle was really nice. The waffle was large and fluffy not dense at all. The syrup for the waffle was lovely, it wasn't to overly sweet and overpowered my tastebuds. 
2. Sausage Hash- if you're a big fan of crunch you will not be disappointed with this dish! The potatoes were so delicious and crunchy!! And to top it off? A nice runny sunny side egg.

All in all a huge let down. I was expecting something reminiscent of the French Laundry, and I got something that didn't even really rival Denny's, sad to say.

Dining at Bouchon was a culinary turning point for me.  First it gave me a new appreciation for French cuisine and second it checked off a few slots on my foodie list:  1) Most Expensive Meal Ever 2) Best Meal Ever 3) First  Time trying Pate 4) Best French Fries Ever  I know the second point may sound like a stretch, but I don't kid on the seriousness of how excellent my dinner was.

Here's what I started with: Pate de Campagne and Confit de Canard.accompanied by a chenin blanc to enhance flavor.  For intermezzo, we had a Woodford Reserve Bourbon and a half dozen oysters for entree I had the Moules au Safran et  la Moutarde.  And, if that weren't enough, dessert was a French sampling of items served with fresh strawberries and accompanied by Irish Coffee. 

It, by far, exceeded my expectations and didn't make me think twice about how enormous the bill was.  I can only speculate that the Top Chef guys were given special ""off menu"" items by the Head Chef, but I don't really care, I was more than happy with what I had.",2,1,2

The wine we got was medium-pricey and was ok, but not memorable. 

I suppose what makes this place is the history behind it.  Awesome cooks, restaurants like French Laundry, your food being harvested and flown in the same day from all over the country, etc.  I had the veal special and the portion was ridiculous (should have shared between two!) which cost marginally more than the teeny halibut.  Quality is top-notch but there's little\/no flavoring added, just the pure taste of unadulterated meat.  The truffle fries were thin and cooked with a light crisp and also had very good, original pure flavoring .  Great food and probably suited to satisfy purists.

This place has a very similar feel to Bouchon in Yountville but a much larger layout and a little busier feeling due to the number of tables.  Our waiter was ""Jewish Paul"" as opposed to ""Spanish Paul"" the Sommelier.  Paul was a very cool cat with a lot of personality who made sure the dining experience was fun and entertaining.  We started out with a tower of chilled shellfish from the raw bar.  5 different types of oysters, a dozen clams, a half dozen mussels, a split lobster, and a split crab.  What a way to start.  Next was a pumpkin soup (it might have been butternut squash, hope I got it right) done very nicely and topped with a meringue.  Then a myriad of appetizers, the charcuterie platter, smoked salmon rillettes (my favorite), and haricorts-verts.  For my entree I had the sous-vide wagyu skirt steak with apple-parsnip puree.  A pretty good dish, I had hoped the skirt steak would have been butter-tender from the sous-vide but it had been seared aftewards which gave it a nice crust (not a bad thing but different from what I had expected).  The apple-parsnip puree was wonderfully smooth, sweet, and balanced the meat nicely.  For dessert Paul brought us everything on the menu and a little more.  7 desserts all together, I think.  A creme brulee, flan, the signature chocolate bouchons with ice cream, lemon tart, coffee pot-de-creme, chocolate pot-de-creme, and ice cream filled profiteroles.  We also had a champagne to start and 3 wines paired with our courses.

Price breakdown:  Bouchon can be tough to gauge depending on your appetite and food selection.  You can start with the seafood tower like we did for $100 or have foie gras and caviar which will run you the same or more just to start your meal.  Or you can opt for the less expensive dishes like the charcuterie platter or salmon rillettes which are closer to $15-20.  Entrees go from $20-40, desserts are roughly $9 each.  Closed for lunch on the weekdays, maybe open on weekends?  Breakfast is also served here every day, though I'm not sure how much that is.  Anyhow, a light meal might run $25 per person while an extravagant one like ours might be closer to $100-150 each.  On average I'd feel comfortable bringing $100 for two people which should cover an appetizer, two entrees, dessert, and wine.",1,0,0

Teetering into Bouchon in my come hither and scrape me off the floor heels we were actually early but they accommodated us with a smile. Nice front end employees. We entered into the large open dining area and it was almost like being transported to Paris. Elegant but not over the top.

Our table, number 50, was a two top and situated about a row away from their outdoor space where there was a large gathering going on. I immediately noticed the place setting which was wrapped with the menu. Very clever. Our very charming waiter greeted us with a big smile and a loaf of the most beautiful bread as well as some pistachios. We relied on his expertise to pair our courses with appropriate wines. 

As we walked in we could not help but notice the beautiful raw bar so we  started our evening with 1\/2 dozen oysters, all from British Columbia, Kusshi, Deep Bay and Fanny Bay. Not the best ever I have had but new varieties to me so worthwhile. Our oysters were paired with our late arriving wine, a glass each of BTG Metaireau. Considering there were three oysters it would have been nice to have had the wine to enjoy all three as we were left with no food with which to enjoy our wine and by then our second course had arrived. I had the Salade de Betteraves, a roasted beet & poached pear salad with marcona almonds, truffle vinaigrette and garden mâche while The L. received his Truite aux Amandes.

My salad was tasty but hardly flew off the charts. The beets we get at our CSA are much better than those that were on my plate. I liked the poached pear as it contrasted in texture to the beets but it really was not anything I could not make as well if not better at home.

The L.'s trout did not appear to be cooked properly as the skin was sticking to the flesh and taste-wise it was not well-seasoned. In fact, when we lived in NC we used to get trout all the time and my husband can cook up a trout which is better than the one he had there. It was disappointing as he was really hoping to have something OTT to inspire him when next with trout in our kitchen.

Somewhere along the line, though, our waiter went from being warmly friendly to coldly professional. I do not know if one of his supervisors made a comment to him but we had rather enjoyed his style and were disheartened to see the change in his comportment for no obvious reason. 

Next we experienced their cheese plate with a glass each of Charles Hours Uroulat Jarançon 2008. Having read a good chunk of Liz Thorpe's The Cheese Chronicles on the flight out I was most excited about this course. If there is one thing I love is cheese and the artistry and science which goes into them. Served with honeycomb, we sampled (yes, that small) a Vallée d'Aspe (a blue sheep's milk), Mt. Tam (from cow's milk), and a rather dry Onetik Bleu made from sheep's milk. Like the oysters the servings were pretty small and therefore tasted rather than savored. They were good and I will look for them at my local fromagerie in hopes of trying them again. I did not like the honeycomb though as it kept getting stuck in my teeth and that is not a good thing in a restaurant like Bouchon, LOL!

We passed on dessert as we figured we would make a pass by the Bouchon Bakery and see what treats awaited us there. 

Overall, it was a nice evening with good food. Not the greatest ever but I am beginning to realize that whatever Las Vegas is offering in terms of celebrity chef eateries, the originals are usually much better. I would happily try Bouchon in Yountville should we be out that way again (and we get in, lol) but when next in Vegas, I would forgo and try one of the local yokle places as we found those experiences to be more rewarding than parking butt in La La land. Las Vegas is really a bunch of smoke and mirrors and what one sees is largely subjective. I hate being jaded about food, especially when my expectation is so high, but nothing we had could not have been made at home and better. :(((

And too bad about our waiter having a change of attitude or his being scolded as if he had maintained his pleasant way I would have given another star. One plus is that it is located off the casino floor in a remote location so one does not have the immediate atmosphere of that nearby.

My hubby and I frequent Bouchon as one of our favorite strip restaurants for dinner. The foie terrine and hot epi bread always has us coming back for more. However on a recent brunch the service was less than stellar. 

Things were off to a good start as we were sat at ""our table"" which they also call the Anthony Bourdain table. A crescent shaped banquette made of crushed velour is super comfortable and always romantic. You can ask for it by name and they'll know which one you're talking about. 

We were sat promptly but once seated we were left hanging for a very long time before our server finally appeared. When she did stop by she seemed less than impressed by us

I ordered the Apple Croissant and the Gravlax for me brekie. Apple croissant, wholly hell man, this is fuck-yeah pastry. Imagine this super light flakey buttery heart stopping layers of sheer awesomeness topped with caramelized apples and strudel. Now imagine that this is no imagination, its real, its good and I ate this delicacy ever so slowly as to not miss a single flavor moment. Honestly this alone is worth 5 stars however its the combined experience that makes up these stars. 

Gravalax. First off I need to say that I don't eat salmon very often unless it's coming from a trusted source and yes Thomas Keller is definitely a trusted source. For me this his is like Swedish sushi, beautifully fatty cured raw salmon with accompaniments of capers, tomatoes, onions and chive cream cheese. No bagel here, you get a warm crispy baguette instead. Im not bitching about this as I love anything baked from Bouchon and was a really nice way to stack and eat this dish. I felt very euro. 

Back to the service.. our water glasses went empty, nobody checked on us after our food was delivered (my dining companion had an issue so we waved down a busboy so he could find our server), it was like we were abandoned. I don't like that the food was better than the service since to me both should have equal standing. 

While I would go back for dinner Im not sure if its worth going for breakfast\/brunch especially since all the pastries can be purchased at one of the Bouchon Bakeries inside the Venetian. I still think about the croissant.",3,1,2

You want real brasserie fare save your money and go anywhere else!  I am sure Per Se or the French Laundry are fine restaurants. But the restaurant business these days is almost comical. People actually think that because TK lends his name to the place that he even cares remotely about it's quality. 

March 6th was my birthday. My wife Lisa and I decided to take nine days off from all three wineries we work at and go camping. We loaded our VW bus will all the usual suspects, duck confit for two nights, slow cooked organic ribs, stinky cheeses, olives, enough wine to drown Bacchus, some Bolognaise sauce... you know the usual camping fare. We decided to stop into Vegas to catch Cirque de Soleil's ""LOVE"" show as both of us are Beatles fans. My wife said that we ought to dine somewhere for my birthday and I was feeling like comfort food so I chose Bouchon. We were excited. I could almost smell the steak and pommes frites. We had been craving a fruits de mer platter since leaving France in September and to our joy they had a few versions offered. 

The shucker was positioned by the door behind an offering of six different varieties of oysters, lobsters, shrimps, clams and mussels. When we were seated the waiter came over and asked if we were in town to do shots. Shots? No, we were in town to eat at what is called a good restaurant by one of America's supposed great Chefs Thomas Keller. I should have walked out at this point. The house music pumping in the dining room was completely unappropriate and annoying. I am not closed minded but maybe some French music may have been more appropriate to the setting. We were shocked by the mark ups when we saw the wine list. Almost no wine less than 120\/bottle and anything worth drinking was so severly young that it would be doubtful if it would be enjoyable. We spent a loooooong time trying to figure the wine out. Finally we ordered a carafe of wine to go with a fruits de mer platter and then we would decide later what we woud drink with our main course. The wine was unremarkable but decent enough to drink. The fruits de mer platter was completely lacking pathetic and an insult to my stomach! If you are pretending to be a French restaurant how about actually serving fruits de mer slightly like the French... Pristine seafood would have been a good start, real French rye bread would have been a good second and mayonnaise would have been far btter than cocktail sauce. I selected three varieties of which I only got two varieties I asked for. Of the nine oysters, three were unedible, three were completely devoid of any liquid that true oyster lovers demand and the other three looked like Jack the ripper had shucked them. The raw clams tasted old, the shrimp and lobster WAY overcooked and flavorless. The sommelier stopped by to see if we needed hep with the wine list. Instead I demanded that Jack the Ripper start fresh and get my some good oysters. Paul, the somelier, promptly brought me fresh ones that looked and tasted good. If any Frenchmen had put that fruits de mer platter out that wouldn't even allow him a cigarette before they guillotined him!

We should of walked out at this point. McDonald's would have been better. I ordered the Magret and my wife the line caught Sea Bass special that sounded good. The waiter asked again what I wanted. I replied the magret. I mean I was reading this right off of their menu. He did not know what it was. So I replied the duck. He started to walk away and I yelled 'don't you want to know what temperature?'. He returned looking much like my beloved dog Lucy when I scold her. I asked for it rare. Paul came back and we pressed him for a 120 bottle that could bridge two very different flavors. He came up with an excellent Beaujolais Cru that I forget the name. It actually worked really well for different reasons with both dishes. My magret was slightly overcooked, cut wrong and served in a giant copper pan without a warm plate to spoon food onto. Obviously the Chef has never travelled to France or eaten at a French restaurant in his life. Lisa's sea bass was so overcooked that if I could of stabbed it with an ice pick I could of used it to pound nails into cement. It literally was hard like I have never known was possible. The serrano broth was ok... but just ok. The seasonings were bland. It was completely obvious that the kitchen, Chef or even Thomas Keller has not even a remote bit of passion. If they do, do not give them a cigarette, just behead them all!

I did not want dessert or anything else after that debacle. The Sommelier, whom we thoroughly enjoyed, brought us complimentary dessert and some free after dinner drinks.  GO ANYWHERE ELSE!  THIS PLACE STINKS!",0,0,0

Knowing that Bouchon has a reputation for stellar pastries, I ordered the beignets du jour as a brunch appetizer. I figured I'd have a bite and that would be that. The beignets arrived, two lacrosse ball-sized puffs coated in granulated sugar and stuffed with fresh, flavorful, raspberry preserves. They were so insanely delicious that I ate both of them to crumbs. My husband is lucky he got a bite.

His pecan roll was also quite good, though it was no beignet du jour. Bloody Marys were well-made, albeit a bit expensive ($13 I believe). For the main courses, my husband had the American breakfast, which he enjoyed but which also seemed pretty standard to me (eggs cooked to your liking, sausage, bacon, toast, etc.). I had the famous chicken and waffles and it was another OMG-experience. The chicken was so perfectly cooked, very moist and tender. True to my savory roots, I primarily used the gravy for the dish rather than the syrup or the vanilla bean butter, but those of you with more of a sweet tooth would like those a lot.

I'd be remiss to not also mention the fabulous preserves served with the complimentary bread. Bouchon must make their jams themselves--otherwise I am really missing the boat by not buying this stuff myself.

We had a really hard time finding Bouchon. The Venetian and Palazzo are gigantic, sprawling properties, and the entrance to Bouchon is an understated doorway near the check-in desk. You then have to take an elevator to another floor to access the restaurant. Just be aware that you will have to look around a little bit to find the place. But do look for it--worth it!",4,2,2

Soo I plan on trying it again and getting something different next time!

Anyway, they bring complimentary bread out with butter and a cherry jelly. I heart bread and butter so that was already a pretty good start. I ordered the Bouchon French Toast and my husband got the Croque Madame (because all the other tables around us had fries and he wanted to see what all that was about!). My french toast was small, dainty, and very beautifullly plated. It was tasty and I enjoyed it, however it comes out soaked in the maple syrup and there weren't enough slivers of the apple. Overall, it was good, but just a tad too sweet for me. My husband's croque madame was very good!

The two components tasted like two separate dishes on one plate. The roasted chicken was delicious w\/ the gravy & the bacon-chive waffle was good w\/ the maple syrup, but put it all together & it was just a hot mess; it didn't belong together. I didn't know if I was eating breakfast or dinner. I did not dig TK's version of chicken & waffles. 
-- corned beef hash ($18): i like how they used cubes of corned beef instead of shredded corned beef; it matched the size & shape of the potatoes. A little greasy, but very flavorful & hearty. Topped with an egg (I chose soft scrambled.)
-- tartine au thon ($17, tuna): open-face sandwich, tuna was very lemony. I'm not a tuna fan, but my taste buds agreed with this dish. Fries were crispy & well salted.

I imagine the service would have been faster with a little prompting if desired.  Also, they were really good about keeping my coffee cup full (which I appreciate as a heavy coffee drinker).

Food - Had a selection of pastries (both for breakfast and on the road) and the oatmeal with strawberry compote.  The croissants were terrific (light, flaky, and buttery ... but not greasy or oily), the pecan sticky bun was good, and the blueberry muffin was also good.

- baguette w\/butter and apricot jam: made me question the sanity of people on atkins. how can you give up bread?! especially when it tastes soooo good?
- basket of pastries: came with pain au chocolat, apple danish, two jelly filled doughnuts (actually, probably beignets), some type of brioche: perfection. awesome way to get a taste of all the wonderful bouchon pastries. good if you have a few people in your group
- daily special: summer vegetable hash: lovely summer veggies (squash, potatoes, cherry tomatoes, etc) topped with scrambled eggs, and covered with hollandaise sauce. accompanied by brioche toast. delicious! the veggies on their own were a tad salty, but it was perfect when eaten with the eggs, hollandaise and brioche
- chicken and waffles: famous for a reason. juicy succulent chicken, flavorful chive waffles. crazy amazing gravy that i wanted to bathe in. vanilla bean butter. 
- daily quiche: lorraine: wonderful quiche! not too heavy on the egg, but a nice dense quiche that was flavorful. perfectly accompanied by a salad tossed in a vinaigrette. 
- creme caramel: if you like flan, youll love this
- tarte au citron: im a huge fan of lemon anything, but this was a little bit too tart for my taste. i couldnt help making a small grimace from the intense sourness after each bite. but, that didnt keep me from continually taking more and more bites
- chocolate mousse: really lovely dark chocolate mouse
- coffee mousse: maybe this wasnt coffee mousse (i cant find it on the menu now) but it was great! came out with sugar cookies, perfect for dipping
- creme brulee: perfection
- coffee
- bloody mary: perfect bloody mary - spicy

pros:
- food: uhm, i can probably wax on forever about the food. NOTHING i had was off or bland or boring. it was simple, but perfection. everything was done WELL. no rubbery eggs, nothing too salty, nothing burnt, just perfect
- service: wonderful. super attentive server that always checked up on us. never had to ask for more water
- decor: super comfortable without being ostentatious or too stuffy. it felt comfortable

cons:
- price: the food was not cheap... but, i didnt mind. the food was THAT good. it was worth every penny. save up and treat yourself! 
- no reservations for brunch, but when we got there at noon on sunday, there didnt seem that much of a wait

again, if you love GOOD food, i dont see how youd be disappointed by this place. ... im starting to feel thankful that theres one in LA so that i dont have to drive out to vegas",1,1,1

We were able to get seated within 10 minutes and our waiter came with menus right away.

I am in awe with my tastebuds still exuding absolute delight from my dinner at Bouchon last night. Located on the 10th floor of The Venetian, this French Bistro is a must stop for any lover of cuisine. With all the over the top spectacles and overwhelming options in Las Vegas, this casually elegant dining establishment just may be the highlight of my trip... so far.

From the doting French server (fabulous accent) to the casually strewn pistachios and knotted french bread on the table, this spot is a wonderful marriage of classy and comfort. Stark white linens never looked so good accompanied by interesting menus made from an unexpected brown paper bag inspired paper truly showcases that fine dining doesn't have to be haughty or contrived. 

Now, let me share my affection for the Gnocchi à la Parisienne ($26.50):
sautéed gnocchi with a fricassée of garden vegetables & brown sauce

DELICIOUS. 
Wow. 
Worth every cent and more. 
Although the dish is very rich in flavor, it isn't overpowering and has me yearning for some Gnocchi for breakfast. This entree will go down as one of my all time favorites!

My only gripe is that when the check arrived, it would have been much more convenient if the server could have split the bill amongst the 9 ladies in our group. At the absolute minimum, pairing us off in sets of two would have made things less invasive of our time and experience. 

I also appreciated that the bill clearly noted with a red stamp that gratuity was already included which many times can be overlooked!

The Escargot was one of the special items not listed on the menu, but Bouchon always does such a great job with their viennoiserie and the puff pastry were as flaky as their renowned croissants.  The puff pastry was a nice touch and was used in lieu of shells that are typically used everywhere else.  The garlic butter and parsley lined escargot were gently soaking into the bottom of the pastry from within their cast iron Staub wells;  who doesn't like butter...

The Rillettes aux Deux Saumons or Salmon Rillette spread is a composition of fresh and smoked chopped salmon combined with some clarified butter, crème fraîche, and chives among other things, and packed and served in a cute glass Fido jar.  Used as a spread, these were served with sliced toasted baguettes. Everyone just loved these...

The Dungeness Crab Salad special was a puck of nearly pure sweet Dungeness crabmeat with a binding of crème fraîche and minced chives, and topped with leaves of arugula, and  plated with dashes of jalapeño puree and radish dices.  The sweetness of the minced crabmeat melded well with the herbs and lemon to form something of a fresh meat crabcake without the breadcrumbs.  The appetizer was served with toast points and when the crab was spread like the rillette on the toast, it was heavenly...

The Poulet Rôti or rotisserie chicken is a very succulent, juicy half roasted chicken on a bed of sweet corn, fingerling potatoes, and lardons.  Keller's method of Bouchon roast chicken is a collection of simple but precise steps, but the devil is in the details well documented in the Bouchon cookbook.  The results are undeniably delicious...

The Elysian Fields Lamb Shank special sounds like it came out of the film Gladiator or something, but really the Elysian Fields Farm in PA is the source of Thomas Keller's lamb.  Boasting of hay and grain fed properly aged lamb which is renowned for its beef like sweetness without the typical gaminess found in most lambs, the braised lamb shank was practically falling off of the bone tender and sweet, extremely satisfying...

The Sous-vide style boneless Ribeye steak special was incredibly tender and moist, due most certainly to the method whereby the meat is encased in an air-tight vacuum pouch and immersed in a precision temperature controlled circulating water bath at its final temperature to ensure even degrees of doneness throughout the meat from the surface to the center.  Prior to encasing and immersing, the steak is seasoned and browned on both sides before using the sous-vide method to finish.  Served over a bed of fingerling potatoes and wilted spinach, this was the first time that I was able to taste anything cooked using this method.  Coincidentally the method was featured in the LA Times food section the week before and taken from Keller's book ""Under Pressure:  Cooking Sous Vide"" by Thomas Keller...

This is a MUST try brunch place in Vegas; I will take this quality food over 3+ hours of waiting for a buffet anyday. And this being my second Thomas Keller experience, and just as good as the first (Fleur de Lys, San Francisco), I am determined to try every Thomas Keller restaurant possible in my lifetime.

We had a 10-15 minute wait on a Saturday morning Christmas, but it was nice because we lounged around and looked at their menu beforehand. We did have a service problem. But I still gave them 5 stars for the way they remedied it. They brought out one of our orders before the other... WAY before. I think we waited a good 15 minutes for our present order to get cold before the other one came out. However, like all top-notch French restaurants, impeccable service rendered the mistake to practically nothing. The service:

- waiter apologized many times
- brought out assorted fruit plated in a cup by the chef
- offered us drinks from the bar on the house
- the restaurant manager herself brought out the dish and apologized
- the dish was put on the house, cutting our bill in half

Service, service, service. They are AHHHMAZING, polite, speedy, attentive, and friendly. Except for that period of time where our waiter was a bit MIA, everything else was flawless.

I was a bit skeptical about their chicken and waffle, because... chicken and waffles? Thomas Keller? Most popular item on the menu? ...uhh, come again?

I was very happily proven wrong when we ordered it anyways. Chicken is usually too dry and waffles are usually too sweet. This chicken... I don't think I've tasted chicken so flavorful WITHOUT the gravy or waffles so flawlessly textured and flavored... add some of their gravy to your chicken, and some butter and syrup to your waffles... I could die eating this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day for the next year.

I got the crab special... I forgot what it was called, but it was a weekend special of crab, macaroni, and cheese, baked and topped with scrambled eggs and black truffle hollandaise sauce (black truffle anything, HOLLA!). I ate every bite even when I was stuffed up to my esophagus because it was that good.

Get their orange juice, by the way. Super fresh and a perfect balance of flavor to your meal. Judging by the flavor of the orange juice, I'd assume their mimosas to be great as well.

Ambience was wonderful. This restaurant is located near the Venetian hotel check in. You take a separate elevator up to a different, more secluded lobby by the pool, and the decor inside the restaurant is classic and has windows that look out to scenery.

Great service, nice ambience, and AMAZING food... I will most definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas.

In terms of brunch, Bouchon is great.  The menu is diverse, inviting, and certainly not conducive to any easy decisions.  The pastries are across the board okay, but they don't always taste fresh.  The croissants and beignets are lovely though.  The french toast is a little underwhelming and too sweet, the waffles are good, the boudin blanc is a real winner, the quiche is dependably good, and the chicken and waffles are amazing.  None of these were bad (my expectations for the french toast were too high) but the chicken and waffles and the boudin blanc are things I ordered, took a bite, and wanted to order again.  That chicken was the most perfectly roasted chicken of my life.  My family maybe ate 4 plates of boudin blanc. It didn't end.

I've only ever been there for dinner once, I think.  Everything was good, but not so memorable (I can barely recall much besides the faaantastic bread and butter).  The butter is so good here. It's so good.  As for the entrees, I tried both the Steak Frites and the Poulet Roti.  Everyone raves about the Steak Frites so I thought, hey, I have to try this.  Wrong.  Granted I'd eaten Cut the night before, but it just felt so greasy with the giant pat of butter on top.  The chicken though...that was once again a winner. Thomas Keller does chicken right.

The nice part about wait was their waiting room with tables and chairs. After the wait, the friendly hostess greeted us and brought us to our table. Along the way to our table, it was nice seeing the oysters displayed in the windows of the oyster bar. I also enjoyed the sunlight coming in from the large windows from the side of the building. There were a lot of tables everywhere and each one was packed. Barely a minute passed and we were immediately greeted by our server to get our drink orders. Our nice server was so sweet getting information from the oyster bar about the tastes and sizes of different orders. It took us a while to decide, but our server was so sweet and she didn't make a fuss about having to come back so many times and getting us more information. One sad part was that I was having a hard time understanding her through her accent.

Right after we ordered we were given freshly baked bread shaped like wheat as well as strawberry jam and butter to compliment it. The bread was toasted and fluffy on the inside; the butter was sweet, salty, and fluffy; the jam was sweet and tangy. Right after our drinks came out: The strawberry field was sweet with a dry aftertaste and the berries floating inside were edible but tasted only like alcohol; the D'Agistan had a nice orange peel that added a nice scent when you bring the glass to your face. The drink had a nice sweet forefront then a bitter taste which was followed by a grand marnier after taste. The blood and sand drink tasted like a sweet Johnnie Black with a citrus aftertaste. I don't know if I really enjoyed this one but the other two were delicious (this could be because I'm not a fan of Johnnie Black though).The Kumamoto and Hama Hama oysters were fresh and delicious. They came with a ponzu type of sauce that was sweet and tangy with minced onion. Our fois gras order was misunderstood and our server gave us a full serving rather than half, which was odd, but it was still good. I'm not a fan of cold fois gras, but this one was really different. It was served in a jar with butter on top to preserve the fois gras underneath. I liked it better without the butter on top and my friend enjoyed it with the butter. They give you a side of salt and thin strips of crunchy bread for you to enjoy with the dish. The dish tasted and acted like a really buttery pate that melted not only in the jar but in your mouth as well. I thought this was well worth trying. The mushroom soup was really different. It tasted like pureed mushrooms that had a delicious mushroom and broth taste. The oil and crème fraiche with herbs that was served on top of the soup added a nice flavor to the soup. The white sausage with eggs and a croissant was delicious. The sausage had a nice grilled outside and the inside was so tender and juicy that it felt like it melted in my mouth. The sauce was really savory and delicious, but I wish I had more of it! The eggs were nice and fluffy and tasted good.

Overall, the food was delicious and well worth the wait. Our server was a major sweetheart, really attentive, and answered all of our questions thoroughly despite the fact that the place was so packed. No complaints! I can't wait to come here again to try more of their delicious food!",3,2,2

On a recent culinary tour of Las Vegas, we had dinner one night at this beautiful restaurant.  From start to finish, everything was great.  The staff was attentive and very helpful.  The house sommelier was able to get us a great bottle of wine to go with our meal and even suggested some great digestifs to consume with our desserts.  

We started off with the modest watercress and endive salad with Roquefort, toasted walnuts, in a walnut vinaigrette.  In addition, we ordered the 3 piece tasting plate of select cheeses to go along with our salads.  All were great.  I highly recommend ordering the cheese sampler.  For our entrees we ordered Truite Amandine, Saumon Poêlé, and the Gigot d'Agneau.  The stars of the evening were the trout, the lamb, and especially the peas with the lamb that my wife had.  These were legendary and to this day, my wife still talks about them.  You could literally taste that the peas were shelled just moments before the dish was plated.  So, so fresh.  

For dessert, we chose the special dessert of the evening which was the Thomas Keller chocolate cake.  Only one word can describe this cake.  RIDICULOUS!.  One of the richest and most decadent desserts I have ever had.  Paired with our coffees and ports, it was a great ending to a great meal.  

All the dishes were perfectly cooked and well executed with great presentations.  The only gripe I had was that the Roquefort salad that we had to start did not have enough Roquefort.  Only a minor gripe though.

We also ordered the dessert platter (ordered 6 of the 7 desserts) they had on the menu. My two favorites were the bonbon (ice cream cream puff-like) and the creme brulee!!!! My least favorite were the the flan (it was kind of bland in my opinion) and the custard cake (also very nothing atypical).

Again - service was SUPERB. I would definitely come back here on my next Vegas trip!",0,0,0

The restaurant is bright and airy and invokes a French bistro. The service is attentive.  The prices are reasonable for the quality of the food.

We went there for lunch and all of the dishes ordered were excellent.  However, the standout dish for me was the moules au safran where mussels were steamed with white wine, dijon mustard and salfron. The dish is served with french fries. The sauce was so delicious that I had to ask for bread to mop up the sauce. 

Bouchon is known for its pastries and desserts so make sure you save room for the desserts.

My wife and I got in late, and woke up the next day hungry. We wanted breakfast so I yelp for local places.  We have tried Hash House a Go Go, great place when not watching your calories.  I saw other places with comments $40 for breakfast ya da, ya da.  We were staying in the Venezia tower and had eaten at Bouchon's before. 

 I noticed that Bouchon served breakfast so I was game.  I was not disappointed.  French pastry's, European coffee, what could be better.

I ordered the omelet of the day, stuffed with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and cheese.  Perfect eggs, good sausage, with brioche toast.

My wife had the bread pudding French toast with warm Carmel vanilla sauce. ""Heaven on a plate"" according to my wife.  

The service was great, and for the strip, and an upscale restaurant the $38 dollar breakfast was another great moment.

I was already a huge fan of Thomas Keller after dining at The French Laundry awhile ago, and after hearing (and reading) great things about Bouchon, I decided to try it out for dinner with my bf on our trip to Vegas.

For starters, we ordered a 3 cheese sampler plate and seafood platter. The cheeses were great; we ordered 1 cow's milk, 1 goat's milk, and 1 sheep's milk cheese. The seafood platter came with shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters, and lobster tail -- great variety!

For entrees, we ordered the pork loin (me) and leg of lamb (him). The pork loin was delicious! Not dry at all and very tasty. Of course, by that time I was already getting pretty full, but finished my course nonetheless. I tried some of the lamb as well, which was nice and tender.

For dessert, we ordered the creme brulee. YUM! Can't go wrong there. Everything was washed down with an amazing bottle of Pinot Noir from Hirsch Vineyards (recommendation by our server).

Overall, this was a delicious meal with incredible service. The attention to detail was apparent in everything. Thomas Keller can do no wrong in my book! :)

(not going to dock for one rude comment by one server, one time when we were there beyond closing entertaining guests)  All most every time we can be seated almost immediately.  The hosted are nice and accommodating and water is brought promptly.

We keep coming back because the ambiance is so soothing even when the place is paced to noise is spread so it is never loud.  The servers are well versed in the menu and are always fast and efficient, if they don't have an answer they will find a answer.

They have a large wine collection to choose from and a nice scotch for the man.  I usually splurge because when we come here and have cosmos because we are not driving.  The cosmos are perfect not to strong and not a vodka cranberry!  They have a well stocked bar and many specialty drinks for those who prefer others.

We are not big on ordering dinners here because we like to get a selection of our favorites.  

We love to get a plate of oysters they usually have a west coast and east cost selection so if you have a preference you should be covered.  We like the west coast oyster but have a few favorites from the east as well.  If you don't know ask they will help you decide! 

We also get a Fromages (cheese plate) one mild soft for me and tow of the smellier the better for him.  The usually do good but he would prefer even stinkier! 

Foie Gras either a plate or a tub of the butter (a small tub is to much for two people) both options are really delicious. 

We usually get Truffle Pommes Frites (french fries) but the didn't have them last time so sad so we will have to find something new next time.

First of all, the menu? Nothing is accurate. They don't erase the specials as they're no longer available, so I got super excited about the slow roasted lamb shanks only to be shot down and forced to choose an alternative quickly. 

They also don't update changes to the regular menu. For instance, my friend Val ordered what was supposed to be a watercress and endive salad with Roquefort, apples, walnuts, and a walnut vinaigrette, and it came with pears.  Another example: they changed what was on my entree (and unlike the pear substitution, didn't even bother to tell me about it). I was supposed to have roasted leg of lamb with a ragout of coco beans, piquillo peppers, merguez sausage, and lamb jus. Instead, I had farva beans and carrots and some sort of white thing. Merguez is a red sausage flavored with sumac, paprika, cayenne or harissa, and a little bit of anise -- it's supposed to be spicy and bold in flavor, and is definitely not white. The limp, overly-anisey white thing aside, it was pretty good. The white thing was gross. (Incidentally, marguez is a fairly popular lamb sausage in France, and spicy; I ate quite a few of them when I lived in France, because they were cheap. Whatever that white thing was, it was *not* the merguez I ate there.)

The wine menu is pretty weird, and they ended up charging two others at my table for a bottle of wine as four glasses (instead of as a bottle). Boo.

The wait staff was ... interesting. My waiter was funny, but a pompous ass. He ordered our desserts - including ordering desserts for people who didn't ask for some, and then charged us for the desserts that weren't requested! We eventually got them taken off the bill, but really, who does that?  A few of us had the bouchons (dense chocolate cakes the shape of a cork, cocoa nibs, homemade vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup), and they were pretty good, though the pumpkin pot de creme looked better.

The star of the night, by far, was the creamy sweet corn soup, which was beautifully silky smooth aside from some minced pototatos, salty minced bacon (which made a wonderfully crunchy contrast), and chopped chives. I lust after this soup, and one day, I will figure out its secrets.

The bread and pistachio nuts they served beforehand were good, as were the sweets they included (on top of the desserts) - I got to grab the nougat, which was deeeeeeelicious.

Conclusion: Glad I went, because the soup was awesome, and the rest of the food was pretty good. Would I go again? Probably not. For the prices Bouchon charges, the menu should always be accurate and the wait staff knowledgeable about what changes have been made (such as the merguez substitution).",0,0,0

We were seated promptly and it was relatively quiet in the restaurant.  We were going to try sweetbreads and the marrow appetizers-unfortunately the sweetbreads weren't on the actual menu (only saw them online).  

Numerous servers bustled around us, waters constantly topped off, but I can't say our head waiter was very attentive or helpful.  Plus, his accent with the general murmur of the restaurant made him pretty difficult to understand at times.  Very friendly though, and I'm sure had I asked more questions he would have been glad to answer them.  He did forget to mention the fact they were out of the lamb, however.  A mildly annoying fact that I'm sort of happy about after seeing other reviews on here.  o.O 

So started with the bone marrow, a first for us all.  Was delicious.  The braising and the sauce was delicious.  My friend couldn't stand restaurants with so much waitstaff-but she lit up when she tried the first bite of it.  The soup of the day was a sweet potato with a strawberry?? stripe drizzled across.  The bright fruit flavor really made it.  

Entrées were the steak and fries, braised short-ribs, and I decided on the chicken.  The steak was amazing (especially for being flatiron-not one I would traditionally consider as tender-man was I wrong)-french fries hardly lost any quality as they cooled off.  Wonderfully seasoned and crispy.  Short-ribs were meaty and delicious, with a similar flavor sauce to the bone marrow earlier in the meal.  Finally, the chicken-it's changed from the menu listed online (or at least it was).  It wasn't served with the brussel sprouts but with a dijon mustard sauce and sauteed mushrooms.  It was far and away the best chicken I've ever had in my life, the skin was crispy and delicious, the sauce was fantastic, and every bite was a pleasure.  The only minor criticisms I could give about it is it could really do with something fresh on the plate, and the white meat, at the thickest parts toward the wing, was a little overcooked.  The dark and most of the white was a joy though.  

Overall-I enjoyed the experience.  Service was great if a little slow at times, not overly obtrusive, and the food was amazing- the steak and the chicken would have me back no problem.  And the marrow-while a small portion- was fantastic.",0,0,0

I ordered the Croque Madame, toasted ham and cheese on brioche topped with a fried egg and mornay sauce.  The sandwich was just as you'd imagine, but the egg and mornay sauce add so much to it.  The mornay sauce was rich and velvety smooth.  The egg enhanced the sandwich the same way adding a fried egg to a cheese burger does.
It also came with pommes frites, or in english, ""french fries"", and a whole mound of them!  So much that a table of 4 could not finish them.   They were really good, maybe in the top 5 fries ever.  After all who makes French fries better than the French?  Well maybe McDonnalds... Wait, did i just compare Bouchon to McDonnalds?  Anyway they were light, crispy, and delicious.

We also ordered french beignets.  I was expecting something like the beignets in New Orleans where they are light and covered with powdered sugar.  These were a bit heavier and both resembled and tasted like cake doughnuts.  Although they were warm and probably the best cake doughnut I've ever had, it was not what i was expecting and was a bit of a let down.  I would have been fine with it, but when it was brought to the table they said, ""your doughnuts.""  Let's get one thing straight here, I'd gladly pay $8 for 3 french beignets, but NOT for 3 doughnuts!  

Pros:  Great bakery items especially the Croissant, Tons of delicious french fries, delicious meals with great sauces. 

Cons: Beignets are okay but not the type you find in New Orleans, definitely not worth $8 for 3 the size of ""Hostess Donettes"".   

Advice:  There is a embosser next to the entrance with some pieces of thick card stock.  you can emboss the bouchon name in it for a keep sake.  not sure if you're supposed to do it or what it's for but i did, and now use it as my bookmark.",2,2,2

Moules au Safran et  la Moutarde (Maine bouchot mussels steamed in white wine, mustard & saffron - $26.50) - 5 stars. Excellent. Mussels were so fresh and broth was so tasty. 

Steak Frites (a pan-seared prime flatiron served with matre d'htel butter - $34.50) - 4 stars. Was pretty good, esp due to the think layer of carmelized onions and other spices on top but the steak itself wasn't that flavorful and I asked for medium and got medium-well.  

Gigot d'Agneau  - (roasted leg of lamb with spring veggies, fennel dauphine - $31.00) - 4.5 stars. Lamb was super tender with only a slight gamey taste with good jus and very tasty fennel. I'm not a major lamb fan so I could have been 5 stars.

Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard (foie gras with toasted baguette $48.00) - 4.5 stars. My first time trying foie gras (pls forgive me you animal rights ppl). Came in a small 5 oz. canister under a layer of goose fat. The waiter carved off the goose fat to expose a rich delicious and generous portion of foie gras. (Of course, you are paying ~$50, so it better be generous.) It was rich and tasty and tasted even better with their special salt on top of small toasted bread pieces. Warning: this is a portion for at least 4-5 ppl to finish so it's too much for 2-3 ppl to order unless you want to take it home. 

Homemade brownies with ice cream - 4.5 stars - three luscious mini brownie bites with a bit of moist chocolate inside with ice cream. 

Overall service was very helpful and attentive but they did screw up a couple of things so it wasn't perfect. I asked for spinach on the side instead of fries for the steak and first they gave me green beans instead. Then they did apologize and bring out the spinach side - it was very fresh spinach in some butter but the SALTIEST thing I've ever had. We returned it and the waiter acknowledged that it was overly salty for whatever reason and apologized for that. We got a free dessert in return.

We started out with mussels, frites, and escargot.  You can't go wrong with mussels and frites... but I have to admit that I like new Zealand mussels over the new England ones.  Sacrilege,  I know.  The escargot was amazing.  Each one had a mini puff pastry on top.  Between the escargot and the puff pastry, it was like double the butter and garlic soaking ability.  Pure genius.  It didn't stop us from slipping up the remaining butter and garlic with the fresh baguette.

For my main course, I had the leg of lamb by recommendation of our server.  Probably one of the best lamb dishes I've had.  The fava beans and turnips went well.  Nice rich lamb taste, not over powering.  I think the only better lamb I've had came off of a spit in Piraeus.

Then, for dessert, we started with the Teahive cheese, again by recommendation.  It was a tea infused cheddar, served with a honeycomb, slices of apple, and some raisin bread.  The four flavors went so nicely together, and it was the perfect transition to our main dessert... brownies with peanut butter ice cream.  I have to say that it was the PB best ice cream ever.  Like a cold, creamy serving of hand made peanut butter.

We had a party of 7 which they sat after quite a wait, even at 1pm on a Saturday. Our server was proper... but not quite friendly or efficient. He brought out the french bread and jam\/butter but no bread plates were to be found for at least 10 minutes later. I guess that's what they have crumb scrapers for..? so they can save a bit of dish washing? I did enjoy the jam though, tasted like apricot to me.. very pleasant.

I opted for the Croque Madame since a friend told me it was one of their ""specialties"" and everything else on the menu seemed normal. Other orders at the table: Corned Beef Hash, Tuna Salad Sandwich, Summer Butternut Squash Soup, and their ""famous"" French Toast. Our waiter said, and I quote, ""People from all around the world fly in just for our French Toast because it's that amazing."" What a way to hype something up!

30 minutes later (literally) our food comes out. My Croque Madame was tasty (toast, ham, cheese, fried egg, creamy sauce served with fries) but WAY too heavy. I tasted a lot of butter with the toast, along with the saltiness from the ham and greasiness of fried egg all drenched in a cream sauce? with FRIES? It's quite delicious at first but after a few bites in it gets on the heavy side. Not to mention I think my waist grew an inch after brunch.
From what I heard: All the other meals were just okay. Nothing special and overpriced. Would my friend fly from half way around the world to order to French Toast? His answer: no. Everyone's conclusive responses of ""meh"" summed it up.

Our waiter was pretty much non-existent, letting his helpers do all the work in refilling drinks and bussing plates. So I guess waiters here only take the order and drop off the check? Plus he was guaranteed a 20% gratuity so what did he care? My plate plus an OJ cost $30 alone. Ouch!

Second French establishment in Vegas that was a semi-fail.. first being Mon Ami Gabi. The theme: mediocre food at a hefty price tag.

To start, the complimentary crusty bread is tasty and chewy and the accompanying warmed pistachios were a hit. The bone marrow appetizer was quite rich and had nice acidity with the vinegar sauce. For entrees, the roasted chicken with baby kale and fresh corn was perfectly cooked and had a beautifully crispy skin. The steak frites was good but not great.

My dad is a huge fan of celebrity chefs, being the devotee of Food Network that he is.  Bouchon should impress him, given the whole ""French Laundry is the best restaurant in the United States"" thing with Thomas Keller.  And while Bouchon isn't French Laundry, I think that the meal was good enough to impress.

We were seated promptly, though we were late for our reservation by about ten minutes.  We blame this on the fact that Bouchon is a hard restaurant to find.  A security guard had to guide us through the Venetian Canal shops, down an escalator, to the right elevators.  Bouchon is located way up on the 20th floor (I think), which seemed like an odd place to have a restaurant.  However, it ended up being a perfect location, since we didn't have a huge crowd , flashing slot machine lights, or the sounds of bells\/whistles right outside the door.

The space at Bouchon is nice, with high ceilings and large windows that allow for plenty of natural light.  The tables are covered in butcher paper and the menu is actually the paper around the napkin.  The fresh baguette was warm and delicious, especially with the butter, which was really flavorful.  

I was disappointed that they no longer had the frisee salad with poached egg and bacon on the menu and the waiter explained that they change their menu about four times a year.  Rats!  They had just had the change and I wasn't really feeling the other salads on the menu.  Instead, we opted to share the salmon rillettes with extra croutons, which was amazing.  I could have just brought a jar of that and their fresh baguettes back with me to Wynn and had an awesome midnight snack lounging in the tub and watching TV.  The rillettes are also served with a bowl of their marinated olives, which were good (the green olives in particular).

For the entrees, we ended up getting the trout, the steak frites, the salmon, and the veal breast.  ALL of these entrees were delicious.  The trout, which was what I ordered, was perfectly cooked in a brown butter sauce, with a mound of the most delicious haricot verts and slivered almonds.  The salmon was also done just right and came beautifully presented in a copper pan.  The veal was good, though a little bit stringy and tough.  The steak was also delicious, though the VAST pile of frites was a bit overwhelming.  Though the fries were seasoned just right and crisp when they first come out, atfer cooling, they did turn a bit limp.  Even being ardent fries fans, we could not finish them.  The entree portions are huge, so much to the point that we did not have room for dessert.  That was disappointing, since the profiteroles being enjoyed the next table over seemed divine.    

Overall, a great place for delicious bistro food in a relaxed setting.  Service was a little cold, as our waiter seemed a little standoff-ish, but they were attentive.  My only complaint was that their water was lukewarm.  I'd be back to try more things off their dinner menu, as well as to have brunch here.",3,0,3

My husband ordered the salmon pate for a starter, and, though it was a fun presentation and a tasty combination of two kinds of salmon and creme fraiche, a little went a long way.

Probably my biggest complaint about our meal overall was proportion. Way too much of a good thing is a bad thing. 

We felt like we ought to finish the big pot of salmon pate, but then along comes my enormous bowl of steamed mussels so full that no human could have finished it. There were probably 60 in the bowl. After the 25th, I just started to feel sick. And the gorgeous french fries that came with it went completely untouched, because if there's one thing the mussels had to much of (besides mussels,) it was salt. 
Wanting a green veg, I ordered a side of spinach which was great for the first couple of bites, but it was swimming in butter
.
I will say the bread was wonderful, and the wine was terrific. I had Pinot Gris and my husband had the Syrah with his Beoff Bourgonoine, which he devoured.

The service was great! My girlfriend and I were seated within 10 minutes on a busy morning and they have a nice lounge waiting area. Our server and her assistant were very attentive and nice and had no problem answering any questions we had about the food. 

I can't remember the names of the food we got Mainly because it was in French I think but everything was delicious! My gf got sourdough waffles with banana and walnuts I believe and I got the candied pineapple brioche bread pudding type of toast. Both were unbelievably delicious. Not too sweet and not overwhelming with the different flavors in the dishes. We also got the pastry platter where you pick 4 pastries for $13, which is a great deal and allows you to try many of the different pastries they offer. The pecan sticky bun, raspberry beignets, banana bread, and strawberry croissant were the best dessert pastries I've ever had in my life. The banana bread was the best of the four but it was a 3 way tie for second for the rest. 

Surprisingly for all the food we got everything was only about $40 and the portions were more than I thought they would be for a high end brunch restaurant in the Venetian.

While the food was great, I am very disappointed at your service.  Please see the below reasons.

1) My boyfriend and I sat down at your section for at least 15 minutes until the busboy noticed that we were waiting and track you down. 

2) When I ordered Croque Madame,  you did not asked me if I wanted fries or chips despite stated on the menu. While I understand that chips can also mean French fries in other places, it doesn't make sense on your menu since it asked chips or fries.   when I initiated to let you know I wanted fries, you brushed it off and just said ""ya"" and quickly walked away. 

3) after we were finished with our food, you did not come check to see if we were finished despite there are no other customers at your section. We were the only table left. The busboy saw and asked if we wanted the check and we told him yes. He tracked you down again to let you know. However, even when you acknowledged it, you still continue to stuff sugar packets in the container. We waited for a while and the busboy checked to see if we got the check, and we told him no. He again tracked you down and then you gave us the check. 

Look, I really hope that our ethnicity and age, being Asian and young, were not factors in your decision in providing the type of service quality, or the lack there of. However, the fact that you seem more concern about the sugar packets than your paying customers is alarming.  And while I am usually a generous tipper since I had worked in the service industry before, I simply could not tip the service industry's recommended amount because I do not want to reinforce your poor service. And honestly, the busboy deserved the tips and not you. 

I genuinely hope you would not repeat this to other customers.

Thank you for your attention,

He said they were the best scallops he ever had. A few of our friends also ordered steak and were very happy with it. They all came with a lot of fries so there was enough to go around a table of 7.

Grandeur elegance laced with sophistication to construe this Français affair, Bouchon made my Sunday brunch at the Venetian the most perfect way to end our final days of my princess getaway along with my date's birthday weekend.

To guide our way to Bouchon felt almost like a secret; located on the 10th floor, special elevators are taken that swayed us to our restaurant destination. Unfortunately, Bouchon brunch does not offer reservations so arriving early before the peak brunch time seemed to be the best fit for this unremarkable Sunday event.

Baroque impressions and a twinge of rococo affair, the high white ceilings and full top to floor windows resembled a romantic French flat in the heart of Paris. Upon seating, Bouchon's signature Epi bread wrapped in parchment paper was placed on our table accompanied by butter & sweet seedless berry jam. Although a little hard to consume, this beautiful touch of an artisan twist had me romanticize cities like Bordeaux, Marseille, Nice, & Paris. 

We started our Sunday brunch with a toast of champagne. I had the peach bellini with a raspberry garnish and my date had the strawberry fields with little red currants. Bubbly and sweet, both of these were superb choices.

I already had my mind set on Bouchon's famous Croque Madame accompanied by sauce mornay. Overly advertised? I think not. This Croque Madame may be one of the finest Croque Madame's I've ever tasted, outside of France. The brioche was toasted lightly, layered with thinly sliced boiled ham and swiss cheese, a fried sunny egg on top, and carefully layered with sauce mornay. I loved that my dish was accompanied with a generous layer of french fries, my oh so guilty favourite.

My date ordered french toast (dessert style) with a side of bacon, his favourite. However, I personally thought his french toast was underwhelming; it was similar to a bread pudding dessert & not so filling. I had a taste, but the style was pudding rather than toast, although he mentioned he enjoyed it quite a bit.

Bouchon also has their very own little bakery on the lobby + second floor; oh did I feel like I was in heaven! I was so excited to wake up the next morning to indulge on flakey croissants and Earl Grey tea for breakfast! I could not help but purchase 4 orders of apple croissants, 2 almond croissants, a kouign-amann for the road. Out of these orders our favourites were the apple croissants; a delicious almond filled croissant with soft baked apple layer on top. 

My experience and taste at Bouchon makes them one of my favourite restaurants today. Exquisitely classy, Bouchon fits my personality exceptionally well and I can't wait to try the location in Beverly Hills x",12,8,10

Food: we had a party of 9, DINNER

We started off with the foi gras appetizer: this was more of a paste, they make it all in house and they scrape off the top layer in the container which consists of solid duck fat served with toasted baguette.  I have never had foi gras like this, and i was mighty surprised by the creaminess and the flavor of the dish.  Be sure to ask for extra bread because this is a very rich dish and can get a bit overwhelming.  Even those in our party that dont like liver enjoyed the dish.  

Entrees: some ordered the braised beef (myself included), some ordered the duck, some got the steak and frites, and one person got the ham steak.  I myself have tried the beef,  lamb, and steak frites all of which are outstanding.  The lamb is served on a  roasted leg of lamb with flageolet beans in a thyme jus, the meat was cooked perfectly.  The braised beef was also cooked perfectly, it is served with some noodle, cooked pork bits and other goodies.  The steak frites is served with a fine amount of thinly chopped onions and some cream and of course shoe string fries.

For sides: we ordered the mac and cheese (which was the only disappointment of the evening), spinach, and the potato puree.  Ive had better mac and cheese at multiple places, at best the dish is average.  The spinach was cooked perfectly, the spinach side at carne vino was better.  The potato puree was extremely smooth, probably the best out of the 3.  

Dessert: we ordered the chocolate bouchon, and the creme brulee.  The chocolate bouchon is 3 little brownies (same one served at bouchon bakery on the 1st floor) served with 3 different types of ice cream (coconout, vanilla, coffee) on top with chocolate on top.  This dish was decent, the brownies werent served warmed which was a big mistake.  The creme brulee was one of the best Ive had.  However it did not have any berries or fruits on top, instead it was just custard and crust. Nevertheless, the consistency was perfect.

Price: for info on prices go to the zagat menu website http:\/\/www.zagat.com\/Verticals\/Menu.aspx?VID=8&R=93909&HID=37
entrees were around 30-40.  In my opinion not very much for the quality of food.

Overall: everyone in my party of 9 was raving about this place by the end saying it was the best meal they had all trip.  And i share the same sentiment with them. The best part was, it wasn't the most expensive meal we had either.  Mario batali's Carnevino's was more expensive",0,0,1

Salad - it is compact solid volume, not like the rest ever--loose, tossed; and EVERY LEAVES are tender, juicy and flavoury.  I never expect a salad can be provided with such quality. Never before.
Burger - It looks funny to me : burger with fried union ring.  When I try my first bite, the crunch fried ring induces one of the best combination when chewing and tasting this juicy burger.  It is fried to the perfect degree for you to chew on it, meanwhile, not oily at all and harmony with beef patty and tomato.  SO TASTY, and makes my mouth watering by just thinking about its flavor!
Pastry - no doubt about it: fresh and taste GREAT (not too sweet as most American pastry). ( I feel it's better than those in Bouchon retail bakery)

We ordered Salade de Betteraves et Poireaux(beet & spring leek) and Salade Maraîchère au Chèvre Chaud (mixed greens with goat cheese).  My wife really liked her Salade Maraîchère au Chèvre Chaud.  My beet salad came with toasted hazelnuts which tasted kind of rancid \/stale.  The bread at Bouchon is absolutely fantastic as well!

For main entree, we ordered Steak Frites ($36.50) and Magret de Canard ($34.50).  Unfortunately, the streak frites tasted kind of funny and bitter (buttery and oniony).  My duck breast also arrived cold with soggy skin.  Very disappointed that they couldn't deliver a decent entree.

At such high prices, I expect extra attention to details and tastes.  Unfortunately, Bouchon did not deliver on that promise.  I will not return to this restaurant.  Note:  our waiter was absolutely the best and very helpful.

If the weather is warm, I recommend seating outside at one of the tables of 4 in the evening.",0,0,0

(I would love to make Robuchon my favorite but that's just impractical on the wallet. =))

Bouchon has that perfect ambience to me... a leisurely bistro feel yet without the dingyness. High ceilings, graceful deco with lovely peaceful garden view. Not to mention the whole Venezia hotel is a piece of ultimate luxury.

I am a huge Thomas Keller fan. He rarely shows his face on TV and he doesn't open 40 garbage restaurants like so many other American prima donas these days. I am talking to you Wolfgang, Boulud, Flay, Lagasse...

Bouchon is a restaurant that does what it does the best - cooking good normal food. It doesn't try anything fancy... you won't find molecular food ""deconstruction"" here, you won't find strawberry turned into a slimey foam by some genius scientific machine here, and you won't find some tiny $500 truffle that only grow at XX and flown to Vegas within YY hours here...

Ok, going back to the food.... 

Lamb shank: oh so good and giant piece of lamb shank. Stewed hours to make it perfectly moist and tender. Oh so good 10\/10!!

French Onion Soup: to be frank this one is a wash... the soup is a little salty and I'd love more caramelization on the onions, but the cheese is solid and it still tastes good, just not heavenly. 7\/10.

Sturgeon with grilled bacon and snails: this is the largest piece of sturgeon I had for a while, grilled to perfection, sauce is tasty too. Best fish dish I had for this Vegas trip. 9\/10.

Mussels in white wine butter sauce: it's almost surprising that they can make something so normal taste much better than everyone else. Go order it. 10\/10.

Since I wrote a review, I have to specially mention the chicken waffle at their brunch menu... everyone should try it as it's that good, cheap too at $25. 10\/10.",1,1,1

Overall
Bouchon Las Vegas - food: average, service: worst
Bouchon Napa Valley - food: exceptional, service: high quality

I remember delicious steaks and custom made wines while visiting Bouchon Napa Valley before. However, totally ""unforgettable"" experience this time at Las Vegas. 

I felt racially discriminated from the server (who was short African american lady)
for the following reasons. I hope I am wrong, but it is definitely true that Bouchon has at least one very poor quality sever. I think we are Asian and so she just thought we are very obedient people who never complain about anything. Actually, my friends were too shy to raise any complaint. 

1. She continued to see us with frowned and dis-satisfied facial expression from the beginning. 
2. Her answers and responses are very short and without explanations. 
3. Our requests are forgotten and ignored many times. 
4. She seems to be doing differently with next table where there were only white people. 
5. She treated me like elementary teachers scolding kids. 

These are things which made me think so. 
1. I asked that I want to talk to store manager twice. He didn't come to me even after 30mins. But after I told her I want to see the manager, her service quality improved considerably. She was being nice and polite. I eventually talked him by asking him in the entrance. He told me that he didn't hear I want to see him. So someone ignored my request. The manager apologized me in professional manner, so I was relieved little bit. He offered me to visit later for complimentary dinner, but I gently refused. Told him ""Would you like to come again if you were me?"" I didn't feel like paying tips, so I told him that I will not. Well, this is something I didn't do it properly. Other 2 families did pay their tips though.

2. My menu came out, which was different from what I ordered. When I ordered, I showed her the picture from Yelp together. So told another server this is not what I ordered. She commanded angrily ignoring my words that this was what I ordered and asked the server to just bring to me without any explanation. (I felt like she was saying ""Shut up and eat whatever there is because this is what you ordered!) I told her and show her picture, but she mentioned she didn't see it when I ordered and the menu has changed. Yes, the menu has changed recently. But if I knew this in advance, I would have ordered different food. I didn't like the dish for that reason. 

3. The server first came to our table, and just left 1 bread on the table for 11 people without any explanation. We didn't have any dish at all. Eventually had to grad bread dishes ourselves. Felt really bad. 

4. My wife told that she want time to order, so other people in our group can order first. After everyone ordered she just left without taking my wife's order.

5. Asked for another cup, and waited for some time. Our kid wanted one, so grabbed one from server's place. They were very unhappy and told me not to do so in unpleasant tone. This was definitely my fault, so I do apologize. But I waited long enough and they shouldn't be harsh as this for this thing. 

6. Our friends' family ordered one salad, but it was forgotten.

7. I asked plastic utensils for kids, but she firmly said it is the same size ""twice"". I mentioned I still want it, but she forgot or it was ignored. We never got one.

There might be some other things, but I am glad that I can't remember anything more. Not to mention that this experience ruined this gathering with our families. 

It is really bad feeling to be treated like this. It kept getting back to mind while I was riding a airplane back to home and when I was in the bed trying to get to sleep. 

I hope these things don't happen again in Bouchon and it goes away from my mind now.",0,0,0

Went to Vegas for a weekend and knew I had to hit at least ONE famous-chef run place.  Since we were staying at the Venetian and the prices weren't too obscene, Bouchon was our choice.

We had dinner on a Wednesday.  Pretty quiet, presumably due to the mid week timing, and the economy.  Our waiter was French and charming.  I had the steak frites (had to try this famous classic) and my tablemate had the lamb.  For appetizers, we had french onion soup and a mixed green salad.  Desert was lemon tart and the special of the night, little brownie ""bouchands"" topped with a small scoop of homemade icecream.  To summarize the dinner: delicious.  I thought the steak was a bit bland for my liking but everything else was so perfect, I didn't care.

We returned a couple of days later for brunch and had an equally blissful experience.  Quiche for one of us and the omelette of the day for the other.  Just delicious and filling without being heavy.  The bellinis were a nice refresher to complete the meal.

Overall, a complete pleasure.  Wish it was closer to home (too bad the Bouchon in Northern Calif apparently is suffering many more negative reviews than the Vegas one, unfortunately.)  This is worth anyone's time and money, foodie or not.",1,0,0

We walked in earliesh on a Sunday morning and the outside patio was already full (45 minute wait) so we decided to sit in one of the spacious booths facing the majestic French windows. To start we orders the beignets -- raspberry and cinnamon sugar. They came with Nutella dipping sauces.

I thought they would be smaller but they were actually the size of those Entenmann doughnuts you buy at the super market. The cinnamon sugar ones were good but a bit too thick and could have been sweeter, but the raspberry ones were super delicious. 

Wasn't a fan of the coffee -- tasted burnt. ‍

For my main meal, I ordered the poached eggs with salmon on an English muffin. It came with a small side salad and was SO delicious and super filling. The only downside was that the salmon was pretty salty.

Bouchon is a FANTASTIC place for breakfast, so my early morning alarm, stumble out of the Wynn, and confused wandering was all worth it.

First, this place is cozy. It's small, has lots of booths and tables, and overlooks a nice courtyard. Even better, upon walking in, you see giant baskets full of fluffy pastries and croissants. How tantalizing!

Next, the staff was very friendly with me (maybe because I was eating by myself??), and the food came out quickly.

Now, about the food. SO DELICIOUS. I ordered enough for three people. No kidding...

Strawberry croissant - think of a croissant sliced in half with top removed, inside filled with slices of strawberry and cream, covered in crumble, then baked. And then, as they bring out the little containers of butter and marmalade, proceed to spread said pastry with those condiments. So gooey, warm, sweet, tantalizing!

Chocolate Spiced Beignets - comes three a plate, covered in sugar, and served hot. Comes with nutella and homemade cherry jam to spread. So good. Makes a regular donut seem shameful.

Croque Madame - brioche bread with ham, cheese, and a fried egg on top and mornay sauce. I requested mine to not have ham, since I'm not a fan of ham. Comes with a large side of thin frites. Oh  man. I downed this dish in minutes, it was so buttery and I loved the way the fried egg yolk spread over and into the brioche bread, which itself was drowning in cheese and butter. OMG.

The ambiance and the out of the way to get to the restaurant (even though it is in The Venetian) makes the atmosphere and the food that much more appetizing.  Definitely recommend getting a reservation as this place fills up quickly and people tend to stay.

Food - after experiencing what we ate, I have to say that probabaly almost anything you order is going to peek your taste buds and leaving you wanting more - again, why people probably linger for the atmosphere, food and drink.    They give you pistachios and some of the best bread and butter spread I have ever experienced for fine dinning - all while being able to make a mess on your table. For an appetizer we had the pork cheek - succelent little bites of meat that complimented our drink selections.  The main course consisted of the scallops - simply amaxzing!  And the special of the day - pork loin over a bed of dirty rice.  Both dished were outstanding and were a testament to the chef's knowledge of food pairings.  We ordered a half carafe of wine on the someliers (sp?) recomendation (although it was the most expensive, it was the best choice for the meals ordered and the wine likings of each person).

We knew this was going to be an expensive meal, but we couldn't leave without having a dessert to walk off afterwards - our server keyed us into what he called ""little pillows"" of chocolate ding-dongs or ho-ho's of goodness with coffee ice cream - holy ****.  Enough said.

In my opinion - if you want a great dining experience with great service and an uncomplicated\/complicated menu, this is the place for you.

The steak frites, while basic as a dish, is exactly how it should be served (with the fries taking the title as top notch). The rotisserie chicken is juicy and flavorful - the mark of true experts. The cold seafood platters (oysters, mussels, etc) is sourced from Keller's high end French Laundry purveyors - screaming fresh. 

There are a lot of celebrity chef restaurants in Vegas that trade on their famous name. This one trades on the quality of the food. A must-visit.",3,1,1

We had a cheese plate with 3 different types recommended by our expert server Erin. We had a bottle of Burgundy rose dry wine which we truly enjoyed with cheeses, then we shared the famous and polemic chicken and waffles.they were served with vanilla bean syrup and the best mushroom gravy I've ever tasted.
After that, we had 6 oysters from different regions in the pacific. Terrific.
While most people had a coffee or dessert, we decided to check out their bakery, located right next to the strip, we had iced coffee, macaroons covered in chocolate and they were all exceptional.
A great place to relax and eat well.",0,0,0

The space is bright and airy; I always try to stop by for brunch when in town. Someone always orders the Chicken & Waffles. This is not your average waffle; theirs is made with chives mixed in which gives it a kick. I usually order the Croque Madame here, really can't go wrong with that.

I loved the experience at the Las Vegas Bouchon just as much! We sat out on the terrace which was warm and beautiful with the calming noise of the fountain and pool behind us.  The menu was filled with an endless amount of food goodness. We started off with oysters on the half shell and the warm frisee salad with bacon and poached egg. I've attempted making this at home but will never be able to master Thomas Keller's savory bacon vinaigrette.  Although the steak frites would have been a sure winner, I decided to try something new I'd never had before - veal breast.  The veal breat was slow roasted and pulled from the bone, then formed into a flat piece and breaded on top and browned in the oven. What came out on my plate was a whole lotta goodness! The meat was tender, juicy and succulent paired with the wild mushroom ragu. Instead of polenta, I requested the frites. How could you dine at Bouchon and not have the frites. Although these ones were loaded with slightly too much salt, they were still one of the best fries I've ever had. Thin and crispy and absolutely addicting!  Also a delicious entree was the lamb loin - very tender. And the steak frites that are a classic of this restaurant featured a flavorful and thick piece of flatiron. 

It was so much food so no room for dessert. Although they have the Bouchon Bakery downstairs so you can always save room for that later.",1,0,2

We came here on a weekday morning just after 9am and were seated promptly with a smile, a few rows away from the small pool outside (the hostess joked that it was the Venetian's ""kiddie pool"").  The restaurant is smaller than I thought it would be, with very high ceilings and an airy, sunlit atmosphere.  

I had the Breakfast Jardiniere with eggs over medium, choosing a chocolate croissant.  It was obvious that the chefs really pay attention to the details.  The croissant came first with a cup of fruit.  Flaky and amazingly buttery, the croissant had delicious bittersweet chunks of chocolate.  Each cube of fruit, whether grape or cantaloupe, was sweet and ripe.
  The eggs came with a toasted brioche, sauteed spinach, and a side of potatoes cut to the size of nickels.  The eggs were an incredibly deep yellow color (from naturally-raised chickens, perhaps?) that I haven't seen from eggs in ages.  The light oil and salt on the potatoes made for a tiny dance of flavor in my mouth.  The sauteed spinach came with big chunks of garlic.  I'm a real garlic lover, so I actually wanted an even stronger garlic taste from the spinach, but I couldn't complain about the tender texture.

I also tried the Oeuf Au Gratin, a deep dish of baked eggs that was a spoonful of richness.  Their coffee was excellent, and their orange juice was very good as well.

I'm recommending this breakfast to all my friends that are headed to Vegas.  Breakfast service ends at 10:30am I believe, which might be difficult for the night-owl party types in Sin City.",1,0,1

Tucked away in what seemed to be another time zone in the behemoth of a casino, Bouchon indulged me with French fare in an intimate, classy setting.
My party of 3 were seated promptly and we started off with escargot (perfectly buttery and chewy).  
The house bread and PISTACHIOS are bomb diggity.  I love anything bread and butter so I was in heaven. The pistachios were a bonus ;) C'mon, where else can you get pistachios?!  Indeed, I am a sucker for novelty. 
I ordered an iced tea and our server brought it out in a carafe, which I thought was and refreshingly...refreshing.  My only gripe with it was that the carafe was not large enough, as I am a bottomless pit for tea.

I have had their lamb so I tried their steak frites, prepared medium rare.  I forget the cut of the steak but I will say that it was one of the best cooked steaks I've ever had!  The center was pink and juicy (no innuendos here!) and every bite of it left me wanting more!  I didn't care too much for the fries; I wish I had substituted it for  something else. What a waste of fries...

My only gripe with the establishment would be the cramped seating between tables.  It can get extremely awkward taking my seat, wiggling my rotund derriere in between tables to get to my destination.  Most of the time, the company directly next to me are not within earshot; but, when they are, then I'd find myself biting my tongue, trying not to spew out my vernacular of special four-letter words. 

Our server was superbly nice and accommodating and our waters were always filled to the brim.  I've always had a great experience here.  The wait staff had greeted us on the way in, which set a precedent for great service and food.

After a few days of huge breakfasts in full american style (we are from Italy, therefore we look for typical american fare in the morning when visiting) she was craving for croissants...
We tried Bouchon at the Venetian, which (a pleasant surprise) is fully operational for breakfast. We had a selection of croissants, actually a huge plate with 5\/6 of them, amongst the very best I ever had (Paris included). Of course you may as well have excellent Omelette and more traditional item, all nicely done and well presented. 
Also the cappuccino was nicely executed, big as expected being in the US, but that's another story. (How can people have a cappuccino after dinner is beyond our comprehension!!!)
Ambience is up to that of a refined bistro. Boucon itself is at the 10th floor in  quiet section of the otherwise crowded Venetian. A Place to linger and indulge in a luxurious breakfast with a special person. A wonderful way to start a morning, business or pleasure or whatever awaits you in Las Vegas.
I will be back soon.

Weekday seating is fairly easy to get a table without much fuss.  You absolutely need to make a reservation on the weekends, or you will likely wait an hour or longer.

The highlight's here are definitely the pastries and the corned beef hash, which is fantastic.  The pastry basket is very reasonably priced for a set of four nice pastries, and they let you choose. ASK THE WAITER, they know which are the freshest\/best and will make some nice suggestions, even if you decide there are a couple you don't want to miss.  The specials and some of the other items are hit or miss.  Recently, they had a lobster hash which I found to be a little underwhelming with the scrambled egg, I think it might have actually been better as a cheaper crab hash, to be honest.   A few of the other items (I've eaten here 4 times):

Quiche:  This is a rotating flavor of the day\/week.  I'm always in a group of 3-4 and we split one of these,  twice it was Florentine which was underwhelming and fairly boring, tbh. 

Bourbon French Toast: Just think bread pudding, not french toast, because that is what this is.  This was solidly good but not spectacular.

Corned Beef Hash:  Order this.  It's awesome.

Pork Loin:  Another highlight, I know you're going to read this and think ""ham and eggs"" basically, but the smokiness of the loin was fantastic with the eggs, and you probably haven't had a piece like this.

Mussels:  Really good thing to split if you have a group.  

Pastries: They usually have a special pastry or two (apple danish last time I was there), the plain croissant is better than the chocolate croissant, but really you can't go wrong in general with what you order here.",2,1,1
