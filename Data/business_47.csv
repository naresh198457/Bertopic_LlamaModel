I came here after work with a few coworkers, expecting since it's still the weekend it would be pretty busy (said a co-worker who was raving about this place).

The wait was about 30 mins, then the line grew as we were waiting for our table. We ordered:
- Soyu Ramen (extra chasiu)
- 2 Tonkatsu Ramen (extra chasiu and egg)
- 1 Pork belly bowl
- 4 drinks
total is around $50

Since this was the first time trying a Ramen spot besides my own mothers, I decided why not, since one of my co-workers have been asking all of us to go everyday at work. We entered the restaurant after the wait and the table are really packed close together (so it's like we're eating the table next to us). The people in line are watching other people eat, it's kind of awkward.

I tried my ramen, it was good but not the greatest (I told him, the hype he was giving this restaurant was not necessary anymore). The chasiu was weird, it was disintegrating in my soup. It was mostly melty, fatty, and I found it pointless to get extra. 

My love got so sick from this place, he was perfectly fine, until that night. He was sweating and grabbing a fever, everything came out from both ends for a couple of days. He's afraid to try Ramen again :(",0,0,0

Items ordered:
Gyoza- 
Always a winner, crispy and chewy wonton wrap with tasty meat fillings. Make your own dipping sauce with condiments on table.
Cold ramen with yuzu-
Great noodle chew with different varieties of veggies, egg and chashu pork dressed in yuzu dressing. Very refreshing
Shoyu tonkatsu-
A mix of both broth and those delicious noodles. The broth makes your lips stick, yum
Chashu bowl-
Exactly that thinly sliced chashu on top of rice
Pork belly bowl-
Sweet soy sauce cooked with the pork belly until super tender. 

I always recommend this place to everyone, it's a small spot that probably seats about 45 including the counter. Constantly busy and consistent with quality of their food.",3,0,2

We've ordered Tonkotsu Ramen, Mentaiko-Don, Cold Noodle (Hiyashi Chuka), Dumplings and Fried Rice. Place was so small, constantly packed and it's seems to be in-n-out kinda place. Definitely not the best place to relax and have a long conversation with friends over the meal. You eat, you get out. Service was ok. Nothing exceptional, but not rude either.

Aside from a bowl of Tonkotsu ramen, we had some gyoza and mini-mentaiko-don. Nothing disappointing here. The service is good ol' japanese efficient and friendly.

Ramen is a messy food. You will need your napkin. Your nose will run. I eat close to the bowl to hide my gluttonous joy.

Service is no nonsense...they want to turn their tables over ASAP since it is small but popular place...even on a Monday around 6 PM it was fairly pack and by the time we were leaving there were 3 or 4 groups of diners waiting.  However, still, I guess they were nice.  When I asked for a soup without noodles, I confused the waitress and she brought me a bowl of just plain tonkatsu broth...no meat, no vegetables.  I was a little confused and thought is was additional broth for my husband's ramen. I ask the other waitress and in a few minutes she brought me the correct order, but mentioned what seemed obvious to me that it would be the same price with or without noodles. 

The tonkatsu broth was rich in texture and deep with flavor and shows quality, time, and care in preparation. I loved it.  However, in comparison to Sora, I like Sora's broth just slightly better maybe because it was just a touch lighter in texture and flavor. Monta's didn't put nearly the amount of pork that Sora does. I do sample the noodles and I prefer Sora's noodles; they are sort of springy and light, Monta's were a little heavier.   My husband who eats ramen the normal way, also prefers Sora.

I guess, I like Sora's style of ramen soup better, but it is purely just a preference, and both are very good.",0,1,0

I was at the end of the bar practically inside the kitchen. There was a wait, as usual, but as usual, the wait is worth it. I brought a ramen enthusiast friend from out of town. He ordered the tonkatsu shoyu ramen with egg and I ordered the tonkatsu ramen with mustard greens. We also split an order of the pork belly over rice. LET ME TELL YOU. This pork belly over rice was so silky and delicious that I didn't want my ramen anymore. I didn't even need the pork belly. The oils and the flavors of the pork just sinks into the rice and the rice alone is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The ramen is no joke either. The texture of the noodles stays perfect throughout the entire meal. They don't become so bloated with soup that they turn into mush. I hate mushy noodles. My friend ate his entire ramen bowl down to the last drop of soup! Now heed this warning: The portion sizes are not of America! If you think you are going to get this huge bowl of unfinishable noodles and broth, YOU'RE A GLUTTON. The portion size is just right and leaves you with JUST enough room for you to share an appetizer and have a cup of tea. This isn't the type of place for socializing.

From the existing reviews, it sounded like I needed to try the Tonkotsu Ramen. I'm glad I did because it was absolutely delicious. The broth is amazing and all the ingredients worked together to provide a satisfying ramen experience. Of course, I had to add egg because that's just my thing.

After finally giving in to my week long craving of ramen, I decided to go with Monta because it was previously my favorite ramen spot. But I think I have given up on this place. I called in an order when I got off of work that way by the time I get there, it would be done. So I walk in right at 930 (the time I said I was gna be there), and not only was my to go order not ready yet, not a single person acknowledged me. I had to walk up to the ladies standing by the cash register to ask about my order. And that's when I saw one of them start getting it ready. So I wait another 10 minutes or so until it's finally ready and I head on to my way. Once I got home, I realize my ramen didn't even come with the meat!!! I tried to call them, but of course, they don't pick up.

Monta Noodle House for now got the BEST Tonkotsu Ramen Soup in town! 

I have tried the famous Ramen shop in LA, SF, and NYC.  This one is no doubt the  BEST.  Thick creamy soup with bald flavors.  Although I am not the fan of thin noodles but they managed to cook it right (Shinsengumi Hataka Ramen in Gardena can not get it right, so does the famous Ippudo in NYC).

We were staying in the north end of the Strip so I suggested ramen and everyone was game.

It was the PERFECT last meal of the trip. We went at 9:30 pm in our yoga pants to get our food to go. I got the Spicy Tonkatsu. My colleagues got the Miso and Shoyu. Our to-go containers had noodles in one container and the broth in another. Everything was tightly sealed - no spills on the way back to the hotel. They gave us spoons, forks and chopsticks.

And we all DEVOURED our bowls. The spicy had a little kick - I would call it a mild-medium. I haven't had much ramen in my life and I now understand why so many of my friends CRAVE it. Especially when it was as good as this was. We all had Ramen bellies in the morning.

At good Ramen places, a half hour to 45 minute wait is the norm. They aren't places to linger. They are places to eat and leave.

Early on a Saturday night, before the huge CES tradeshow, we hoped it would not have a line curling around the block as it did the year before during the trade show. With a little bit of parking ""karma"" we snagged a parking spot as someone else left, signed in and waited.

We were fortunate. After 20 minutes, we were in. Some Ramen places do a complete ""meal"" with broth, meat, egg, veggies, etc. for about $15 Monta does the ""basic"" with add-ons that comes up to the same price. But that meant you could get what you extras you wanted. More meat, maybe another egg or an extra helping of corn or nori.

I had the Tonkatsu Shoyo broth (pork bones and soy sauce) with extra charsui (fatty pork), stewed egg and nori. Seated at the bar meant we got a ring side view of the cooks: The huge pots of broth at a roiling boil, how they heated the bowls before using them, the finishing of the bowls.

Once they arrived, we slurped it down - like you are supposed to, before the Ramen sat in the broth too long and the texture changed. Excellent noodles, tasty - very tasty broth, fatty slices of pork and stewed egg with the yolk just a little ""custardy"" - very yum.

Definitely worth the usual wait - if we were to head back there again.",2,0,0

I like the tonkotsu ramen with extra pork.  The broth is great and the noodles are cooked well.  The pork slice is thin and still has some fat layers on it, which adds to the flavor.  I don't get grossed out by it because it is YUMMY!  If you have a saltier taste bud, you might try the tonkotsu\/shoyu broth combination.  Personnally, I like the regular tonkotsu best, but you won't go wrong with the combination broth.  I have also tried their gyoza, which was ok and nothing special, but hey, I'm here for the ramen and pork. =)

The only issue I have about this place is the price or serving size.  The ramen bowl is $6.99.  If you have a decent appetite, you'd have to order extra noodles ($1.50) or extra pork ($2.50), which is ok.  However, if you have a bigger appetite, you might have to order gyoza or other side dishes in addition, which can increase the overall cost of your meal.

Monta reminds us of Japan's ramen shops...its all about order your food, eat your food, and get out, so the next group can eat. It's not a posh restaurant, minimal tables\/ seats. The restaurant holds at most 30 people (5 tables of 4 seats and about 10 seats on the counter), so if you go with a large party, just sit wherever you can and when you can or you might be waiting for awhile.

The menu is simple. Miso, Tonkatsu, or Shoyu ramen. My favorite is...all of them. Huge stock pots in the back have been boiling bones and veg for hours to create the backbone of their heavenly broth.  I seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. They give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, green onions, half boiled egg, and kikurage. Its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price.

Another favorite is their pork belly bowl. Its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. You get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. Its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. We always get a small bowl and share it.

Their gyoza is good as is the kim chee fried rice. We need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the  dishes that Monta is known for.

Its easy to over order food at Monta. Because the ramen bowls are big...resist ordering other dishes unless you have a big party and you want to share.

This place seats about twenty people and you should be prepared to wait on a weekend. 

The service was very fast and friendly. 

This ramen place is run and owned by Japanese which is always more authentic. 

I got a spicy tonkatsu ramen and the fried rice.  The portion was very large, extra noodles for $1.50 if you like. 

Ramen: broth hot and spicy, on the saltier side, the hot sauce was right on target, pork was super tender and fell apart easily with my chopstick, veggies nice and firm. 

Fried rice: good size portion, plenty of veggies mixed in, nice side of ginger slice.

Prices: very reasonable, all the ramen dishes were under $10 bucks. Fried rice portion was about $7. Japanese tea for $2 beer for $3


This is a solid ramen place in Vegas. Never impressed. Will return here again in the future.",2,0,0

He told me straight up I either need to ""down it"" or throw it out. I was so taken back that I thought I was on the show Punk'd. I wouldn't mind tossing it but first of all the rule is dumb.

They weren't accepting of that and continued to harass me about having any outside drink. The waiter said that there's a sign as I was in, but the sign is barely visible as it's off to the left and looks like it was drawn by a kindergartener.

Shoyu - Broth was much darker than the Tonkatsu and had a slight soy sauce type flavor but a bit salty for my taste. Noodles great as well. The Pork definitely the highlight!

Pork Belly Bowl (Regular Size) - First of, I'm so glad I ordered the full size than the small. I love Yoshinoya Beef Bowls and this was a Glorified version of it! This is a 100% Must Try

Chicken based soup that's not too salty and not greasy. The noodles were cooked perfectly, which is always a +.  The only tiny thing they could probably improve on is to have the egg yolk more runny.

The meat here is melt-in-your-mouth and fall apart tender. Really good. The egg is quite tasty as well.  I can tell that the food here is cooked meticulously and with pride when watching the guys cooking your noodles. That being said, I don't think it was really that exciting or remarkable. I got the shoyu ramen with less sodium in it, and the noodles and flavor weren't as good as Ramen Sora's.

If you had to pick one of the two to try, I would try Ramen Sora. The atmosphere at Monta reminds me more of a cold winter day in Japan in a packed ramen house, but I like my American elbow room! Also, the flavors are brighter and portions are bigger at Ramen Sora. ;)",1,1,1

I usually order either the Tonkotsu Shoyu or the Miso Ramen and then add an egg. I absolutely love their broth (I am a big fan of salt after all). At times, we will order gyoza and\/or fried rice to go along with our orders of ramen, and that is usually a good way to round out the meal.

The Service (4 out of 5):
I love how fast the turnover of tables is after a patron as left because there is usually a line of people waiting to get in. This is my only true gripe about Monta; I just wish that they had just a little more seating room. HINT: If you go here for lunch, they open at 11:30am......just make sure that you are a couple of minutes early otherwise you will be waiting about 20-30 mins to get seated.

The Price (5 out of 5): 
Ok, I guess that this could be better if it were FREE, but come on, that's not going to happen! But, you shouldn't be paying any more than $20 pp here (more like $10-12 pp if you're not getting any extras and\/or having water as your drink).

I finally got the chance to try it today.  I was a little apprehensive after reading all the reviews about the heat inside and the rude service.

Well, as usual, I was only customer at 3 pm.  The first thing I noticed was the temperature.  Sure it was hot and humid, but they have large vats of soup and hot water boiling away, so it was to be expected.  I think they had the A\/C on full because it was definitely tolerable.  Next was the waitress.  The one that helped me was very friendly and helpful.  She checked up on me regularly.  So good news, maybe the owner read the reviews and critiques on Yelp and decided to do something.

As for the food, I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with egg and extra premium green onion.  Since I was the only person in there, my order came quickly.  The size of the bowl was a bit on the small size.  Two, nice, fatty, pieces of pork floated underneath a mound of slivered green onions.  I quickly tried a piece of the char-su.  The meat was extremely tender, as tender as the fat and their was a nice ring of flavor on the outside.  Made me wish they gave me more.  The broth was nice an rich, not too salty and the noodles were cooked to a nice al dente, so they were chewy and adsorbed some of the broth.

After sampling everything, I added some minced garlic and chili powder to my bowl.  They also had the pickled ginger, toasted sesame seeds, white pepper, sesame seed oil, and some other condiments so I could season my noodles just the way I wanted.  That was a big plus.  

Overall, I was very happy with the flavor of my tonkotsu ramen, the service, and the A\/C.

I had the Tonkotsu (not to be confused with TonKAtsu), my husband had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu and the girls both had the Miso. We also shared a pork belly bowl. Everything was spot on delish. The Tonkotsu is the heaviest, richest broth...delicious, but I think I'll wait until the weather cools before ordering it again. The Tonkotsu-Shoyu is a combo of the richer Tonkotsu and the lighter, clearer Shoyu broth. It had the richness from the Tonkotsu, but the Shoyu gave it a delicious brightness. We did not get to try the plain Shoyu as both girls insisted on Miso. The Misi was also very good, but did not out-shine the Tonkotsu-Shoyu. The toppings were perfect...thin slices of ultra tender chasu (pork), strips of mushroom and pickled red ginger (nothing like sushi ginger).

The Pork Belly Bowl was everything the name suggests. Tender, well seasoned pork belly atop sticky rice. So good. We like to sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds on top.

The service was fast, friendly and very welcoming. The place is tiny as are most noodle houses you find in Japan. We went at 2:30 in the afternoon and were able to get a table right away. (was almost hoping they'd be packed...forcing us to go to Raku *sigh* my fav, lol)

Heads up! As of June 1st they are offering Hayashi Chuka which is a cold Japanese noodle dish. Perfect for summer. We didn't order it this visit, but will definitely be headed back soon. It is a favorite of ours, but we've only had it in friends' kitchens. They serve canned soft drinks, and our whole family highly recommends you give the Calpico a go. It's tangy, almost reminiscent of the original tangy flavor yogurt at Red Mango or Pinkberry. Very refreshing :)",0,0,0

My boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner around 6:00 PM on a Monday and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. The restaurant has about four tables, three tables seat four people each and one table seats six people, and then there is bar seating. As we were leaving the restaurant a little before 7:00 PM, I noticed that there were several people waiting outside for a table.

I ordered the Shoyu Ramen, while the boyfriend had the Miso Ramen. Our food came out quickly in 10 minutes or less, much to our delight. We both agreed that my clear Shoyu broth was much better, as the creamy Miso one was a bit salty. Both of our dishes featured their thick and wavy noodles that had a great, chewy texture. The pork chashu is super tender and melts right in your mouth *drool*. If you are a meat lover, you may want to add extra chashu (four pieces) since the ramen only comes with two pieces. The fatty part of the pieces of meat is what packs such flavor and gets you hooked. I added corn and a soft flavored egg as extra toppings to my bowl. The bamboo and black jelly ear mushrooms that come with all ramen dishes made each bite unique and delicious. The Gyoza dumplings were just alright - I probably wouldn't order them again.

Miso ramen- broth was a lil salty and luke  warm, cold corn (which prob made the broth luke warm), the noodles were stuck together in a ball shape, so that was obvious it wasn't boiled long enough. 

Kim chi Fried rice- was very wet and was obvious drenched with a lot of oil

Cold noodles- were a bit sour and visibly covered with way too much sesame sauce.

Kurume style is still creamy and rich, but the mouth feel of less oil\/fat allows for more of the meat flavor to come through. Monta definitely gets this right.

Unfortunately, Monta is a small shop and quite popular, so it's often busy and crowded. Even on weekdays I'll often find that there's a line by noon - so I'd definitely get there right at opening if you don't want to wait (as long).

There's definitely a pork flavor, rich and soothing.  The soup is steaming when it comes out, but it makes it taste even better!

This is my third visit to Monta but first time to review.  

1.  The lines - The place is typical for a Ramen shop, with limited space to eat and to wait, but it is worth it.  My suggestion is to go when it opens and it will be all good.

2.  The food -  Have had:
a.  Miso Ramen - Bean Paste Ramen, very tasty. noodles perfect.
b.  Shoyu Ramen - Soy Sauce flavored broth and a nice stand by.
c.  Tonkatsu Ramen - Pork Bone broth - my favorite.

All noodles are just right, al dente and the broth is not piping hot as I would expect, but tasty overall.  Perhaps they believe the western palate does not prefer the hot broth, but to me, it has to be piping hot to be perfect.  The soups have a perfect blend of roasted pork slices that are tender and tasty.

3.  Price - Very reasonable, approximately 7.00 depending if you put extra stuff in the noodles.

Monta Ramen has that must-visit reputation so there's always lines.  It's located in probably the most renowned shopping plaza in Chinatown so add no parking on top of the wait time.

Their menu and selection is straightforward and simple:  3 types of noodle broth and you pick and add the extras you want in there.  Each of the 3 soups come with green onions, two slices of cha siu, bamboo shoots and kikurage.  You pay anywhere from 50 cents to two bucks for addt'l toppings.  They also have gyoza and varieties of fried rice & pork belly bowl - yummm!

I ordered the Tonkatsu-Shoyu Ramen with extra helpings of Cha Siu and Nori.  First sip of the broth and ohhh was I in my happy place!  The combination of the tonkatsu pork bone \/ fat with the Shoyu soy sauce made for a flavorful rich, creamy and salty soup.  I was quite happy that I ordered extra servings of the cha siu.

Definite must return the next time we're back and I'd give my recommendation to anyone as well.

WELL.. That is NOT allowed at Monta. They follow strict rules and would rather have you LEAVE than seat you at a table (that seats four people) and have your remaining party join you. 

SO in essence, if you're seated at a table with 2 extra seats you CANNOT have anyone come in and sit down and join you. 

I was told that my friend would have to re-check in and wait. (?? that doesn't even make sense)

I've been coming here with my family on and off now since opening, and even though the broths and noodles are still very tasty, the quality of the soups and other items have been hit\/miss over the last year or so.  Used to be that we'd always order the takana rice and gyoza, but both of those taste like microwaved foods now (even though freshly made - if you watch the kitchen).

The broths are still very tasty, but sometimes overly salty, sometimes not enough.  Hit\/miss, like I said.  Stay away from the shoyu and miso version if you don't need extra sodium.  Normally I just get the tonkotsu with corn, nitamago, and takana on the side (self-add for saltiness).

After ""Togoshi Ramen"" disappeared, Monta is probably the first real ""Ramen-ya"" (ramen house) opened in Las Vegas.  Not a sushi-ya or a restaurant serving ramen, or a ramen-ya being a full restaurant.

Monta's  Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen started good, and was good for awhile, and went to ""a little too salty"" on the ramen soup, but I know they can do better.   Went back today after more than a year, and it was back to normal. Still a small place, busy as usual, but, I was in and out in about 30 - 40min.  I ate pretty quick, too. I didn't order any extra toppings because I want it to taste it the way it is, plus, I ordered a side of pot stickers and a side of Kimchee Fried Rice.   It might be my imagination, but, I think their Kimchee Fried Rice got better.  I don't remember if it originally had any bits of shiitake mushrooms in it, but it had it, and it was delicious! 

The gyoza (pot stickers)  I ordered (not in the photo) was a gyoza.  Nothing special.  Frankly, I've had better gyoza, and I can too, make a better one (with 30+ years of professional cooking and non-professional experience).  However, their specialy is ramen. Tonkotsu Shoyu is difficult to balance in the first place.  I can taste the pork broth with the shiitake mushrooms, and a hint of something... not Japanese.  May be Chinese, or perhaps that ""hihachi"" pepper from Okinawa?  Great job Monta!

Their other ramen like miso base and shoyu base have always been good.
Ramen soups are always fascinating, because there are so many things you can do to it.  There is no ""fixed"" or ""Orthodox"" style, or, whatsoever.  It has to taste good at your first sip of the soup, hence, very challenging.

Miso Ramen 7.25 
Pork Broth w\/thin noodles (you can choose between chicken or pork broth, thin or wide noodles)

Chasu Pork $2.50
Spicy $1.50

Takana Mustard Leaf  $1.50
Corn .50

Other: 
Gyoza $5.50

The service was fast.  Ingredients on the ramen are placed on top, but before I mixed everything altogether I tried the broth and it was very good.   Adding the ingredients of the spicy sauce, Mustard Leaf and Chasu in Pork broth made the soup just way too salty for me to eat it.  I really wish the server would had informed me that this would have happened.  Otherwise, the Chasu was really tender and the thin noodles were not too overwhelming.  Everything in the bowl was well portioned. Then I had the gyoza, it just tasted like any frozen gyoza purchased at a super market.

Our server was courteous and we did not feel hurried. There's counter seating around the bar and maybe 5 four-tops in addition. It's not a big place, so there might be a wait if your party is larger than one or two. The AC was cranked up, which made for a very pleasant dining experience, considering you're eating hot soup in the desert.

I loved the concept of standard toppings and adding what you want on top of it. I added the seasoned egg to my bowl, which had a perfectly set, slightly gooey middle. The tonkotsu was thick and cloudy, with plenty of collagen dissolved in the soup to give you that lip-smacking sensation. Noodles were perfectly chewy, although you had to slurp fast so the hot soup didn't soften them too much. They also have Sapporo on tap in schooner sizes.

It's essentially in a strip mall, but I get the sense that this is the deal with a lot of restaurants off the strip in LV. There was a wait when I arrived (around 1pm on EDC weekend, so I anticipated this), and the place was very very small which meant waiting outside in 110+ degree heat... ramen is always worth the wait though! One thing I would suggest is to reorganize a bit so there is more room for waiting inside, and perhaps if possible find a way to keep more of the AC inside... I was happy I wasn't seated near the door because you were definitely feeling the hot air! 

Anyway, the food... I ordered the miso and asked to add spicy paste - it wasn't listed as an add-on for the menu but they were happy to accomodate. The broth was rich, salty, and tasty, with a strong miso flavor which I really appreciated. Sometimes ""miso"" ramen just tastes like ""salty"" ramen lol - not the case here. The spicy sauce was a great choice, it had a nice garlicky flavor and blended well into the soup. The pork was delicious and well-cooked, but the portion wasn't as  large as I might have liked. The noodles were excellent! The miso comes with the wavy noodles and this is my personal preference, so I really enjoyed them. Very chewy and well cooked. There was also a healthy portion of menma, a delicious ajitama, and a piece of nori included. Probably should have just added more chashu for only $2.50... but I didn't think of it.

It's flavorful without being overbearing and it adds a nice variety if you're ordering ramen.

The Pork Belly Bowl was sooo sooo bland. It looks much better than it tasted, and throughout eating my bowl, I kept having to add spice and soy sauce. The chef kept looking at me do so and I felt a bit guilty since I'd think it's pretty offensive that I'm altering his dish as much as I did, but I HAD to. 

The ramen was mediocre and didn't meet its hype. We paid an extra $1 for spicy paste, but still felt like it was lacking.

We started our meal off with a pork belly bowl which was just savory goodness. The pork drippings from the fat coated the each grain of rice and made it all savory, buttery, and utterly delicious. The slivers of red ginger also helped to cut the fattiness\/greasy factor of this dish.

Next came our orders. We each ordered some variety of ramen, but noticed that only the miso ramen came with ""traditional"" ramen noodles. Everyone else received these thinner noodles...still good, but not what we expected. I added a pad of butter and corn to my dish which made it more complete in my opinion....I also appreciated the fact that add-on's here ranged from $0.50 to $1.50 as opposed to my regular $1.50 to $3.00 in the Bay Area (for the same two spoonfuls of corn in most cases).

One of the thing that surprised me most was having the minced pork over rice at a ramen shop. That I was not expecting. 

Tonkotsu Ramen was what I ordered. It did come with some good flavors, but personally I think I liked the Minced Pork over rice more than I liked the ramen. The flavors were pretty good but they seemed like a flavor i'd get at any other ramen shop. Broth was buttery but felt like it was made me more thirsty than anything. I got this other noodle that I didn't like but my friends had the original type of ramen noodle. I didn't notice that they paired different noodles to different flavors or that you can request to have them changed, so that was a fail on my part. Add an egg and some butter corn and that makes anything close to good. Add some mouth melting tender pork and you should be good to go. 

Place was kinda crowded and we had 9 people so our wait was a little long. There's a nice little boba joint next door, so get some boba and wait in the AC.

Nope, they still had a very nice texture to it, and the broth was full of rich deep flavor.  That marinated egg......OMG, so much flavor and cooked absolutely perfectly.  The Chasu, super tender and flavorful.  The gyoza was good, however I usually like it better when the bottom is a touch crispier.  My wife rarely brags about food like I do, but she made sure to let my friend know how good the ramen was and that we had to come back again on our next trip.  Ahh, yah I think we can do that.

I loved that this place was open late and although it was packed when I first arrived at 12:30am, I was seated within 15 minutes of arriving.

Monta is actually so pea-sized that if you come during peak times you'll almost certainly have to wait before you can sit down. Don't let this be a deterrant, just keep it in mind before you go, and get there quickly before even more people find out about it.

Half of the restaurant is an open kitchen, so your dinner music consists of the clanking of woks and pans accompanied by the chatter of the waitresses, cooks, and other patrons. You can sit at the bar if you really want to be part of the action, or if none of the five tables are available. Though the vibe is nice and busy, the waitresses are sweet and won't rush you through your meal.

There are three types of ramen to choose from; Tonkatsu (rich, cloudy, almost creamy broth); Shoyu (light and delicate soy sauce based broth); and Miso (somewhere in the middle of the other consistencies and tastes like...miso). The Shoyu and Miso ramen come with chewy, thicker noodles which I much prefer in texture and taste to the thinner, less al dente noodles that come in the Tonkatsu (you can sub if you like). All three varieties of the ramen cost around $7 and also come with chasu (tender, roasted, fatty pork), scallions, kikurage (mushroom), takenoko (bamboo shoots), and scallions. You can then customize your ramen with little extras that include perfectly coddled egg, butter, more pork, and my personal favorite, Takana, or pickled mustard leaf. These don't cost a lot, so customize away. Also, be sure to add some of the fantastic accoutrement residing in your condiment tray such as pickled ginger strips and minced garlic.

You won't find much other than ramen on the menu, just a handful of appetizers and sides. Of these I've had the gyoza ($5.95), which were excellent one time but not cooked correctly another, and fried rice with takana. The fried rice is almost as good as the ramen, so if you aren't in the mood for soup get this instead. Another plus is cheap beer ($2.50 for domestic).

I can't think of any other meal I'd rather enjoy on a cold day than a steaming bowl of hearty home-made soup, so I plan on going to Monta frequently this winter. If it continues to get even busier, however, I may be taking it to go in a perfectly packed parcel. I brought ramen home for my husband once and was amazed at the care put into ensuring the soup would be just as good at home as it is in the restaurant. The noodles were wrapped in their own little pouch, waiting to be cooked until they reached our stove, and all the other ingredients were individually wrapped to keep them in their peak state. Attention to detail really separates the boys from the (ra)men.",5,3,2

That's a health violation!

Then, the moment I had been waiting for, and cue the angels...AHHHH...my ramen. It just looked so beautiful & smelled wonderful. As I write this now, my mouth is watering & I can just taste it. It really was so comforting & delicious, the epitome of Umami, in the general sense. I just wanted to dive in and backstroke in there! I was totally reminded of the movie Ramen Girl, and I could just feel the love, and heart & soul that went into this bowl of ramen. Unfortunately, I have nothing else to compare it to. I have been to Japan, but sadly I never had the pleasure of having ramen while I was there :(

Overall, I really love this place & I will definitely be back. The staff is wonderful & gracious. It was a lot of fun sitting @ the counter & watching the cooking going on back there. Lol, I did find it amusing to see some of my fellow Hispanics back there doing big things ;) I'm pretty sure they were trying to pass them off as Japanese by tying their headbands a little tighter than normal though. Well, they do it @ Benihana, so why not here. Ha Ha! I will totally recommend this place to any and everyone who will listen.",3,2,3

The small ramen joint does not fit many and there is often a wait. Your entire group has to be there in order to be seated as well. There is a $10 minimum for card.

The waitresses are obviously experienced and seemlessly work together and with the chefs to efficiently serve customers. They are friendly, but not overly so. Food comes quickly as well because their menu is pretty small.

My usual order is a miso ramen with corn. The main reason I get corn is because the broth is a little too salty. Many people complain about this but I never really felt the extent of Monta's salty broth until the past year or so. It just seems thicker and more unhealthy than it used to be. I'm not sure if their recipes changed or if my tastes changed.

You get nori, chashu, and bamboo. Condiments you can add include garlic puree, pickled ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, sesame seeds, and chili powder. One thing that used to bother me when I first started coming here was that they only have green tea iced and in a can. 

They also have a few other dishes besides the various ramen, including rice bowls, friend rice, cold noodles, and gyoza. For recent additions to the menu, they have the option to make your noodles spicy (+$1) or the kuro ramen, which is black garlic ramen. It's actually pretty tasty in my opinion, but I am an avid eater of garlic.

Regardless of the heavy mouthfeel of the ramen, the consistent service and food keeps regulars like me coming back.",1,0,0

My friend turned to Yelp and found that Monta had a bunch of reviews and was overall rated four stars.  After dining at Monta and though the price is right, my conclusion is either Vegas lacks great ramen spots or Vegas Yelpers have low expectations for ramen...or maybe even both...

WAIT:
Our party of seven arrived a bit after 1pm on a Friday afternoon.  Monta isn't a big place.  They accommodate approximately about 10 people at the bar and another 20-25 seated.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table which in the end, our party of seven had to split into two separate groups to be seated.

FOOD:
*Tonkatsu Ramen ($6.95) - Though the broth was tasty and hearty, the noodles totally failed.  The noodles were different from what I am use to and I wasn't a fan of the thin, vermicelli like noodles which made the broth taste starchy the longer they sat there.  Toppings on the noodles were two pieces of chasui, bamboo shoots, green onions, and kikurage mushrooms.  One of our friends ordered the miso ramen and it came with noodles we were more accustomed to.

*Pork Belly Bowl ($3.95 small\/$5.75 large) - Delicious!  We ordered a large bowl and shared it with the table.  A generous amount of tasty pork belly is shredded over rice and topped with chopped green onions.

SERVICE:
Typical Asian restaurant as you basically order, get your food, and get the bill.  Food took about 15 minutes or so to come out.

So during the colder months, we make our way as much as possible to Monta for Ramen

It's tiny noodle shop, the counter seats ten and five table tops that seats twelve total.  It's open until late at night and it cranks out people like no one's business-prety much there's always a waiting list to get into this place!

And it is well worth it,  the Ramen is some of the best that we have had, (and that includes Japan!  Gasp! Horror! Blasphemy!) but it's true-we went to Hide Chan Ramen in Fukuoka and the broth wasn't as good as Monta's!

As we always do, there's a couple of things that we order and not much else, (it's hard to venture out when you know a dish is that good).  We start the Japanese journey with an order of the Gyoza; these pork dumplings are perfectly cooked, a crunchy charred exterior that holds in the moist juices of the pork.  Add Sujoyu, (a mixture of Vinegar and Soy Sauce) Rayu (Chili Oil) and some raw garlic, dip these little moon shaped suckers in it and pop' em in your pie hole! 

After you've wet your appetite, it's time move onto the Main Event; the Ramen.  As is, we're partial to the Tonkotsu (Pork Bone) Ramen- the broth is made from simmered Pork Bone, Fat and Collagen which gives it its super rich, almost creamy soup that can easily fill you up and warm your body.  It's most definitely the most satisfying noodle soup on this planet.  And especially since this is a Kyushu dish, (Fukuoka is on the  island of Kyushu) I'm particular to the flavor.  (Japan based on its regions have different tastes and styles to the same dish).  

Monta's Tonkotsu Ramen recipe is from Kurume, (not far from Fukuoka) so it's really close to my heart.  Which is why you won't see me ordering the other Ramen, (there's Shoyu, Miso and Tonkotsu-Shoyu).  One of these days, We'll get to them......

There's a couple of add ons and I would definitely go and order an extra Chashu, (Roasted Pork) these tender slices of heaven are as much as a main character as the Noodles and Broth.  Getting to the Noodles, have you ever had anything better than Ramen Noodles? They're just so unique; chewy and Monta really cooks them right.  We also get the Nitamago, (cooked egg) Takana, (Mustard Leaf) and sometimes Nori, (Seaweed) -the egg for extra protein, the Takana for the vegetable and crunch and Nori for the contrast in texture.  You can also order an extra helping of Ramen Noodles (Kaedama) if you have extra broth, but there's no way I have ever had enough room for that!!!

In the Summertime, they serve Hiyashi-Chuka (Cold Chinese Noodles). It's refreshing and cold perfect for the summer with bits of Ham, Cucumber, Bean Sprouts, Takana, Nori and Sesame Seeds over Ramen noodles in a light Soy; it's the best on a hot day!!!

I forgot to mention the Rice bowls that they serve as well; I'm not the biggest fan of these bowls but that just me- a lot of people rave about them!  I know what I like and I'm happy staying on my side of the menu if you know what I mean...The service here is excellent, the waitresses are terribly polite and the the food comes outs really fast! (They need too, cuz they have to get people in and out of there)!

Once I walk in to restaurant, smell stronger when walk closer, it is open kitchen, so that you can see how they make and prepare the food, it can make people feel safe to eat and I saw almost everyone order the ramen, so that may the one reason why all flavor comes out so quickly. Once I get menu, not much food option in the menu, several ramen and fried rice to choose, I heard their ramen is good, so I order the miso ramen with thin noodles, add corn and egg on top. About 15 minutes, the server give me my ramen, this ramen looks so bright and opaque, because it have green onion and a little bit seaweed with the corn and egg on top, those makes this dish so colorful, once I smell the dish, it is fragrant and looks like very tasty. The noodles very soft and moist, when I eat that my mouthfeel is smooth and stringy, the soup is very salty for me, and the egg is cold and smooth too, when I ate a lot of soup I feel oily.

The spicy tonkotsu initially comes as a normal tonkotsu and then you mix the spicy red stuff in the soup to make it spicy. My date really liked that the get to enjoy two flavors. He also said that the spicy thing is like spicy miso so it adds additional flavor\/depth. The kuro ramen was really good, just the right amount of garlic so I didn't feel the need to add any(there's garlic on the table if you want to add it). We also got gyoza and fried rice. The gyoza was good but I was really really fascinated by the fried rice. That was like the perfect fried rice you would get at a Japanese ramen place. Wish I lived closer so I could go back.

After waited for 30 minutes and finally got to try a variety of ramen... here's the verdict... well, all Tonkotsu, Spicy Tonkotsu and Kuro Black Garlic Oil Ramen turned out to be a bit too salty... although the quality of broth is considered somewhat standard... (NYC standards, of course) with creamy and thick broth... their Chashu is very thin and on the fatty side.

I have to say this stacks up pretty well compared to some of the ramen places in California like Santouka or Shin Sen Gumi.  I think the defining factor is the broth itself.

I was a little skeptic at first, but walking into this tiny little place, which probably seats no more than 20 - 30 guests, was one of the pleasant little surprises of my trip.  

Ordered the Gyoza and the Tonkotsu ramen with the hard boiled egg.  The gyoza...typical.  The ramen was actually quite good.  The noodles were nice and soft, and the broth was flavorful and not too much.  The yolk of the egg was pretty salty, even for my taste(and I LOVE salty), but the Chasu...MAN, I don't know exactly how they cooked it, but it was frickin good.  I ate all of my ramen and my fiancee's leftovers and was so full, but would've still eaten some more, just because I liked it so much.  

I can definitely see this place getting quite busy at peak times, considering the size and all, so come outside of the meal rush hours.

I love ramen as a meal. Its cheap, fast,  and totally filling, not to mention tasty. 

We split a gyoza app, which was super greasy. Would probably skip that one. My husband felt like the 105 heat was too much for warm soup, so he opted for cold ramen noodles in a sesame dressing, which I also thought was absolutely delic.

But the second I walked in, I was taken aback to the tiny ramen shops back in Japan, with 1 long bar and a few tables.  Immediately my attitude changed for the good.  I looked at the menu, just 3 kinds of ramen, but you really don't need an exotic variety, just the ones you're really good at making.

Being kinda picky, I had ordered the Miso ramen, but with no mushroom or bamboo shoots, and added an egg and corn.  The soup came, and I did my usual broth test and was very surprised to find it was really good to me.  I added some sesame oil and went to town.

This was definitely one of the best things I have eaten in a long time.  The fact that I was hungover and had spent the morning in the desert only added to the greatness.

if only the broth wasn't so damn thick,

they could solve all these problems just by making the bowl bigger!

We were seated almost right away even though there were ppl waiting in front of us(perhaps they are in large groups).

Although I don't think it beats out some of my California favorites, Monta Ramen is a solid ramen shop...just be mindful of the wait.

+Let's talk about pricing first. I got the tonkatsu ramen for a pretty reasonable price ($8.50) that includes a mixture of kikurage, bamboo, green onions and two pieces of chasu. It's a bit light on the items it comes with, which is a little bit unfortunate. I added egg and extra chasu for about $3.50 more. You can get drinks here for fairly cheap. Beer is only about $3 but note that they only have Asahi\/Bud. They also have a number of side dishes, some coming in different sizes like gyoza to a chasu bowl. They also have a number of different ramen types which look interesting.
+Flavor-wise, I think the tonkatsu ramen was really solid. The broth had a simple but filling flavor. The chasu nearly seemed to melt in your mouth with the fat easily tearing off as you chew. Not the 'softest' chasu I ever had but comes pretty darn close. I did think adding extra chasu (which was about another 4-5 pieces) seemed a little overkill though for me personally. The noodles were pretty good although didn't stand out as anything different that you might expect. They have a variety of regular condiments for you to use from ginger to sauces. 
+Staff was friendly and attentive. Loved seeing the kitchen from the bar area as in most ramen places.  

+\/- Seating (which I'll mention again below) is tight. There's a small bar area and a few tables. Don't expect to bring a huge group here.
+\/- Parking is in the same plaza as a few other popular restaurants like Raku. It didn't seem overly busy in the daytime but it's definitely a tighter space for parking to be mindful of. 
+\/- Note they have a $10 credit card minimum. 

-Man, this place is small. I came about 11:45AM (15 minutes after opening) and it already was a 25 minute wait. Those who came right after had to wait longer for sure. Be mindful of this when you stop by and especially with the hot summer months, you might be waiting out in the hot weather. 
-Again, as noted above, don't expect too many toppings on your ramen as in some other places.

Finding parking here was kinda annoying since the parking lot for this shopping center was small. We were actually surprised that we were able to be seated right away as a party of 5. When we left there was a line going outside the door, so I'd either come early or expect a wait because this place is super tiny inside (there's a few tables and then bar style seating). 

Looking over the menu, I was shocked at how cheap the ramen was. But then I realized that the ramen is very basic -- broth, 2 slices of pork, green onions, ramen and bamboo shoots. If you want extras like egg, extra pork, corn, kimchi, etc. you'll have to pay extra. But even after adding toppings my food still came out to be like $10. 

We started off sharing a pork belly bowl as a table. It was pretty good! As for my meal, I ordered the Miso ramen and asked for spicy paste on the side. I also opted to add the egg and corn.  After adding the spicy paste in my Miso ramen it tasted great and was full of flavor! The miso ramen also had the thick wavy noodles that I love.

Located conveniently next to Raku on the outskirts of Las Vegas Chinatown, Monta is the latest darling in the Vegas foodie scene and follows the popular ramen trend that has already hit LA, NYC, and the Bay Area.  

Authentically Japanese owned and frequented by many Japanese during our visit, Monta offers shoyu, tonkotsu, and miso broths.  Tonkotsu appears to be their most popular offering and bowls start at a reasonable $6.95.  Each bowl comes with two pieces of chashu, green onions, and some bamboo shoots.  

Overall, the bowls are on the small side and toppings a bit sparse than other top places I've frequented.  Corn, butter, Kim Chee, and a hard boiled, not soft boiled, egg can be added.  

Broth flavor was good though a tad salty and one noted compared to the more complex broths I love at Santouka.   The noodles are fresh but thin reminding me of the fresh made noodles at Maru Ichi in the Bay Area. I personally like thicker noodles like Orenchi in Sunnyvale.

Service, due to the small space and crowds, can feel a bit rushed and they initially forgot our drink orders.  No biggie and quickly fixed.  

Monta is a nice addition to the ramen scene but with minimally topped bowls and solid broths, ramen aficionados will likely have tried more polished ramen parlors in SoCal and NorCal.

The thick and rich, gravy-like broth, was extremely salty and offended our taste buds. Although I preferred the spicy miso ramen over the tonkotsu shoyu, they were both incredibly heavy and beyond rich. The bowl and noodles were piping hot, but the broth was just warm. 

We couldn't finish our bowls and left about 65% of it back (noodles and broth). After our dinner, our stomachs had a hard time digesting the richness and we felt a little nauseous. We could of shared one bowl of ramen, it was super filling and we had a ton of leftovers. 

This is the first time I've ever regretted adding extra toppings on my ramen. The toppings didn't enhance or compliment our ramen. It all got lost in the thick salty broth. Plus the topping choices were rather boring, the best had to of been: corn, kimchi, and nitamago (flavored egg) - the kimchi was fresh and flavorful and they have perfected their soft-boiled egg!

Here's what we ordered: 
Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen with thin noodles (I didn't care for these noodles) and 2 slices of chashu (and with all of the extras):
+dried seaweed - pretty boring
+corn - I loved the corn's sweetness and texture 
+nitamago (flavored soft boiled egg)- perfect! 
+mustard leaf - mushy and flavorless
+shredded green onion - adds nice texture and freshness
+butter - this ramen doesn't need more richness! 
$12.45 

Spicy Miso Ramen with thick wavy noodles (the best noodles!) and 2 slices of thin chashu (and with all of the extras):
+dried seaweed - boring
+corn - great!
+nitamago (flavored egg) - great! 
+mustard leaf - boring and mushy
+shredded green onion - adds freshness
+butter - this ramen does not need more richness! :x
$13.75

Side of extra chashu $2.50 - super fatty and buttery. 

Side of Kimchi $1 - very fresh and flavorful. 

Small pork belly bowl $3.95 - this was my favorite. The pork belly was tender, buttery, and rich in flavor. The rice was cooked perfectly and the green onion and sweet pickled ginger added perfect freshness to the rice bowl.

TURN THE FRICKIN' A\/C UP DAMMIT!!!

My buddy and I wandered in here for our last meal in Vegas before heading home for LA. Read some positive reviews so we decided to check it out.

Service was very nice and friendly, I'd give it a 4. My miso ramen was pretty good but nothing extraordinary. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and go with a 4 though. My friend had the tonkotsu and didn't really like it because it came with thin noodles (won ton noodle type) which he wasn't expecting. So just a heads up for anyone who is concerned about that sort of thing.

But the big kicker was that whoever runs the place has the temp dialed up to an abnormally warm level. We sat there the whole meal with sweat running off our foreheads and trying to fan ourselves with our shirts. Just on this issue alone I would not go back. We really couldn't finish up our food fast enough to get out of the restaurant and back into the car so we could turn on some A\/C! Totally ruined the experience for us and this part gets the establishment a 2 in my book. 

So YMMV but I would not go unless it's nightime... or winter.",2,0,1

It is in a little strip mall and is quite crowded no matter the time of day (we were there at 2:30 and waited about 20 minutes)  You write your name down on the clipboard right inside the doorway and when a table is ready they call you.  Most people wait outside, there are a few benches to sit on.

The interior is very clean, neat, and cute.  There is a counter and a few small tables.   It is not a place you want to come to if you have a large group. 

The service was very pleasant.  The waitstaff was extremely kind, patient, and attentive.  

We ordered some of the regular fried rice and it was the best we have ever tasted.  It was extremely fresh, well seasoned, and downright delicious.  We also ordered the gyoza which were cooked to order and impeccable. 
Onto the ramen, I ordered the Tonkotsu which is a pork based broth where the bones are cooked in the broth to create a creamy, thick, almost buttery texture.  It was extremely flavorful and very rich.  My husband got the combo Shoyu Tonkotsu which is the same pork broth mixed with a soy\/chicken based broth.  This was a little less rich and was also close to perfect.  The noodles were fresh and the perfect texture.

Sometimes it may be a bit salty or whatnot, but I guarantee you, the other Japanese restaurants in the Chinatown area can never compare to their ramen.  Unless you've found a smaller, hole-in-the-wall place (doubt that's possible, considering how small this place is), then let me know.

Great ramen.  Great for the price, but it's $10 for the ramen plus a couple ingredients.  The service is ALWAYS fast.  I mean, how hard is it with less than 20 seats?  If something concerns you, the server is no more than 10 feet away- call for them when they pass by.

There are several kinds of soup base you can pick from- each explaining in good detail what they taste like.  They are never watery- very flavorful, and each side dish they give you to put into your soup is always fresh.  The ramen doesn't taste like cup noodle.

Someone earlier said that it's a typical, small Asian restaurant- get your food, eat, get the bill, get out.

Ok, that's true.  So what, you're going to knock them down a star for them not having a heart to heart connection with you and not letting you tell them your whole life story?  Please.

Contrary to many of the yelpers, I can't give this place anything more than ONE star.  

If you like high carb, high fat, high sodium foods, this is definitely the place to come to. Otherwise, you are better off eating a hamburger -- less damaging to your body. 

My wife and I came and we ordered Shoyu Ramen, Tonkotsu Ramen and a regular fried rice. 

Both Ramen have three pieces of CharSiu -- but they are not Charsiu, they are thin slices of pork belly. If you like pig fat, you will find this to be hog heaven. 

Both the Miso Ramen soup and the Tonkotsu soup are very, very greasy and quite salty. The ramen noodle is of the thin variety that can be purchased from many of the Asian food markets. Both Ramen bowls are filled with scallion, bamboo shoots and seaweed. 

In many other Ramen noodle houses, there is always a half marinated hard boiled egg that comes with the ramen dish, but not this one.

Pricing on the Ramen is quite reasonable -- about $7.00 each. However, I can't tell whether it is good tasting or not, when food is covered with grease and salt, my taste buds are over powered. 

We also shared a regular fried rice. Again, it is quite greasy and the rice is bit too soft. Many other Asian restaurant can do a better job.  

All in all, the rice is barely acceptable but the ramen is not.

I ordered the special black garlic tonkatsu ramen and bear had the regular. The noodles were perfect, the bowl came out immaculate. I did learn that as much as I LOVE animal fat, I am not a tonkatsu broth fan.

I've heard only amazing things about Monta Ramen from fellow online Yelpers. But lemme tell ya, I should have listened to my actual Yelp foodie friends from the Bay Area. They told me, ""Monta ain't all that."" 

Don't get me wrong, service was pretty good actually. Maybe too good...cuz my ramen came out within minutes of ordering. How is that even possible? Do they have it pre-made in the back and it's just microwaved or something?

I had very high hopes for Monta, sadly...I will never return. Here are my reasons:

1. TOO SALTY. And even if you ask for less salty...you're still gonna feel bloated as shizz from the sodium.

2. Noodles are NO BUENO. They're like thin vermicelli noodles. I like my ramen noodles thick and with the right kinda chew!

3. My soft boiled egg got cold within minutes. Hmmmm :-|

4. Spicy means weaksauce-American-spicy to them.

5. Oh yes, and there's always a wait here too. Why, I have no clue...

Do yourself a favor. Go across the street to Ramen Sora and have a real bowl of delicious ramen. 

You can tell I was quite excited to sit down and enjoy my meal when I first got to Monta...check out my YouTube vlog for that weekend: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DhN4ggfu52w&list=UU5YaBtOxOYqeFEEQ_aW6JiA",7,4,5

The tonkotsu shoyu ramen w\/ chashu and green onions was okay. Added in the nitamago, hard boiled egg, which made the ramen that much more tasty! As other Yelpers mentioned, they use skinny noodles here...so less substance to chew on. The chashu was tender, although it was on the fattier side.

You do need to save some of your broth though because they will give you a bowl of noodles and that's it.

I ordered my Pork Ramen w\/out mushrooms and they placed the wrong bowls in front of us, my dinner companion was about to take a bite and the waitress like snagged it out from under him to swap ours around.  I couldn't even finish the whole thing. It has to be at least 3 cups of liquid, plus noodles and some very small bits of pork.  Get yours with the hard boiled egg. It's worth the other $1.50 or whatever it is they charge you, it was delicious.

Great for a cold day too!",7,3,6

When I found this place (through Yelp of course) I thought to myself, ""Could it be? A true authentic ramen place that the city I originally resided in devastatingly lacked of? My own little NYC Momofuku only a 15 minute drive away?"" OH, SWEET BABY JESUS IT COULD! 

Before making the trip to your next lunch or dinner date here, you should probably consider what day you're going and at what time. This place is SMALL, like 5 tables (2 4-tops, 3 2-tops) small with a couple seats at the bar, and it gets crazy packed! The first time I came here I literally drove by and was like, ""awh hailll noo,"" and drove away. HOWEVER I will say that if there's just a couple of people before you, just be patient and wait. The tables turn over rather quickly.

Which leads me to the menu. It's very simple and quick to prepare. If you're going with ramen, they have 4 different broth options: Shoyu (chicken), Tonkotsu (pork), Tonkotsu-shoyu (chicken & pork) and Miso. All are priced around 6.95 a bowl. Just forget the rest and go with the Tonkotsu-Shoyu. All ramens are prepared with two slices of pork, bamboo, and chopped green onion. Don't forget to add extra ingredients like an egg and mustard leaf! If you've never tried mustard leaf, it really compliments the broth and makes it extra delicious...order it on the side and try it out! Adding in the ingredients is what really gets the meal to be pricier than expected. Just 1 egg is an extra $1.75, but it's okay to indulge a little every now  and then, so just go all out with you bad ramen self! 

They have other items as well such as fried rice, small plates, and cold ramen! I still have yet to try them.. will do an update after my next visit! 

The only negative thing I'd have to say about the ramen is it can get pretty salty, of course you can mention to them less sodium, but I'm pretty sure all they're going to do is dilute it with hot water. To leave it on a positive note, aside from the saltiness the broth is PERFECTION. Extremely murky, so you know its packed with flavor and takes overnight cooking to prepare.",3,3,3

The entire menu fits on one page, which for those that like variety I would suggest you search somewhere else to cure your soul for that variety of ramen. For entertainment purposes though, my group started out with an order of their gyoza, which was made from scratch, and was very tasty. The texture was a bit crispy-like on the outside, and that's all that it took (I think) to make it that much tastier. The inside had that ""it's hot, but just right"" feel to make it warm up the insides.

Though really now, it's all about the ramen. Monta prepares ramen in a Japanese fashion, the importance on the soup base. I had the tonkatsu (pork) base with extras of corn, egg, nori (seaweed for those who don't know), and some extra tonkatsu. The broth was a little bit saltier than I would have liked it, but all in all it was a very good blend of flavors that would make anybody want to come back for more. (b^^)b

In terms of drinks, you want to avoid pretty much everything on the menu besides water. It's a ramen shop, so you really want to focus more on the awesomeness of ramen, but I'm a bit sad that there isn't hot tea; my group ordered tea thinking it was hot, but it comes in a can that's been sitting in a fridge. Not a big letdown, but on a cold day in Las Vegas (those do exist) it would be nice to have a cup of hot tea to go with the ramen.

Atmosphere wise, everything resembles your typical Japanese ramen shop. The music adds a nice touch, but really it's the small, cramped family-like atmosphere that gives it that ramen shop touch. It's definitely good for those who want to catch up with one another or a small group of people looking for somewhere to eat; that's the atmosphere that was created.

All in all, a very good experience and if you want to eat some good legitimate Japanese style ramen, Monta is the place you want to go. (b^^)b",2,0,1

I'm not a food critic in any way but comparing it to Sora, I can notice a lot of differences. One is well Sora doesn't have Tonkotsu Shoyu in the menu. But with Monta's serving I was quite disappointed. The broth felt greasy and almost instantly left a line of fat\/grease on my lips. Although it is good, certain people don't like that feeling when eating. It is creamy and rich but Minus points on the grease. The pork on the Ramen Bowl is only one slice hidden behind bamboo shoots and mushrooms. If I didn't dig through the bowl I wouldn't have even found it. The noodles were okay, but it felt like as if they were just about cooked when the chef took it out from the pot. It felt as if it needed about a minute more in cooking. The server was very nice, refilling our water glasses almost every time we downed a glass. So fast it felt like she was on a mission. The Chasu Bowl was very good however, the shredded Nori on top was surprising and the meat was tender and tasty. It was sweet on the outside part of the cut just how Chasu should taste like.

So anyways. This place is located next a Korean BBQ and Raku. Makes me wonder if it's the same owner as Raku? 

The ramen is okay. Anyone that has had the standard of ramen (Daikokuya in LA, hello?) will tell you that Monta isn't as good, but for Vegas, it'll do. 

Monta only does three kinds of ramen: tonkatsu, shoyu, and miso (around $7-8). All are decent. The menu has short descriptions of each for us gaijin. There is also a short list of accouterment like egg, butter, corn, and spring onions available for nominal additional costs. I recommend the butter. It is exquisite. 

The very limited menu has gyoza, mini mentaiko (around $3), kim chi fried rice (not very good). Sometimes they have specials written on the white board on the wall. 

On the front of the menu, there's a short history of ramen. The reading lists the source: ramenlicious.com

They have a few beers including Asahi and something domestic, maybe Bud. My friend got a $3 glass of Asahi. It was like a double shot of beer.  

They do NOT make their own noodles, at least not on the day we came. 

The unisex bathroom is practical and has a weird interior design nonsensicalness to it. Meh. 

The joint is pretty small. A bar that accommodates eight and maybe five four-tops. 

All of the staff is Japanese. One of the cooks looks hardcore prison cook with the burns all up and down his forearm. Heck yeah. 

The restaurant is small and will possibly never have air conditioning. But there is a plethora of fans running and the back door remains open on the hottest of days. When some one opens the front door to leave or enter, the joint turns into a wind tunnel. 

They're only open til 11p. I'm sure they could stay open later and do just fine with the late night belligerent crowd. ""Whoo, I'm so wasted! I need lots of calories in my system. Whoo!""

Watch Tampopo.

I'm struggling giving it another star because I noticed somethings in the 20 minutes I was there to make you go hmmmm.  You heard me 20 minutes to get in, order a shoyu ramen and asahi and get out.  Can't beat that for efficiency.

Menu is straight and to the point, if you are not here for Ramen, go somewhere else.  Broths are Tonkatsu, Shoyu, and Miso.  Shoyu is the base for me (kinda like vanilla ice cream).  Soup comes standard with a few thin slices of roast pork, green onions, bamboo shoots, and some seaweed.  The noodles were decent but not homemade, very stock machine made ramen.  I like my ramen al dente, these were not.  I did add the pat of butter for $.50 which was a nice addition, but totally over priced.

Sat at the bar so had full view of kitchen and how things were prepared.  Didn't like how the cooks did not sanitize very well, bare hands on food doesn't bother me, but when you grab an egg and some  pork slices, I'd like to see you wash them hands before moving on to the next order.  Also noticed their Kim Chee was out of a bottle, which they could have done a better job at concealing if they kept it towards the back.

I usually order the miso or tonkatsu ramen.... until I decided to order the ""cold"" ramen noodles on an extremely hot & sunny day. 
The cold noodles have been the only disappointment I've experienced at Monta. Even my sister, who lived in Japan for 3 years, said the cold noodles were different from what she's had before. 
However, she did say Monta was just like the traditional noodle houses in Japan!

I agree with some reviewers.... at times, the broth has been on the saltier side. But that hasn't stopped me from returning on a regular basis.

It took me some time to finally try this place. For one, I didn't know of its existence until after it was open for some time, and I had a hard time finding it. It is inside of a plaza where I had a hard time locating it, but you just have to make sure you make the turn into the plaza or the little street next to the plaza.

My friends that have tried Monta beforehand liked it enough where I had some expectations for this place. It didn't have to be rated G-A-F, but it had to be tasty. The first time I came, I just got a bowl of their tonkatsu ramen and I must say, I was one happy guy afterwards. The noodles were pretty good, their egg made me happy, their pork melted in my mouth, but the broth is what impressed me. The broth was probably my favorite part about the meal. Needless to say, I finished the whole bowl, soup and all! I was really happy. 

The next few times I came, I started customizing and ordering different things on the menu. I added more noodles the next few times, got some of their fried rice, gyoza, added some corn to my soup, just customizing things to the point where I was happy! Their fried rice was pretty tasty. The kimchi fried rice may not be for everyone, because unless you like kimchi, you may not like it. Adding various things to your ramen makes it takes a lot better and funner to eat since it has more color and just the feeling of being able to customize your food just makes it that much better. 

If you want to try some ramen and you're in the area, I highly recommend Monta. The only downside is that the restaurant is fairly small and during peak hours, you should expect a wait. People get turned away from places that have waits, but if you think about it, why do they have waits? It is small, but people keep going back because the food is delicious, it's as simple as that.",1,0,0

Monta Ramen rivals among the best ramen joints in the US. For the locals who think that this place is just aiteeeee, I'm jealous of y'all! The black garlic tonkotsu is just dripping with richness and FLAVOR - one of the best bowls I've ever had. The spicy tonkotsu, while also great, is my second favorite - flavor wise, it is comparable to Ippudo's akamaru modern. My first bite into the perfectly firm al dente noodles put me on cloud nine.

Today, I keep coming back expecting their classic ramen, best broth, and perfected simplicity. But I now must admit all I have come to expect is disappointment. I have been coming here for about 2-3 years. But now I can't help but second guess my decisions. 

The service here has seemed to have gone down the drain. They give so much attitude and don't really care about the customers. You are rushed to order and if you have any problems or questions you are met with eye rolls and sighs. I'm not a picky eater, not at all, but service is key. 

Now to the food. I remember the food they used to have was great. Unfortunately that didn't seem to translate over time. Like watching the slow death of a once great king, the food quality has seemed to die too.  Over salty broth, oily broth, boiled gyoza, and an appalling meat to rice ratio on their side dishes. What happened? WHAT HAPPENED? 

To this I'm sorry Monta... You have lost me. I used to defend you feverishly against other ramen places but now... You have betrayed me. So to all you newbies that rave and praise this ""new"" monta. You can have it. I will leave this place in the past.",7,5,4

We came here on a Friday afternoon during lunch hour. There was a 9 top wait in front of us, but the line moved quickly. There is a sign in system so be sure to get your name and number in your party written down on the clipboard by the hostess podium. They will call your name out when there's a table ready. 

The place is TINY! Maybe 8 bar stools by the ramen bar, and 10 tables. 

They blast top 40 which creates an odd ambiance, the waitresses are hurried and harried. Case in point: we tried to place our orders when the waitress brought us our water to which point she said she couldn't take our orders right now. She appears when she's ready to take our orders and when we ordered the gyoza appetizer, she screams it to the kitchen. She wrote down the rest of our ramen orders.

We ordered the Tonkatsu and Miso ramen. I made mine spicy ($1 extra). The Tonkatsu is pork broth based, while the Miso was pork and chicken soup base. They were both flavorful and contained green onions, roughly two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage. I say roughly because the chashu were very thin and mostly fat, therefore dissolving in our ramen. The spicy I added to my ramen was not mixed into the broth, instead it was a goop that sat on top of the ramen along with my toppings. It tasted like the Korean Gochujang chili pastes, and did not compliment the flavor of the ramen. 

There were no service on the remainder of our dining experience, I'm not sure if this is because it's more of a casual counter service\/semi-table service. 

If you've ever had Santouka Ramen in Arlington Heights or any where else, I do believe they are the superior ramen shop.

It's so good, for the longest time, Monta was my comfort restaurant. I remember after I thought I failed my SATs, I immediately drove to Monta and ordered not one, but two bowls of ramen and gleefully slurped them up. 

After I got rejected from what I thought was my dream college, I drove to Monta and ordered another two bowls of ramen. 

I'm not sure what it is about this restaurant (maybe it's the price? cheap food is my favorite hehe) but something about this place, the simplistic menu, and the wonderful prices make this a must-go every time I'm home. I love everything on the menu, and you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Whenever my friends come visit me, I always drag them to Monta at least once.

I can't recommend this place enough - it's not just the nostalgia that gets me, but the really wonderful, affordable bowl of piping hot ramen that always manages to hit the spot. 

Warning: It does get REALLY packed, but I find that going for an early lunch at around 11-12 or early dinner (like 4-6) is usually a safe time. 

*I also always order the extra side of noodles for $1.50 for an even more satisfying meal, so make sure you save enough soup for that! 

*I also love the shopping center Monta is located in - it makes grabbing a sweet dessert after really convenient.

As soon as we arrived, a waitress came to get drinks order from us. When we got drinks the other waitress came to our table  in a minute after and tried to get orders. even though, we didn't have enough time to order, we tried not to take so long time. Since three of us are working as server in japanese restaurants for while. For sure, we weren't taking lots of  time to order. but this waitress was giving us mean look and had negative attitude.

We ordered pork belly rice, fried rice, one pot sticker, two tonkotsu shoyu ramen with egg, one miso ramen with egg, and one miso ramen without egg. Cook made a mistake and  put an egg on both of miso ramen. It was totally fine with us because sometimes people make mistakes. Moreover, we got an free egg, but the problem was waitress's attitude. 
I definitely remeber that she never apologized to us but said that ""chef made a mistake, you guys can have it"" and turned around and left. 
That happening embrassed everyone of us and we thought we did something wrong to server or etc. 

After we all finished our meal, she just ""dropped"" check on our table. We tried to split in five ways, but we left four cards on a bill and talked to each other that ""we gotta leave maximum 2 or 3cards.... Its too much"" and so on. But this mean look waitress came to us and saw four cards stacked on a bill ( actually, we had five people in a group but one person did not left her card on a bill, so total we left four cards at the first place ) And said 10 bucks minimum to swipe and go throw, understand?? With annoying face Then left

We TOTALLY all felt insulted and humiliated.Qh

Because our total was 53.xx dollars which means we can leave all five cards to split and she was the one who dropped a bill on our table. ( we assumed that she knows about the total. ) she just did not like to split five cards and mentioned it to us to do less work. 

So, I know it was really mean to do it ( we know this is very annoying when servers get more than 3 cards to split ) but we left five cards on a bill, but while she was working on our bill, my friend said that she is keep staring at us. ( i was sitting toward windows so i actually couldnt see that ) 

I normally leave 20-30% tip whenever i get enough service and qualified food, but i told my friends to leave 0 tip and i left 0 tip too. 

As soon as, we left restaurant the other waitress came to us and asked ""something wrong with service?"" 
I replied ""i didnt like the service"" 
I expected her to ask ""such as??"" or what did you guys dislike about ? 

BUT she said ""ok bye"" and went back to the restaurant. 

Ok bye bye. I never gonna recommend this restaurant for my life and also my friends will not. 
I will definitely gonna tell anybody who wants to visit here that this restaurant has the poorest service. 

YOU waitress ! (I know one day you will read this and remind about us ) 
I also work as a server in japanese restaurant and sometimes you can not provide service to cusotmers as normal. But shaking head in front of customers while you saw 5 cards stacked on a bill??  and staring at customers while spliting five bills?? Really??

Thanks to one of my friends' extended knowledge, we decided to grab ramen in Chinatown at her favorite place, Monta. The shop isn't particularly big and I guess people heard about the hype so there can be a 20-40 minute wait a lot of the time. 

I got the tonkatsu ramen and the base price is such a great deal at just $6.75. I added corn for $1 extra and my friend and I also shared the fried rice. You also have to purchase green tea and it comes hot in a can (so interesting). Still, after all that, our total was $32 after tax which is such a great deal!

Everytime we order the ramen, we will pay $2.5 for 4 more pieces of the chashu because it is just so good. For the chashu bowl, i think it's soso because the chashu is fried. Therefore it's not as good as those that are in the ramen. And i think the pork belly bowl is soso too, nothing special about it. For the fried rice, I think it tastes good and smells good. I had only tried the ""fried rice"". I didnt try the one with kimchi and veggie. And for the gyoza, I think it is okay. Nothing special about it too.

This place is so small! For how busy it always is, I feel like they need to invest in a bigger location. When my friends and I got here the line was out the door. 6 groups of 4 ahead of us and a full house cramped with people. The only reason we stayed and waited was because my friends were really craving ramen. If you really want Monta Ramen, try the location on Eastern and Serene (Next to EOS). That place isn't as busy as this one!

The ramen was good, portion was generous which is why I'm even giving this place 2 stars. I also ordered gyoza and it tasted like it was the frozen kind you buy from the store. I suspected that because it was still cold in the middle and because they were all stuck together. Im guessing they half assed cooking it because it was busy. 

Their condiments on their table (soy sauce, chili sauce, vinegar, gyoza sauce) weren't labeled and when my friend picked up the vinegar, the lid opened and spilled it all over the table. It seemed full so I'm guessing whoever refilled it didn't close the lid properly. 

Lastly, I felt rushed. I couldn't enjoy my food because I felt like the servers where just walking robots trying to get everyone in and out. 

Because of all these things, I probably won't come to this location again especially if there's another location more convenient and less hectic.",4,3,0

At first I was hesitant seeing as I have had plenty of ramen in Vegas.  They are good but not what  I was expecting.  When he had said the name Monta, I was relieved to know that this was not a place I had previously eaten at which is surprising seeing as I have eaten at plenty of ramen places.

When pulling up into the lot you would have to look for it seeing as Monta is a pretty tiny place.  This is definitely one of those places where you would have to hear about.  One of those hole in the wall places.

Once you walk in you are greeted warmly by the staff and the cozy environment.  You can see the kitchen and the workers all hard at work trying to fill the mouths of its many customers.  One thing I have to say about this place, and I have eaten here many times, prepare to wait a bit for there is usually a line because of how delicious this place is.

Once seated there will be a small menu with now four types of ramen you can choose from.  A tonkotsu base ramen which is pork based, shoyu which is soy based, tonkotsu-shoyu which is a mix of the two, and miso which is bean paste based.  They also have side items which you can put into your ramen like corn and eggs which are a pretty much a must.  The portions are also very generous and you will get that good fill feeling.

I have personally eaten them all and can vouch for them all.  They are all so good.  Monta is like the In-N-Out of ramen.  They specialize in ramen and boy, do they deliver.  This is now one of the only ramen places I will go to eat.  A very cheap and delicious way to spend with friends or even eat at by yourself.

Staff was friendly and prompt to take orders to which they were seated thorough the ramen house. While waiting to order we had the seat next to the kitchen. It was artful to see the chef prepare the ramen bowls for the orders. A process to insure the bowls were clean. A process to make all bowls of an order. A process to continue the broth and insure each bowl is consistent irregardless of when made. Chef tasted the broths as being made so nothing would be off. Chef insured all ramen noodles were consisted from each bowl. 

My order was the Tonkotsu shoyo ramen garlic pork added egg. Others in my group ordered the black ramen and one substituted their protein for chicken. The order didn't take long for the ramen master to artfully prepare and have wait staff deliver. The broth was made from pork or chicken.

The dishes arrived with the noodles, protein, broth, spices, vegetables, and spoons all fashionably placed in the bowl. With those who added egg, the egg was sitting on top. Tender noodles through. Broth was well layered and spicy in it's own. I still added some because I love the kick. Cha shu was not overly fatty. Egg was more cooked than I like. I enjoyed the bowl. I left no broth.

She gives me hot water, I add half the bowl and it was still salty.  Disgusting. 

She didn't even come back to ask if it was okay until after I was done with the whole thing!  Good job lady.  Yeah I finished the whole bowl but it was still salty.

I've tried the shoyu, shoyu-tonkatsu, and tonkatsu ramen and hands down I like the rich fatty tonkatsu broth the best! However, I'm not a big fan of the thin noodles that come standard with that option....because the noodles become less than al dente as I work my way down the bowl.  To fix this little issue, I have them swap out the noodles for the miso or ""curly"" noodles to ensure al dente goodness.  The charsiu (pork) slices are one of the best parts of the ramen....it only comes with two slices....so make sure you order extra if you like meat :) As for the little extra bottles of goodies on the table....I always add the chili oil, sesame seeds, togarashi (red pepper flakes), and the garlic paste.... pickled ginger is also available but too strong in flavor for my taste.  Also, for the big carb loaders out there...make sure you save some soup at the end...you can request extra noodles for less than $2.  

Although the ramen is good relative to Vegas....better than Ichiza, Shuseki, Anime ramen, Yokohama kaigenro...it won't compare to the ramen places like Ipuddo in NYC.

Only negative notes are that sometimes the broth is too salty...and they want you to eat and go...so you'll have to find somewhere else to hang out after you are in a food coma...my recommendation is to venture over to Wendy's noodle and order the mango tapioca dessert with coconut milk...for a nice finish to lunch.

Luckily, service and cook time are quick, so I have never had to wait more than fifteen minutes or so for a table or spot even when it's crowded.  

Monta is a small, hole in the wall ramen place.  There are three kinds of seating: booth, table and bar stools.  If you're eating solo or you have a small party, you'll probably get seated more quickly because the individual bar stools will open up.  Additionally, so they can keep the flow going and keep wait times down, you'll have to sign in on a sheet, and they won't seat you until your entire party is present.  From the bar, you can see the crew in the kitchen cooking the meals.

On to the food.  I normally order the Tonkot-Shoyu (mixed broth of the Tonkotsu and Shoyu) with corn and nori (dried seaweed), and add in some chili oil and spices from the table set.  The soup itself comes with chashu pork, bamboo shoots, kikarage (black mushrooms) and green onion.  I've tried ramen at two other locations (one in the Galleria mall in Henderson, and the other was Anime Ramen) and this is definitely my favorite spot to go.  The noodles have just the right amount of chewiness, the broth is flavorful but not overpowering, and the chashu is tender, melt in your mouth goodness.  

I have also tried the pork belly bowl and gyoza, and both are pretty good.  I wish they had a different sauce for the gyoza, but soy sauce mixed with vinegar and a little chili oil works just fine.  I've only discovered this place in the last year, but I can honestly say it's become one of my go-to restaurants and it's definitely a comfort food.  Prices are more expensive than your fifty cent package of Top Ramen, but it's still cheap for a restaurant at under ten dollars an entree.

There tables are only made to seat 4 at most, and even though there was an empty table and the one next to it had just paid and was ready to leave, instead of waiting 5 minutes and seating us THEY SAT THE EMPTY TABLE. After we had already been WAITING FOR 45 MINUTES, they again wanted us to wait for two tables to clear out at the same time. Not gonna lie, I lost my s***.  Then, to try and make it up to us they tried to offer us bar seats (after I made it perfectly clear in the beginning that we wanted a table) and we just picked up and left. Apparently bringing more than 4 people and asking for a table is too complicated for the waitresses to handle and caused their brains to melt.

Other than that, I have never had a problem with their service there and their ramen is the best I have ever had. Even my half Japanese cousin (who is from Tokyo) said that it's the closest to Japanese ramen you can get in the states. It's always crowded now (a testament to how good it is) so be prepared to wait. But the wait is usually not too long since they get people in and out as fast as they can.

Finding this place by searching on Yelp I really did not expect what I found.  The food here is absolutely awesome.  I could say all of the things that everyone else uses to describe the food here but for me it wouldn't be enough.  I have taken detours from cross country driving just to come here.  To me it is worth losing a day of travel time just to enjoy their food.  Recently my Dentist informed me that he had a 3 day conference in LV so I directed him to Monta.  When he came back he told me it was so good that he ate there 6 times in 3 days which means he had lunch and dinner there for 3 days in a row.  If that isn't proof of how totally awesome Monta is then nothing is.  For me it is as good as any I have had the pleasure of enjoying though I do personally consider it the best.  I have nothing against the Ramen in Japan as that is considered the mecca of ramen but Monta seems to have come from a back alley of Tokyo and shines much brighter.  At this very moment I am craving a bowl but just cannot run to Vegas right now but I would if I could because it is that good.,0,0,0

And this place is probably the best ramen we've had, perhaps second to Totto ramen.  Their tonkotsu- shoyu ramen is awesome, I love the mix of the pork and chicken flavors.  They cook the noodles just right, and of course, the pork is to die for.  I also love how cheap the ramen is.

I went for lunch on a Sunday and arrived right before the place opened.  There was a line, but when the doors opened, there were just enough tables for everyone who was waiting.  Service was friendly and quick.

Broth: The tonkotsu broth was relatively creamy and flavorful.  Not the best I've ever had, but it was definitely the best part of my bowl.
Noodles: I wasn't impressed. I expected hand-made or at least fresh noodles; mine were either over cooked or not the freshest.
Pork: Quite good. Fatty, how it's best served.
Egg: Thumbs down for this barely seasoned egg.

And let me tell you, after that first sip of the soup and the first snap of the fresh noodles, I was instantly transported back to Japan. Even for just a fleeting moment, I forgot all about the hustle and bustle of day to day life here and was ""home"" for the duration of a bowl or ramen.

But for the Las Vegas area, this has been the best place to get my ramen fix. 

The broth is super fresh and clean, not filled with like oils and things like that. The meat is super soft, which just melts in your mouth. The noodles are just how I like them, RAMEN noodles. 

One bowl is enough to satisfy your hunger. 

Now to mention the wait - my family and I waited 50 minutes for ramen noodles. Factoring that in, it was not worth it. The waitress even let back people who ""left"" from the waiting list, and came back! That's not what a waiting list does, if a party leaves, they are off the list.

What sets Monta apart from the others I've tried is the deliciously rich pork bone soup base that you know has been simmering for hours on end.

I travel very frequently & always try to seek out the best Ramen \/ noodle houses in the cities I visit often as I'm a noodle junkie. I don't know why it took me so long to find Monta, though I'm really happy I did as I'm in Vegas every other week. 

Firstly, the greeting and staff are extremely friendly - which really surprised me in a positive way considering Monta is located in Chinese town (an area I typically expect to be underwhelmed by service). Very attentive and happy - I left in such a better mood than I arrived!

I sat at the comfortable wooden bar & ordered the Miso Ramen with extra chashu. It was nice to watch the 2 cooks prepare the bowls ordered before mine as it was immediately clear that they were dedicated to the quality of preparation, ingredients and timing to ensure their guests received a perfect serving. In between orders I watched one cook prep and truss the pork for slow roasting & was impressed with the skill.

My bowl arrived as a perfect portion & nicely presented. I only added a dash or two of the toasted sesame seeds & a dash of the chili powder that were part of a good array of seasonings available to personalize the noodles to your taste. I like that.

The broth was truly wonderful: rich and creamy while carrying a fresh pork flavor. Noodles were nicely cooked, although a little thinner than I find my favorite to be (Santouka still purveys the finest noodle I have come across). The definite star of the bowl were the delicate and chashu slices that pinch perfectly into the grip of the chopsticks! The flavor, texture, and quality of this moist pork is truly superb.

Suffice to say that Monta has immediately become a favorite here in Vegas; a city where the experience usually fails to measure up to the hype.

If you're feeling ramen, this is (so far), the best place. Growing up in Japan, ramen has been the comfort food for me whenever I'm out and about with family, friends, or by myself. I only knew of 2 other locations here in Vegas when I used to live here and since I left and came back, this popped out of nowhere and it blew me away. Their ramen is perfect. From the texture of the noodles, the amount they serve and the flavor of the broth, it's just perfect. It's also the first time I've been to a ramen shop where you can choose exactly what type of toppings you want. I chose eggs, nori, and pork. The pork and the egg definitely is the perfect toppings I've ever tasted on ramen. The amount of fat and the flavor of the pork was magnificent. The egg was just perfect where the yolk had a creamy texture in the center and the whites had a slight salty flavor to it that just blew me away and mixed very well with the broth (I had the Tonkatsu broth). As for the restaurant itself, It's clean inside. It has a mom and pop feel so it didn't feel fully sterile like an apple store would which I don't mind. It felt very home-e. I felt like I was really in Japan, minus the radio blasting in the background. I think I heard One Direction and some other pop music play. It shouldn't bother you though if you love\/hate it because trust me, the ramen will be so good you're not gonna care. Customer service was really fast. I walked in and was greeted and seated right away. I ordered and I'd say 3 or 4 minutes later, I get my bowl. Once I finished my water, (BAM!) refilled. Portions I'd say is just right.

We wanted to get some curry, but the place we wanted to go to was closed during lunch hours. So with my trusty Yelp app, we decided to search what was popular around the vicinity. Monta Ramen was the first thing that popped up in our search, so we headed there.

As we arrived, there was a small line formed outside the building. Typical for a well known ramen spot. We added our name to the wait list and had about a fifteen minute wait. Once we were called, we sat around the prep area. Our server handed us our menus and gave my cousin some recommendations on their popular dishes. As for myself, I already knew what I was going to get.

I decided to the the miso based ramen, which includes some basic ingredients:

- Green onions 
- Two slices of chashu
- Bamboo shoots
- Kikurage

There are extras you can add to your ramen, pricing varies. I got the following extras:  

- Butter
- Corn
- Extra side of noodles
- Nori
- Soft boiled egg

Our ramens came out fairly quickly after placing our orders. As quickly as they were served, they remained piping hot! The presentation was nicely put together. I mixed all the ingredients in the bowl and took my first sip of the broth. The broth was very tasty. The addition of the butter gave the broth a creamy taste. The noodles were soft and easy to chew. The hard boiled egg was perfectly cooked to my liking with the runny yolk. The chashu seemed a little dry, but still tasted great.

Overall, a great experience and comparable to some of my favorite ramen spots in the Bay Area.",2,2,3

Drive off strip just for the Tonkotsu and although it was good, Jinya beats it which is a above average ramen place. Definitely not as good as the ramen I had in LA but the hole in the wall look of the place had its appeal. Food was good and a nice break from high prices on the strip. 

I noticed they had oolong tea so I assumed it may be Chinese owned and so I asked for a Tsingtao (one of my favorite beers) and the waitress said ""This a Japanese restaurant, no Chinese beer .

Whether it's 10 minutes for lunch or a 30-60 minute wait for dinner, your olfactory glands, umami super sensors and full warm belly will thank you profusely. 

I am a massive fan of the basic tonkotsu, always with a nitamago (soft boiled, soy sauce-seasoned egg), with a spicy iteration thrown in the routine every so often. I am also slightly obsessed with their kimchi fried rice, on which I pile on pink pickled ginger. They should probably start charging me for the pickled ginger, as I definitely take advantage of the free-for-paying-customers-with-the-notion-it-will-be-used-sparingly jar of the condiment\/dish enhancer. $2.95 Asahi on tap??

The wait staff is well trained and are very alert to what is taking place around the restaurant.  Unfortunately, the ramen is not up to par.  Instead of a slightly thicker and more al dente bowl of noodles, my was softer and more closely resembled the thinner egg noodles one might find in Cantonese soup noodle entrees.

We ordered the tradition tonkotsu ramen ($6.95) as well as the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen ($6.95).  Both were good but the tradition tonkotsu was what really caught our attention. The broth was really good. Smooth, creamy and a tad salty.  

The noodles were perfectly cooked and tasted great.

The meat was also above average. Tender with a good amount of fat.  

We also added an egg to our bowls and we were so glad we did. It was cooked correctly with the right amount of creaminess to it.

It's the best ramen we've had since our trip back from japan.

In addition to the ramen bowls, we ordered a mini pork belly bowl which was good enough to steal our attention from the ramen. The pork belly was thinly cut, which makes it a lot easier to eat with the rice. It's a great side to order if you visit.

As for the staff they were friendly, maybe a little bit overwhelmed. The cook didn't look happy at all for some reason but he was still churning out some great food so we can't complain!

It's not even ""pretty good"" ramen. It's simply decent. I came on a weekday for lunch and there were several people waiting outside for a table. This noodle shop is tiny. Luckily, it was only my boyfriend and me so we snatched two seats at the bar. I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen while he had the Tonkotsu Ramen with an egg. 

Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen - pork and chicken broth with two slices of pork chashu, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and a pile of green onions. The broth was extremely salty, especially compared to my boyfriend's broth. The noodles were rather springy but they were still acceptable. Half of the pork chashu was fat so there was actually very little meat.

Tonkotsu Ramen - pork broth with two slices of pork chashu, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and a pile of green onions. My boyfriend added an egg which was soft-boiled so the white was cooked through, but the yolk remained molten. He thought his ramen was OK (and he's a ramen fanatic!). The broth fell flat (although not as salty as mine).

The flavors here aren't very compelling. The portions are generous considering a bowl is about $7 and the noodles come out pipin' hot. The restaurant is quite small so I was feeling a bit claustrophobic. That, coupled with the relentless Las Vegas heat, made me want to bolt outta there the second I was done slurping my noodles.

Me and my wife are lucky to get a table after about 45 minutes of wait with about 6 parties waiting in front of us for dinner (by the way, you will need to check yourself in as there are only 2 very busy waitresses). The menu was very simple - noodle, fried rice or some small variety of specialty. There are flyers if 2 today's special pasted on the wall, which we ordered - spicy tonkotsu ramen. We also ordered a mini mentaiko bowl (basically some fish eggs with sesame over small bowl of rice). I would not say it is super delicious, but it is really worth the price. The ramen was very flavorful (can be a little salty). You also have the option to add another noodle if you still feel hungry after you finish the bowl - I think most people will do since there was actually not much noodle in it.

I don't come for the customer service, I come for their delicious food, but I haven't had a bad customer service experience until yesterday. 

We were in a group of 6 and being waiting on by a waitress named Sanchi or Sachi, she quickly took our orders but didn't repeat or confirm the orders which is what I'm used to. When the food arrived at the table, two of our orders were incorrect. When we told her about it, she looked concerned and then curtly said something along the lines of ""order it right next time"". I was a little stunned by that, but because there is usually a language barrier with the staff there I brushed it off. I wanted to talk to the waitress again, to let her know if it was a problem, just add the two incorrect orders in our bill. I looked around and saw our waitress with another waitstaff named Archer looking at our table and talking\/ laughing-- that didn't rub me the right way, and on top of that we didn't get checked in on until Archer came to the table to basically take over for Sanchi\/Sachi, I'm guessing she asked him to take over. I explained our experience to Archer, and he was as kind as someone trying to mitigate a customer service complaint could be in that situation. 

My take away was feeling insulted, but lesson learned, if you're in a big party or just in general, ask the waitress to repeat your order in there-- they usually do, but it happened yesterday that our waitress didn't, and it's loud and busy in that restaurant almost all the time. Again, the food is amazing, I don't go for the customer service.

I have been a regular here at Monta Ramen for quite some time and have been recommending this noodle house for many. 

Pros: Monta Ramen provides a traditional Japanese style ambiance with transparent view in kitchen that portrays confidence and quality in its product. Monta's Tonkatsu style ramen is delicious and perfectly prepared. The broth never gets old and is always ready to fulfill. Monta offers perfectly balanced side dishes (fried rice, gyoza, etc) and options to upgrade ramen dishes.  Service is quick and generally helpful. 

Cons: The size of the restaurant is small and can be an issue when hosting larger parties. The wait time especially during prime hours (lunch and dinner) can be an issue. All parties must be present upon seating. Be weary of writing your name down on the clipboard; my party got overlooked recently and the host sat three parties before mine.

As I pulled into the parking lot a bum approached the front of my car and stopped me, he asked me to roll down my window, I could smell the alcohol coming off his breath mixed with the smell of unwashed body... after explaining to me that he ""wasn't lying and telling the truth"" and needed three dollars to get on a bus to take his ""kid' (pointing at a wall where no one was) home I told him I had no cash... after staring at me for a moment deciding what to do about that I cut him off and told him to have a good day and good luck... and then proceeded to try to find a new parking spot as someone went around me and took the good parking spot that I was aiming for before I was approached by said bum!......

I have read reviews and you really don't understand how small this place is from reading them. the size of the bedroom... I mean... their dining area... is smaller then the size of my master bedroom.... You could not fit two king sized beds in the main dining room area. after getting over that shock, I signed in and proceeded to wait. after about 20 minutes four people from the bar area left and I was seated...

Now I'm a bigger dude. I push about 290 on a good day and the stool i was on was uncomfortable and flimsy but for some miracle it didn't break!

I ordered a mini Mentaiko and a Tonkotsu Ramen. The Mentaiko was actually very tasty, those eggs do give a good spicy kick, but once I mixed everything up with the rice and added some soy sauce it wasn't long before it was gone.

The Ramen was flavorful , I added more chashu pork, nitamago (hard boiled egg) and nori to the bowl when I ordered. The broth had a ton of flavor to it. I really did like it. however, I noticed that the noodles are pre-packaged and did not have any sustenance to them they were a little bit of a let down and I wasn't really into them but they didn't take away from, nor add anything of value to the soup broth itself. 

The Chashu Pork was melt in your mouth good. I don't think it was worth the extra 2.95 for the extra two paper thin slices though. however, the extra cost for the 1.50 for the egg was definitely worth it and to be honest, the server I had was actually really nice and she worked really hard to make sure everyone was happy which I really liked to see. after paying in cash...  I ended up getting most of it to go and I just finished the last bit of it while writing this review... (for some reason after re-heating it actually tastes more flavorful! that's kinda odd)...

I would recommend giving Monta at least a try... it's not spectacularly good but it's good enough that I'd come back and try some of the other broths.. I have been to Ichiza for Ramen too. (just up the road from this place heading east) and if I had to compare the both I'd say that Monta comes out on top in terms of the quality of the broth... if I could get Monta Broth with Ichiza Noodles it'd probably be the perfect bowl of Ramen.

I've subtracted 1 star for just how small this place is and the fact that if you go by yourself you'll pretty much be forced to sit on the uncomfortable stools that promise either a fun trip to the ground if they break or a sore ass by the time you're done. I also subtracted 1 star because I didn't particularly care for their noodles.

In fact, it's pretty much all they serve. Their menu reminded me of an In-N-Out menu: You either order a tonkotsu ramen or a miso ramen. If you don't want ramen, there's fried rice and some basic Japanese apps. Not much in terms of variety. But, if this is what you're in the mood for, they do it great.

I started off with an order of gyoza for an app. Simple stuff and what you'd expect. Nothing to write home about. Then, came the steamy bowl of tonkotsu ramen. The broth was a real winner here. A lot of places that I have tried never really got the broth quite right. This was one place where the flavor really hit the spot. Even though it's a scorching 100+ degrees outside, a routine stop for a bowl of ramen here is worth having. Next time I drop by, I will probably give their fried rice a shot.

Growing up in Japan with a Chinese family, I know what good ramen tastes like and they're decent but when they're busy the noodles are hard (not cooked long enough) which I hate, they have to be consistant! And on top of that I can't eat the charsui without getting sick which then it's game over for me for the day, so it usually ends with me giving it away to someone. 

So like I said, when it's busy they're not that consistant because they're trying to keep up with the demand and not be slow, but it shows in their cooking. I always get gyoza with my ramen and would feel weird if I didn't! Something I've done since I was a little child, besides the pair together taste great! 

The soup base itself is light as it should be, though sometimes I feel it's a bit salty (maybe my Asian taste buds were a little too active then, but it's good. Also depends on the one you want, I'm pretty traditional and don't stray from the shoyu (soy sauce base). The noodles is a hit and miss, since they're usually busy and rarely not, though I like going when most people aren't eating, the noodle can be either perfect or too hard for me. People like their noodles differently and not many places give you an option (very few in Japan do), but like I said hit and miss usually it's okay. 

Outside of their regular toppings you can add extra stuff like corn, butter, green onions, etc for some extra costs which isn't much at all! They also have kaedame which is a second helping of noodles, but you need to leave some soup base and not drink it if you're going to do that.

Overall the price for what you get is decent and not too bad especially comparing it to places in Japan. My only complaint is that the charsui gets me sick every time I've eaten it and since I've stopped it's been okay.",1,1,1

It has earn the reputation of being the best place in town for ramen).  Due to all of your rave reviews I was compelled to give this place a try.  (I can just hear my dad saying, ""if everyone jumped off a cliff would you jump too?  If it were into a yummy ocean of noodle soup, hell yeah!)

This little gem is hidden a bit back from the road and does not have a huge eye catching front.  It modestly blends in with the rest of the shops.  As you enter you will be greeted by the cooks, servers, and maybe a few customers.  It is a simple small noodle shop fighting the Vegas Heat with a weak AC system and a multitude of fans.  Was it warm?  Yes sir, very much so.  But my good friend told me, that regardless of the heat we should endure and it would be worth it.

We sat at the rotating wooden stools at a lovely solid one piece of wood bar.  Service was immediate and friendly.  I found the very short menu to be a relief from the pages and pages of food offerings of other establishments.  I often have trouble deciding what to eat, and then leave with regrets if I did not enjoy my meal.  Neither would be the case today.  I have heard a hero of mine speak of restaurants that only make one thing, but they make it better than anyone else around.  I hoped for a similar experience.

I quickly decided on the Tonkotsu Ramen with tamago, chashu, mustard cabbage, and green onions.  I noticed from everyone's pictures that many of us decided on the exact same combination.  Great minds think alike right?  

A few minutes later a large hot bowl of aroma and color found its way to me.  I dug in and didn't stop till the bowl was tilting to my face and the last drops of soup were tickling my tongue.  I love the thinner noodles over udon, so I am a bit biased here.  The noodles where not over cooked for my taste and the broth had great flavor.  The Chashu I got was soft and delicious.  Everything just seemed to go together perfectly.

If I were judging this restaurant against all noodle places in vegas, 5 stars.  But since I have had some outstanding noodles in California that I set my standards by, I'll give this 4.  Don't get me wrong, this place is great, and I will be back, but I am saving the 5 star rating for a place I love in California.

I am not a ramen expert by any means but I have had it before, and for me, this place dominates.  One of my best friends is obsessed with it and I didn't understand why until now.  The only thing I have had is the shoya (soy) ramen and it was a religious experience for me and it might be a while before I try anything else.  

Imagine a bowl of broth that taste like the most amazing piece of seasoned caramelized roasted pork ever, it's not thick but has that velvety satisfying stock feel that only comes from stewing all that flavor and goodness from bones for endless hours.  

Now in the broth, perfectly al dente noodles that soaked up all that awesome flavor.  They are al dente, you still have to chew them but they are by no means undercooked.  Then take slow roasted pork bellies that are so tender that you could cut it with, I don't know, a piece of grass, and slice it and float in on top.  Along with that add just a few slivers of some vegetable things that are cooked so they are just barely firmer than the noodles along with a touch of scallions.

The only thing that would be more porkly satisfying would be a pork loin wrapped in bacon.  It is crazy but it somehow reminds me of one of my favorite things in the world, carnitas.  Well it hits the same spot at least.  It's perfect too because it's got enough fat so you know you are eating pork but it's still lean-ish so you don't feel like killing yourself via hara-kiri after (It's the perfect lunch).  I mean I worked out about an hour after the last time I had it, try doing that after a carnitas plate.  I love pho but this ramen flipped my noodle soup world on it's head.  I can't sleep right now I just want to go back and eat more.  

P.S.  I have seen this place here before on this site and had it bookmarked but then I saw it pop up in the book ""Eating Las Vegas"" as one of the best 50 spots in vegas.",3,3,3

I have always gotten their to spicy tonkotsu. I recommend getting additional shredded green onion and soft boiled egg.

It's more rich than the other soups, just a warning), shoyu (simple yet fulfilling).

The last time we went (3 days ago) we ordered the pork bowl, and it was pretty bomb.  

Just a warning as far as the actual space. It is small. There are only about 4 4-person tables (which of course they can split for a 2-person table if needed) and their counter.

Like most relationships though, our initial encounter was not ideal, at least on my part. I think it was because this was my first time trying ""authentic"" Japanese ramen, so I wasn't sure what to expect and left feeling unsure. However, our bond has solidified and deepened with each visit, each more yearning and wanting than the last.

Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen is my favorite ramen, and I like to relish it with most of the condiments they offer. The pork belly bowl is both sweet and savory. The gyoza is delicious, the pork inside perfectly cooked and rich. Thankfully they don't mark up their canned drinks too much so a party of 2 could get away with 2 ramen bowls and 2 drinks and the bill will come to $20, not including tip.

If you come here in the summer months, prepare to deal with stifling heat. Monta is so small and doesn't have the best air conditioning to battle the heat and since the place is packed all the time, it will definitely get stuffy. A bowl of hot ramen is more enticing in the cooler months. But no matter what time you visit, prepare to wait anywhere from 5-30 minutes for seating. Tables are of course preferable since they're more private and have more room, but you'll wait longer for one. The bar is great too.

Be prepared to get ""hurried"" in and out because as soon you're seated, your order will be taken and as soon it looks like you're done with your meal, waitresses will zip over and offer to take your bowl in a hurry to get the waiting guests seated.

We ordered the Miso and Kuro (Tonkotsu with black garlic oil) ramen and they were both amazing.  The broth in the tonkotsu was thick and tasty.    Noodles and pork were both perfectly cooked.  Normally I try not to drink too much broth because it's so fatty and unhealthy, but the broth was so tasty I drank it all.  

The restaurant is small and the line can get long so be prepared to wait if you come in during the lunch or dinner rush.  The service is fast but don't come here if you're expecting to hang out for hours.  

Highlights:  Quick service.  Prices are very reasonable.  About $8 to $10 for ramen.  Kuro and Miso ramen are amazing!

Lowlights:   Lines can be long so be prepared to wait during rush hours.

A yelp hyped place I actually really loved.  Just when I was starting to give up on agreeing with my fellow yelpers, this place comes along and surprised me.

Let me note that I have never tried any sort of authentic ramen or have been to any ramen houses before, anywhere.  I know nothing about what is good and what isn't.  I also never come to the Spring Mountain area, as it is nowhere near where I live and my husband is not crazy about Asian cuisine.

So I came here alone before spending a few hours doing volunteer work in North Las Vegas, wanting something in my tummy before doing lifting and stuff.   I've complained in other reviews about some restaurants (mostly Asian-type food) that overwhelm you with egg smells when you walk in.  This one was one of those restaurants, but it was not bad enough to make me turn around and walk out.  It still grosses me out, as I really hate eggs.   I ordered the Tonkatsu, and only added some green onions.  Really nice flavorful broth, and I've never had such tender, nicely cooked pork in my life.  Very very good.  Next time I would add more pork to the dish.

My only beefs about this place was that they didn't brew their own iced green tea, they serve it from a can, meaning no refills.  And, the portion sizes were huge and I couldn't finish it all.  I wish they would serve a smaller bowl.  Oh and veggies!  Ramen needs a little vegetable action, and yes I know it is not authentic but I want it.

Other than that, I'll definitely be dragging my husband here whether he likes it or not.",3,1,1

When the tonkatsu ramen arrived, I was afraid to dig in...at first, it just looked so pretty. The broth was cloudy and delicately shaded. Two large slices of tender pork lay atop a pile of ramen noodles. I got mine with a hardboiled egg - the two halves smiled up at me.

I really love ramen. It's a bowl of super happy. This is the best I've had in town. I have no idea what the spicy stuff in the shaker was (it was explained to me once, but that was between Asahis one and two), but a sprinkling of that and sesame seeds added punch and richness.

Google map takes you to this empty plaza with nothing but a sleazy looking massage parlor. Hmmm....? 

This small hole in the wall restaurant interior reminds me of Daikokuya Jtown LA but even smaller! They had an L shaped bar which probably sits 10-12 people max. There were about 5-6 regular tables, some made for two people & some made for four. What happens in a place like this? A number of overflowing people waiting out the door. I recommend you coming early or during non-peaked hours. We got lucky because there was only one party ahead of us when we got in but that quickly changed. By the time we got out, there were at least 10 parties on that waiting list.

First thing I noticed was the array of condiments in front of us. Shredded pink ginger, purified garlic, white pepper, Japanese chili powder, SPICY a$$ hot chili oil, vinegar, soy sauce just to name a few. Love restaurants that aren't all hipster tight up the butt about their condiments.

Had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen, a mixed blend of pork bone and soy sauce type soup based. The first one I've ever had actually since I'm typically accustomed to just Tonkotsu base. It was a little less rich and thick then the Tonkotsu base but still had that cloudy and strong taste. I added an egg and kimchi for a little more. For you carb lovers, you can add extra noodles for a minimal fee. I was quite satisfied with my ramen. My expectations were met even though they weren't that high since we were in Vegas and we know LA is crawling with bomb ramen houses. The chashu pork was quite fatty and the slices were on a smaller scale. The bowl of ramen itself was enough to make you full but not overly stuffed.

Also ordered the mini mentaiko bowl - cod fish row, seaweed, green onion, over rice. Nothing significant to report. The fried gyozas (pork and vegetable filling) were decent.

The ramen is nothing to die for but it really wasn't too bad. If you have a mad craving for ramen or just want to get something other than pho on Spring Mountain Road aka Chinatown, then Monta Ramen is there for you. Just be ready for a wait time. The ramen met my simple standards and the price was very affordable. The hard working staff are efficient and all ""peace sign"" fobby smiles.",2,3,2

And because it's seemingly authentic, vegetarian ramen is a mere fantasy here. All ramen options are pork-based. While not a place for vegetarians, Monta is a great spot for a hangover cure after too much partying. The consensus from my carniovore\/omnivore buddies was that the broths were tasty but a tad too salty towards the end. One friend observed a person eating rice on the side with his\/her ramen, perhaps a good solution to the saltiness.

Because I didn't have a non-meat option for soup, I got two bowls of the mentaiko on rice instead. Mentaiko atop rice is nowhere near as tasty as the noodle version. Also, butter seemed to missing from the fish egg mixture. I probably won't order this again if I return. The vegetable gyozas are probably worth trying, though.

Service is pretty good for such a fast-paced dining environment; the staff really know how to manage lines and to keep things moving along without being rude or giving you the impression that you were being kicked out.

Of these 4 I like monta ramen the best. This place is super small so come early or later if you want to avoid the long wait. Their menu is clear and concise.  They don't have dip ramen here.  The reason I liked this one the most was because their broth is super thick and flavorful. I ordered the regular tonkotsu ramen and it comes with chasu, and thin ramen noodles. I usually don't like the spice they add to make it spicy because it detracts from the broth flavor. They said that the spice they put in their spicy tonkotsu ramen is gochugang based ( the Korean spice paste) so it has a sweet note to it. Their ramen price is surprisingly also the cheapest amongst the 4 other places I've tried. My bowl was really satisfying!

If you're a big eater, they also had rice bowls you can order on the side. My friends got the pork belly bowl and the bowl that starts with a t that comes with pickled cabbage. The pork belly bowl was good. It was just fatty cooked meat and rice. The bowl with the pickled cabbage I didn't like. It was way too salty and it has a strange taste. I think that bowl is an acquired taste.",5,0,2

I personally am a ramen fan in general so I like trying new places, my other friend and her hubby are not big ramen fans, but luckily, after coming to Monta they have found a renewed interest in ramen.

We all started with a glass of beer, pretty cheap at about $3 but they are not pints, I think more like 10oz-ers? Still it was a refreshing way to start the meal. 
Shared the pickled greens fried rice and the pork belly rice bowl. Fried rice was cooked well and flavorful, the pork belly bowl was even better. The fatty pieces of pork were cooked perfectly tender with their greasy goodness seaping into the rice underneath. 

For ramen I got the half pork half chicken broth and added an egg. The chicken broth is supposed to be a little less rich but mine was still a pretty thick broth. Not that that's a bad thing, thick as in thick with flavor but sometimes I prefer a less rich broth because it can get very filling. So depending on what you like, the full tonkatsu broth would be richest and most flavorful and a the half and half would be a lighter version. Noodles were cooked perfectly. 

The place is typical small Japanese style shop, they have a list for you to write your name on and wait. The waitresses do a nice job of clearing the tables and getting everyone seated as soon as possible so even though we had a few parties ahead of us the wait wasn't too bad for lunch hour.

'Earl of Sandwich and Monta Ramen.'

It was my first time here and I could see why he suggested coming here.
The restaurant itself is very cute and homey.
There was a good amount of people when we arrived.
Luckily for us, they had all ordered and were receiving their order when we placed our food.

The menu is small - a couple different styles of ramen, a couple of add ins, a handful of appetizers, including fried rice.
From my experience, simple is usually good. It means that they make whatever they make very well.

My extra chasiu made the broth a little fatter than I would like; however, the broth was good - not too rich or heavy, and all the toppings in the ramen was fresh. The gyoza was made to order and same with the fried rice (which somehow ended up being my favorite part).

It was so good that we came back, once more, during our 3 days Vegas getaway before returning back to the Bay.

Oh... make sure your party isn't too big.
The restaurant is very cute and homey, but it gets harder to accommodate large parties.

While Monta isn't my first choice anymore, I don't have any qualms on eating here. My best friend Tida C. is still a die-hard Monta lover so I'm sure they'll still be in my regular rotation of restaurants.

The Miso broth isn't as rich and a little more salty than I remembered. And the flavors are more subtle than comparable broths I've had at other ramen places. Between Shoyu, Tonkatsu, and Miso, I consider Miso to be the tastiest of all of them.

A couple of the reasons I still think Monta is awesome is their Togarashi (the red chili\/pepper flakes on the table). I don't know how they make it or where they get it from, but no other togarashi is equal to that of Monta's. The blend of chili and other seasonings make it incredibly addicting and it has more spice (heat level) than others I've tried.

And of course, they still hold true to carrying the freshest mentaiko in town. That mini mentaiko bowl is still my favorite app \/ side dish to a hot bowl of noodles.",8,1,4

Their ramen is delicious, the meat is wonderfully soft and flavorful, and their fried rice is do darn good.  I could eat four orders of their fried rice in one sitting!  

I'm glad that I found more traditional ramen in Vegas--finally!  Monta is one hell of a ramen restaurant.  I believe that I'm retiring from the other ramen places in Vegas and sticking with Monta from now on.  If you haven't tried it and were looking on yelp for some assistance as to whether or not you should--YOU SHOULD.

I tried the Shoyu Ramen this time, while my friend tried the Miso.  Shoyu was good and I didn't feel it was too salty like the other two ramen.  And my coworker enjoyed the Miso Ramen. Both of these options are prepared with the thick ramen noodle (just FYI), which I prefer anyway.

Food! We ordered a Large Pork Belly Rice Bowl to share - the fatty pieces of pork were cooked perfectly, so tender, buttery, just goes perfect with rice! I really miss this!

Hubby ordered the basic Tonkotsu Ramen with egg added - broth is very bold and tense, and what I love the most is not overly salty!

I ordered the Kuro Ramen with egg added on the daily special board - black garlic oil ramen, I really love it. Egg was perfectly soft boiled, runny center. I do wish that it was thick noodles, this is just personal preference :)

The gyoza was pretty forgettable as it had charring on the top.
They're also not as delicate as the ones in Hakata (my forever ramen love!). 

What I did like was their smooth ramen broth base. 
Not too thick nor thin and also not too salty. Tonkatsu ramen comes
with thinner noodles and shoyu comes with curly thicker noodles.

- The price is right. Two bowls of ramen, 2 asahi, about $20. That's a date night right there.
- Once you get a seat, service is fast, and all the servers are super nice.
- Menu had everything spelled out for a ramen-noob rather than making me guess.

Cons:
- The wait to get seated can be kind of a bummer sometimes, but on a cool winter night, it almost just whets the appetite.

I appreciate that it's the real stuff and not the packaged, powder crap other places use.  

Yes, Monta is a noodle house but their fried rice is just as good, if not better.  For someone who doesn't really like fried rice, I would come just for that.  Their gyoza was just okay.  I've had better.   

Even though the place is (extremely) small, I like that it's cozy.  There was only one time when I actually had to wait for a table, but as always, the wait was worth it.  

A basic bowl of ramen will cost you almost $8.  That's kind of steep, especially in the economy that we're in now.  An extra $1.50 for a hard boiled egg also seems a bit much, don't you think?  I guess it's really quality over quantity with this place.

Monta is a tiny restaurant tucked in a strip mall that seats about 25-30 people.. They serve ramen with a choice between 4 different broths and every bowl comes with char-su, mushroom, and green onion.. There are other options that you can add to your noodles for an additional cost too.. The broth was thick and a yellow-milky color which wasn't the best for drinking and the noodles didn't have any distinction that would make them ""the best"" ramen.. We also tried their regular fried rice and that was probably the only thing everyone enjoyed and would come back for again.. But as for the ramen I think I'll pass!",4,3,3

I have been looking for a good ramen place in town and this one looks to be a keeper. The shoyu ramen rocks my world. The broth was light and the noodles cooked al dente. I got mine with extra pork, butter and corn. Slurped it right up. Since I am a bit picky, I usually end up picking out the bamboo shoots, green onions and kikurage.

Not a big fan of the gyoza, a little too many vegetables in them for a carnivore like me.  My mom really enjoyed her tonkotsu ramen. She also went with extra pork as well as nitamago and takana mustard leaf. My bf always gets the miso broth. This time he went for extra noodles in addition to usual his add-ons of pork and egg.

Both times I have been so far has been on a weekend for late lunch. The first time, we didn't wait very long but we did end up sitting at the bar.

It was this past Saturday night and I actually expected to have to wait after reading the other reviews. My advice to anyone going when they're busy is to watch the list!! My party of 4 waited outside for about 40 minutes. After noticing people being seated that arrived after us we decided to go back inside the crowded little waiting area inside to look at the list. Our name was not crossed off but the 6 lines below my name were. Just then we watched as a table of 4 got up to leave and looked for the hostess to call us over. Instead she looked at a young asian man standing directly in front of me, to come over to the table. I said out loud ""Wait we are next on the list!"" It was futile as I was completely ignored. I then grabbed the list and walked over to the server\/hostess that seated them and pointed out to her how we were obviously next to be seated since every name above mine was crossed out. She pulled the ""I'm going to act like I don't speak English card"" and mumbled about a mistake. She pointed to another table where the diners were paying their check and said we can sit there. Ugh! If my family wasn't so hungry after waiting for so long I would've walked out at that point. What bothered me the most is the fact that the hostess never even looked at the list before motioning for the other party to be seated. Would I have waited 2 hours to be seated had I not gone inside to inspect the situation? Now for the food...the regular fried rice was not very flavorful but had a nice meat to rice ratio. It was also on the greasy side which I like. The cod fish eggs over rice was not edible. It looked great but tasted really fishy and not fresh. I tried dousing it with chili oil and then soy sauce but nothing could quash the fishy smell. The kuro Ramen with black garlic oil was fantastic and is the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars. It was very salty, which I love, and had 3-4 pieces of chasu. The broth was the star of the dish. The pork wasn't bad but a little bland, while the noodles and green onions seemed fresh and tasty. My family ordered gyoza, which they warn you will take 10 minutes to cook. I didn't try any, but the kiddos liked it. After our meal it took another 20 minutes to flag down a server to get our check and another 10 to wait for the check to be picked up.

I was a US Marine stationed overseas on mainland Japan for three years. During those three years i've had the opportunity to eat sushi, ramen, bento bowls, curries, udon, miso soups, and other foods of Japanese origins they way they make it and the way they eat it.

The ramen that is offered here is a step above instant ramen but is FAR from authentic. 

The broths are noticeably lighter and less flavorful from authentic, the noodles are in the middle, they're close but dont have the right texture, sides such as meats are too fatty but seasoned better then authentic ramen.

The biggest difference is the price. Here a bowl of ramen runs from 6.25 to 7.something which isnt bad but it's the sides that get you back. 1.50 for a hard boiled egg? 1.50 for a spoon full of pickled mustard greens? 2.50 for extra noodles?

I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen. Even just the smell of the broth was oh so soothing - I felt my headache fade away with every slurp of the soup and ramen. From my understanding, they put great care into their broth by letting it boil down for hours. It is creamy, salty, and hot. Essentially, a perfect cap to a crazy night. The noodles were quite delicious too - it was slightly crispy and went very well with the soup. Tonkatsu comes with two pork pieces. You can order extra sides to put in your ramen (I felt like corn that day), but they do charge you.
I also had a side order of fried rice, which I thought was very salty. It is good, but it needs something to offset the saltiness.

To even mention Monta's ramen in the same sentence as Top Ramen or Cup O' Noodles is blasphemous. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen which I believe is their most popular dish. The broth is thick, cloudy, and jam packed with flavor. The noodles were perfectly cooked and tasted like they were made fresh onsite. There were a few slivers of pork and I added a soft boiled egg. My husband got the combination Tonkatsu and Shoya and it was just as yummy as my dish. It is interesting how many variations there are of ramen and how adding one ingredient changes the whole dish. 

Monta really is a hole in the wall restaurant because it could easily be missed in the shopping center. The restaurant is tiny so it is not recommended for large groups.

I have to say I enjoy different ramen styles better, though, like what they have at Ramen Sora. Monta has thinner noodles, and their broth is very good but doesn't have the umami punch that makes ramen so delicious. I prefer thicker, chewier wavy noodles than thin noodles that they had. They also do not have curry like many ramen places unfortunately, but that is okay, because they make up for it with their variety of fried rices. 

I sat at a stool at the bar, and it is pretty uncomfortable, but adds to the ramen-ya feel that they are going for. I wouldn't mind going back, it definitely satisfies the ramen craving, but I think if I had to pick one place it would be Ramen Sora for sure.

The following week, I ordered my Miso with my favorite noodle along with my extra vegetable components just like my last visit but forgot to add the mustard green. I swore up and down to the chef that they gave me Tonkatsu because Miso was spicy last time.  Well, after a discussion with the chef we realized that the takana mustard leaf presented the spicy flavor to the broth, which was forgotten!

I felt like I needed to rush, since there wasn't much seating. If you're looking for a place to go with a big group of friends you may have trouble getting seated. There is maybe enough room for 40 people. So grab your few closest friends and go get a table.",1,0,0

Stopped in today for a solo lunch- was seated quick as there was a spare spot open at the bar, but when I first went in there was a wait list. Yes, at 3PM on a Saturday. Plan ahead if you're going with a group!

Service was great- two super-sweet ladies were attentive and friendly throughout my visit. Placed my order for the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen, added the egg, nori, and shredded green onion. Initially I was put off by having to add on my favorite ingredients separately, but the silver lining to doing so was that I was able to meet the $10 credit card minimum without buying a separate appetizer.

While waiting for my bowl, I was entertained watching the guys in the kitchen making endless batches of noodles. Got my order fairly quick as the restaurant started emptying out a bit.

My first reaction was one of happy surprise: the steep $1.50 fee for green onion got me a shredded nest of it atop my bowl, an unexpectedly gigantic amount that found itself in every bite I took. In a good way! Found the noodles to be thinner than I prefer but cooked to a perfect al dente. Shredded the nori into small pieces to distribute throughout my bites. The broth lacked the depth that I've had elsewhere, but I was pleasantly surprised to use the brown garlic oil on the table and get a robust improvement in the flavor. Potential new favorite condiment alert!
Sad to note that the chashu was somehow lost among the kicked-up broth and sea of shredded onion. What is usually a highlight of my ramen experience was just mediocre here, the cut I had was not fatty nor was it particularly flavorful either.

I will likely be back because service was great and there are other varieties to try on the menu, but I was slightly underwhelmed by the bowl I got today. Location is everything though, and this noodle house is conveniently located and will likely result in repeat visits.",5,2,3

Yes the wait is long cuz the entire plaza where this is located is full of seemingly awesome restaurants. There's a sign in sheet to help keep orderly and seems to be the practice in Chinatown restaurants. The parking lot is packed during dinner time. People were walking in from parking across the street. But hooray for the selections of neighboring restaurants!

Yes service is quick and attentive. They clean off tables and seating areas as soon as guests are through. We got bar seats facing the kitchen and were able to watch their process. They wear gloves and hair bandanas. Saw how they keep their soup bowls hot. Saw how routine it was to put noodles, ingredients, and broth. Saw how busy the workers were. Our orders came out quickly after ordering.

Yes their ramen soup is totally delish! Hot, tasty, comfy, and a good amount of ingredients. Their awards and acknowledgments on the walls live up to the best value. Absolutely enjoyed the flavor! There was enough in our bowls for another soupy meal for later. Wish I could've finished it cuz I was having a needy moment. The rest of the soup to go - so it is so...

No there is not a lot of room for a popular place to eat. After a tiny bit of parking frustration, then there's the seating wait, and the standing, and the crowd. I wish they had better space; and perhaps that is what's in plans for such a successful place. Real awesome for them! Good luck on the bigger space.

No 3 whole stars or 3.5 - what's up Jo... Why're you jippin' on the stars?! Oh no see... Was looking forward to leftover soup for lunch the next day. Saddened me to gags that the broth was hard like butter! Eeeuuuw what! That doesn't happen to pho noodle broth! What was REALLY in this ramen broth?!?!?!

We ordered:
- Tonkatsu Ramen: Absolutely wonderful smooth & milky pork-based broth. My favorite ramen is at shin sen gumi, and this bowl of ramen was very comparable, if not better. I also added toppings of a hard boiled egg and extra slices of pork - they gave 6 extra slices in addition to the two slices of pork that came with the bowl by default. I decided to avoid the kimchi because I didn't want the Korean toppings to dominate the Japanese broth. Noodles were cooked perfect, and you can order extra noodles for $1.50.
- Shoyu Ramen: This is the darker one, I believe it's miso\/soy based. My gf had this, and I tried the broth and it seemed equally as delicious.
- Gyoza: It's like lightly grilled potstickers
- Fried Rice: typical fried rice as expected - not something to die for, but good.
- Kimchi Fried Rice: Pretty much exactly like the fried rice, except that it had a bit of the tangy flavor that the kimchi added
- Pork bellow bowl: This was my favorite out of the fried rice bowls. Lightly cooked, tender, moist and juicy pork belly strips layered on top of white rice. Definitely worth getting along with the ramen.

This place is SMALL. Party of 4+? Prepare to either wait or not sit all together. Parties with younger children, plan accordingly cause half of the seats are bar seats, which small bodies and bar stools don't usually mix well.

I was in the mood for some good Mexican, but I was overruled as Wifey wanted Ramen. I scoffed at the notion of a good Ramen joint existing in Vegas. I crave for good Ramen, and so far the best I've had to date was from Santouka Ramen in LA. The Ramen joints in The City are a joke, but thank god for San Mateo as my only salvation for good Ramen. 

So when Wifey found this place, I was very skeptical; but I had no choice since she won all the money in Vegas that pretty much paid for our trip and then some. 

So we drove to Vegas' Chinatown district and one thing I noticed is that the blocks are like a frigging mile long. Damn...the blocks are so far apart I felt like I was in the desert. 

So we arrived and it's in a small strip mall similar to those found all over California (looks promising) and definitely qualifies as a Hole-In-The-Wall joint. The place is small...more tiny than small with a seating of about 20 + at a time. It was around lunch and the place was packed. I also observed a squad car illegally parked and had me worried for a second thinking it was a crime-ridden area and had an incident in progress. My guard subsided when I saw two of Vegas' finest slurping the Ramen inside. 

We waited for approximately 20-25 minutes before we got called and I was famished. I was already eyeing the 'Daily Special"" board of Kuro Ramen and Spicy Tonkutso Ramen (both $7.95). Sold! Wifey also ordered a side of Tonkutso Pork over a bowl of rice. 

The side order arrived first and what we got was a pile of pork meat on top of rice topped with Nori strips. Ummmm....Anthony Bourdain would approve of this. 

Then our Ramen arrived and all my skepticism disappeared and what I felt next was envy. I was envious that Vegas can have a better Ramen joint than San Francisco. Then envy turned into sadness, which turned into me slurping the noodles to comfort my emotional needs at that time. 

The broth was amazing. Unlike the broths in The City that are overly salty, this one was creamy, thick, rich but also tasted light. How could that be? It wasn't rich, thick and heavy as one would expect. All I can say is wow. It truly made a believer out of me. I also tasted the Wifey's broth and the roller coaster of emotion began again. 

This one really surprised me in a good way.",5,5,6

I stumbled upon it and decided to take my wife and two kids (4 and 2) to give it a try. Last week we tried another Ramen house down the street from Monta and it was nowhere near as good. We've had ramen in Japan, Hawaii and California and Monta is the closest to what you can find on the streets of Tokyo. 

We started out with Kimchee and the fried rice. They were both amazing! The Kimchee had an amazing taste and the fried rice was probably the best I have had! I had the spicy tonkotsu ramen, my wife had the miso ramen and my kids shared the cold noodles. All had amazing flavor with robust noodles and tender meat. The dishes were bursting with flavor! My kids pounded the cold noodles and the fried rice.

Overall, Monta is a MUST TRY when in Las Vegas. This is going to be a regular spot for us. Oh, the place is really small... So don't expect to have a big party and get in right away. You'll wait 20-30 minutes before you get in. Enjoy!",0,0,0

The tonkotsu is definitely rich compared to other ramens I've had. The flavor of the bamboo and mushroom distracts me from the pork flavor.  Thin and firm noodles come with the tonkotsu and that is the way I would have done it. 

The shoyu soy sauce ramen is great and the pairing with a thicker noodle is a good choice because it carries the favors of the broth better.  The flavor balance is right on.  I make this my preferred ramen when I visit.

The place is small simple and quaint. Went here for a late lunch (about 2:30pm) on a weekday so it wasn't busy and were promptly served. I ordered the Black Garlic Oil Ramen and not even 10 minutes later, got my food. The ramen and the pork in it had the perfect balance of richness, fattiness and saltiness and was definitely the best I've had in years. 

It does get busy in the evening, especially because the place is small (I tried coming back later in the week). So I do suggest coming early. Other than that the only disappointing thing is that it's in Vegas. Definitely going to come back next time I'm in town.

Good thing we got there early enough to avoid the long line during lunch hour on a Friday afternoon. Just got off the plane, I was super hungry and ready for some yummy ramen. I got the tonkotsu ramen and one of my friend got the miso ramen. I tried her and it's very similar to mines except for one thing, she added extra butter. This make the broth super rich and I can't see myself finishing it after a few bite if that was my noodle...too much. My ramen was super salty that it makes me super dehydrated. My favorite part of soup is always the broth, and if the broth is too much for me to handle, there's no point of eating it. The pork though, on the other hand was very tender and delicious.

chashu was good but I didn't like the skin around it. The bamboo shoots weren't that good. Kinda bland. 

The complaints I'd have is that the soup is actually a little thicker and saltier than I'm used to. Just a little. Also the noodles are on the slightly softer side. 

I also tried their nitamago (flavored egg) which I think were very average. I'm very picky with my eggs so these eggs were too hard and cooked for my liking. Also a bit dry because of that.

So let me back up. This little restaurant is located in a small strip mall off of Spring Mountain (Las Vegas' International District). Use Yelp Directions to help you find it. It's small, clean, and similar to a place you might visit in Tokoyo today (only it's missing the plastic food display at the front of the store). We walked in around 4'ish and the place was already packed.  Luckily, we only had to wait a couple of minutes before a place opened up at the bar.  A very nice server came over and took our orders down on her iPad (good modern touch).  

The Shoyu Ramen (thick ramen, soy sauce & chicken broth w\/ 2 slices of Pork) was only $6.95;  Tonkatsu (thin ramen, pork bone stew w\/ 2 slices of Pork and a side of spicy sauce was $7.95; side of Kimchi $1; and rice $1. Oolong tea served nice and hot in a can was only $1.75.  

Any Cons, you may ask? Well the restaurant is really small and really crowded because of it's popularity & tasty Ramen.  You have to eat fast or your Ramen will get cold.

I'm not a big ramen fan, so I begrudgingly went along with some friends for my first visit. I now go willingly, without any hesitation. I don't get ramen, but I do get the pork fried rice, which is some of the best I have ever had in my life (and I have lived in the Bay and LA). It's flavorful and rich, and so amazingly priced (~$6?). I could eat it everyday. All my friends love the ramen, so they're obviously doing something right there. They also have pretty great appetizers as well.

Be aware that the sitting room is REALLY small. I think my parent's living room is about the size of the whole space. As a result, there can sometimes be a really long wait. The longest I'm ever willing to wait for cheap food is 30 minutes, and I've waited that long for Monta. But there have been times where my wait has been less than ten minuted on a Friday night. So it really depends on when you get there, and luck honestly. I will say that it is a terrible place for large parties though. It's always been such a hassle coming here with more than four people.

Conveniently located on Spring Mountain, right next to the super busy Raku.  (Smart business choice I would say.)

This place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don't come with a large group.  Their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (A couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)

I went for their most popular dish - Tonkotsu Ramen ($6.95).  The main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  This results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  It automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and green onions.  Their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the Chinese kind, but definitely tasty.

The Husband went for the Miso Ramen ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  This was also good, and quite filling.

We also shared a regular order of the Pork Belly Bowl ($5.75).  It sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  I adore pork belly and the next time I come here, I'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  It's fatty and good.  

A side dish we added on was the Takana Mustard Leaf ($1.50).  You can have this on the side or in your broth.  It's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  It's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  Other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or green onions.

There's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - Shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  You can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for ""Kaedama.""  Other dishes available are gyoza, fried rice, kim chee fried rice, takana fried rice, cha siu bowl, and mini mentaiko (marinated polluck roe).

Service was good.  With two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  It's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.

Update!  
I returned the following month for my own bowl of the Pork Belly Bowl.  This time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.  Guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day.",14,6,8

As all the other Yelpers mentioned, it is VERY warm in the restaurant so be prepared! The whole restaurant only fits about 26 people but we were lucky we were the only customers.

I went with my boyfriend and I ordered the tonkatsu ramen w\/ egg and he had the miso w\/ corn, egg & extra chashu. Even in the heat I definitely enjoyed the ramen. The broth was very savory and delicious. The chashu was very soft and also very flavorful. I would definitely order the extra chashu next time we go there. I've never had corn in my ramen before (except for the american cuponoodles) but it added a nice crunch to the dish and sweetness.

The service was good but just be careful with your bill there. This was the first time we went there and they rang up 3 cokes instead of 2. After the transaction was completed she had corrected it by giving us cash back for the misrung item. After leaving the restaurant and being a day later, we came to realized the server charged his debit card TWICE for the meal as well.

At the same time, both times we were there we only waited 5-10 minutes so they do turn them pretty quickly.  Orders are taken promptly by pleasant wait staff, and your meal is turned around quickly as well, within 10 minutes.

Their ramen are overall the best I've had - not greasy, fresh, with nicely firm noodles - although from pure taste standpoint I probably prefer Hiromaru (RIP).  Their fried rice is really good, as is the chashu don.  These are more like side dishes from size standpoint, but probably too much for one person to have a ramen and one of these.  Maybe 2 ramen dishes and one will work for two... I say that because they're really good and you should really try them.

Great atmosphere, bustling crowd, and great food all equal to the best ramen joint I have been to yet.  It's probably more like 4.5 stars, but I want to differentiate between this and other 4-star places I've rated so I'm giving it a 5.

I thought to myself, ""heck yeah, this wait is going to be worth it because I've heard a lot of good things about this place!"" Tried the food. Wasn't impressed. I ordered a Shoyu Ramen and a mini mentaiko bowl. I expected the mentaiko bowl to be delicious, and it was--but trust me, after a few bites that sodium content will turn you off. A few minutes later, the shoyu ramen came. Too salty for my tastes. 
My cousin ordered a Tonkotsu ramen and I tried it. I wish I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen instead because it wasn't AS salty, but still pretty salty. My dad ordered a miso ramen. Again, it was salty.
 You get the gist.

Aside from the salty dishes, we ordered gyoza and fried rice. The fried rice was pretty standard and the gyoza was just a bit better from the frozen ones you can get at the store. Neato.
Maybe I'll come back when I'm low on sodium intake.

They also had gyoza, pork rice bowls, and fried rice. Service was nice and speedy. You can tell the girls here were used to dealing with the crowds.

We tried the tonkotsu ramen and the kim chi fried rice.  Overall the ramen was quite flavorful but the flavors don't compare to our favorite ramen place in San Diego at Izakaya Masa. Monta noodles are much thinner but not mushy or al dente (the way we like). It's served with a couple slice of pork, Asian mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. But I do like that they have pickled ginger and minced garlic jars out for self service.  The fried rice was decent but unremarkable.($6.95)

We ordered the fried rice also which was really good and the pork belly which comes in small or large. In all honestly, food was good but the BROTH is a different story. The broth is too thick for my liking and it was too creamy that I couldn't even drink all of the broth. I feel like the broth was on the salty side and I asked my friend and he agreed. 

Funny thing is, whenever my group of friends crave ramen, we would always separate and go to different ramen joints. Half of them would go to Monta and the other half would go to Ramen Sora.

Do you know why it is that the Japanese community in LV has turned their back on MONTA? There are many reasons.....

I was confused. I was really confused. Why was I not a fan of MONTA? Every Chinese person kept telling me that MONTA was ""the best"". Every Korean woman kept telling me that it was ""the best"". Even their white husbands kept telling me that MONTA is ""the best"". My Mexican-American and Black foster kids kept telling me that Monta was ""the best"". Why is it that I didn't like it when everyone around me kept saying that it was the greatest? Am I just not Japanese enough to enjoy MONTA? My Dad is a 3rd generation Japanese-American and he did marry a Korean woman, so maybe that Korean blood in me erased my ability to determine what a good ramen is. But then I started noticing that all my friends and business partners who were born and raised in Japan kept insisting that MONTA was NOT ""the best"", In fact they thought it was ""the worst"". So I came to the conclusion that Japanese people just don't like MONTA like everyone else does. 

Personally, I think MONTA is  the California Roll of Ramen. It's a slightly Americanized variation, just like how the California Roll is an Americanized variation of traditional Maki. MONTA's ramen belongs to no true Japanese region.  It's made in America like Burgers and Fries. 

No one eats comfortably at MONTA. The place is extremely cramped, the chairs are very uncomfortable. The counter is made of that cheap plywood you find at discount furniture outlets on Maryland and Flamingo.  The bathroom is like 4 feet from the bar, and some guy always insists on taking a huge dump and leaving the door open. There is never any parking in the lot. Frequently, I just drive across the street to Shuseki(A Chinese-Japanese restaurant) where it's much more comfortable and the ramen is f*cking awesome.  MONTA is the most popular ramen-ya in Vegas, so why won't they move to a larger space? One of the wealthy Korean business owners who is a member of my Asian-American Activism agency informed me that Seoul Plaza(where Monta is located) has the cheapest rent in Chinatown.  The owner of MONTA is attempting to cut costs to maximize profits and that's why he won't leave Seoul Plaza.  Cheapness is the main reason! And Cheapness is also the reason why your bowl of ramen at MONTA is only half the size of the other 4 major Ramen-Ya's in LV. And Cheapness is why you have to pay extra for every little thing. You gotta pay extra for noodles, you gotta pay extra for the egg, you gotta pay extra for butter and corn! How cheap is that!!! If you get all the add ons, the bowl of ramen comes out to like $15.00. You can get the egg, extra charsu, extra noodles, 50% more broth, corn, butter, and garlic oil all included in the $8.00-$9.00 bowl of ramen at Fukumimi. The Deluxe Ramen at Sora also has everything included and it's only like $10.00 flat.

The f*cking hipsters! This is a major reason why the Japanese have left MONTA.  Hipsters are usually White people, but they think it's cool to hang out in latino areas or Chinatowns. I don't know why, but hipsters think it's ""lame"" being around other Whites. Unfortunately, they have chosen MONTA as their ""COOL MINORITY HANGOUT SPOT!"". As a Japanese-American, do I wanna sit with a bunch of guys with "" David Lynch Eraserhead"" haircuts who wear Geek-Sheek  glasses and talk about their feelings? Do I wanna sit with a 6 foot 4"" man in a dress who is attempting to start a conversation with me about: Indie Rock, Indie Flicks,  Jesus(aka Obama), Apple Products, and how cool it is to wear sunglasses indoors?  My response= THAT'S IT! NO MORE!  I'M F*CKING OUT OF HERE! I'M GOING TO FUKUMIMI!

By the way... How f*cking long does it take for you guys to eat one bowl of ramen? While I'm on the waiting list for over 1 hour, I always notice how people finish their ramen after 15 minutes but just sit there and talk for another 45 minutes. This is the reason why we gotta wait so f*cking long to get a seat. 

MONTA has the worst Gyoza in LV. It tastes like the Chinese variation, and they all stick together like they are frozen(look at my pics). And they give you like 5 pieces for $5.00. That's like a dollar a piece!! Walk 2 minutes to Shuseki for a much better gyoza.

Why did my egg come from the Alley? They ran out of eggs during my last visit and then they ran into the alley and grabbed another box? Are the eggs just sitting out there in some kind of big jar?

A Japanese restaurant is supposed to have Kim-Uchi, not Kimchi. I saw with my own eyes, the cook here at MONTA going to Greenland to buy one of those giant glass jars of Korean Kimchi. At Fukumimi, Katsu-San makes his own Kim-Uchi which is slightly sweeter than Korean Kimchi. It's a true Japanese variation of a classic Korean dish.

If I had to pick a ramen restaurant to go to in LV, I wouldn't hesitate to come back. It's about 10-12 min ride from the strip via uber in non traffic so swing out there after a day of gambling or beach clubbing and pick up a very delicious bowl of ramen. 

We sampled several dishes while we were there. I tried the tonkotsu, the spicy tonkotsu, some of the fried rices, and the gyoza. 

As with all Japanese dishes I hardly detected a major difference between the regular and the spicy so that is kinda moot. The tonkotsu itself is creamy and a tad bit too salty but very filling. I didn't even finish my soup so I'm not sure if I blame the noodle portions or my ""diet"" that I was on. You have the option of selecting your type of noodle from udon and thin style I believe. I went with the regular thin noodle and was not disappointed in the least. 

The fried rice was not to my taste so I had one bite and that was about it. Nothing negative to say about it but just wasn't a winner for me.

What knocked my rating down 1 star was the way the seating was done. I observed a table with enough for our party get given to a party with three less people than ours which in turn if they had just waited one second for them to clean the table they could have given them the appropriate size table. We had to wait thru two of those moments and I watched as the host just put people around helter skelter.

This came following a year of nonstop coworkers cheering about how wonderful Monta was and how it made other establishments in Vegas, particular Anime Ramen, look bad.  So needless to say, my expectations were really high.  

It should be mentioned that Monta was incredibly authentic to the point where everything that I loved and hated about Japan was en-capsuled by this establishment:

Too small to fit a decent crowd so there was a 45 minute wait late night on a Friday?  Check.
Hard benches?
Check.
Tiny waiting space?
Check.
Completely open mail slot in the middle of December with a door that didn't close so it was incredibly drafty and wet and miserable?  
Check.

At some point I was actually convinced that this was their plot: Make you so hungry and cold and put-out that you would just find the food euphoric when you finally arrived.

Not to mention that they were OUT of miso so anything that had miso in it was not an option.  Seriously, my favorite thing on the menu?  You're out of it??

So finally managed to get to our food and the taste was great.  Broth was wonderful, noodles perfectly cooked.  Was it worth the wait?  Not reallyI just wanted to flee to Curry Zen whose attitude is blah but food is a staple for me.   

I suppose that if I came a weekday afternoon and had a casual bowl I would had a different experience then it would have been fine.  But I shouldn't have to wait for a chance time to have a pleasant experience.",1,0,0

Monta is in a small strip mall on Sprint Mountain Rd, just West of Decatur. It is very easy to miss as you go by. And the shop is very small, with only four 4 place table, 1 2 place table, and about 10 counter seats. They only accept cash so beware.

I recently learned of this place right here on yelp and had to give it a try. Like others on this forum, I grew up eating fantastic ramen all over Japan. And have long been searching... I was elated when Santouka came to the states and even more ecstatic when local joints like Orenchi (Cupertino, CA) that are very much like the ramen I used to know in Japan... started to pop up.

I'd like to preface this review with the fact that I like tonkotsu, thick chijirimen (wavy noodles) usually, so I am usually biased towards that. Monta has 4 basic types of ramen flavors: Tonkotsu, Shoyu, Miso, and new (at least it said new today) Tonkotsu Shoyu which is a combination of the Tonkotsu and Shoyu broths.

Tonkotsu, of course, is pork based broth. The Shoyu uses chicken broth (according to Monta), but I also detected some dashi (fish based) in there as well. Tonkotsu, and Tonkotsu Shoyu uses thin straight noodles. Shoyu and Miso uses the thick wavy noodles. Each ramen @  $6.95 comes with 2 slices of char shu, kikurage (woodear mushrooms), memma (seasoned bamboo shoots), and chopped green onions. There are other toppings available as mentioned in other reviews, along with kaedama (literally means ""replacement ball"") extra noodles.

Kaedama is usually ordered as you go, not in the beginning. This is because if get it at the same time as your ramen, then the noodles either go cold, or get overcooked. This is one of the reasons why I do not like places that have a ""Large"" size. By the time you're half way through, the noodles are too overcooked. I commend Monta for doing the kaedama the right way.

Anyway, I was @ Monta today, Thu, at 2 pm, and the place had a waiting list 8 deep! It took us abobut 20 minutes to get seated, and as we got seated, the wait line even got longer. OK... my expectations are way high... but be cautious... this, after all, is the only ramen only joint in Vegas....

I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu with nitamago and extra char shu. My wife had the Shoyu with nitamago. We also had gyoza. In the kitchen, there are basically 2 guys preparing the dishes. One guy that does the ramen, another that does the fried rice and others. And with the packed house, the service was slow.

But when the ramen finally came, I was not disappointed. Despite my doubts, the Tonkotsu Shoyu had a wonderful balance and marriage of pork and chicken broth. My wife's Shoyu, I believe due to the chicken stock, had a very mellow aspect to it which also gave the Tonkotsu a very mellow and non-overpowering flavor. I finished the broth to the last drop, including my wife's Shoyu\/Chicken broth.

The noodles... My thin noodles were not overcooked, and about just right when my ramen came out. But because of its thinness, by the time I got half way through my ramen (and I'm a relatively quick ramen eater, beating my wife by a good 10 minutes :-)) was way overcooked and mushy soft. Next time, I will see if they will cook it less (katame, or as I do at Kyushu Jyangara in Tokyo, bari-kata... crispy as in ironed with starch). My wife's chijirimen was very good with good amount of al dente,a and the chewiness one expects in good ramen.  If I can't get them to cook the thin noodles to super al dente, then my backup plan is to have them use the thick noodles in the Tonkotsu ramen.

The boiled egg is soft boiled, but the yolk does not run. I like my soft boiled egg a with a bit more runny yolk. But nevertheless it was still good. The Char shu was one the the better ones I had in the states. very tender, melts in your mouth, with good flavor... not too over powering, not too bland. The slices were on the thin side, but I got a total of 8 slices by ordering the extra char shu topping ($2.50). 

In summary both the Tonkotsu Shoyu and Shoyu ramens were done very well, with a good balance of broth, noodles, and toppings in a dish that came together very very well. Too many times, I have been to ramen places in the states where the broth may be good, but noodles lack, or vice versa, or even where all the individual ingredients are good, but the finished product just doesn't cut it.

The gyoza, unlike one reviewer here, I though were also very good. I would beg to differ that this is not like store bought gyoza as it is stuffed with pork whereas the store bought ones are more heavy on the nappa cabbage and not stuffed. The flavor is also very good, however, I like my gyoza wet...that is with a bit more juice as you bite into them.

In the end though, I give Monta 5 stars even with the few deficiencies. Monta, in my book, share the top honors with Orenchi in Cupertino,",1,0,0

The gyoza was too greasy but tasted good.  The tonkatsu ramen was delish!  The broth was white, cloudy, flavorful and less greasy than the shoyu and the noodles were thinner.  
The shoyu would be perfect for a  hangover.  The broth was darker, clearer, greasier, and saltier than the tonkatsu.  The ramens come with some green onions, and two pieces of tender pork.

This place is popular with the locals and frequent Vegas visitors.  The hype is no bull and regrettably if you arrive after 5 pm, there are clusters of hungry ass people waiting for an open seat outside & inside.  And dammit, I will wait.

You cannot go wrong ordering the shoyu ramen, unless you space and not ask for extra char siu aka ""juicy pork butt"".  To really have a ramen equivalent of the ""Calgon-take-me-away"" dreaminess, get extra char siu, egg, nori, menma (marinated bamboo shoots).  Their broth has been made the traditional way.  Really good broth doesn't require lots of salt or shoyu, just enough to enhance its flavor.  I rarely finish the broth, since most places make it way too salty but I cleared my bowl here.

One tip I will mention is the ramen will come with basic garnish of  green onions.  I made the mistake of ordering it as an extra, and I got a mound of jullienne scallions which was a bit onion overkill.

Their gyoza is excellent, and compliments a bowl of ramen so don't forget that too.  On top of all that yumminess, super cute&sweet servers that are fast on their feet to clear a table so I can devour more ramen when need be.",4,2,2

A small restaurant that mainly focused on ramen with decor that was similar to that in anime, UNHEARD OF. I was blinded by Monta's kool-aid. However years later now and most likely because of the raging success Monta has on the Vegas valley, ramen proprietors came from the shadows and declared Vegas ready for legitimate ramen. For me a cause and effect of the boom is that Monta has fallen in the ranks of preference and not only because of taste, but from the swarm of different styles of ramen that became available. 

Sure Monta is not what it used to be pre-2012, but it is consistently now what it is. For myself it overwhelmingly salty, thin, and a lack of depth. That might not be the same for everyone, as I know that some of my friends do not particularly enjoy the thick rich broth from other providers. The chashu is more fat than anything else. Monta also consist of ridiculously long wait times, its insane to wait anything more than 15 minutes when a handful of options are only a 5 minute drive away. 

Although this may seem like a bash on Monta, I think that everyone should try it at least once (when the wait is not ridiculous), sort of paying tribute to Monta because without it, we (Las Vegas) would not have all delicious alternatives.

First off... Place is SUPER TINY. So expect a wait and make sure to write your name down. Even when it's not packed, it get packed pretty quickly... And because it's so tiny, it tends to get uncomfortable when it's packed... And that's uncomfortable on both the eating and waiting end. Eating coz all the tables are close, even the bar area is hardly comfortable elbow room for the seats next to each other. And also when it's a long wait and you're eating, you seriously feel like EVERYONE waiting is watching you eat to see how much longer you will be sitting down. Uncomfortable on the waiting end coz there's not much of a waiting area at all. If you have issue with confined spaces... Not the place for you my friend. 

The decor and seating does follow the more traditional Japanese ramen house with it being a small narrow restaurant, with wood tables and seatings. I noticed most if not all servers are Japanese so it keeps to the authenticity. Minus the Hispanic cooks lol 

The food is good. Price is definitely what keeps me coming back and dealing with the wait and tight space tho. The taste and flavors aren't mind blowing and it's nothing to rave about to your friends.  But it's definitely somewhere I can easily say ""I got the bill tonight"" without regretting it and feeling like I broke my wallet over a filling meal. I will say the portions are great for the cheap prices. 

My favorite actually is not the ramen here but the pork belly bowl. The pork belly is cooked just right; not over or under cooked and just the right amount of sauce in the right to compliment the flavors of the pork belly. For me... That's the ticket item that has me returning. Plus another good point is service is fairly quick... BUT they have to be... They need their customers revolving in and out to accommodate for lack of space. 

Tbh the location in Henderson is better. Just this area is closer to my house than Henderson. The ramen can tend to be too salty for my palate... But again like I said it's not amazing but it's not terrible. But definitely worth going for the prices and the pork belly bowl! Nom nom nom",6,5,4

My parents live locally and they'd heard from several sources about how great this place was, so when we were visiting, we took them out to Monta.

We managed to get there at the perfect time because only 1 table was occupied, so getting my dad in was quick and easy (he is in a wheelchair).  They don't have hot drinks, so enjoy some UCC Oolong or Green Tea or a can of Calpico (I wish they had UCC Iced Coffee!!)  We placed our order and watched as the crowd built up very quickly.  Food arrived fast and piping hot.

The gyoza was fine - crunchy on one side, steamed on the other, hot all the way through.  My mom and hubs got the pork belly bowls and my dad and I got the miso ramen (I got mine with corn)

The charsiu\/chashu\/chasyu (how ever you want to spell it) WAS SO AMAZING - I do not use this phrase lightly.  It was LITERALLY melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  The pork fat was flavorful and rich and just melted away when it hit your tongue.  So amazing!  I am sad that I didn't stop and order a side of it immediately.

The ramen noodles had a great chewy texture and the miso broth was delicious.  My mom was very pleased with the pork belly bowl, as well.

The only thing that didn't live up to everything else was the mentaiko bowl.  I got it because I love hot rice and tarako (and my mom had made some for me the night before and I was still jonesing for it).  Unfortunately, the rice was not very hot and a little on the dry side, so the bowl was disappointing.  I ladeled some of the miso broth into the bowl and that made the rice more palatable, but it messed with the flavor of the mentaiko.

All in all, it was a great experience and I can't wait to go to Vegas again so I can go to Monta again! 

**ACCESSIBILITY NOTE - The parking lot is not very wheelchair friendly and Monta itself can be a little tight to try to get a wheelchair in and out.  The only wheelchair ramp up from the parking lot is blocked by the car when you park in the handicapped space, so once you get the person into their chair, you have to move the car to get them up to the sidewalk level where the restaurants are.",2,0,0

My husband ordered a bowl of ramen, but I can't remember what he had. It was either Tonkotsu Ramen or Miso Ramen, although I think it's the former. 

I ordered the pork belly rice bowl, and it was great! There was a good portion of marinated soy pork belly on top of a bed of rice, and I gobbled it up so quickly. It helps that I am a fan of pork belly :)

Long: I'm a very critical person who isn't impressed very easily. Most of my reviews on Yelp have 3, and the rare 4 stars. This is worth 5 stars. 
I went here with a friend, were a couple minutes late and had to wait. It's not in the best place in the shopping center, but doesn't matter much. Get here when they open if you don't want to wait.
We ordered their specialty Tankatsu ramen, and was served within 10 minutes (very quick). Noodles were packaged, but very good. The roasted pork on top was thin, but tender and flavorful. The rest of the toppings; mushrooms and bamboo shoots and green onion helped the ramen nicely. What makes it all go together was the soup stock. Amazing. 
On top of that, for $7 the price is totally right. Not too cheap, not too expensive. And worth every penny.

Like other reviews compare, the only contender to Monta Ramen is Sora Ramen. I suggest Monta first, definitely. I believe it's on an entire different level than Sora. But, Sora's extra cost does get you more: Thicker meat, more soup, a tad bit better topping, but the noodles and soup stock isn't as good.

Second visit: Still amazing. Had the mini mentaiko bowl. It was good, and a nice side.
Third visit: Still amazing.

Monta is well-known for their pork and chicken broth or the combination of the two. Had the tonkotsu ramen with thin noodles in pork broth included two slices of pork chashu, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, green onions and an addition of nitamago (marinated soft boiled egg).

Even though a bunch of cheap skates were at Big Wong, this tiny dining room at  Monta was still almost filled to capacity, but still; I found a seat the the counter area. 

The waitress was very impressive, and had it down on helping almost everyone in the dining room, while still taking care of take outs orders.  On the down side, looking how Monta menu is set up,  they have a nickel and dime effect on how you make an order with them.   Never  in my life I would thought of a eating a 12.00 bowl of Ramen which happen that day.

The Tonsoku stock was pretty good, and ramen could have been cooked a little bit longer, but the thought of paying extra for the corn, nori, boiled egg, and extra noodles kind of got to me.    Don't get me wrong,  I thought  Monta had  the best Tonsoku ramen in Las Vegas, because there wasn't any real competitors at that time.   My only thought going through my mind was if Monta had to match up with Ezogeku in Hawaii (which is pretty good)   This comparison would be like Godzilla battling Pee Wee Herman, because Ezogeku would  waste this place in a heartbeat for quality and value.  That's pretty sad to say a ramen-ya in Hawaii has a better overall package than this so-called Las Vegas heavyweight.. 

I never understood why anyone would wait two hours in line to eat  here, because currently  in Las Vegas there more than a few Ramen-ya that recently opened recently and all of them can trade punches with Monta.  In fact, I don't think this place has the best ramen in the Chinatown area, and for sure Monta isn't the best Japanese establishment in this shopping complex.   Take my advice, walk fifty step to the east in the parking lot, and go there.   Sorry Monta,  in my opinion your product doesn't justify the price and the time wasted.  Also, please take a lesson from your neighbor next door, and keep everything clean in the back room.  Getting nailed with a MAJOR health violations from the Southern Nevada Health District is quite an embarrassment.    I""m Japanese, and know more than a thing or two about Ramen.   In my opinion, Monta is now just in a middle of the pack for Las Vegas ramen scene.  Don't believe in the hype.

I have also tried the gyoza and kimchi fried rice. Both very good, although I would prefer if they chopped the onions a tad bit smaller but I'm not complaining too much about it.

I have lived in Japan so I know what real quality Japanese ramen tastes like. I had their shoyu tonkatsu ramen and the noodles were half cooked and the broth was horrible.  They have instant ramen at mitsuwa or greenland for Vegas that tastes better than this crap! They put 2 small slices of meat and thats it. You have to pay for an egg and any other garnish.

Surprisingly it tasted almost exactly the same as it did at the festival! Except the portions were a little bit bigger.  I got the Spicy Tonkatsu ramen and added an extra egg for 50 cents.

I would also recommend the pork belly rice bowl (just get a small its plenty enough).

I came on a Friday at 11:45am - just 15 mins after they opened and they were completely full. This is not surprising since this place is super tiny. I had a party of 5 and we only waited about 15 mins, not bad of a wait at all..especially for Ramen!

In addition to the traditional Japanese greeting by the staff as you come in and an open kitchen view of the chefs preparing the food, what struck me was the significant number of older Japanese business men who had come in with their suits folded against their shoulders on a blistering hot summer day to order a steaming bowl of noodles!  That clued me in this was perhaps the real deal.

Being my first time here, I went with the Tonkatsu ramen, which is ramen in pork broth stewed for several hours.  Bonus points for speed since I could have sworn my entree arrived within 2 minutes from the time I ordered.  Step one is tasting the broth:  the broth was at once unctuous and velvety smooth with intense flavors of marrow and porkified goodness without seeming overtly greasy\/oily.  

Moving onto the noodles, there should definitely be some spring when you chew on the noodles and these were definitely on par with the other places I've visited with just the right amount of ""al dente"" and some umami embedded within the noodles themselves.  

Finally there's the pork which is marinated in soy and cut paper thin with a thin lining of fat that has condensed into a perfect strip of pork belly perfection that is just right for the creamy broth it is bathed in since any more would cause the pork to loose it's distinct note.  The basic order also includes some bamboo shoots and kikurage (japanese seaweed) and it is a steal of a deal at 6.99, but I think what would have completed my experience was the addition of a few toppings such spring onions or mustard greens (for a few bucks more) to cut through the richness of the broth and add some additional textures and color.  There is also the option to add a hard-boiled egg or to get an extra serving of noodles if you're needing something more substantial.

All in all, definitely an authentic joint that measures up to the greats and will be somewhere I will frequent again and again especially during the colder months.",2,1,2

Food flavor and quality-always was and will be 5 star. It's incredible and I crave it. 

Wait time-average. 3.5 stars.

Quantity of food-5 star. You get tons of food. I usually get two meals out of one order that I take to go.

Parking-BLOWS. 1 star. Barely ever any room. You're better off parking on that side street.

Atmosphere\/building- 2 stars. Cramped, tiny. They really need to expand and fast.

Service- 0 stars. I've only had to come in here once and I don't know if I'll be back based on this alone, no matter how damn good it is. 
We walk in to a cramped\/stuffed area full of people waiting- a patron is nice enough to tell me I have to ""sign my name on the pedestal"". I said ""I just want it to go"" and she didn't say anything, just kind of awkwardly looked at me. I didn't sign it. All those people got seated. After waiting about 10 more min of not being acknowledged, a waitress finally asked if I was waiting for a party of people, I said no, I just want to order to go. She came back 5 min later with a menu. I told her I already know what I wanted-she was already at a table next to me saying ""yes, they were first"". I'm aware, hence the reason they're at a table. 

At that moment in time I was ready to explode ""could someone just fvcking tell me what I'm supposed to do to order to go so I'm not standing here like an asssh*le??!?!?!""
I was furious by the time I left. I couldn't be courteous anymore. If this is how noodle houses in Las Vegas go, they are all run sloppy and poorly organized, then white-girl-me can't deal with this, count me out. I sincerely hope other noodle-based places aren't like this, because now I really have motivation to try other ones.

Perhaps to avoid confusion, I should take an asian friend with me to break the barrier a little? I heard once that it's because Monta waitresses don't understand English well-this does not excuse the poor execution of guest-ferrying and certainly doesn't welcome new people to the establishment.",1,2,0

I'm a big fan of David Chang of Momofuku fame.  I have his cookbooks and just received his first issue of ""Lucky Peach"", an awesome quarterly magazine.  This particular issue of the LP focuses on ramen and the way it's adored and eaten and made in Japan.  Different broths and combinations of broths and perfectly cooked noodles and various garnishes and seasonings that adorn th bowls of love that are slurped in thousands of little ramen houses tucked into the most unassuming little nooks and crannies throughout Tokyo.

Anywho, I've been geeking over ramen literature and got to thinking maybe it was high time I got back to Monta to try to get me a bowl.  The last and only time I tried to get a bowl the wait was half an hour at 2pm in the dead heat of the summer.  There are only around a dozen and half seats up in there so it can be hard to snag one.

This time I waited for my bowl and I'm glad I did.  So good!  Only 3 different bowls on the menu.  I love that.  In ramen joints in Japan the ramen masters only serve one thing, ramen, and do it for decades.  It's artistry and perfection.

Shoyu Ramen- Brown and clear color broth, based on a chicken and vegetable stock with plenty of soy sauce added resulting in a soup that's tangy, salty, and savory yet still fairly light on the palate. Added a seasoned hard boiled egg to the soup.

For $6.95 they hook it up with a large bowl filled with equal amounts of broth and noodles. The seasoned hard boiled egg was delish and not dry or rubbery. Added some garlic paste and that soup was the biznass!!

1. Shoyu- Soy sauce-based broth, pretty salty and nothing spectacular, average

2. Miso- miso-based broth, salty but not overwhelmingly so, pretty run-of-the-mill miso ramen

3. Tonkotsu- pork flavored broth, savory, and has a creamy texture. The soup's thick consistency is due to boiling pork bones, collagen, and fat for a long period of time. Some people find the thickness of the savory broth distasteful and unsettling. If you're not a fan of a thick soup, I would skip this one. Definitely one of my favorite broths to get here.

4. Tonkotsu-Shoyu- best of both worlds, the tonkotsu and shoyu work well to balance each other out. The shoyu waters down the tonkotsu so it's not as thick and the tonkotsu adds a bold, fuller flavor to the shoyu. This is definitely Monta's signature ramen and a must try.

Additional Toppings: Some of the toppings are noticeably more expensive compared to other local ramen joints that already include these toppings in their ramen.

Additional Notes: 
*If you order extra noodles (Kaedama), it comes in a separate bowl usually in the middle of the meal. It's been heated up so your noodles are still delicious even if your broth is not as hot as in the beginning. 
* There are two types of noodles to choose from: thick cup ramen style noodles (that definitely taste nothing like those horrible cup noodles) or a thinner noodle similar to Chinese egg noodles (not the noodle that usually comes with wonton noodle soup). I definitely prefer the thicker noodles; the thinner ones tend to be overcooked easily and soggy. 
*There is a $10 minimum on credit cards. Bring cash if you don't plan to spend more than that.
*They will not sit you at a table unless your whole party is present.

Overall:

So far, Monta has the best ramen in Vegas. (Still need to try Anime Ramen, and Fukumimi though.) It's just the thing that hits the spot on a cold chilly night when you need some warming up. 

Service varies depending on how busy they are. Bar seating may get uncomfortable for some but that's how traditional ramen houses are: small and cramped. Seating is very limited so anticipate a wait if you're coming during peak hours. 

The consistency of the ramen sometimes varies as well. Sometimes the chashu is over done, resulting in a dry piece of meat that doesn't have that heavenly gelatinous soft layer of fat that melts in your mouth. Also, the noodles sometimes come out too soft if they've been sitting there for a while. Once in a while, the yolk of the hard boiled egg will be completely solid, with none of that ooey gooey goodness. These hiccups happen rarely, only when they're extremely busy and it's during peak hours. Portions are decent sized for a regular person. If you're a gluttonous fatty like me, it's better to share fried rice (which is quite delicious) with a buddy.

Overall, despite the ridiculous wait sometimes and food consistency issues, Monta is definitely a must try for locals and tourists.",1,1,1

But the thing is, ""I'm definitely not a Ramen-guy!"" 

Because I'm not contented with just noodles, flavored broth, diced meat and\/or vegetables in a bowl. 

It's been a LONG while since I've had a bowl of Ramen....even before 9\/11 to be exact (yeah, that long).  

I met up with a bunch of friends in Las Vegas and each of us ordered one of the restaurant's tasty Ramen Noodle. I ordered the Chashu and Tonkatsu Ramen Noodle Bowl. For $6.95, it's not a bad price and had slices of Chashu and noodles in a flavorful Miso soup. The soup\/meal was actually pretty good and comforting. This bowl of soup would definitely warm me up in a cold winter night in San Francisco. 

I got my ramen soup very fast and the service was also good.

Friends used credit cards for their meals. But I paid my meal in cash.",10,5,5

That means as soon as guests are finished and make their way towards the exit, staff is there immediately to clean up and prep the table for the next people to be seated. 

Major upside to the ramen here. It's very good and still super affordable even after adding extra pieces chashu and an egg. As for my bowl of ramen? One of the best bowls I've had. Flavorful broth and the noodles were at that perfect thickness with good texture. Monta Ramen is worth a try.",2,0,2

For those not in the know, I've been a ramen-iac since I was 12 and first learned how to cook myself a cup o' noodles. I spent several summers as a gawky teenager watching cartoons and gobbling noodles like a fiend. Over the years, and through thousands of packets of freeze-dried noodles I slurped onward. Kimchi flavor, Maruchan, Nissan, yam-noodles, dandan mien and instant jjangmyun, my adoration for the comfort of a big steaming bowl of chewy noodles drenched in broth steadily growing. I've tried Ichiza's, Shuseki's and making it myself- this tops the list. Ichiza's was close, but this place will most likely be my number one noodle-spot this winter. 

Coming up to the restaurant, I wouldn't have thought it was open if it weren't for the neon sign saying so. There's plenty of parking and it's right across the street from the shopping center with Shuseki. 

I sat at the bar as I was having lunch alone and wanted to see the action. One chef would feel out the proper amount of fresh noodles per bowl, roughly a fistful, and drop them into the boiling cauldron of water. On the other side was a large kettle of broth steaming away, ready at a moment's notice. In the background several men worked on various other tasks involving the pork and other side dishes. At the front of the bar was the Vegas Weekly magazine that mentioned them, as well as a Good-luck Kitty, which I thought was cute.

Today, I opted for the miso. At first I couldn't decide- I'd tried the miso flavors at other establishments, so should I continue the trend for consistency of comparison, or deviate and expand my horizons further. I opted for the miso with nitamago, or egg. It didn't take long before my noodles were politely presented to me.

The broth: Super porky. No MSG taste at all. Rich miso flavor-seemed like it was all white [sweet] miso. Great depth of flavor, with an intense, buttery mouth feel. Hit all the right notes and was intensely satisfying. Tastes like homemade.

Noodles: Al dente egg noodles. Chewy and lots of them! Much better than anything instant with great slurpability. 

The egg: Beautifully cooked, creamy and custardy, it added an entirely new level of complexity to the broth and had an exceptional texture. Ichiza's eggs are close, but the one I had here was supple and gelatinous, cooked slowly and well. It was easily the best egg I've had in a restaurant this year. 

Pork: My bowl came with 2 slices of succulent, fall-apart tender pork. I could pull bite-size pieces off using my chopsticks. Thousands of times better than the terrifying piece of pork we were served at Shuseki. The pieces were thin, but I was satisfied with the amount I was given. You can always order more if you're willing to pay the additional charge. 
 
Extras: The ramen comes with bamboo shoots, a few pieces of mushroom and a mountain of green onion. You can also add minced garlic paste, benishoga [red pickled ginger], sesame oil, furikake mix, sesame seeds, what looked like vinegar & a couple of other options are available either through the menu or asking your server.

I found the portion large enough for a late brunch, tiding me over for hours and powering me through a trip to the dog park with 3 rowdy puppies. I'm extremely satisfied and happy with the meal I had here, and I bragged to several of my friends. I'm looking forward to trying the shoyu flavor next, as well as trying the spicy greens with it. 

I'll be back very soon!",4,0,1

I fell in love after the first steaming mouthful.  Since then, I've been trying to find somewhere that can match California's quality, and so far, Monta is the closest I've come in Las Vegas.

I judge a ramen place by their tonkatsu ramen; its the most basic and traditional type.  If they can make tonkatsu, the shoyu and miso are bound to be good.  Such is the case with Monta.  The tonkatsu is creamy and savory, with just the right amount of salt.  Make sure to get a nitamago in there as well; it definitely adds to the texture and flavour.

Kimchi rice is meh, it wasn't as kimchi-y as I would have liked it to be.

FYI: they have different noodles for each broth. The miso ramen has a thicker, chewier noodle (dericious) while the tonkatsu ramen has a thinner noodle that I didn't really care for. I didn't do this, but you could probably ask for the thicker noodle + the tonkatsu broth!

After a two days of almost non-stop clubbing adventure and drinking for a bachlorette party we were seeking a hangover cure.

Of course split amongst 10 girls + the extra 3 bottles of ""blow job shots"" and ""scooby snax shots"" that resided in our hotel.

I never understood that. Also the patrons here are rude. Another party arrived and tried to CUT INFRONT OF US. To get in. WTF VEGAS? SCUMBAGS NO?

Anyways, the ramen here is comparable to some very phenomenal ramen joints in Japan. The Ramen mecca. It could go head to head to Santouka ramen and probably kick their ass easy.

I have recently lost my hope for ramen so this place was actually better than I expected. The broth was a bit too salty for my taste but the chashu was really good. The noodles weren't bad. 

The gyoza was really good. It was crispy and the inside of it was juicy and perfectly seasoned. The skin wasn't too thick so it had that perfect crispy to it when you bite into it. 

The Kimchee Fried rice was the shiitttt. No joke. I think I'm gonna have dreams about the kimchee fried rice to be honest. It was moist and tasty. So much seasoning to it and there's little kick to it from the kimchee. There are restaurants that makes it super dry but Monta made it perfectly. Obviously it is oily, but it is seriously bomb-diggity good. It was sooooo good that we ordered a to-go right before we left and we ate it at midnight. We ate it cold cause there was no microwave in the hotel but it was still so damnnn good.

I would seriously come back only to get the fried rice...I'm really curious about the takana fried rice too. Service was actually really good and I actually gave Monta a 4 just because of the fried rice...or else I would probably give it a two stars. 

The lesson is...you come early to avoid the wait, you get the fried rice, and be happy with life.",0,0,0

My husband and I finally decided to try Monta. We heard from a few friends that this was one of the best noodle houses in town. We stopped in on a Monday at around 12:30 pm. It was crowded, but we were able to get seated right away since a few parties left at the same time. The restaurant is really tiny. I saw the sign on the wall that said the seating capacity was only 26 people. We sat at the bar, which was kind of cool because I got to the see the employees preparing the ramen in their kitchen. 

Sadly, I was disappointed. I ordered the Shoyu Ramen. I'm not sure if we just came in on a bad day, but I thought the noodles were too hard and the broth didn't have much flavor at all. Also thought the Chasu was weird. It was easy to eat because it was sliced very thin, but I did not like that slimy ring of fat around it. My husband felt the same way about his Tonkatsu Ramen. 

Service was not the best either. The employees were slow with drink refills and they seemed to be more attentive to the larger parties in the restaurant. We waited a long time for our bill after eating.

We explained we were expecting hot tea and were told they don't have any hot tea. So we asked for water with lemon but were told they don't have lemon. I ended up ordering a diet coke and my wife stuck with plain water

Things went smoother from there.

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen with egg, nori, and mustard greens. It was good, salty.

My wife ordered the Tonkatsu shoyu ramen with egg and green onion. It was also good and less salty than mine.

I highly recommend getting the eggs. It was a great addition to both. Beyond that, choose what you like.

Overall, I preferred my wife's ramen and she preferred mine. We switched midway through though I was only halfway done and she'd finished two-thirds of hers. I got ripped off.

The service here is also very good. The food comes to you very quickly. The establishment is relatively small so if it gets busy it could take a while for seating.

They finally have a sign up so they're a bit easier to spot.
Anyway, I'm glad everyone else is liking this place.  I don't know why the bad reviews on the gyoza, because it's right up my alley.  And yes, they do use different noodles for the Tonkotsu ramen versus the others.  The tonkotsu ramen is Hakata style, and is known for the very thin, very delicious noodles.  They cook theirs a little more here than they do in Hakata, but it's still great.
Anyway, having tried the miso ramen, I'd say give this one a shot too.  It's their tonkotsu soup with miso added to give it a rich nutty flavor that really sticks to your ribs.
I also have to recommend the chahan (fried rice), it is super peppery and delicious.  Just the way I remember it from my highschool days in Japan.
A second note.  Anything you don't like on your ramen, let them know.  I keep going with picky eaters (1 vegan, others just picky), and they've made a vegan kimchi chahan, as well as bowls of ramen with extra this, no that, whatever you ask for.

It wasn't a surprise that the flavor was lacking when you only have a few components. You get two small slices of chashu and a few bamboo shoots. The tonkotsu-shoyu broth didn't have any depth of flavor. I had to ask for a second helping of noodles because the serving was so small. I didn't like the thin texture of the noodles. My friend asked for extra chili sauce for his spicy tonkotsu because it lacked the kick he was looking for. They said it was $1 extra.

Think rich and thick tonkotsu broth with an added black garlic oil that is immaculately fragrant and savory. You know it's been simmering for hours the moment that soup touches your lips and coats your mouth like silk. I tell you, it's delicious beyond words. Give in to the urge of adding that flavored egg for an extra $1.50 and some corn for $.50 more. The option to add butter is there if you think this bowl could use more fat than it already contains. Go ahead, I won't judge. The noodles are chewy with a good bounce to it however, the next time I'm here, I'm asking if they can substitute the thin noodles to the thick wavy ones they use for the miso ramen. It's just something I prefer and definitely not a deal breaker.

I've heard good things about the PORK BELLY BOWL (sm $3.95) and I concur. It's slices of tender pork with a sweet and salty marinade over white rice, and then topped with ginger and green onions. Only, after having the KIMCHI FRIED RICE ($6.95), there was no looking back at that pork bowl. The latter won my heart and palate as soon as a heaping spoonful made it to my mouth. Oh how I wanted to come back that same weekend for more. 

What's impressive too is the efficiency of the servers and kitchen. We sat, ordered, had our drinks, and before I could even say a word, our food trickled in just like that...boom, boom, boom!

I came here with a group of 5 once (all newcomers so I was trying to show off the place).  Luckily, we showed up right when they opened so we got seated right away.  We were all squished on a table that clearly should have supported only 4 full grown adults.  But the ramen is so tender, the broth so hearty and flavorful, and the boiled egg and yolk so delicious.

On another occasion, I came here for dinner with 1 other person and ended up waiting about 1.5 hours because the place is so darn busy and there aren't enough seats.  I kid you not.  Several times we thought about leaving but couldn't come up with an alternative ramen joint that was remotely as good.  It's absolute cruelty.

Also, they don't seat you unless your entire party is there.  And I wouldn't recommend going with a party bigger than 4 or it's almost impossible to find somewhere to sit.

I loved it!! The ponzu sauce for the cold noodle was very citrus and just right. I'm wondering if they are making the homemade ponzu at their place instead of using the sauce from the bottle :) The hint of sesame oil was really blended into the dish and I was happy with the amount of the vegetables that they served with the noodle. 

The chashu is a popular topping for the ramen, but I wanted to try with my rice this time. The chashu bowl comes with several piece of fried pork, chopped dried seaweed, and chopped green onion on top of rice. It was sooooo good!  I think I am sometimes very superstitions.

Everyone on here raving about how good it is, and too be completely honest, it was pretty tasty. Fact is though, my wife and I have STILL only been in the US for less than 1 month.... Soooo the Japanese ramen of our home, which is Japan lol, still is heavy on our pallet. 
Ok so I ENJOYED it. My wife said the soup (broth) was very good and very authentic. However, she had a problem with the noodles. She said the broth was real, the look was real, but it was kinda mind messing because the noodles were too soft for the kind she ordered. She used a bunch of Japanese words of course but I'm just giving the typical American consumer the gist. Taste is 3 stars, authenticity is 3-4 stars, seating is like wow, PACKED 24\/7. Price was fine... I mean, my wife felt bad for being critical about a ramen place and her Japanese blood came out when she stared being thankful instead for even being able to have Japanese food in this American desert. Her final decision was, for a western country, this was pretty solid ramen. 3 stars! 
So that's that. It's not the worst... And my American ass honestly doesn't know the one details and difference... So it's whatever.  Don't take my word for it... Thousands have reviewed this place. Do take my wife's word though... For America this is a 4 or 5 star... In reality (in Japan) this would be like a 2... Not the worst but in the homeland your ramen gotta be dope to compete. So this might sound harsh but just saying... OVERALL... It's worth it. If you can get in (always packed) please go in... If there's a long line (like out the door, which is common as this place is popular) walk catty corner to Curry Zen in same parking lot... Personally, Japanese curry is my FAV...

Never had been here before and we just searched up a Ramen place to try (since our favorite ramen joint closed down) and I would have to say that Monta Ramen is probably our new favorite. Their menu is small and simple, which I like because then I don't have to sit there forever trying to decide which one I want to order. I was able to see what they have and decide what I wanted quickly. We ordered the Tonkatu Shoyu and added an egg (extra $1.00-$1.50) and it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO yummy! We also ordered their fried rice and gyoza. All was delicious. 

The only downfall I have is that it is such a small restaurant that many people enjoy going to, so if you're there on a busy night.... most likely there will be a wait for a while and you'll be stuck waiting outside. (No inside seating area, hardly)

It was definitely worth the wait for us though. We enjoyed eating here and will be back again for sure.",1,1,1

I'm not a fan of fat on meats but there wasn't much in the slices and the fat was very edible. When I get meat at some Vietnamese or Korean places, I get scared but this was great.

When you get there, you need to sign the guest list if the place is full (which it will be).  We had four parties in front of us but they were gone within 10-15 minutes.  We sat at the counter on hardwood stools which were not very comfortable.  The tables had padded chairs.  I'll be requesting a table next time.

Came here based on the awesome reviews. Showed up a little after 1pm on a weekday. We waited easily more than an hour. This place is super tiny, but the turnover seemed as speedy as it could be. It was cold outside and there was no shelter from the cold. I would NEVER wait to eat at this place during the HEAT of summer!!! Impossible!!! 

When we finally got seated, our orders were taken promptly. Surprised to find a little cubby to stash my stuff under the bar!!! Clever!!! I LOVED my Sapporo on tap. Sitting at the bar gave us a bird's eye view on how the food, especially the pork roasts were prepared. The logs of pork roasts were seared on something that looks like a huge George Forman grill. Oh!!!!! If you could only hear the sizzle of the hot grill & the smell the wonderful umami flavor of roast pork!!! The roasts are then placed into an oven and cooked until tender. This pork is then cut into nice generous slices to garnish the ramen or cut up into the fried rices. I take the time to mention what I witnessed because you feast not only with your palate but also with your other senses as well. I love that they roasted the pork & didn't just boil or steam them to oblivion. This is probably what makes this ramen house so yummy...the care in how the pork is prepared. 

What we ordered...

Spicy Tonkotsu ramen...the most popular ramen on Yelp. Also highly recommended by those drooling to get in. I hear that corn & butter add-ons are a must!! 
The broth was delicious, the ramen noodles were cooked perfectly, and the ramen was garnished with nice big round slices of roast pork. In most ramen houses, the chasu is often half fat... although there is nothing wrong with some good fat. These slices were mostly meaty. Yay!!! 

Pork belly bowl...also popular on Yelp, but the pork in my bowl wasn't crispy at all. Good, but not as good as the....

Kimchee fried rice....surprisingly VERY GOOD!! I am usually skeptical to order ""Korean"" items at Japanese restaurants and vice versa, but it tasted SO GOOD!!! The big juicy pieces of pork made the rice so decadent!!! Yum!!!!

I didn't take off any stars for the wait...they can't help that they're a fabulous popular place!!! :D",0,0,0

They did give us two extra because initially they only gave us five because the chef had dropped the sixth one on the floor so they had to only serve us five at first.

However, I was so disappointed by my last visit at Monta that I feel like there needs to be some sort of review on the service. I have here many times because their food is good...not just good, but craveable. It's also a good value for the price and it never takes long to cook. 

But that's not the problem at Monta. The problem is the service or lack of thereof. I visited today, April 28th, 2017 around 1pm. There were two cooks on, two servers, and all seats were filled. Everyone had their food and nothing was being cooked. I put my name on the list. A lady that was waiting before me kept looking around. After a few minutes she left, looking distraught. No one greeted us. I tried several times to catch the attention of the younger waitress but she kept looking away. I sat down. Stood up. Tried speaking to her when she was three inches away from me and refilling waters. She ignored me. I understand if this place is busy that she might not have the time, but she did. The cooks were cooking a thing. Everyone was eating. Not even a hello. All I wanted to do was order food to go. Finally I literally stared here straight across the room and said ""excuse me."" She came over with reluctance like I was going to ask her why I couldn't have a seat sooner. When I said I wanted to order to-do she immediately took my order. I was out of there in less than 5 minutes from this point.

Just remember, people come for the food but return for service. 

On one of my last visits I witnessed another young waitress scream at a patron who had ordered over the phone. She confirmed her order with him but he said he ordered something different. He did seem very confused but she basically humiliated him in front of the whole restaurant. She changed his order for him but said that the price would not change. I understand that this is frustrating as someone who works both a job in customer service and a second job in the restaurant industry. But this is no way to handle a simply fixable mistake.

I am simply giving feedback as a customer on my experience. This place with continue to be successful because of it's delicious food. As for me, I will look elsewhere for my ramen. I will stop recommending this place to my friends. Las Vegas has countless restaurants, why should I go somewhere where I feel unwelcomed and hassled?

This little ramen shop was located in the China Town area of Vegas.  There are actually a few other asian things in this plaza.  I was happy we found this spot.  It's a legit Japanese Ramen place, we tried the Kuru ramen which was black and garlicy. I thought it was good, not amazing, but something different.  You don't get to select how firm you want your noodles, I felt they were on the firm side so if you like that.  Price is good, I think about $6.75 for a bowl of ramen and you can get refills on noodles if you wish.  You can also add additional toppings like egg, etc.  

What was a must-do was getting a side of the pork belly bowl.  Think of it as an upgraded Yoshinoya beef bowl.  Instead, it's pork belly, the taste is strong juicy.  It is a little much to get ramen and a small side of pork belly bowl but I wouldn't have it any other way.

If you had food in Japan and expect this place to be 100% authentic then you may be dissapointed. But if you eat it for what it is then I can promise you that you will not be dissappointed.

It's like when you have expectations before you watch a movie at the theatre, then you will most likely be let down. But if you watch it for what it is then you will enjoy it, unless the movie completey sucks.

I had the ""Shoyu Ramen"" with extra noodles, and the additions of the egg and pork. The broth was rich with lots of flavor, but the best part was the pork. It was so succulent and flavorful. I recommend adding the chili powder and the sesame seeds to your soup for even more flavor.

Service was great and the food is served quickly. Only downside is the price, since all toppings for the ramen are extra charge, so by the time you add on 1-3 toppings you're looking at an average price of about $13 for a bowl. The restaurant is also very small, so prepare to wait for a while if the they're busy, which is most of the time.

If you love ramen, authentic or not, definitely check this place out, it'll be worth your time.

SPICY TONKOTSU RAMEN $8 - The ramen noodles were pretty good, but the soup was way too fatty for me. I usually love fatty ramen soup but the soup here is ridiculously thick. Drinking the soup alone will fill you up. I also don't think the spicy version of the tonkotsu ramen is worth it, since it's $1 more than the regular version and not very spicy at all. I had to add extra spicy powder and oil.

Extra noodles are $1.50 and if you want to share, I suggest just getting 1 bowl and adding extra noodles to split. This way you basically get two bowls of ramen for $10.

FRIED RICE $6 - Pretty good, but not worth it for $6.

TAKANA FRIED RICE $7 - Expensive! Save your money and get ramen instead. This also tasted like mushrooms.

Be prepared to wait, because this place is really popular, even when it's hot outside. The restaurant itself is pretty tiny, with only a couple of tables and a bar area.

My cousins decided for me, this was a good place to meet up a old acquaintance they have not seen in a long time. This place is decorated simply with a wooden bar really dominates the place. Got here about 8pm, luckily my cousin snagged a table since the place filled up fast. The menu here is pretty simple, ramen, sides, rice dishes and thats about it. I had the Tonkatsu with the premium green onions and the four of us split orders of Gyoza, Kim Che fried rice, large order of Pork Belly over rice and the Fish Eggs over rice (the name escapes me). Everything was very delicious. About the best I've had in a while including places on Sawtelle Blvd in West LA, known for its large Japanese population. 

Pros: Ramen was a nice al-dente with good chew, broth was very savory it definitely had that umami kick to it. Service was quick.
Cons: The Gyoza skin was a little too burned on bottom and under cooked on top. Limited seating could be a future PITA.",1,0,1

We've had the spicy tonkotsu ramen and tonkotsu shoyu ramen. They serve most of their ramen selection with thin noodles. I found it interesting that their broth offerings were differentiated by chicken, pork, or a combo or both. The spicy tonkotsu ramen comes with pork broth, spicy sauce, and thin noodles - the exact same as the tonkotsu ramen, but with a $1 spicy sauce extra fee. It was alright - a less creamy and oily than usual. The tonkotsu shoyu ramen is a mix of pork and chicken broth, and comes with thin noodles - the broth flavor was quite light, a lot less creamy than what I am used to (which I appreciated), had a slight syrupy consistency, and got pretty salty towards the end. The chashu pieces were extremely tender and fragile - so much that the pieces fell apart upon being picked, which was funny - I enjoyed them, but they were also thin and small slices. They also had an interesting dark brown jelly-like coating on the edges. The kikurage mushrooms and bamboo shoots were finely chopped and good and plentiful, and the amount of fresh green onions was generous. We also ordered kaedama, which was also a generous extra portion of noodles, and which basically used up the rest of the soup within the original bowl of ramen.

Overall, I prefer many other ramen places. However, you get great value at this place especially since you can currently grab a bowl of ramen for $7. The creaminess of tonkotsu broths I am used to is replaced by saltiness, which became too intense at the end. This experience can be easily skipped, but nowadays it's tough to find ramen at this good of a price.

I came here with friends and didn't choose the place so I didn't know it was not vegetarian friendly. Sadly that meant I couldn't partake in the ramen but I settled for fried rice (not the restaurant's fault I'm vegetarian after all). 

I ended paying about $6.00 for a tiny serving of rice. Mind you, I got a size that was supposedly a full meal. When I asked the waitress to substitute the ham for egg, corn, or anything vegetarian friendly, she refused. Instead, she insisted I pay extra for each of those items. 

I have never been to a place less accommodating to dietary restrictions in my entire life. I've also never been to a place that would charge me extra for a substitute that would be cheaper than the meat that comes with the meal. For the rudeness and inflexibility combined with a tiny and expensive portion of rice that was ordinary at best, I can't give this place any more stars.

My friend didn't like the chashu (pork) so much because she felt it was a weird texture thing but I loved it, put extra in mine and took hers, so my gain! Tonkatsu noodles were good, and the egg was good but you had to let it sit in the hot broth for awhile, otherwise you'd realize that they tossed a cold egg in there. Service was good, very friendly and nice.

The biggest cons were the size and the temperature.

My black garlic ramen with extra egg was so good I am thinking about it until  now. The broth had depth of flavor and I relished every single spoonful. The noodles were al dente and tasted fresh and went well with the black garlic seasoning, I can eat it all day long. No regrets after I decided to be adventurous and try black garlic anything for the first time. Now on to the Gyoza - they were pillows of soft savory goodness with a slight crunch from being pan friend. The meat was lightly seasoned and was perfect with a lil bit of chili oil and soy sauce dipping sauce. The pork belly bowl was a good sized bowl (I ordered a small) and hit all the right spots with the tender pork belly coupled with the fragrant rice. It was the best $45 meal I have ever had in my entire life. I wish there was one in Houston. I am dreaming of coming back to Vegas just for this. And oh, don't even think about saving it for next day.

We started with the Fried Rice. It comes in a regular or small size and since 3 of us were sharing, we ordered the regular. The portion isn't very big so if you want a lot I suggest ordering 2. It had tons of flavor and even chopped pieces of chashu. We all loved it and it was a nice compliment to our ramen.

My choice was the Miso Ramen. It consists of a pork and chicken broth with miso and medium-thick wavy noodles. I was determined to choose a ramen with those noodles instead of the thin ones, and I am glad I did. The noodles had just the right amount of chew, the chashu was tender, and the broth was packed with flavor. You must add the flavored egg. It was tasty, although it would be nice if they had the option for a poached egg. 

A flavorful and unique choice is the Kuro Ramen Black Garlic Oil. It has tonsssss of roasted black garlic and a taste unlike anything I have tried before.

The tonkatsu (pork) soup base is wonderfully complex and rich, and quite frankly some of the best broth I have ever had.  You can tell they took great care in preparing this soup base.  By the way they even pre-warm the soup bowls before putting your ramen bowl together!

Mixed with strips of seaweed and bamboo shoots, and charsiu, this would be great on a cold winter day (or even a hot summer day like I had it).  The noodles were a little different from what I am used to.  They were a little thinner, light, and with a clean finish.

At first glance it looked like this little noodle shop was going to have a very long wait. However, we did not have to wait too long even with people waiting outside. There are not many seats, but this is not really the place to linger for long. Most people seem to leave fairly quickly once they are done. My friend and I sat at the counter and had fun watching the bustling kitchen while we waited for our ramen. The seating may feel cramped for some people, but I really liked the busy, controlled chaos feel of it. 

On to the good stuff. I ordered the Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen with the regular house fixings and my friend had the Shoyu ramen with thin noodles. I was instantly impressed with my choice as soon as I tried it. The broth was slightly creamy and full of flavor, the thin noodles cooked to the perfect point so they were not mushy at all. I found the soup very flavorful, but I had to add a liberal amount of chili oil since I like my ramen spicy. The Shoyu ramen was also very tasty, the clear beef broth had just as deep a flavor as my selection. We both had a can of green tea to drink, which was a refreshing counter to my spicy soup. My only gripe was the fact that I was not completely full when I left, which is mostly my own fault. They offer the option of extra noodles, which I will surely do next time. The gyoza and fried rice are also on the list to try in the future. 

Another great aspect is the price. The total bill for two bowls of ramen and two drinks was $18 and change. A great deal for any sit down place. Bottom line is that this place is a great option for a fun, cheap meal. I will definitely be going back.",0,0,0

*Oh yes...if you need a place to hang out or wait...I suggest the bar across the plaza...$4 beers and video casino games kept me entertained.

When we sat down, they had 2 specials: Kuro Ramen and Spicy Tonkatsu. Both sounded absolutely amazing...it took me a while to figure out which bowl I should get...but I finally came to a conclusion within minutes. I ORDERED BOTH!

In addition, I also ordered a bowl of Pork Belly with rice and a nice Sapporo to go with the meal. Oh yes, how could I forget...GETTING AN EGG IS A MUST!

The food came out...everything was heavenly. The noodle was firm to an appropriate al dente - ramen style. The broth wasnt too thick where it came off as a sauce.

Parking lot is pretty big. Service was good. The restaurant itself is super duper small. Like 5 tables and a bar area. 

Spicy Tonkotsu - $7.95 - Basicly the same thing as the tonkotsu but with a spoon full of a chili paste. I do not think that spoon full is worth the extra dollar they charge. The broth was clean and the spice was decent. Not to salty. I like the noodles. Had good bite. The chashu was over cooked, fell apart in the broth. I had to dig around for it.

Miso - $6.95 - Clean broth with good miso flavor. It was super salty. I did not like the noodles in this ramen. The texture reminded me of the dry bagged ramen. 
 
Corn - $.50 - Plain sweet corn. I like corn in my ramen. Good price.

Seasoned Egg - $1.50 - Basicly an egg seasoned with soy sauce. The yolk was good. Not worth the price though. 

BIG ISSUE. There was a hair in one of our ramens.GROSSS!!! Usually when there is a hair in your food, they replace it and do not charge you for it but they still charged us. That was a little annoying.

Initially, I didn't come here with much expectations because no other ramen places I've been to have impressed me as much as Ramen Dojo in NorCal. Knowing that the capacity of Monta Noodle House fit around 20 or so customers, I anticipated a wait so arrived 30 minutes before opening on a Friday afternoon. Arriving early got me a table right at opening...yay to that! so COME EARLY to avoid waiting. 

Monta Noodle House offers three different kinds of broth but I got a recommendation from one of their regular customers to order the tonkatsu-shoyu combo broth! The standard bowl comes with noodles, bamboo shoots, onions, and two pieces of pork. I wanted the ultimate ramen experience so I added on some extra stuff to spice up my bowl - I added the soft boiled egg (a must for every ramen bowl!), sweet yellow corn and shredded green onions (MUST add - gives great flavoring to the whole bowl). I also garnished my ramen bowl with the togarashi chili powder and sesame seeds! The addition of sesame seeds in the bowl was just perfect =) I have to say the best part about this place is the ramen that they used - the noodles were so soft & the thickness was about the size of egg noodles but with a softer texture. I definitely enjoyed this.They also give you plenty of noodles to fill you up real GOOD!

Never talk to anyone waiting the table then she split 7 of us to the table without even asking if that's what we want. By looking her bad attitude we just don't have appetite to eat there anymore.

It's a small and busy restaurant, and I recommend that you time yourself wisely...otherwise, you'll be stuck waiting outside under the Las Vegas sun. 

The wait was over and my cousins and I were finally able to sit in the well air conditioned room. Let the ramen begin.

I ordered their special- cold noodle with the mushroom, tomatoes, pork. The words 'cold' and 'noodle' shouldn't be in the same sentence, I know...but this is different. It was a refreshing blend of meats and veggies for the hot weather.
My cousins ordered the pork belly bowl, which is served with rice. To attempt..to even try to get close on its description..it's like Yoshinoya but 100 times better!
The other cousin got the miso based soup with an additional corn. It's so creamy and filled with flavor. 

I rarely head to the strip for food, instead take on adventures to find the best Asian places here in the desert. 

4 stars for their awesome food. But if I could, I'll give them a 3 for the seating capacity. I just don't like waiting.",0,0,0

There were maybe several competitors but not one jazzed me. Except enter Monta. Small booth tucked in a corner. No heavy signage just three folks sweatin in the polstering heat serving up what unbeknowst to me the best ramen showcasing. Found out that they have a location out in Las Vegas and decided to take some family members out there to give it a try.

Got there 30 minutes before they opened. All of us hungover from the night before, only to see that there is a line about to form! We turned off our engines parked and snagged in front of the line. in 30 minutes I kid you not, at least 40 others joined. Luckily we were in front. 

Starving and dehydrated. We ordered. I settled for the Spicy Tonkotsu with the added green onions, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage. Added additionally the Nori + Nitamago. (dry seaweed and hard boiled egg, respectively) some corn, etc. My gal got the Tonkotsu BLACK. and whoa. I've never had a ramen to that degree ever in my 30 years of life. What is this? A smoky flavored broth? almost like a bbq tang? THIS was my highlight. It was unusual. It was weird. But in the most gnarliest of ways a ramen can be. I highly recommend that one. 

fyi: their Chasu Bowl is one of the better ones I have experienced in all of CA. Definitely worth it as a side dish.

Though it is not up to what I have tried in Japan, it is pretty close. 

This is a small ramen shop at the back of a shopping centre. Max occupancy is probably give or take 25-30 people max with option to sit at the bar or table. Staff gives a very friendly welcome upon entry. A lot of times, this restaurant is quite busy. The restaurant has a nice warm feeling (not due to the heat from cooking) but it resembles some ramen shops i have tried and seen in Tokyo, Japan. 

Upon sight of the menu, the front cover has a little story of origins of ramen. When you see the selection of foods they provide, it is not much. This is one of the few places, that i really like, that don't offer a wide variety of foods. Not only do they specialize in what they offer, it is also the only thing they need because of how well made it is. 

They have three broth selections. Tonkotsu, which is a pork bone based broth (usually slowly boiled and simmered for many hours to create a white flavor-filled broth), Miso, and Shoyu (soy-sauce based). Being a fan of tonkotsu ramen, that was the first broth i had tried and loved. Price range for the different soup is i believe 6.95 - 7.95 with Shoyu and tonkotsu being $6.95 and Miso at 7.95 [don't quote me on the pricing but i do remember the miso being more expensive than tonkotsu for some reason... you'd think the one with more work (tonkotsu) would be more expensive]

They offer a variety of toppings ($1 - $2.50 each) you can choose to add to the ramen as well, ranging from extra pork, green onions, corn, butter, some green vegetable (forgot the name). Hearing great things about their pork, that was what i had ordered as an additional topping. There is also the option of getting extra noodles for a small fee of $2. 

Take note, there are two types of noodles they use between the 3 broths. I believe Tonkotsu uses one, while miso and shoyu uses another. They also offer sides like gyoza, pork over rice, etc. 

Upon arrival of food, i was amazed how well the ramen looked. The soup had a deep white color, pipping hot freshly made. The soup was not thin but not thick as well. Not sure how to explain, but it was a broth that looked to be filled of flavor. As most people, the first thing to try was the soup. Upon tasting of the soup, I was amazed. The flavor of the soup was rich, extremely flavorful, not too salty or sweet. It was like, perfection was reached. The noodles were a little over al dente which was perfect for ramen. The table has spices that you can add on top of your ramen like chili oil and this spicy spice mix. 

The pork they used was a 1\/2 fatty 1\/2 meat type of cut formed in a circular shape. Being of Asian origin, it was exactly how I liked it. As said before, the option of extra noodles was available so some of the pork was saved. They amount of noodles you get is quite an amount (usually wont expect too much for ""additional noodles"" but if anything, it may have been a slightly larger serving then that was in the original bowl. The additional noodles is given in a bowl, heated and ready to be thrown into your original soup. 

Lets just say, every single time, i order a bowl of ramen, additional noodles.. and never have soup left over =]

We tend to end up at Palms Place, just a couple of miles away.  

Most recent trip, we came here for a quick bite. Dinner time on a Tuesday night resembles the weekend. People already waiting outside after signing in on the wait list. 

It took about 10 min before we were called. Menus came quickly and our orders were taken just as fast. Fairly simple menu with decent choices. 

We had Kuro ramen w black garlic oil. Rich broth w noticeable garlic flavor plus fatty slices of pork. Sprinkled their red pepper and it was delicious. Only $7.95

Also got a tonkatsu ramen. Like the other, this also had a rich broth w even fattier slices of pork than the first one. The red pepper did wonders for this bowl too. $6.95

Extra bowl of noodle to soak up that broth: $1.50. 

The food came out super fast. And they came by quickly to clear up the table.  I get it, they need turnover. But they the staff were always nice and never pushy.  

Our food was great. Simple and very satisfying. The  service was fast and efficient. We will definitely come back. 

Notes: 

*The parking lot is a decent size, but it will fill up. Circle around and even look at the side streets.  
*The entire party needs to be present before being seated. 
* It's a small place. Parties larger than 4 may expect a longer wait. Come in smaller numbers
* Toppings are available ranges from nori to pork chashu at various prices. 
*Eat quick and leave. They need turnover at these low prices. Go somewhere else to catch up",9,4,9

""Not the same but good enough"" were his exact words comparing it to Daikokuya.  Monta Ramen is literally in the midst of other small Asian food joints in a mini-strip mall in Las Vegas' Chinatown on Spring Mountain Road.  I honestly would have not known this place existed if my friend didn't tell me  about it.  Parking was, for one, a bit limited.  

I walked in to a small, maybe 6 (or 7?)  tables and the counter bar, stuffy and unventilated ramen joint.  It had the same feel of Daikokuya:  cramped and rushed.  There were people standing, waiting and blocking the door.  I was offered to sit on the bar but there was no elbow room so I stood up and told the lady I would wait for a table instead.  The wait staff are Japanese, but noticed 2 Latinos working behind the bar\/kitchen with an Asian guy.  Red flag I thought but then again I saw the framed accolades from different local papers and publications honoring and awarding Monta as the Best or one of the Best in Las Vegas.   

I sat down in one of the small tables and ordered their tonkatsu ramen ($6.95).   The bowls are smaller, I noticed, and they're somewhat stingy with everything, including the broth and the toppings.  I had a couple small slices of chasu, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and green onions.  Mine didn't come with marinated boiled egg.  I come to find out that you can order the toppings for extra charge.  Really? for an egg? 

The broth was a bit salty to my liking, heavy and tasted like it was enriched with milk or cream, or maybe miso.  The wavy thinner noodles were somewhat seasoned too, but not overwhelmingly salty.  Their chasu, however, is to die for!  It's perfectly seasoned, cooked, caramelized and charred to my personal standards!  For that alone, I will come back and try their chasu rice bowl.  For their ramen soups?  I might try a different one the next time around, and maybe request thicker noodles.

we won't ever go there again.

we went because several people we know were raving that there was FINALLY a good ramen joint here in vegas.
see, where we come from, ramen joints are a dime a dozen where 90% of them are above average and super inexpensive.

i ordered the miso ramen.
my broth was just slightly colder than lukewarm and tasted as though the chef ran out of salt for the rest of the day because he decided to put the restaurant's entire supply of it into my bowl of cold broth.
the noodles are clearly dry, packaged noodles purchased in bulk.
nothing special and certainly not al dente.
if you know good ramen, you know that it should come to you so hot that it's almost impossible to eat for the first minute or so.
the amount of steam that comes from a proper bowl of ramen should open up your pores and clear out your sinuses.

as for the service, well, i don't think i have enough expletives in my vocabulary to describe how miffed i was.
i asked that my ramen be free of meat with extra veggies instead.
that, apparently, was not allowed.
i didn't argue and just decided that i'd remove the overcooked, thin pieces of pork from my bowl myself.
i then asked if there were any additional non-meat toppings that i could add and, with a roll of the eyes, i was reluctantly directed with pen in hand to the section of the menu that said ""toppings"".
so, in order to annoy the girl even more, i asked what takana was and, with another roll of the eyes and a severely frustrated tone, she said ""it's a vegetable"".

We came during a weird time around 230\/300 so the place was pretty empty but I'm sure during lunch and dinner they are packed considering they only have a handful of tables. When you enter you instantly smell the delicious broth. We were welcomed and seated instantly. When we looked at the menu I was surprised to see that the
Menu was small! It only had about 4 entrees and half Of them were ramen with the other half side dishes so instantly I knew that this place was going to be delicious since they only specialized on one type of dish! i got the miso ramen while my fiancé got the tonkatsu (did I spell that right? Lol) ramen. Both were delicious it's ridiculous how much flavor the broth had! Hands down the best ramen place that I have tried so far! 

As for service I have no complaints either everyone was friendly and greeted us when we entered and when we left! Like I said this place is a MUST now for us whenever we are in vegas and I can't wait till I go back again!

There's also L shaped seating for around 10, bar style, around the kitchen area.  The restaurant later filled up with people waiting outside, so be prepared to wait during the typical eat times.

Menu was simple as there was only 3 types of ramen you could order, Miso, Shoyu, Tonkotsu and a couple of rice dishes.  Decided to try the shoyu ramen ($6.95) with toppings (ranges from $0.50 - $1.50) corn, kimchi, and Kaedama (extra noodles).  The broth was tasty and not too salty and the pork was flavourful with the melt in your mouth taste.  The corn was not too buttery but the kimchi could of been better. I was expecting more taste from the kimchi, as it was toned down from other Ramen places I've tried in the past as well as Korean restaurants. The extra noodles was served on the side and was fist sized.  Do this if you're extra hungry...I was comatose after finishing this.  The noodle was a little skinnier than expected but had the right consistency and texture. The gyoza was not too my liking (didnt finish) and I can live off dumplings!

I've been here about five times and I like the tonkotsu the best, which is pork bone broth.  But it is very filling.  Right now, they are offering the tonkotsu mixed with the shoyu broth.  It has pieces of pork and the tonkotsu noodles.  This is a little less filling but does not have enough of the pork taste for me.  My husband prefers the noodles in the shoyu so we might try to get those noodles in the tonkotsu\/shoyu.  We shall see.  I have not tried the miso as most people tell me it is very thick and salty.  I can't tear myself away from the tonkotsu - it is so good!  I'll just stick with that.

I highly recommend getting the takana mustard leaf in your ramen.  It is very, very flavorful.  Also, they have containers of fresh garlic and ginger scattered about the place.  If there isn't one on your table, just ask.  It's a great addition to the ramen if you are a fan of garlic and\/or ginger.  Free addition to the ramen! The gyoza is good too, but keep in mind, you will likely be surprisingly full after just some ramen.

If the place is crowded, they will set up a waitlist that you have to write your name on.  It's outside taped to a table by the door.  If they are really busy, they may not stop to explain this to you, so just keep an eye out for the list if the place is full.

It's true, as some of the reviewers say, that it is unbearably hot inside the restaurant during the summer. But they are good with the beverage refills (Asahi on tap!) and just be thankful you don't have to work there all day! Plus, when it was too warm inside, the turnover was quick so the wait for a table was shorter.  Now that it is colder outside, it seems like people linger and chat.  But still, turnover is decent so if there is a wait, don't despair.  You need to spend $10 minimum to use a credit card.",7,0,4

I went there around lunch time and the place looked like it was going to blow up.  The restaurant is very small and it was jampacked.  I'm talking like elbows to elbows.This might annoy some people, but in a way I found it to be charming and like any standard ramen venues you will find in Japan.  It's as real as it gets, as for the venue at least.  As for the ramen, it gets even better.

I waited about 10-15 minutes, sat down, placed my order and waited for about 10 minutes for the ramen to come out.  Not bad, considering there was a lot people in the restaurant.

The ramen was so, so tasty.  Not too hot, the noodles were juicy, and the soup was not salty nor sweet.  I have tried Japanese ramen many times in the past, and I notice that the ramen is ruined because the ramen is too salty or there's too many damn vegetables floating around.  Luckily, for the ramen here at Monta, it was all love.  I had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu, and it was pretty damn good.

The service was speedy, but great nonetheless.  The waitress took our orders, filled our waters, and gave me the check as soon as I asked for it.  All in all, great experience.

I wanna point out that this is a ramen house, so don't expect a variety in their menu.  They have some chicken bowls and gyozas, yeah, but nothing like sushi or whatever.  You won't be wanting it anyway, the ramen steals the show.

Except there were mushrooms. Lots and lots of mushrooms. Which would have been nice if they warned me on the menu, since I am allergic. 

I don't know why this place is aso popular with the hipsters. It is cramped. It is tiny. It isn't that clean. It plays classic rock and has no particular decorating scheme. Seating is seriously uncomfortable. Parking sucks.

They sat me at the very first itty bitty wooden bar stool right by the kitchen and beverage machine (blowing hot air, adding insult to injury). Every time someone walked by, they hit me in the ass. I couldn't see more action as a pole dancer. Half way through my meal, I gave up.

As someone who's lived in Vegas for over 17 years, I've frequented many different ramen shops. Monta is by far the best. Super simple, super modern, fast, delicious, exquisite. 

I've been visiting Monta for years now, and it's still just as good as ever. The broth that Monta concocts has such a deep, tremendous flavor, and this is really where they shine. Monta features Tonkatsu (pork), Shoyu (soy), Tonkatsu Shoyu, and Miso, but they also have specialty ramen like garlic Kuro ramen, as well as spicy Tonkatsu ramen. It's cheap and delicious. You can also load your ramen with toppings ranging from kimchi to corn for an up-charge. I personally prefer to add extra Kikurage (mushroom) to my Ramen. And it's only $1.50 for extra noodles!

If you're looking for more than just ramen, I'd highly recommend the fried rice and the gyoza. The fried rice is out of this world, and the gyoza are extremely addicting and some of the best I've had. It's not uncommon for my friends and I to order several servings of the gyoza in a single sitting. 

With the Spring Mountain location being in the heart of Chinatown and not too far from The Strip, the peak hours can manifest massive wait times. Monta has a tiny footprint, only seating about 30 people at a time, so keep that in mind if you're planning on visiting on a Friday or Saturday evening. However, you can usually always get a seat of you visit during off-peak hours; afternoons in the middle of the week are usually best. 

Overall, I'll be visiting Monta and slurping their delicious noodles until I die from ramen overload. This is some good f***ing ramen, and once you go Monta, you'll ALWAYS go back.",1,1,0

We loved this place so much that when my friend came to visit from the San Francisco Bay Area the next day, we went again. My friend is a food snob and was leery that Monta would be anywhere near as good as her beloved Orenchi in Santa Clara (I've eaten there, it is heavenly). Monta definitely passed her high standards. I couldn't get her to admit that Monta was better, but she did agree that it was at least equal!

Monta is very good...they do you a solid here with their flavors.  The cramped little space and bustling turnover carries a positive energy with it... if you aren't waiting at rush hour.  That being said, Monta is not my favorite, and while I would happily come back, I probably won't too often since my favorite is so close.

I am all about the miso ramen, so I enjoyed that here as well.  I read Yuhi K.'s review before ordering so I also enjoyed the mentaiko and made sure to use togarashi.  These were excellent suggestions so I'll pass them on as well, but check out her review for more details.  

The bottom line for me was that the broth lacked the deep, developed flavors you can get elsewhere, but they have some great options--especially for the kosher minded.

The restaurant is minimalist with very little seating and is located next door to Raku. We generally don't sweat the decor, or lack thereof, as long as the food is good.

They offer shoyu, miso, and tonkotsu ramen and several other items on their menu. We ordered the tonkotsu, of course, which was $7 for a small-medium sized bowl. They used the thin white classic tonkotsu ramen noodles which were decent but lacked the elasticity or chewy ""freshness factor"" of other places we've tried. As my wife will attest to, I like my food salty and flavorful, but their broth was a bit too salty, even for me. It had an earthy shiitake mushroom flavor but was lacking in the porky flavor and richness of a good tonkotsu broth. Neither of us cared to slurp up any of the broth once we were done with the noodles. I found the two pieces of chashu were mediocre at best. They were somewhat tough and fatty and had this unusual ring of gelatin around the edges.

This place is arguably the best ramen place in Vegas that we have found so far. Unfortunately that also isn't saying very much.

I say it's just another good reason to visit Vegas... again. I'm not a ramen expert, but I've had my fair share of ramen throughout LA and OC (though Daikokuya in LA is up there). Everyone has their own style of ramen, coming from different regions in Japan. My favorite just happens to be tonkatsu-style ramen.

After waiting about a half hour to get seated in this hole-in-the-wall, we were slurping away. The price of $6.95 per bowl is a steal, but if you want to add extras it can easily go up to $10+. I had the tonkatsu-shoyu, and I found the broth to be perfect. Deep, rich flavor, while not too heavy or salty. 

My particular bowl of ramen came with thin noodles, which were okay. I kept reaching over to steal some of my wife's shoyu bowl, which had the standard, curly-style ramen noodles. Those had a nice, al dente chew, and I just loved how it clinged onto the flavors from the broth. Of course, what did I do after I was finished with my bowl? I had to order an extra side of curly ramen noodles for $1.50. Well worth every penny.

The other part worth mentioning is the slices of pork in the ramen. I'm used to the thick, fatty slices of pork belly. At Monta, the pork is so thinly sliced that it just melts and falls apart as soon as you try to pick it up with chopsticks. It's a shame that you only get 2 slices with the bowl. Next time around, I'm ordering extra. 

I can just imagine my face dripping with sweat if I'm slurping down Monta ramen in 110+ Vegas heat in the summer. I was dripping with sweat in 70 degree winter weather in November! At any rate, it's definitely worth the short drive from the Strip, the sweat, and the wait to eat at Monta ramen.",6,5,6

After reading all the reviews we got here before it opened.  Since there was already a couple sitting on the bench, I decided to stand by the pillar near the door.  Within 10 minutes, a crowd began to form and they created their own impromptu line...which I was late to realize.

Luckily all went smoothly without any incident.

Food came out quickly, and service was good.  For big eaters, the offer extra noodles for a little more than a buck.  Everyone in my party enjoyed their meals.

We went on a Tuesday night at about 8;15 and there were people milling about outside, indicating a waiting list.  I had to be up early so we almost left and went elsewhere.  While we were thinking about it we put our names on the list, there were 3 other 2 tops ahead of us.  One of them had left I guess so we were sat in about 10 minutes.  I'm glad we stayed.  

We were sat at the bar, with a perfect view of the noodles flinging about the kitchen.  Although I am a little short so I was standing most of the time :)  The place is small, probably no more than 24 seats, 10 of which are at the bar.  The service is quick and friendly.  The noodles come out quickly and it is fun to watch your order being made.  I got the Soy Ramen with extra scallions and extra pork.  Get the extra pork.  Each bowl comes with like 2 thin slices of pork.  It was my favorite part of the bowl, it is braised fatty pork that kind of melts in your soup and your mouth.  The flavor is wonderful and noodles are tender and slurpable (is that  a word?).  

It was 20 bucks without tip and included two beers and two bowls.  It was quick and fun and tasty.  In the past I have had ramen bowls that were tasty, but they usually come with fish cakes and a few other things I don't love.  But this was pretty straight forward and no fish in any of these.  I guess it's a different type of ramen, but I like it way better.

The broth was my favorite part of this ramen, it was incredibly flavorful. It had the sort of taste that said, ""Yes, I've been simmering for hours overnight, letting all my flavors marinate and get to know each other."" The garlic flavor was really strong, but it was perfect with the broth.

The chashu and the egg were both really solid. The real kicker here is that the ramen was ridiculously cheap! It was under $10! I was blown away! Value wise, this was the best bowl I've ever had under $10.

Not only do they have excellent Ramen broth and noodles with a perfect balance of flavor with neither side over powering the other. They also had Kimchi fried rice that was ""WOW"" so delicious and their Gyoza's were great. And loved the fact that they have crushed\/minced garlic in a container next to our table.

Been to a bunch of places all over the US and this is one that is closest to real Japanese style Ramen that I have experienced in Japan. So happy Yelp is now being used in Japan.

Maybe I had higher expectations of this place, even though I had nothing to compare it to other than the ramen you get for .20 at the local grocery store. It was good. Very good even. I ordered the pork\/chicken broth ramen add corn and butter. I ate the entire bowl and would order it again. I personally chose to add a little chile oil and whatever that mixed seasoning at the table was. It def improved my broth which needed the extra umph. The pork in the soup was not my style. The fatty skin reminded me of duck, which I don't like the skin of. Everything else in the soup was yummy and ill consider adding extra mushrooms and maybe an egg next time. 
Good prices, I'd much rather go order a $7 bowl of ramen, versus buying all those ingredients and doing it myself. However, how often do I eat ramen is really the question here, maybe that's why I expected it to be something more than basic. Ill consider ramen again, as long as I don't have to wait (which you usually do considering they have like 6 tables) or possibly order it Togo. I did notice that was an option.

I had the:
- Tonkotsu shoyu ramen (which has both pork and chicken broth). The broth was lacking.  It's salty but isn't rich.  The flavors are subtle compared to other places like Fukumimi, Daikokuya, and Men Oh Tokushima. ..and the egg in the ramen is a side option, so if you don't order it you won't get it.  The noodles were really different too.  They didn't seem like they were made from scratch.  Whatever it is, it's not what you typically have in ramen.  Also, the chaysu is pretty fatty so if you're looking to get some meat or protein in, you're almost forced to order something else.. or something else on the side!
- Gyoza.  All 6 pieces were stuck together.  It really just looked like a whole bunch of frozen pieces were thrown in a pot so I wasn't too impressed - but they were YUMMY!

This place is quaint and cute nestled away in a little shopping center off of Spring Mountain. It is SMALL so there may be a wait around peak times. That's probably the only downside. But it's definitely worth it.

They had four ramen to choose from: tonkatsu (pork bone), shoyu, miso, or tonkatsu-shoyu. All of which come with the basics: chashu (pork slices), bamboo shoots, green onions, and kikurage mushrooms. You have the option to add ""extras"" to personalize your ramen.

I had the tonkatsu-shoyu ramen with a boiled egg (as an extra). In retrospect, I should have ordered extra chashu -- which I recommend you do if you like pork. The meat was so tender and melt-in-your-mouth that the two slices the bowl comes with wasn't nearly enough! The broth was very tasty and not too salty like how some ramen can be.

They have other side dishes (gyoza, fried rice, etc) but I have a feeling those aren't the reason people come here. They're simply there as fillers. Stick to the star of the place: ramen of course!

After making it to the bar area me and my wife were extremely rushed to make a drink order as well as a food order right away. I ordered the spicy pork broth with nori and egg along with a hot tea. The hot tea came out right away inside a very hot can which was placed inside a cheap plastic cup. This is the first time in my life I was ever served a ""hot tea"" this way, and I unfortunately burnt my fingers quite badly picking it up. After pouring it in the cup which the can was inside I decided not to drink it, not only because of the awful taste, but I was attempting to be conscious of the potential health hazards.     

  My ramen came out almost instantly afterwards; but to my dismay, the broth was nearly ice cold, and there was no nori inside either. Other reviews have stated that the broth wasn't hot either, so my theory is that they make it that way to turn tables as fast as they can; as I felt extremely rushed by our server who was already making mistakes with my order. The noodles and eggs were the only two things in the bowl that tasted up to standard. I was able to get the nori off my check, and I had to deal with a slight stomach ache afterwards, but thankfully nothing too terrible.

I always thought that if i'm on vacation, I should experience the strip and maybe downtown and nothing else. Lately though, I find myself enjoying the hidden gems of Vegas more and more; eat where the locals eat and you can't go wrong. Monta Ramen is one of those fine establishments. 

Hands down the best Tonkatsu ramen I have ever had. The presentation is simple, but the flavors are out of this world. By far my most favorite part of the dish is the pork belly. Thinly sliced and melt in your mouth juicy, even the L.A.'s Daikokuya doesn't match. Also ordered a side of Kim Chi fried rice. The dish was unremarkable, and unnecessary since the ramen portion was filling. 

The place is small, and popular so be sure to get there early!",0,0,0

I have had a lot of ramen over the past couple of months, trying to find the holy grail of ramen, trying to find the bowl of bowls, trying to find the one bowl by which all other bowls are compared (I am not talking about weed sorry...).  Finally, after searching, I found it in Las Vegas of all place.  The first time I had Monta, I was hungover and it was damn good.  The second time I had it, I was dead sober and it was still damn damn good.  

Honestly, if I could, I would give Monta 5+++ stars.  I have been here a couple of times and have tried all of the broths, and by far, the best broth is the tonkatsu-shoyu combo broth (rich, salty, melt in your mouth goodness).  The tonkatsu is a close second because wow, the broth is super-stick-to-your-ribs rich.

Make sure that no matter what you order, make sure to get extra pork and the amazingly, soft-boiled egg, with a slightly soft and runny center.

I took take out since waiting for a table is that of when the president arrives and stops all lanes of traffic, no one is ready and no one knows how to make it flow. Place is jam packed because of the tasty ramen provided but my personal opinion they have fallen off the tracks a bit due to such overwhelming success.

I took the tonkatsu soyu but was given just the soya offering. Discovered when I arrived to my home. The broth was what I wanted but it was too late and I felt it's from monta so it should taste good either way; I was not impressed. There were a few things wrong with the meal the tea egg was over cooked and just the overall wait inside the shop to pick up your Togo wasn't very pleasing.

Our schedules made us push dinner to a late one at around 9p almost 10p. I'm addicted to ramen right now and have wanted to try this place so bad due to all the stellar reviews. We wondered if it would be less busy at this late hour and it was! We were seated right away at the counter, all tables were full. Once we ordered and were eating the whole place was full, including the whole counter top and it even looked like a few people were even waiting when we left. 

I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with thick noodles (it comes with thin) I added Corn and an egg. It is already topped with chashu, bamboo shoots, and green onions. Sadly, they didn't have bean sprouts :( I love bean sprouts in my ramen. I thought the broth was a little saltier and thicker than I like. The chashu was SO fatty, there was barely any meat, just fat. Not good. It wasn't my favorite bowl of ramen that I've ever had like I expected it was going to be. 

My boyfriend ordered the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen, it came with thin noodles but my boyfriend asked for thick. It wasn't super spicy but it definitely had a kick to it. He added Corn and an egg, as well. His chashu was also more fatty than meaty. It was less salty with the spice in it.

The Gyoza we ordered to share were soggy. They were all stuck together like they were frozen together before cooked and served :\/ the insides weren't seasoned very well, either. I have had so much better elsewhere.

I was just extremely disappointed here. The service and kitchen was pretty quick but we did have to ask for our check because we hadn't been given one after quite some time of finishing our meal. Their menu is smaller than other ramen houses and so is the restaurant.

They took on Tsujita, Zagat rated and the best LA has to offer, and stood toe to toe.  I work in the Westside, so I eat at Tsujita a couple of times a month.  Monta gave them a run for their money with fine, al dente noodles, half a perfectly cooked onsen tamago, and an unctuous broth that was rich and flavorful without being too heavy.

Monta easily beat the two heavy hitters from Japan - Mattou Seimen, three time Tokyo Ramen Festival champion, and Tatsu No Ya, the #1 ramen shop in Kyushu.

Monta also took out a personal favorite, Shalala Ramen from my native NorCal, and a Googler staple.  (Shalala's Mountain View shop is 5 minutes from the Googleplex.)

I have had most variations here and there, but I am a die hard miso fan and prefer to try the miso anywhere. There is only 4 broth bases to choose from along with the occasional special, as well as a nice side menu with a lot of other small dishes to choose from. 

As for the Miso. The salty creaminess with those thick bodied noodles always fulfills the appetite and keeps the taste buds impatient to scoff down more. Simply comes with 2 pieces of Chatsu pork, bamboo shoots, scallions, and mushroom.

A little skimpy with pork in my opinion, but it temps me to order extra because it really is the best I've ever had. So rich and flavorful and tender. Fat and all should absolutely be savored. You must also pay for additional toppings such as butter, nori, etc. I either get a side of kimchi or the small pork belly bowl which is equally delicious and abundantly layered in a rice bowl.

I applaud the waitresses for their patience and kindness. The place is almost always beyond busy and full, yet they still handle and attend to customers quickly and with a good attitude.

Miso ramen was too salty for me. Miso is such a strong taste that you should not have that first before you tried the tonkatsu one. The noodles they used for this was perfect(it was the ramen noodles)! 
Tonkatsu ramen was really tasty. The pork melted in your mouth. So good! The fungus gave the ramen a crunchy\/texture to it! You always want to have some sort of bamboo in your ramen, which they did! The only thing I thought was missing was the noodles. They served mines with the thin noodles. I preferred to have my ramen with ramen noodles!

There was a place near the Beverly Center in Los Angeles where I had some and liked it enough to return. The ramen at Monta is a whole other level of good. It's not only the best ramen I've ever had, it's the best Japanese food. My experience with Japanese food is that presentation is more important than flavor. That wasn't the case here. 
We started with gyoza. These dumplings were tasty although maybe a tad too salty for me. Then our ramen soon arrived. I got the kontatsu with pork belly, green onions, egg and corn. The broth was tasty. A couple of different flavors going on. Quite savory. The noodles were perfect. Not overcooked and delicious. And all the toppings were good, too. 
Janet got miso soup and was quite happy with her choice. She noted it was thicker than my soup.
It seems like a winner.
When we got there at 7 p.m. there were a couple of open tables and most of the bar was empty.

The noodles are pretty firm and chewy. They don't leave a waxy feeling in your mouth. Kaedama (extra noodles) are only a buck fifty more too.

The broth is where it's at though. It's really thick and tasty. I normally get around 4 noodles (1 original and 3 extra) in before I need extra spicy sauce or something to thicken it up.

They also have other items like gyoza (pot stickers) and fried rice.

It wasn't that way at Monta.  What you see is what you get, complete with photos.  And since even as a kid I was nauseated by even the tiniest bit of fat on any meat or poultry, I couldn't stand the pork that was in the bowl and had to remove it.

FIRST VISIT: Weekday lunch hour. 16 people ahead of me. Wait time 50 min. Had the Tonkotsu ramen ($6.95), Takana Fried Rice ($6.95), and hot green tea ($1.75). The ramen was not the best I've had, but pretty darn delicious. Good coloration and consistency of the broth, which was very savory and appetizing. I drank the whole thing! Good combination of toppings with adequate amounts. Comparable to traditional flavors found in Japan. If I had to be picky, I'd say the noodles itself were just okay. As for the Takana fried rice, it was as traditional as you can get. Reminded me of my childhood in Japan. If you've never had such flavors before, it will be a good experience. The savory flavor of the rice complemented the pickled mustard leaf which had a subtle spiciness to it. All this, including tax & tip, is a good deal for 20 bucks.

SECOND VISIT: Weekday around 9:30 pm. 8 people ahead of me. Wait time 35 min. Had the Kuro ramen ($8.95), mini Mentaiko ($2.95), kimchi side ($1.00) and hot oolong tea ($1.75). Kuro ramen has noticeable black garlic oil in the broth which is delicious. Thick rich savory taste. Again, if I had to nitpick, the noodles itself were average. The mentaiko was also very average. Straight forward and very traditional Japanese dish. No real wow factor but I enjoyed it. The marinated cod roe was spicy and complemented the dish well. Kimchi was not overbearing. It was tasty but seemed store bought. Total cost came out to be under $20 which is a great value. The hot teas served on both visits were provided in unopened cans which were heated. 

Overall, this place has wonderful ramen and the monetary value is outstanding. The star of the show was the broth. Very complex flavors with depth. You won't be disappointed.

cue violin

Hey, I just ate you, and this is crazy... but here's my hunger , so feed me maybe?   All of the ramen bowls, try to tempt me, but here's my chopsticks, so feed me maybe?  

Yeah this will probably be out of date by the time I hit submit review, but I'll deal with it.   I've been to Monta several times since it opened, and the first 8 or 9 times I stuck with getting various ramen.  Of those my favorite quickly became the Tonkotsu as I really enjoyed the creaminess of it.  I did like the other two as well, but always found myself going back to Tonkotsu.  As a quick aside, I actually found the Tonkotsu-Shoyu to be my least favorite.  The pork was always tender and tasty, and I would almost always get an egg added and I tried most of the other additions as well.   I personally didn't find many of them to be worth the extra cost to add, though I did like the Mustard Leaf on occasion.  

For an appetizer I had the Gyoza a few times and found them to be very good examples, but not extraordinary at the same time.   Then one day I decided to split a pork belly bowl with a friend as an appetizer.  Game change.   It's seriously all I think about when I think of Monta now.  As much as I enjoyed the Ramen whenever I'd had it, it took a backseat to this dish in my heart and stomach.  Currently saving up for an engagement ring.  Pork Belly Bowl will make a lovely bride.

Service is always friendly if a little rushed, and I always thought the overall price was decent.

The service was great and attentive but the ramen was not doing it for me. 

I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with medium waves noodles. The broth was fatty feeling which I love but with no flavor to match it, except salt. The noodles were cooked al dente except I didn't like the type of noodles they used.

The bowl is also very small. I finished the bowl and wanted more noodles but the calories weren't worth it if I didn't enjoy it.

know who your neighbor will be and you can strike up some interesting

We both ordered the Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen with extra chashu and hard-boiled (more like deliciously and perfectly soft-boiled!) egg.  The broth was absolutely delicious--just the right amount of flavor and rich pork fatty goodness to make it taste perfect!  Even though it was 103 degrees outside, I didn't care.  I ate and drank the entire bowl clean.  Gluttony at its finest.  Woo!  I was extremely impressed with the quality and texture of their chashu.  It was marinated just right and they really did cook it for hours to get it to really melt in my mouth!  The moment I bit into a piece, I didn't even really have to chew at all...it immediately disintegrated into orgasmic morsels of ecstasy and rocked a party in my mouth!  The egg was perfection...just the way all ramen ""hard-boiled"" (I still think they should call them ""soft-boiled""...it just suits the texture better!) eggs should be.  The yolk was nice and and gooey and soft.  It complimented the ramen broth so well!  Needless to say, I wolfed down the entire bowl in about 10 minutes or less. hehe ^_^  

We also got an order of the regular fried rice, and the only thing I can say is that it is THE BEST Japanese fried rice I have EVER had in my life thus far (in the States).  The rice was so extremely flavorful and light (because too much oil is a no-no).  Sprinkled with those little slices of heaven known as their chashu and plenty of pickled ginger, it tasted PHENOMENAL.  That was the 2nd party that rocked my mouth in one sitting!  Boy, what an awesomely dining experience!

Exquisite ramen.  Good price.  Great service.  Will most DEFINITELY have to visit again whenever we're in the area.

Oh, and my brother (who doesn't eat pork) also came with us.  He ordered the kimchi (or spicy?) fried rice without the pork and REALLY enjoyed his food.  He was even full off just that one single plate, so their portions are very reasonable, considering the elephant-sized appetite that he has.",2,1,2

However, Monta comes close to filling the void.  Monta is a small Japanese noodle house in a strip mall in china town.  If you don't like waiting to sit down, get there early as the line usually begins to form before the restaurant opens at 11:30AM.  There are a few scattered tables, but I prefer to sit at the bar and watch the cooks prepare the dishes in the open kitchen.

Monta makes Tonkotsu ($6.95), Shoyu ($6.95) and Miso ($7.25) Ramen broths.  While all three of the broths are very good, the milky white colored Tonkotsu (stewed pork bone broth) has an especially savory meaty flavor.  My favorite is the combination Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen ($6.95) which tempers the intense meaty taste of the Tonkotsu with the salty Shoyu broth.  The thin yellow Ramen noodles have always been consistently cooked to the just right texture, neither too limp nor too firm and underdone.  The ramen comes with basic toppings (green onions, bamboo shoots, Kikurage mushrooms and two thin slices of marinated Chashu pork) however, like all good Ramen joints, they have a whole list of additional toppings you can add (for a little extra cash) to make the dish your own.  The combination of flavors and textures soaking in the hot broth goes down well on a cold day.

We also usually order the pan fried pork gyozas ($5.15 for 6) and a small Kimchi fried rice ($6.95).  The gyozas are excellent and the moist rice has a good flavor.  Each table has an array of sauces and condiments that you can add to your meal (rice vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, sesame seeds, and chili pepper) as well as little jars of crushed garlic and red pickled ginger.  They also serve beer to wash it all down with.

The service is fast and the food comes out quickly.  So even if you do get stuck waiting in line, it usually moves fast.  And if you are in the mood for good Ramen, it is worth the wait.",1,0,0

The portions here are much smaller than other Ramen places I've been to.  If you're accustomed to the large portions in So Cal Ramen joints, be warned that the portions here is about 3\/4 those portions.  The Fried Rice was very good and hit the spot.  The Ramen was very good, full of flavor.  I had the Veggie Miso Ramen and it was awesome.  The Better Half had the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and she thoroughly enjoyed it as well.

Other notes:  They make the Ramen fresh to order, so it's a bit of a wait.  There's also counter seating available for convenience.  We sat at the counter and watched them make the dishes....pretty cool.

Did it live up to the hype?  It met my expectations and was definitely 4 Stars in my opinion.

Wait was not bad at all , 5 minutes, but we came in on a Monday night before my flight out, so that may have been why. I ordered the Kuro ramen (black garlic oil ramen) and it was possibly the best Kuro ramen I have had thus far. There is a restaurant that specializes in kuro ramen near my own home, but it does not compare to Monta's. 

The food came out pretty fast, which is always awesome. The garlic was incredibly flavorful and aromatic and just amazingly delicious. Chashu was also really nice and tender. My only qualm was that the broth was a little salty for my own liking. I had to add some ginger and sesame seeds to cut the saltiness a bit, but other than that it was very, very good. If I had access to Mona Ramen close to my own home, I would eat there so much it would definitely not be too good for my blood pressure.

Parking is packed. Place is tiny. Sign yourself in and be prepared to wait. Make sure that your whole party is present, or they won't seat you. It happened to us. Makes sense though when your establishment is only about five tables and a limited bar area.

I had the shoyu ramen with nori (seaweed) added...I don't have any proper adjectives to describe it for you since I am nothing but a ramen amateur, but it was good. I do know I like thick noodles in my soup and it had that. My boyfriend had the miso and it was creamier compared to mine. We both shared the regular fried rice, which was a nice contrast.

It seems to be sorta hidden in the back of the shopping center but just look for the white sign.

Shoyu Ramen:  my ramen came out with extra chasu and with no corn.  the waitress quickly realized this and immediatly gave me some corn on the side and didnt charge me for the extra chasu (kudos to her to rectify the situation).  The broth was very good and not overly salty.  I consider this one of the better ramens that I have eaten.  But the thing that stood out the most to me are the noodles.  Wow! This has got to be one of the best noodles ive eaten at any ramen joint and I have been to many in NY, CA and Hawaii.  Many places forsake the noodles and focus too much on the broth and chasu but very very good noodles.

Fried Rice: this was the dish my friend kept raving about and keep telling me to order.  I am not a huge fried rice person but it was pretty darn good! I devoured it within minutes of it coming out and didnt even leave a spec for my friend.

This disappointment felt like when Mayweather vs Pacquiao happened, or when Batman Vs Superman fight was so short. All that build up to just flop. I get there parking sucks I know that. I waited, but not that long to my surprise. Place is busy I get that so not really much time for proper service buts thats okay too. Even the long wait for the receipt to print out, because I guess it overheated, was fine. I don't mind waiting because of the experience. In reality If I would of had a good experience I wouldn't have mind actually waiting. I'm a patient guy and I was here too, but reality is that deep down inside I wanted to just go.

I order the Spicy Tonkatsu.I mixed things in, I ordered an egg for it and digged in. I ate, and I ate and I could just not get any flavor from the other ingredients. The only thing I tasted was the noodles and the very thick broth. As far as spiciness... there was none. Not one single sweat came down, not one single sniff of spiciness, just a whole lot of disappointment. The broth was too strong and took all the flavor from everything else. It was not warm enough. My friends bowl had more noodles than mine, he did not order extra. The noodles just felt present. Not really much of an impact there. The meat just dissolved and I didn't even feel anything because of the broth. If I at least had more noddles I would have just enjoyed slurping them more.

My friend had some Gyoza and those were real good! But again thats something I did not order. I did not eat it fast, the bowl just ended quick. I still feel disappointed writing this now. Between the hype, the atmosphere and the awards hanging I was expecting more. My friend ordered the regular Tonkatsu and said it was great. We both agreed though that we have tasted better around Las Vegas. So I may come back, but not for a long time cause I don't want to feel disappointed again, or feel like a sucker. Price is fine for Ramen I don't mind that anywhere. To give you a sense of how it feels today... It's like when you break up with your lover only to go back and be treated like crap and being told, ""I told you so"". Just for me... when it comes to Ramen I want to feel happy to some extent.

It was quite a bit of an acquired taste to me. When I first tried it I got a tonkatsu ramen and I hated it! It was too rich and too porky for me and I found myself wanting pho instead HAHA but oddly enough I started craving it a couple weeks after! 

Now I get the tonkatsu-shoyu with all the fixings except the greens with a side of kimchi! I always find myself thinking the noodle to soup ratio is off, I need more soup!!!! I always make sure to get the thinner noodles because they taste better! Sometimes the broth is way too salty and sometimes I leave feeling like I just drank a bunch of pork fat but I keep going back, it's strangely addicting LOL 

The gyoza and kimchi fried rice are good but nothing too special~ 

The negative is that It's a really small restaurant and their AC is not the best. There's most likely always a wait. So in order to keep the flow going please be courteous and eat your ramen and leave! This is not a place to lolly-gag after you're done eating, quickly give up your table to the next hungry group or suffer the consequence of angry looks!!!!! LOL 

Hot Tip: If you don't want to wait go at really odd times like 3:00-5:00; there's usually never a wait~",5,1,4

I bookmarked 3 ramen shops for what it seemed like high rating while I was in a conference. Due to limited time on Yelp search, I didn't read anyone's reviews, just quickly bookmarked highest rated 3.

I picked this one as it was closest from the hotel I was staying. After I ordered my food, the person who sat next to me at the counter said so much good thing about this place over other places I bookmarked.

Gyoza was good.  I gave a piece to a stranger sat next to me as he gave me this look that he wanted to try.

Ramen..... Well broth was nice and hot... I ate ramen as soon as I took one picture but noodle was soft. It's Hakata thin noodle, perhaps I should have requested barikata (very hard) for my noodle. If their noodle was al dente, I would have given this place 4 stars.

After I was done eating I finally saw some reviews from some of my favorite yelpers. They all rated 3... Ah of course.

I looked at the stranger next to me, he ate so slow, his noodle looked soggy.  Either he doesn't know how to eat ramen in Japanese way or too busy talking to me. 

If you like ramen in Japanese way, may want t ask to cook noodle al dente to fully enjoy it's texture.",12,7,8

Hmmm... well... so far, it's one of the best bowl of ramen we've had in Vegas (but that doesn't necessarily say much). There is certainly a good amount of porky flavour in the broth... but not enough to make it really stand up  on its own (ie, make me want to drink the whole bowl and wonder if I can ask for more).  Also, there is a hint of the distinctive earthy shitake mushroom which does take away from the flavour of the pork.

The noodles are classic tonkotsu ramen noodles but they lacked the nice chew of others we've tried. The chashu was okay - a little on the fatty side, mildly tough but great flavour.

Three of my friends and I came here after a night dancing looking for some soup to appease our parched bodies. Here are some things you should expect: 

1. Parking
Easy peasy. There is a big lot, so no need to worry about that.

2. The wait
Oh my goodness. We came to this place like 40 minutes before it opened, and there was ALREADY A LINE. This being said, I HIGHLY recommend coming early & waiting, unless you want to be in the hot Las Vegas sun, grumpy, hungry, hungover and sweaty. 

3. The ramen
I ordered the new spicy tonkatsu ramen with an egg. It was SO GOOD! The broth was very flavorful and not too salty (although, I've been told that I have a salty palette.. to each his own.). The pork in the ramen was soft and melted in my mouth! My only regret is not getting extra. My boyfriend got the tonkatsu shoyu ramen with fat noodles, which was good, but definitely not as good as mine... I think his was TOO salty for my taste (which again, has been known to be on the salty side). Even thought my ramen was overall really good, I couldn't finish it because it felt way too heavy\/greasy in my stomach. I actually ended up with a small stomach ache after. 

4. The service
Okay, I guess I have to cut some slack here, because there were only 2 workers manning the floor, but it took FOREVER to order\/flag someone down... it kind of felt like they were ignoring us on purpose at first. Nobody likes to have to compete for attention! #middlechildsyndrome #i'mnotevenamiddlechild #yelpdoesntevendohashtags

5. The value
SUPER CHEAP! Also, a coke was only ONE DOLLAH! To me, that seems unheard of in a restaurant... 

All in all, I recommend it. If you're like me and you easily get stomach aches from food that is too heavy, buttery or greasy, I'd recommend getting a coke or a sprite with your ramen so that you can burp all out alll dat ish.",2,3,3

I've had ramen from NorCal, SoCal, and New York. I don't call myself very knowledgeable but I sure as hell know what I like to eat. The best ramen place that I've tried is Ippudo, which is located in Manhattan NY. However, Monta does come close.


Monta is quite a small restaurant and it has one of those homely feels to it. One thing I didn't quite like was how stuffy it was. I went during one of the warm days, it wasn't even hot, but all they had was fans and I couldn't even feel them. So the place had pretty poor circulation and stuffy. I'd hate to see what it's like during an actual summer temperature where it hits over 100 degrees. 


I had their tonkotsu ramen with corn -- definitely recommended. Their broth is rich and full of flavor. It is yummy. However, because of how rich and yummy the broth is, I don't suggest adding an egg to it. Because once you do, the egg loses its flavor and the broth overpowers it. So no point. 


I would've given this place five full stars if it were not for the waitress that helped us. Oh the service was fine throughout our meal. When we first took our orders down, she offered us, ""Would you like everything on one check or split checks?"" We were a party of 8. Obviously, some had cash and some didn't so we would prefer the latter. So we answered with, ""Split checks would be nice :)"" But then she responds with, ""I could do that but could you please not do 8 separate checks? It's a little bit too much.""

I'M SORRY? Really, why did you even bother to offer? 

I didn't feel like arguing or bothering so we just went with one check. You don't offer something then take back your offer. Or at least lay your own terms down before you finish offering. Thank you.

Only those who are really serious about ramen will brave flooded intersections for a hot bowl of noodles -- that, or your Plan A for dinner fell through. 

I almost didn't want to come here because of the issue I have with the lack of seating at this place, but we took the chance and dropped in anyway. We figured not many people would hit up Monta because the weather was lookin' ominous. Two open spots were free when we arrived at 7pm on a Friday night, but the tiny restaurant was almost filled to maximum occupancy. By the way, if you see seats available, don't forget to put your name down on the sign-in sheet by the doorway; it's still first come, first served. 

I stuck with what I ordered on my last visit which was the Tonkotsu Ramen with nori and nitamago. I was pleased to learn that the ramen was still solid like the last time I had it several months ago. The broth was hearty and the pork was tender. I also shared an order of the Mini Pork Belly Bowl.  As much as I enjoyed my ramen, I almost want to say that the pork belly was my favorite part of dinner. It was flavorful and delicious, and I prefer it over the Mini Mentaiko Bowl that I ordered last time.

Unlike other ramen restaurants I've been to, Monta has about four ramen selections to choose from; however, you won't pay over $8.00 for a bowl. Overall, the food here is affordable. Two bowls of ramen and the pork belly came out to a little over $23.00 (without tip.)

We had the shoyu (chicken broth with thick wavy noodles), tonkotsu shoyu (pork and chicken broth with thin noodles), and the kuro (pork broth with a garlic oil).  

All three were good, although I think I like the shoyu better.  Mine (tonkotsu shoyo) was great at first, but the more I ate, the saltier it tasted.

K first of all it's like my crack when I'm in Vegas; it's the first thing I hunt down when I get here. It's like the most amazing thing I've tasted in my entire freakin' life.

The restaurant is quite a modest noodle house, very small, and they have a simple menu. It seems this kind of place would just be something to overlook. But NO. Their ramen is the best ramen I've had.

Their broth is very rich and flavorful-- I've been to ramen houses were they put a lot of salt and MSG in the broth for its lack of flavor--not here! Very rich. Noodles were not too hard nor too soft, just right in the middle.

But, the pork. Dear god the PORK

Next time I go I will get extra chashu pork in my soup. Their pork literally just falls apart. I've had soft pork before, but that was because I'd get nothing but cuts of fat. Here, the meat is so tender and flavorful. I don't know what they do to it, but it's just downright amazing.

Each one of us got a different bowl of ramen they offered, so we pretty much ordered the whole ramen menu. Each one is delicious. Their shoyu (soy sauce broth) is the original ramen, but it is very delicious. I enjoyed mine. Everything else was delicious as well.

We got a chashu bowl, and it was a simple bowl of chashu pork with rice over it, but it was just the best thing ever. The pork is so amazing, I could go on and on about it forever.

Their kimchi rice is also quite good! Not too spicy, but it does give a kick.

You really can't get anything ""bad"" or ""ok"" here; everything on the menu is amazing.

Our group of friends were rock climbers and just got done climbing in Red Rocks for the day, so they were quite famished. We each ordered one bowl of ramen to ourselves, split a chashu pork bowl, one plate of gyoza, and one plate of kimchi fried rice, but they decided to get extra noodles.

TONKATSU SHOYU RAMEN was good. Broth and noodles are nice. Only comment is there's not a lot of toppings that comes with the original order - 2 pieces of pork chashu and bamboo shoots, I think. We had to order extra topping of egg. I think next time, I'll also order extra pork chashu. 

GYOZA is nice. It has a crunch that I like, but still meaty on the inside. Pretty good. 

Monta and Sora are the only ramen places from Vegas featured on Ramen Festival in LA and Vegas. Rightfully so because both are awesome. (Didn't get to go to Ramen Fest though.) Contrary to other reviews here, my boyfriend and I think that Sora beats them by a tiny bit due to Sora's broth and toppings. I'd say come taste it yourself and you be the judge. It's very subjective after all. I'll probably go here if Sora is full since they're pretty close to each other.

Gyoza- Hot pan-fried pork and vegetable dumplings with just the right amount of crisp from the charred skin which contrasted well with the soft and juicy meat filling. Overall, very good and savory. 

Miso Ramen- He enjoyed his ramen, saying that it tasted very authentic. I tried some of his ramen, and while I preferred the broth of his ramen, I liked the thinner noodles from my ramen more. 

Mini Mentaiko- He enjoyed this as well. I think it was the perfect light contrast to the heavy ramen. 

Tonkotsu\/Shoyu Ramen- Delicious! The noodles were perfectly cooked, and the vegetables added texture and mildness to the rich broth. My only complaints are that the broth was just a tad too salty for my taste and the char siu lacked the meatiness I wanted. 

Overall, we enjoyed dinner that night. I enjoyed my experience there so much that two days after my initiation into the Japanese ramen world I went again with my mom.",14,5,8

They have different ramen bases and sides that you can add to your ramen. The ramen is very delicious and filled with lots of flavor. If you aren't craving ramen, they also have delicious rice dishes and other nonsoup based dishes. This place also does not break the bank. Cheap eats that are actually very yummy is always the way to go. As for the service, I feel like it depends on the day. If it isn't too busy, it's very fast, and obviously if it is busy, you may have to wait a bit longer. This place is definitely a casual dining environment, with yummy Japanese comfort food!

We arrived on Friday night, between 6-7PM to a full parking lot, but a slow night over at Monta Ramen. We found street parking, got our name on the list and probably sat around 7 minutes after that. The bar top was packed while the main area had a steady flow of patrons ordering, dining, enjoying then leaving. Seems like standard operating procedures, so let's do it.

I ordered the Spicy Tonkutsu Ramen and our table shared the Takana Rice. Literally, our ramen showed up within minutes.. Seems like they might have it sitting stove top somewhere. It took longer for our rice to show up, but it was definitely worth it. The rice was tasty, as are most fried foods. Fluffy and moist with bits and pieces of meat, egg and dashes of spice. 

As far as the ramen goes, there was a taste I can't quite describe.. it wasn't necessarily bad nor was it good. What saved the bowl, in my opinion, was the fact that they include a little sriracha style chili sauce which blended well in the broth and masked that indescribable taste. That, along with garlic and a dab of soy totally turned this dish from a 3 to a 4. The spice level, out of 10, had to be in the 5 or 6 zone. ALMOST had me, but it was more of a flavor than the actual kick. The ramen noodles were a little thin making it truly easy to finish this bowl off, which I find hard to do in the SGV area due to the portion sizes.

This wasn't necessarily the best ramen I've had to date, but having the wind gust hard outside along with winter like temps and an empty stomach, it definitely did the job.. We didn't have to wait in a dreaded line, super-friendly service, decent prices, prompt ticket turnaround times and the meal was quite fulfilling.",11,11,10

Now the world is good again....  
I usually go for the the tonkotsu Ramen, but have been known to dip my chopsticks into the tonkotsu-shoyu broth as well.  Both flavors are deep and rich, and each has a creamy texture that can only come from long, slow simmering.  The main difference between these two types of broths comes in the form of a lil more salty punch that the tonkotsu-shoyu has.  
The noodles are firm (but not too firm) and thin and have a great mellow flavor that balances out the saltiness of the broths.  On their menu it states that you can get an extra helping of these noodles for a very small fee.  I've tried to finish an extra helping of the noodles twice, and have failed both times.  It is a really huge a portion of food, and in my version of man vs. food, food most defiantly won.  Along with the noodles you get a selection of side items you can add to your Ramen.   I would recommend adding the egg and corn they taste great in the Ramen, and turn it into a really substantial meal.

Wow what a gem!  The place was very small and there were about 6 parties waiting already less than a hour of this place opening up.  The place only seats about 35 people, but we figure the turnaround should be quick being a noodle house and we are glad we waited!

We decided to share a Tonkotsu ramen with a hard boiled egg, got a bowl of extra ramen (too bad it didn't come with extra broth though), we tried the gyoza as well, and the takana fried rice.  Excellent ramen!  Was not overly salted and had great flavor.  The gyoza was very tasty.  I think the biggest surprise came with the takana fried rice.  This was a mix of vegetables and there was definitely a spicy kick to it which was just right, not overpowering, not overseasoned.

We were very pleased with this noodle house and definitely wouldn't mind coming back here whenever we are in Vegas.  This location is cash only.

My growling stomach couldn't bear to wait so we settled for someplace else, cough swish shabu shabu cough, and was very unsatisfied. So we decided to give it one more try on my last night in Vegas.

They won't seat you until your whole party is there and luckily the other two people made it just in time.  This is a cozy restaurant which just adds to the ambiance a japanese noodle house.

We also tried the fried rice and the gyoza.  Gyoza is top notch, some of the best i've ever had and I had some Godly ones in japan..  The fried rice was pretty delicious as well.

I really liked my experience here.  The waitresses seemed to be imported straight from Japan, very hospitable and nice.  The food was excellent.  And it didn't break our wallets either.

At 10pm there was no wait and a nice sized table for the 4 of us. We went with the Yelp highlights, and I'd hate to mention these here again since I don't think the system Yelp is built on filters out the negative comments for items mentioned a lot and it just keeps reinforcing the highlights even though I don't like em!

Tonkotsu Ramen - Got this and asked for extra spicy sauce since I didn't see the Spicy Tonkotsu on the chalkboard right away. It was good, but honestly way TOoOoOOo salty. I didn't realize it at first cause I was so hungry, but honestly it was very salty and I couldn't finish the soup

Gyoza - Nothing special whatsoever and no special sauces for this
Kimchi Fried Rice - does NOT taste like a kimchi fried rice you'd expect after living in K town for some time
Pork Belly Bowl - Also a MEH for me. I can see how it is taste so if you're into the crispy 'chadol'\/yoshinoya type of meat then you should try this. A little saucey which ain't necessarily a bad thing. I also took this one home and ate it the next day and I didn't hate it.

Overall, unfortunately for the amount of reviews this place has, it was only worth 3 stars for me. I can confidently say I am a strong foodie and have my spots in the different cities I frequent and I was hoping to find a go-to ramen spot in Vegas.

The Pork Belly Bowl was a small size, but it was plenty for us since we totally devoured ourselves with tons of fantastic food on our trip to Vegas.  The bowl was pretty when it arrived!  The bowl was decorated with pickled ginger to cut the fattiness of the pork belly and an abundant amount of scallions to give the bowl a fresh green flavor.  Below the green and the red, was a pile of juicy, tender, and fatty pork belly gleaming at you. 

Then our star...Tonkotsu Ramen.  We added extra Chashu Pork, corn, butter, and EGG (this is a definite MUST add...super soft and melt in your mouth!) to our bowl of ramen.  I have to say, this was a delight to the eye.  The portion was a good size, about the equivalent of a large bowl of Pho.  The flavor of the soup was deep and meaty, the noodles had a good bite to it and every bite had the yummy soup flavoring (we saw them cook the noodles in the slow cooked broth), the pork was drool worthy, the crisp sweet corn added an additional tastiness to the bowl, and the black fungus and bamboos added earthiness.

Hot ramen... In Vegas?!? Monta is a small ramen shop. I've been here a few times. I'd say this ramen is pretty authentic because of the thick, creamy broth that it comes Tonkotsu style. 

I'd say there's usually a wait since it's so small so go at a reasonable time. I loved the Tonkotsu ramen and the Pork belly bowl. The Pork belly is definitely better than the Chashu bowl. Gyoza is also bawmbbb",3,2,3

Yes, there is tucked in-between small shops along Spring Mountain Road or otherwise known as ""Chinatown"" in Vegas.

As you may or may not know it', ""Ramen"" noodles is one of Japanese noodles invented in 1958 by Japan's Nissin Foods. These are thin, ribbon-like, lightweight, calorie-rich, tasty, and cheap that can be bought in packs of 1 or 10 (you can find them in your Asian or Oriental grocery near you or in any of your college friend's pantry). It's one of those quick cook-it-up soups.

It's rather an eccentric choice of mine to dine in this place with my Mom last night around 6 p.m. on a very rainy night in Vegas. Soup is the answer to the cold, wet rain! Ramen is kind-of over-the-top in this restaurant!

With a sweet, smiling greeting from the waitress, ""Moshi, moshi!"" in Japanese, which translates to ""Hello"" or rather ""Welcome!"" (I have learned a few Japanese greetings in high school and  having been to Tokyo before, the greeting didn't sound ""foreign""). It brought a smile to my lips, I knew I would have a good dining experience. 

The restaurant is small and cozy but cheerful with minimalist Japanese style decor including the bathroom's interior design was contemporary Japanese. There are table seatings and bar-like seating available. Menu is simple. Three choices of Ramen noodle soups in ""Tonkotsu Ramen"" (pork bone), ""Shoyu Ramen"" (soy paste), and ""Miso Ramen"" (bean paste). Nothing else to confuse any soup-hungry soup-lover. A list of toppings for the noodles soup for an extra charge, 8 ""Other Dishes"", 4 kinds of cold beverages, 2 kinds of beer choices, but no dessert and no hot beverages on the menu.

I ordered the house specialty soup which is the ""Tonkatsu Ramen"" Soup. It's very hearty soup in a thick, cloudy milk-like tasty broth. Topped with green onions, 3 slices of pork, bamboo shoots, and with kikurage (dried black mushrooms), I drizzled it with sesame seeds and hot spice powder. Oh, wow, there was no need for chewing the roast pork that melted in my mouth. Surely, the pork melts! Another dish I ordered was the ""Mimi Mentaiko"" which consists of Fish Cod Roe (or fish eggs which are red-orange in color is otherwise, caviar) with strips of nori seaweed and green onions topped on a bowl of steamed Japanese rice. Very appetizing, a sure favorite! The ""Pork Belly Bowl"" is also one dish you ought to try; delicious. As usual green tea on ice was my beverage pairing for these meals.

Funny thing...the cheerful smiling waitress who served us went to show her colleagues in the kitchen my soup bowl which made her shyly squeal in delight to show them all it was empty!! I caught a glimpse of the cook's smile.

Yes, I left nothing in the bowl, not even a drop of soup!
It must have been that I really love soup, or it was cold and wet outside or just that I needed to fill my belly...how can you go wrong in making such a choice to eat for the night. For a price that's easy on your pocket, aahemm! wallet...an excellent deal! ""Arigato gozaimas!"" (English translation is ""Thank you!""), as we left the restaurant in good spirit!",2,2,3

Ordered the Tonkatsu. The pork belly is always tender and I love adding the red powder stuff (not entirely sure what it is, but it's great) thin noodles make it easier to devour quicker.

Kuro Ramen:  Kuro means ""black"" for all you japanophiles.  The color comes from them adding Ma-yu (not to be confused with ra-yu), which is sesame oil with roasted garlic which gives it garlic flavor while adding blackish color.  To be quite honest, this ramen was not good at all.  I was expecting a punchy garlic flavor which it had very little of, and the broth....damn....what happened?  It was bland.  It taste as bland as Ramen Shoku's tonkotsu.  I had to believe that they were using a different broth for this ramen as I tasted my daughter's tonkotsu and it was totally different.  I would give it 2 stars.  Pretty crappy ramen if you ask me.  I would NOT recommend it.  

Spicy Tokotsu Ramen:  This is somewhat similar to spicy miso at Ramen Sora in a way tha they just add spicy miso which you can mix to give it a little kick.  The base Tokotsu ramen is identical and I enjoyed the extra spicy kick to the regular rich tonkotsu broth.  It was also moderately spicy (for me), and I liked the fact that the spicy miso was viscous enough that I could adjust the amount of kick I wanted as I didn't want ALL of it.  I would give it solid 4+ stars for it.  

With all that Monta has done to Las Vegas' ramen scene, I would still give them a 4, even though their new Kuro ramen was a complete failure.  

I'm also finding that ramen chefs of recent has become noticeably hispanic, and ramen noodles seem to be a bit overcooked for my taste.  If I see that the noodle isn't as firm as I like it next time, I will drop them down to 3 stars....watch out Monta...there are some real competitions now.",0,0,0

If this place were relocated to Little Tokyo in DTLA, Sawtelle Blvd. or Gardena\/Torrance, I doubt it would even make the mid-tier.

Hits:
* Mildly impressed by the Tonkotsu ramen -- the broth was greasy and creamy, but not completely full-bodied... definitely not worth the half hour wait and hype
* Ramen is cheap (~$7), since the portion sizes are small -- if you're still craving more noodles, add another serving for $1.50
* Order the overpriced hot green tea ($3) and you'll be amazed that the aluminum can is still hot... Apparently the Japanese vending machine keeps the can warm
* The servers are good about splitting the check, and you can pay with card

Lessons Learned:
* Why are all ramen restaurants so tiny?? This place can seat 20 at a time, and does not easily accommodate to parties larger than 4 (my party of 6 barely fit at the bar counter)
* Prepare to wait -- we waited half an hour coming here at 5p on a Monday night
* While the waitress was nice, she seemed really distracted -- In between taking my friend's order, she rushed into the kitchen and then came back 5 minutes later to resume taking down his order... weird
* The ajitama ($1 for half an egg -.-) is not included and was slightly overcooked.. lame!

Service: At the door they don't really care who you are or what you do (whether you have a party of one or a party of 10, no special treatment; no forgiveness for leaving\/having incomplete party). Once seated, the service is quick and they get your stuff out as soon as possible to get another butt in your chair. With a small party (2-3) the wait shouldn't be too long. With a large (+4) party, at munch-time you're out of luck. Service does not earn a star.

Food: Ramen (why would you get anything else here?). Four different broths to choose from with their own noodle style. Tonkatsu shoyu ramen comes with wavy noodles and the Miso came with thin noodles. Extra noodles are $1.25. I don't get add-ons because there's no need, the amounts which are portioned should be rich enough to keep you from wanting for a couple hours. Which leads me to portion size. First time it came, I thought I could eat 3 bowls, but after the first tasty, rich bowl you find yourself satisfied. What you're looking for is the flavor of the broth and I think this place has one of the tastiest broths. I like to add the spicy powder, hot oil, and sesame seeds so maybe that's why it gets salty near the bottom, but it makes my noodles tastier. (* + 1) Got the gyoza, tasted the gyoza, enjoyed the gyoza, did not write home about the gyoza.

Strangest thing: I do not understand why they don't serve hot tea. Too much work to serve and too little space for the cups? They do have canned oolong and green tea though.",2,0,0

As you may all have read the rest of the 400+reviews & counting, everyone is raving about the food at Monta & the prices, and I definitely agree with all the positive reviews, I mean c'mon you have a Menu that would fit in one sheet of paper, how can you mess that one up? They have followed the In N Out Burger's mantra...KISSS (keep it simple st*p*d) Less is More, No Frills, No guess work, in fact I love everything on their menu so much it is so hard for me to pick just one item! The only disadvantage to the ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"" attitude is that it GETS BORING, and you might get Monta'd out (especially if you are eating there almost every week sometimes two) I guess some good things must come to an end, and as the Law of Gravity dictates, what comes up, must come down, even if it is THE BEST noodle & chiar su pork in town. With this popularity also comes one downfall....BE PREPARED TO WAIT FOR A TABLE! Especially during the peak hours of lunch & dinner. They open at 11 am and trust me there is a line already forming outside waiting for them to open. this is a sure way to tell that a place is sure to be good especially when it's packed, but what if you are really hungry already??? Hmmm bring some crackers with you. Keep in mind also that at Monta it is first come first serve, you can not make reservations, nor will they seat you if your whole party is not there yet (they FROWN upon this) Monta is suitable for parties of a maximum of 4 if your party is more than that you probably won't sit together or even eat at the same time. The waiting time is often discouraging, HUNGRY PEOPLE are ANGRY PEOPLE! It has happened on more than one occasion that we had to go somewhere else because we got discouraged by the slew of people waiting to be seated anplay how pressed for time we already are. So by now you probably figured out why it is missing that 1 more star, Me & Monta definitely have a Love-Hate relationship. Like in any other relationship, if you fall too quickly, you will fall out as quickly as you fell. So for now or until I crave you again, SAYUNARA Monta-san.",2,0,1

The space is located in a plaza behind the strip, where you will also find Kung Fu Tea and a shaved snow place (forgot what it's called).

Like many ramen places, the space is small. I came here with a party of 7 on a Friday for lunch just right when it opened and our wait was about 25 minutes. It's a great place for a casual meal and more ideal for smaller parties. Our party of 7 ended up splitting up, where 3 of us sat at the counter and 4 of us sat at a table (which we were totally okay with but just a heads up for people who prefer to have a more of a catch-up session!).

For their ramen, they offer quite a few different kinds from Tonkatsu, Shoyu, Black Garlic Oil and Spicy. I was torn between their Black Garlic Oil and Spicy ramen and decided to get their Black Garlic Oil with spicy sauce on the side. Portion was decent- it's probably considered a medium bowl you would see at most noodle places. Each ramen comes with a good amount of bamboo shoots, mushrooms and green onions. Their broth had hearty, savory pork flavor (just like how all solid ramen broth should be). At first, I was worried that the black garlic oil would be too heavy and overpowering but surprisingly I thought the garlic flavor was a lovely element to their both. Noodles were thin and firm, also similar to traditional ramen places. 

I also got a hot tea, which comes in a can rather than in a pot. Price wise, I can't remember the exact amount but I do remember thinking it was only a LITTLE bit more pricey than the usual places I go to. But if anyone needs a hangover fix and needs a break from all the madness that may happen on the Strip, I do suggest trying this place!",13,3,9

Actually, the reason why I even decided to check this place out is because the day before I was at the Japanese Curry spot just a couple hundred feet away (in the same plaza) and noticed a long line at Monta Ramen. I was curious. Why were so many people waiting outside to eat ramen? Well, I needed to found out! So the very next day, my friend and I arrived around 11:15am (the place opens at 11:30am for lunch). There were already a few people in line waiting for the doors to open. I peeked inside. It's very small! There's only about 6 tables and a few seats at the bar. We got seated at 11:30am and when I looked out the window, there was already a line. 

We ordered their top two special daily ramens: Spicy Tonkatsu and Black garlic Oil Kuro ramen. Both are fantastic! Very flavorful and unique! I've never tasted anything like the Kuro ramen before. Truthfully it looks gross cuz it's black and oil, but damn the ramen tastes soooo ono (good)!!!! The noodles are perfectly cooked, al dente!

The inside is exactly how it is in japan SMALL and casual so taking a date here on your first date wouldnt be ideal but you can try raku next door. Now to the good part FOOD, i love the noodles here cooked perfectly not chewy and over cooked like a lot of ramen places (note: ramen is all about the noodles so i give the noodles alone 4 stars) down to the broth which was well a little too salty not a bad broth but def overpowered the noodles and chasu so i had to deduct points. Service here is well my experience was great, server sat us fast and got our order perfect, and key point kept my WATER full which is my biggest thing at any  restaurant; why you ask because its the easiest thing to do and well most places fuck up and thats how i determine tip as well (TIP) Overall this is the ramen spot to go to in vegas so far until something else pops up but however this is still not the best well at least in vegas it is thank you Monta i will return!",0,0,0

When I go to monta, I usually order a tonkatsu ramen. I like to get thick-wavy noodles instead of thin noodles as well.

The bowl usually comes pretty fast even if the place may be packed so that's a plus as well. 

I also enjoy their pork belly bowl. Their rice to meat portion seems just right to me! And of course, it tastes great!

I ordered the Tonkatsu-Shoyu Ramen with nori and corn.  Personally my broth was a little bit on the salty side and my best friend felt the same way.  We also ordered gyoza, which I liked very much but that's about it.  We did arrive about 12:30 A.M. and I'm assuming we got the last batch since all the workers seemed to be cleaning up the place as we finished up our Ramen.  They also forgot to give us the red ginger you usually get on the side.  My boyfriend and I didn't realize this until we headed out the door after seeing the Ramen add-ons were compiled together at the bar ready to be stored for the next business day.

If you plan to go maybe try and go during normal\/peak hours.  The way I see it, it's like ordering french fries in the wee hours of the night, when they are usually sitting out too long and become stale and soggy.  Basically, you might not get the best batch of broth... 

Yeah, sorry Monta Ramen, there's just no chemistry between you and me.  Good try though.

And it has a very strong taste of the pork fat. Many might love the thickness, but I am not a pork fan, so is a no for me. Shoyu base is just chicken soup with soy sauce, just soso.

I've always had good service, although sometimes there is a little bit of a communication problem... my English isn't so good sometimes! ;-)  But that's never annoyed me because I love the soups here.

So far I have only tried the Tonkatsu. I ordered with extra pork, egg, and (I know, shame on me), butter.  you can also order extra noodles if you aren't a big broth eater.  The Tonkatsu is, I believe, a pork based broth.  Its thick (for a broth), a little salty (but not too salty), and very flavorful.  The pork was cut very thinly, and was so juicy, almost buttery.  I barely had to chew it.  Now, I am no expert in homemade noodles or anything, but the noodles for me were quite good... filling and tasty.

The place is pretty small and seats about about 30 people, but from what I've heard from people that have been to Japan the look and feel of the place would be your typical ramen house. The first time I visited Monta was with a group of 6 and the wait wasn't that bad considering it was during lunch and the place was pretty packed. I also liked the fact that you can sit at the counter in front of the cooks so you can see all the action going on in the kitchen.

The food here is awesome, from the ramen to the gyoza to the pork belly bowl all are simple dishes with outstanding flavor. I've tried both the Shoyu and the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen the only difference was the broth where the tonkotsu was a pork bone flavored broth. In both they put slices of pork which have been slowly braised to the point it melts in your mouth. So if you're a pork lover this is the place to come check out. The noodles are cooked to perfection and by watching the cooks they use a fresh noodles in which they cook to order. The texture combination of the soft pork and the chewy noodles makes you want more and more.

I guarantee you will never pick up the package ramen ever again after you've visited Monta. So if your looking for a quick bite and want quality Japanese ramen come check out Monta it will make you say ""cup 'o' what???",2,1,1

Location: 1 block West of Decatur on Spring Mountain Road. It's tucked into the back of a small shopping center off the North side of Spring Mountain. Signage is minimal which means if you're not paying attention you will miss it.  

Parking: Limited parking spaces if other businesses nearby are open. Can be tight to park if crowded. 

Monta is small. Square footage wise they've taken a small space and maximized every square foot of it. Don't be surprised if there's a wait that you have to stand outside as there's room for maybe 2-3 people inside the front door. 

Seating. They have a handful of tables and a counter with slightly uncomfortable stools you can sit on that looks into a fun to watch kitchen. If you are shy, claustrophobic, or don't like slurping noodles where anyone can watch this is not the place for you. 

Food: I walked in here skeptical. 559 Yelp reviews. Lots of heated discussions, controversy abounds about Monta. I came to try it, and I came in a bad mood to boot. I ordered Miso Ramen with extra slices of charziu. And I had an OMG moment here that left me with a smile from ear to ear and I left the bowl totally empty. I will say that Ramen Sora has better charziu, hands down. But the overall experience I had at Monta was superior in every other aspect.  

Special Notes: Monta's Miso Ramen has a bit more oil in the broth. It's not an oil that ruins the taste, it seems to enhance it somewhat. But it's also a small problem if you're sitting at the counter slurping a bowl of ramen and you get some splash back that lands on your shirt. If you've got to go back to work after eating at the counter, having some Shout wipes on hand is essential. 

Overall Impression? I loved it. From the wide range of people I ate lunch beside to the overall awesomeness of the Miso Ramen to the friendly and fast staff, count me among those who understand why Monta inspires such a range of emotion.

We stopped by Monta on a recent trip to Vegas.  It is located on Spring Mountain road like most of the other popular nearby offstrip spots and is located in the same strip as Raku and Kung Fu Tea.  The parking lot is a bit tight and can fill up pretty quickly on busy nights but there is street parking and we have used the lot opposite of the strip (store was closed).

There was a short wait at Monta as expected but it was reasonable - only 3 other names on the clipboard.  The shop consisted of a long L shaped bar and 10 or so small tables.  Not a huge place but not small either.  We all ordered the Tonkatsu ramen and Tanaka fried rice as recommended.  The default toppings were a bit sparse (pork, bamboo, ginger, 'shrooms) but considering the price (under $7) I didn't mind.  I added a soft boiled egg to mine - other standard toppings were available (corn, more pork, butter, etc) We were pleasantly surprised at the turnaround for the ramen - within 5-10 minutes.

The broth carried plenty of flavor but was a bit thicker than the other ramen shops.  The noodles were thin and firm but not overly so.  The bowl only came with 2 slices of pork but it was expertly prepared - tender with a good combination of meat and fat.  There was a slight aftertaste (from MSG?) but easily queched from the Kung Fu milk tea from next door.

The fried rice was solid but a bit salty.  It was more than likely from the mustard leaves either being too abundant or just overly salty themselves.  Not bad but I may go with the potstickers or simply stick with the ramen next time.

Very small place and that is the reason for a long wait time. I had 6 people in my group and we had to wait about 45 min. Groups of 2\/3 were just going in and out. The menu is very simple and to the point with the different types of ramen they offer and the description of the broth and toppings. The first thing that stood out to me were the prices. Everything was less than $9. They also have other items like fried rice and gyozas. I ordered the Kuro Black Garlic Oil ramen and substituted the thin noodles for the medium thick noodles and added eggs, corn, and a sheet of seaweed. I'm not big on ramen but I really enjoyed my bowl. I even drank my broth from the bowl. The flavors were great and the noodles are hand made. For my table that ordered 6 bowls of ramen and an order of gyoza, our total was just under $75. That blew me away because I've always seen and spent at least $15 for a bowl ramen and most of them did not taste as good as here at Monta's. My only tip is expect a longer wait if you have a group of 4 or more because there are not many seats and the place is small. Definitely worth checking out especially for the prices and quality. Service was also great!",0,0,0

This restaurant is located in a small plaza and it's also a small location that can sit only about 20-25 ppl.   There is usually at least an hour wait during dinner and lunch time.   They don't take reservations and won't sit you unless all parties are present.  I highly recommend coming during a weekday or early before rush hour.   But even if you had to wait, it's still worth trying for the 1st time.  The food comes out really fast and the servers are not a few feet away.   Monta is very efficient in getting you in and out.  The menu overall is very affordable and what's even better is that the ramen is delicious!   

The 2 dishes you have to try are Kuro Ramen Black Garlic oil $7.95 and Takana Fried Rice $6.95.  The ramen broth is very rich from a long period of simmering and the noodles comes out chewy just like the way i like it.  If you like roasted garlic, you have to try it.  I found the flavor was even better when you add chili oil.  Eat this ramen fast because the soup gets richer and saltier the longer the soup sits.   It was a bit too salty and thicker for my liking.  But it's still a good ramen that you can't get anywhere else in this world!!!!!  You can also add additional toppings for additional fee if you are feeling adventurous.   The Takana Fried rice is the best rice i have ever had and i want to note that i'm not much of a ricer eater.  But the way they made the fried rice is out of this world.  Its served with chasu pork, mustard vegetables, green onions, eggs and white onions.  I loved the texture with the white and green onions mixed together.  They also give you a side of radish ginger for more enhanced flavoring. 

Note: 
1.  They do accept credit card if the bill is over $10.
2.  They don't allow you to bring drinks from another restaurant.",3,1,1

The egg..how could I forget to order the soft-boiled egg? I'm actually still bitter about that. So please do me (and yourself) a favor and add a soft-boiled egg to your ramen.

This one seemed very authentic & the staff in the kitchen were Japanese, which is a plus.

Also had the pork belly for an appetizer. That was very tasty, tender, & fatty!

The location is away from the strip but the ramen was reasonably priced & definitely worth the drive! I would come back again!",4,0,2

So the restaurant itself would be best described as cozy... I wouldn't come strolling in 10+ people deep. Most of the seating appears to be surrounding the kitchen in a bar-like fashion. The menu is pretty basic and to the point - easy enough to order. You have a selection of noodles\/ramen dishes to choose from... then you can add extras like egg, nori, etc. The basic ramen dishes are pretty filling themselves....but I added egg and nori for more flavor.

I first went to Monta about a month ago.  I thought it was good.  Then asked some of my Japanese Speaking staff where they go for good Ramen.  They mentioned Inaba and Sora.  I went Sora and finally made it to Inaba last night.  Well actually went to Monta and there was a line then decided to check out Inaba.  Inaba had 2 tables seated, other than that it was empty.  It was good.  Handmade noodles.  Cooked to order.  It took a while to get our food, but it was good.  Would I go back, no.

But nope! Located in Las Vegas, over 100* in the summer and serving nothing but boiling soup AND an open kitchen that lets heat from the stove circulate throughout the extremely small dining area...Monta is a great place to dine in the winter, but in the summer, you'd have to eat it with struggle. I'd hate to give it less than 4 stars because of its environment, since the food is delicious, but Monta is one of those places where it's really a diamond in the rough, and it will eventually affect the way you feel about the meal overall.

The restaurant itself is very tiny. It sits up to around 30 people max and because of its popularity, it is always packed. They have about 10 items on their menu only, with 4-5 of it being their specialty noodles. The broth here is superb, especially their miso flavored ramen. It is very rich and buttery in taste. The soup is not salty at all, and their noodles are extremely fresh and chewable. It is almost uniquely sweet when you bite into them. The char siu pork that comes with the noodles (japanese pork with soy on the outer skin and slow BBQ) is delicious. The meat is thinly sliced and fatty at the same time. When you bite into it, with the combination of the buttery taste of the broth, you will get an almost guilty sensation of rich flavors. It is really worth the experience, if you can deal with the heat. 

Monta gives you the option of adding extra items into your ramen, each of it having a charge from like .50 to $3 ... The only thing that is worth the extra charge (since I ordered it all before-- not worth it!) is the boiled egg, butter, and extra char siu. Everything else will just overwhelm your soup and by the time you're done eating half.. the soup will be soggy and floating with stuff in it. 

Just beware though, the standard price starts off at like 6.95.. But  if you get carried away with the extra sides... your ramen can come out to about $14 without you even realizing it!",4,0,1

I know I said in my Sora review that I probably would not go back to Monta after falling in deep and passionate love with my bowl of ramen at Sora, but I wanted to eat by myself today and I knew if I went to Monta, I could probably get a seat quicker than at Sora since Monta has the counter-top seating.  I used to go to Monta every Saturday for lunch by myself and noticed that there were a lot of people who like to eat there by themselves, which makes it easier and faster for me to get a seat.

Today was so busy!  So busy in fact, that I still had to wait about 15 minutes before getting seated. They only have a couple of servers who also double (triples?) as hostesses and bussers so these ladies are running around like crazy.  Like Sora, I just find myself exremely impressed at how quickly they turn tables over without making you feel rushed when you're eating.  I love to sit at the counter-top and watch them making the ramen.  The guys are super nice and will usually chat a little bit when I've been there on Saturdays, but today he was constantly running around getting those delicious bowls of steaming ramen out of the kitchen.   

Anyway, I don't have anything against Monta.  I just think Sora is way better.  However, I did leave there today feeling extremely happy and satisfied.  I always get the Tonkatsu-Shoyu with chasyu and nitamago.  One bowl of ramen is usually more than enough for me.  If I'm with someone, we will usually also get the gyoza, which are good but nothing special.  Today, however, I decided to try something new and adventurously ordered the kimchi fried rice.  Not sure why regular fried rice comes in a small and large, but add some kimchi to it and you can only get one size, which is a large serving.  But I'm glad I got it because it was freakin' wonderful!  The seasoning is just perfect and the kim chi is just subtle enought that it doesn't overpower the fried rice taste.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I still can't help but compare my ramen at Monta to my ramen at Sora, and though it falls short, I still really enjoy Monta as part of my ramen rotation and will continue to go there every once in a while.",2,0,2

Choice of 4 Ramen bowls. Tonkotsu, Shoyu, Tonkotsu-Shoyu (combination), and Miso.
My favorite is the Tonkotsu-Shoyu, best of both worlds!  Full of flavor, not bland at all..I only added a little bit of spice to add some heat!
I would definitely add a hard-boiled egg (minus a star because you have to pay extra, EGG should be included!)
The bowl itself it well portioned and I was full after finished off last drips of broth and slurping my last noodle. 

We also had the pork belly bowl.  To me this was flat.  As in, not what I was expecting with pork belly.  It was more gelatinous than crispy with fat on it.  Order the small bowl to try it I'd say. 

Quick tips: Can be a long wait as the place is small so plan accordingly.  However the food comes quick, almost 5 minutes after you order! so the turnaround time isn't bad at all.

When I arrived there was no host at the stand but I was told by one of the waitresses walking by to add my name to the sign in sheet. I added my name in the next available open slot, and joined the crowd of people who were standing around outside waiting to be called. 45 minutes pass and I see that a couple who had arrived after me is called in for the their table. I go inside to ask about my position and I see on the sign in sheet that they have literally skipped over my name and seated at least 12 people who had signed in after me. I'm bewildered at this point because I'm starving. So I flag down a man who appears to be a manager lurking in the back of the restaurant. He tells me that my name was skipped over because it was not written exactly within the lines on the sheet. Huh?? So you skipped me because my handwriting went over the line in my designated space? I was so utterly confused. With not so much as an apology, he tells me the only thing he can do is add me to the bottom of the list. Thankfully, a very nice couple who had witnessed the entire thing invites my fiance and I to share their four top. We were very grateful as we would have had to wait another hour just to be seated. How strange. The food was decent however, neither one of us eats pork so we ordered the chicken broth only to find out that they still add large hunks of pork within the soup even when you specifically request no pork.

Why is that you ask? Because at least then I'm already prepared to be disappointed. The ramen scene in Vegas is not that great, there are few choices of where to go and even fewer options of what type to order.

Hearing from my friends that we were planning to visit a new ramen place I got quite excited. Were we finally going to find a place worth eating ramen at after all these years? The simple answer, yes.

As soon as I walked into Monta I knew that this was going to be a place we would eat again. The decor was simplistic in nature and at the same time very enchanting. There were few seats, maybe 26 at most, but you didn't feel cramped at all. We chose to sit at the bar seating and got a great view of the chefs at work.

A first look at the menu told me that there were three different types of ramen to choose from. This may not seem like a lot but accompanying that was a decent sized list of sides that you can add for a small price. As my nickname is Miso, I decided to stay true to it and order the miso ramen. I requested no bamboo shoots or mushrooms, that come with the order at no extra cost along with some slices of pork. I also decided to add an egg to my order because egg in my opinion makes everything better.

The staff there was very upbeat and happily took our orders. They were very chatty with each other, but not in a bad way. This is the kind of staff that you know they enjoy their work. If anyone needed a refill on their drink the staff was very quick to notice and refill them without any trouble.

As the food arrived all of us looked at our food putting off the first bite in fear of being disappointed once again by another bowl of ramen, boy were we wrong. The first bite was amazing and with that we began to devour our dinner with gusto. The flavor of the miso was a little on the salty side but not so much to over power it. The noodles were prepared well and the texture was enjoyable. The egg that I had ordered did not disappoint, and the pork was a pleasure to eat. The size of the order was enough to make me content. Had I wanted more there was an option for more noodles for $2.00, which is not that bad at all.

Overall the experience at Monta was a great one. It may not be the best ramen out there, but it is for sure the best ramen you are going to find here in Vegas. The pricing is reasonable, the order came out to under $10.00, and the food did not disappoint. If you are looking for some good ramen, Monta is the place to go in town!

The Chasu (bbq pork) here is quite good, IMO it is better than the chasu at the well known Daikokuya in Los Angeles. Oddly, they have 2 different types of ramen noodles here that are ASSIGNED to the type of broth you choose and they will NOT let you choose the other noodles with a different broth. I prefer the noodles they use in the miso ramen, but normally prefer a combination of tonkatsu and shoyu broth.

TL;DR - Small place with average ramen with overpriced toppings

Very small and cozy restaurant. Be prepared to wait a long time if you go with a party of 3 or more. We came with 4 and had to wait for one of the four-seat tables to vacate. It was kind of awkward standing in a cramped entrance staring down folks who are eating in your to-be seats.

I ordered the black ramen just to try something new, but it was unflavorful. By the time I finished adding condiments, it pretty much became a Thai noodle soup.

The overall service was nice and quick, though none of the servers were smiling.

FIRST IMPRESSION and ORDERING
As we stood waiting for about maybe 15-20 min, we peeked over to the table of 4 who were eating on a table smack right next to the entry door where everyone was standing & waiting. We saw that the fried rice looked a tad greasy and so did the ramen broth. My dinner companion gave me that look of ""hmmm"" and I said ""I guess we'll just try it since we're already here"". We were curious to compare this to our usual Ramen Dojo (San Mateo, CA).

We ordered one tonkotsu $6.95 (+egg $1.50  and corn $0.50), one shoyu ramen $6.95 with extra chasu (+4 pieces, $2.50) and one kimchi fried rice $6.95 (hoping this would be less greasy than the regular fried rice and it was slightly less common in the Ramen place).  Having not eaten lunch that day, we were huuungry and ready to devour our order as soon as it arrived. First impression: noodles presentation looked neat and mouthwatering; the ingredients were neatly arranged on top and the bowl of ramen looked quite appetizing. Especially with 2 hungry stomachs impatiently waiting to devour them. LOL. 

The broth didn't appear as greasy as my earlier glance at the previous table.  There was a curious black ring around each of the chasu (more about this later) that's usually not present in the other ramen's place chasu piece.  Interesting, we thought.

The fried rice still looked a tad on the greasy side by the shines it showed. But in all fairness, I haven't ordered Japanese fried rice in a ramen place for some time. Maybe they all look like that.

Now on to the fun part.

FOOD
The broth on the tonkotsu ramen was delish. Slightly on the lighter side compared to Ramen Dojo, but it was still good. One big difference that made Ramen Dojo's broth more 'hearty' and tasty was the addition of chicken bits in their broths. If you like a lighter version of Tonkotsu broth, you will like Monta's version better.

The shoyu broth was light yet had a lot of flavor. 

The tonkotsu bowl came with thin noodles. We both were very curious how good (smooth) this thin noodle would be. While not as 'smooth' as some of the other thin ramen noodles we've tried in Japan, we were pleasantly surprised at how smooth and tasty it was. So, thumbs up here.

The noodles in the shoyu bowl was also pretty good. It is the yellow, thicker, curly kind; of course heavier than the one in the tonkotsu bowl, yet not super-heavy.

As for the curious black ring around the chasu, as you probably have guessed, it is the pork skin. The skin itself was a real thin strip with a very thin layer of fat underneath it.  Including this skin gave the soup broth an extra flavor and aroma that distinguished it from other ramen's place broth. It was probably also why the half-finished ramen bowl we peeked earlier looked slightly greasier. I don't typically see this pork skin included in other ramen shop. This is a plus for the broth. The slightly greasier broth didn't quite happen as much in my bowl. 'cause I like to scrape off the fat under the pork skin. LOL. Another thumbs up!

The last dish which was the kimchee fried rice ($6.95) was yum, though I still think it could be done with slightly less oil.  Unlike the rice bowl-sized portion that it often comes in, this fried rice came in a rounded square plate of the size that could've been a meal by itself.

SERVICE
Service was friendly, efficient and brisk without making us feel rushed. But we did devoured our meal super fast and left quickly as a courtesy to the long lines of people waiting.

Two thumbs up for this place.

This joint is mad smalls yo!  Not only that, it was packed at 4pm!!! Yeah the hungover Asians woke up effin late for ""lunch"".  We obviously had to wait since we rolled 9 deep up... We waited around for maybe 20 minutes inside since it was way too cold to wait outside.  We were finally seated and served by the nicest waitress ever.  This chick smiled every moment that I remember at Monta.  Very nice and curtious.

We ordered the following dishes:

Miso Ramen with Chasu:  If you order this Ramen, I warn you... DO NOT ADD BUTTER!  This thing is mad heavy.  I felt I was drinking mashed potatoes at one point.  The flavor was amazing but it came out warm and not hot enough for the weather.  I wish my bowl was just a bit warmer and less heavy.  Other than this the soup was really good.  The chasu pork just melted in my mouth. mmmm

Dumplings:  Perfectly fried.  Now I've tried dumplings for many years and this place had one of the best!  Dumplings are supposed to have that golden roast fried look.  Monta's dumplings all had this color.  Once your dumpling has dark brown or black then that mo'fo is burned out and will be waaay to crispy.  If your dumpling doesn't have that golden roast then it probably is just semi fried which is too bland and soggy.  

Pork Belly Rice:  This was pretty good too.  Very tender and well marinated meat and enough ginger for a unique taste.  Most people in my party chose this as their favorite. 

Ton Katsu Ramen:  My friends ordered this Ramen which was pretty good in my opinion.  The description on the menu made it seem very rich in fat and unhealthy but it actually turned out to be less heavy than the Miso I ate.

I can remember mostly the frustration of having to wait to be seated for about 30 minutes for lunch, my wife couldn't believe that we would have to wait (of course) because Yelp put these guys on map let alone because we were on vacation...

I'm glad I take pictures cause I would not remember what we had otherwise.

I must have ordered extra chasiu signaling the extra fatty pork belly as all of our bowl had some thin slices of  regular pork already.  The eggs we ordered extra look soft and slightly runny.

A couple friends and I had gone here after hearing about how amazing this establishment is. Always seeing the long lines whenever eating in the neighboring establishments, we had always passed up on coming until now.

Monta Ramen is in the literal hub of Chinatown, as everything here boosts popularity. From Zen, Trattoria Nakamura-ya, Snowflake Shavery, and Raku, be warned that finding a parking spot during busier times can be almost impossible.

We were promptly seated as soon as a table was available for us. If there is a wait, I suggest figuring out what you want before being seated. The servers here work efficiently, so be prepared!

I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. Prices were pretty cheap and there are extra toppings for you to add. Be warned as these add-ons are are lot more expensive than other ramen joints in town. As much as I wanted to like the food, I couldn't. The broth was thick, creamy, and filled with so much sodium I felt parched shortly after attempting to drink the broth. I couldn't taste much else from the ramen because of how heavy and salty the broth was. The other two in my group seemed to agree, as we all usually finished our ramen bowls from other restaurants, but suddenly had a hard time finishing half these bowls. We felt sick after leaving the restaurant.

As popular as this place is, I really cannot see why. Maybe it was a bad day and I will someday give this place another try. But for now, I'd rather go to a ramen place that doesn't make me feel nauseous.",1,0,1

While I understand the aim to look like an authentic Japanese ramen shop, they really ought to consider how impractical it is to have a large customer base with only a few seats. We waited in the cold outside for about half and hour, and then were able to squeeze our way inside the door to wait for another 20 minutes or so. There is a wait list that fills up very quickly.

I ordered the miso ramen with an egg, and a side of gyoza. The noodles were perfect but I found the miso broth to be incredibly salty and it overpowered everything. The egg was pre-boiled and probably stored in the fridge because it was cold in the middle. That was disappointing, as I paid over $1 extra for it and the yolk wasn't creamy at all. The gyoza were your typical run of the mill dumplings and tasted like they came from a frozen package rather than ""handmade"" as the menu stated.

The noodles have very nice texture, which is what I mainly look for in the noodles.  

I usually get the Tonkastu Ramen with a little extra Roasted Pork, but I like the Miso Ramen, too.  The Miso is also very good, but just different.  I would characterize the Miso as sweeter, and I usually prefer the meatier broth to the sweet broth, but that's just me.  I also love that all the Ramen's are below $7, I believe.  I think I usually pay around 6.95 for the Ramen, so it's a great deal.  
I have also tried the Pork Belly Bowl, which I really like.  I always try to order pork belly wherever I see it, and Monta's did not disappoint.

The Spring Mountain Road strip mall location where Monta Ramen is located is seemingly blessed because it features two authentic and amazing food locales that I was lucky enough to bet on two food-tastic nights with my friends.  

Monta Ramen is the real deal! So amazing is the Kuro (tonkatsu with black garlic oil) that you will definitely want to add a Kenadama (extra noodles) to help you get as much of that magical elixir that is perfect after a night out partying or before a night out. The broth is creamy and smooth and made with great effect to give it surprising ""I can't stop eating"" umami flavor.
I would have loved it if the noodles which should almost always be the star of the ramen experience were slightly larger but so strong was the broth's performance that I didn't care.

The other great thing about this place is that this bowl only cost about $8 at the time that I am writing this. Add a 5 spice cured soft boiled egg for even more creamy richness.

Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen was my go-to both times.  It was my first time having authentic Ramen and it was delicious.  The pork, abundant in portion just melts in your mouth and the broth - my lord, the broth was creamy and rich and thick and so tasty.  The bowls were the perfect size too! My boyfriend and I joked that this is better than pho, but I put pho in a totally different category ;) 

We came here around lunchtime during the weekday and on both occasions, there was about a 10-15 minute wait, but it's worth it guys! It's definitely easier if you're a single diner or just the two of you.  A party of 3 or more -- be prepared to wait.  The place was rather small so I got worried, but the staff are efficient and people are in and out.  We were seated at the counter closest to the kitchen, so it got pretty hot while waiting and eating our ramen, but it wasn't too bad.  For the amount you get and the absolute tastiness of everything -- it was worth every bit of wait and effort especially for being under $10 for a bowl.  

I recently came back to DC and decided to try another ramen joint in the city and it didn't even come close.  Boyfriend and I were really disappointed because Monta Ramen has set the bar high for us and I cannot wait to come back to Vegas just for another bowl! 

I definitely recommend this place if you're traveling or trying Ramen for the first time.  You will not regret it!

I had to go through 2 full cups of water and I still felt that wasn't enough.   After 1\/3 of the way, I had to eat the ramen without the broth, which was unfortunate because the broth is what makes the ramen.  On the upper side, the noodles and eggs were perfectly cooked!

After waiting to get seated in the small restaurant, we were greeted quickly. What happened next was weird. We waited for almost 20 minutes before a member of the wait staff arrived to take our order. It took entirely too long for simple noodles in heated broth to arrive. It takes me two and a half minutes to make similar noodles and another two minutes to plate everything.

If you go during the Summer, which is always in Vegas, be ready for heat inside. Like another Yelper has mentioned, due to its size, this place stays hot and has little to no airflow.

The tonkotsu ramen tasted more like fatty grease than a pork flavor, the server recommends the Tonkotsu-Shoyu and I understood why. 
The Tonkotsu-Shoyu is better but what is a peeve of mine is that recently when I get to-go (because the place is so small and gets crowded), they get really skimpy with a good piece of chashu! I always get extra chashu and if I'm lucky I get a piece that isn't 45% jiggly fat, and they're small pieces maybe 2in diameter of thin meat. And to top it off sometimes it's not even a discernible piece but a broken up tiny lump of fat-meat that's supposed to be the last remaining 3 out  of 6 pieces... which surely didn't look like 3 pieces.

Overall I think it's overrated and a little overpriced for the amount of soup\/noodles and meat given along with a very ""fat"" tasting meal but hey that's flavor I suppose. I might come back every once in a while unless I find someplace better although it would be further away.",1,1,1

Tonkotsu Ramen $(7) and +$2 for egg- slightly above average-The broth is pretty good.  It comes w\/ 2 pieces of meat (which is detailed on the menu).  The pork base is pretty thick, so if you are into thick broths this is the place to go.  

My gripe is they don't give you complimentary egg w\/ the broth, so you gotta pay $2 extra (which is pretty steep if you ask me).  I mean, who eats ramen w\/o egg?  It's almost required!!!  I also would've preferred my egg to be a little more runny.  Part of the egg yoke should seep into the soup (but still retain it's shape).  The egg I got was slightly hard when I got it.

Pork belly rice ($5.50 for a large, $3.50 for small) - Average.  The pork belly is extremely sweet!  I think they use too much sauce or something. The sauce almost over-powers the taste of the meat.  I'd pass on this next time.

I was able to try my friends Takana fried rice and it's delicious.  10x better than the pork belly.

Tips:
-Not good for groups.  Restaurant is small, maybe seats 20 people inside.   Parties of 4 or larger might have trouble sitting.
