It's big enough for two people. Ordered a small side plate just in case. The chicken tasted really good. However, the chicken breast was a bit chewy. Perhaps that's the portion where it's hard to cook cause of its meat density.  The Smoked briskets were perfect. It was a good size meal, didn't put anyone into a food coma.",0,0,0

Yardbird has a lofty reputation and as a result, our expectations were high.  Yardbird lived up to its considerable hype.  We had lunch at Yardbird on a Friday afternoon.  There were 3 of us and we were able to walk right in.  I liked the joint, especially the random pictures of Cash, Elvis, Bob Dylan, etc. that were cycling through on the wall.

We were approached fairly quickly by a server to take our drink orders.  Good beer list, decent wine list.  It was a little early for me so I went with a housemade lemonade.  As expected, a restaurant that specializes in southern fare makes fantastic lemonade.  It's $6 a glass, and I do not know if that comes with refills since I did not get one.  If you don't get refills that's a hefty price for lemon juice, water, and sugar, even when the mixture is as good as this.  

The 3 of us split the chicken and waffles, chicken biscuits, fries, mac and cheese, and coleslaw.  You may bristle at $36 for the famous chicken, watermelon, and waffles, but it was a lot of food.  You get 4 pieces of chicken plus a large serving of watermelon and the thick waffle.  The food comes out QUICK.  As in, within 5 minutes of us ordering it.  I guess when you have something as labor intensive as fried chicken as the star of the show you just constantly make batches of it.  But, it did not suffer in quality.  This chicken was definitely fresh, it had not been sitting under a salamander prior to its arrival at our table.

I had the breast and thigh of the chicken.  Both were juicy and flavorful, but the dark meat was better.  The skin is crunchy and seasoned very well.  No need for additional salt and pepper.  The chicken is just good quality fried chicken.  Is it the best I've ever had?  Probably not, but it is damn good and I didn't have any qualms about the price.

The waffle has a nice slight crunch to it and a chewy center.  Paired with the bourbon maple syrup it was very good.  Paired with the chicken it was great.  We had to ask for more syrup, the waffle to syrup ratio was off due to the size of the waffle.  The spiced watermelon didn't land with any of us.  It was okay, and it's good quality watermelon.  We just did not love it.

The sides, in order of preference:  mac and cheese, fries (with bacon ranch that they should bottle and sell), and cole slaw.  The slaw was good, its served with a crisp of chicken skin, but it couldn't compare to the mac and cheese.  This stuff was creamy and incredibly flavorful.  We all loved it.

The chicken biscuits were another winner.  The flavorful chicken on a flaky biscuit with some very good pepper jelly was a strong combination.

It took me awhile to get to Yardbird after its opening.  I will not wait so long next time, and will likely return on my next trip to Vegas.  Highly recommended.",1,0,2

I check out the menu once I get seated and see they want 36 bucks for the chicken and waffles!!! Wtf??? I mean damn come on man!!! So I got the C&W but I got the price down to 26 so I was cool with that. Now I can't lie the food was really good and probably the best C&W I've ever had.

Dinner Experience:
Service - Fantastic. We ate early so it wasn't busy at all. Our waiter was friendly, we were seated quickly and our food came out really fast. The one small bummer here was that we weren't done with our appetizer when our food came out.  BLT appetizer was outstanding. We had the friend chicken and mac n cheese for dinner and it was so delicious. The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the mac and cheese was so well done. 

Brunch: I think I loved our brunch even more than dinner. I got the ham biscuits and the potato hash. Let me tell you, that potato hash is made of sunshine and dreams - it's that good. I don't know how they make hashbrowns creamy and crispy all at once, but they do and it's a beautiful marriage. I also have to give a special shout out for their coffee. Vegas is filled with really crappy and expensive coffee. This was some of the most rich, full bodied coffee I've had in that town. I would have taken an entire thermos if they let me. 

Overall - do yourself a favor and come here. It's relatively new and I don't think everyone has caught on to how fantastic the food is. Stop going to gross places like TGI Fridays and come here. The end.",0,0,1

Items on the menu are delicious items like chicken & waffles, southern fried chicken, biscuits, mac n cheese, etc. 

I let the waiter bring me his favorite drink. It was delicious! It was called ""Southern Revival"". 

For starters, he brought out the fried tomatoes that are topped with pork belly. The dish was called green fried tomato BLT. Each bite was delectable!

For the main course, the waiter brought us chicken, watermelon & waffles, along with mac n cheese (five cheeses). Each dish was amazing in it's own right. The chicken was crunchy and perfectly seasoned.

For dessert, our waiter recommended the banana pudding. It was wonderful! It had bananas, Nilla wafers, homemade whip cream... heavenly!

It's a pretty spacious venue and definitely nicely decorated. They sat our group by the kitchen and most of you would think that being seated there would be annoying but it wasn't. It was fun watching the food getting prepped and such. It definitely was a well oiled machine. Our server was great and all the staff that we encountered were friendly. Now on to the food...

We split four appetizers between 6 people and our server was gracious enough to add to more deviled eggs and biscuits to our order - an order usually comes with 4. 

Deviled eggs - this was delicious. I generally am not a fan of deviled eggs but this was seasoned nicely and the flavor of dill was spot on. 

Kale salad - this dish was okay.  It was lightly dressed, they used baby kale and that's all I really have to say about that.

Mac & cheese - when this item arrived at our table, I wouldn't have thought that it could be split between 6 people. That little mini cast iron sure fed all of us. It was creamy and cheesy and I wanted more. 

Classic buttermilk biscuits - I am also not a fan of biscuits. This however was fluffy, soft and buttery. It also included some butter and jam in cute little jars. Add some of that on the biscuit and darn it, you would want another one. 

On to the entrees. The boyfriend and I decided to share\/split two entrees.  He had the St. Louis style pork ribs - we asked for it to be dry and BBQ sauce on the side. He ordered the full rack and that was plenty for two people. The rub had a nice flavor and the meat fell off the bone.  Dip the meat in some sauce and it was even better. I ordered Llewelyn's fine fried chicken. An order came with a thigh, breast, drumstick and wing. Our server told us that it was a good size serving and boy, it was really a good sized serving. Most of the group ordered this and most of us didn't finish it because it was that filling. The chicken was moist and nicely flavored. I think the only thing that we didn't like about it was that the skin wasn't crunchy enough. But this is just a preference. 

Oh we all ordered cocktails\/drinks and they have a nice selection. I had the southern peach and it was nice and refreshing. Make sure to order one when you dine here. 

Overall, it was great ambience, the staff was friendly, and the food was great.  Also, if I'm ever around one of these establishments, I would go back.",0,0,0

I think we only saw our waitress once after we ordered eventually having to track down a manager just to get our check and then left cash so we didn't have to wait longer. 

Chicken and waffle was way overpriced for what it was. It was just fried chicken and one waffle. Nothing exciting about the flavoring or anything of the fried chicken. The syrup was a nice touch but not worth the $36 for fried chicken and a waffle. 

The menu is very small for a brunch menu. Not a lot of options. Luckily we were seated next to the kitchen and after not seeing anything my husband liked he saw a burger come out of the kitchen and asked the waitress. She was very reluctant to bring us the dinner menu and when she did told us the only thing we could order off it was the burger ( it was 1 in the afternoon not 9 in the morning) but then we continued to see sandwiches and other dinner items come out of the kitchen while waiting for our food. The poached egg dish had a very odd overpowering lemon flavor to the sauce that ruined the whole dish. The burger was super greasy. 

We ordered the peach cobbler instantly cause we had friends tell us it was fantastic (again nothing overly special) and still ended up waiting for it forever after our meal.  

Wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend it. Maybe it's better for the cocktails!",0,0,0

The biscuits (4 to an order $7) were on the small side, but delicious, and came with two small jars of honey butter (yum) and apple cinnamon jam (double yum).  For the entrée, two of us ordered shrimp and grits (highly recommended $28), and one had artichoke pasta (cheesy goodness $21), the other had the wedge salad (meh $18).

The table right next to the kitchen was also very cool. Made our dinner choices easier since we saw everything prepared and presented before our eyes.

The Bar:
We ordered the bone marrow and jalapeño corn bread. Both were OUT OF THIS WORLD and filled with so much flavor. The hubs enjoyed his blackberry bourbon lemonade and I was happy when they brought a pitcher of water for me personally. The presentation was impeccable and I thought it was very classy when our bartender 'set' the table right in front of us before our meals were served. Made us feel extra special.

The Restaurant:
Like I mentioned above, we were able to sit in the kitchen area even though they usually sit for parties of 6+ in that area. I mentioned it being our 10th Anniversary week and they made a special exception for our party of 4.

We ordered the mac & cheese, fried chicken (without watermelon), short ribs with green beans and cauliflower mash and the salmon pasta. All of it was amazing wonderful and perfect in every way.

To finish off our exceptional meal, we all ordered dessert which could have easily been shared. Deep fried Oreo cookies, fig molten chocolate cake, blueberry\/lemon sundae and the bacon\/butterscotch 4 layer cake.

Nothing about this meal was anything less than perfect. It was one of the best meals I've ever enjoyed and can't wait to return for another go around!",2,1,1

We were lucky to grab a booth right in front of the kitchen so were able to see all the delicious food coming out of the kitchen.  Our party barely even used the menus given to us and just ordered with our eyes seeing all the different southern entrees coming out.  

The food is quite heavy and I don't recommend this place if you're going to go party directly afterwards.  I ended up sharing the crunchy yardbird sandwich (basically a fried chicken sandwich) and it was the smart thing to do for my waistline.  The sandwich was quite delicious and the kitchen was kind enough to cut the sandwich in half so my friend and I could easily split it (they even put an extra cornichon on top so each of us could enjoy one).  The fried chicken sandwich does have Crystal hot sauce which gave it a nice little zip to it.  The sandwich does come with a side of buttermilk sauce but I barely used it since the sandwich was already delicious.  The sandwich does come with a generic green salad that neither one of us ate.

We also got an order of fries which comes with the same buttermilk sauce.  The fries were ok, I've had better, but they were a nice accompaniment to the sandwich.  I recommend only getting one order of fries for four people.  The food is so heavy and rich you won't want to stuff your face with fries.

Our table of four also got bloody marys all around.  Yardbird knows how to make a delicious bloody mary.  The bloody mary is garnished with pickled okra, cornichon stuffed olive, and a picked green bean and finally the best part... BACON!  The only thing that was disappointing about the bloody mary was the fact that you couldn't really taste the alcohol (I guess that could be good or bad depending on the person). 

If I had enough of an appetite I would have ordered cinnamon apple hand pie or the maple bacon doughnut.  I guess I will have to make another visit the next time I come.",0,0,0

-We came here on a Friday night for dinner with reservations and we quickly got seated near the back where the chefs were cooking.  The menu was easy to read and gave a lot of options (drink menu was aplenty).  We ordered the Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles dish with honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon (a little spicy), cheddar cheese waffle, and bourbon maple syrup (you can really taste the alcohol!).  This is what they recommended and what we wanted to try.  We had two big pieces and two small pieces of chicken with maybe six cubes of watermelon and two waffles.  The taste was good, juicy, soft, and flavorful.  I would definitely come back here again for the chicken but not order this dish (watermelon and waffles). Our friend just ordered Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken (1\/2 a bird with honey hot sauce) and it was only $26. The waffles were only okay but the bourbon maple syrup was really good, and very different.  
-Aside, we had the skillet corn bread with cheddar, bacon, jalapeno, and maple butter.  This was also just okay.  It didn't taste fresh, and I did not taste much bacon in it.  I also tasted the mac and cheese which a lot of people talk about on yelp and my opinion is that it is delicious! I would order this again.

Improvements:
-Waffles had a very bland taste to it.  This was not my favorite. 
-Don't order the corn bread.

-CC and Cash accepted, they can split bills for you.
-Make a RSVP as it can get really busy after 6pm.",4,0,2

The décor and ambience is very inviting and welcoming. My friend best described it as country chic and that is Yardbird in a nutshell.

I ordered the Watermelon Sling and it was both refreshing and delicious. The Bourbon was definitely the star of the cocktail and the fresh watermelon juice added a subtle freshness to it.

Skillet Cornbread - The honey butter definitely makes this dish shine. You cannot beat corn bread made with real corn pieces baked into it. It was had a nice sweetness and smokiness to it. Baking it in the skillet gave it a nice crust on the sides and bottom.

Mac & Cheese - The dish was a little heavy on the cheddar cheese and I was kind of hoping for another type of cheese to balance it out, but it was overall a very tasty and filling dish. The panko bread crumbs on top finished the dish perfectly, adding a nice texture and saltiness to it.

Fried Chicken - One of the best fried chicken I have ever had. This is the reason you come to Yardbird and believe me you will not be disappointed. The only thing you that you would probably regret is if you don't order enough of it.

This is definitely a place you should check out, even with all of the choices you have in Vegas. For those on the East Coast, there's the one in Florida.",1,0,1

I had the Low & Slow Smoked Chicken Salad and my boyfriend had the Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken. Our waiter was super patient with us and recommended dishes for me since I was feeling something lighter. I went with his recommendation of the chicken salad and it surely was light enough! The sauce at the bottom was a bit on the salty end, but I wasn't sure if my taste buds were off that day because I was recovering from being sick. I did love the salad on top and the avocado bits at the bottom that was refreshing. The chicken was thinly striped so that each bite was just the perfect amount and flavor. My boyfriend had hot sauce on the side with his fried chicken, and he gave me the insides of the fried chicken, and boy was that chicken juicy!

Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken was the least of my favorites here.  It was just ""meh.""  At $26 and 27 hours of brining, the fried chicken failed to delivery.  It really didn't taste any better than the flat battered chicken you get at a Ralph's deli.  At least that was my impression.  No crispy skin.  It just goes to show you, some recipes are best kept simple and straightforward.  
My favorite fried chicken ever was at  Blue Ribbon Sushi.  Yes, a Japanese restaurant with the best fried chicken.  Go figure.  

Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken:  C+, didn't care for the batter, and it was greasy

Short Rib:  A+, OMG, amazingly tender, beef with perfect bbq sauce.  Easily the best thing on the menu  

Smoked Backyard BBQ Chicken:  B+\/A-,  PICK this chicken dish over the Fried Chicken.  Fantastic sauce, smokey and delicious.  And that charred okra - yum!

Mac and Cheese:   B+, pretty solid.

Being natives of Oklahoma and Texas, respectively, we were somewhat skeptical of a Las Vegas joint that so boldly promoted its chicken and waffles.

We shared the chicken and waffles, and our doubts proved pretty groundless; the chicken was juicy and crisp, and the waffle was fluffy, if a little softer than I like. They serve it with both syrup and a hoisin-y hot sauce; the latter kept the meal interesting for me. Between the one entree and the biscuits (very good), we were stuffed to the gills.

Our server was attentive and proactive without being pushy; he sensed that we were casual lunchgoers and that had us in and out inside of 35 minutes, but we never felt like he was trying to turn the table.

The atmosphere was fine - very country chic. It was a little loud, but that's to be expected in what is essentially an underground casino mall. I think we paid about $50: one drink each, one app, one entree. Expensive for chicken, but also to be expected in LV.

I recommend you do this too since the portions are huge and that way you do get your money's worth. Service was impeccable and the hostess, waiters, and busboys were all attentive and friendly! I love great customer service. 

We started off ordering their cocktails. We ordered the blackberry bourbon lemonade, southern peach, and southern revival. Out of the three, my favorite was the southern revival. Nice ginger based soda with lemon but still strong and fresh but they were all very good! 

Chicken & Waffles - Amazing!!!! The Waffles perfectly crisp and fluffy. Chicken was moist and juicy without it being dry. The watermelon was refreshing since it's coated in citrus and mint, a good contrast after you dip the chicken in the most delicious honey hot sauce. I usually don't eat the breast because it tends to be dry but it was so succulent and juicy.

Short Rib - SO TENDER. I usually don't order short ribs whenever it's on the menu at any place because more than likely it's dry. But this short rib was so so so good. So tender and moist. The corn, beans, and mash potatoes that it comes with was so good too! The corn had a nice char on it and paired well with the savory green beans that were cooked in butter. The mash was just right. I really recommend the short rib. You just have to try it!

We got the Peach Cobbler for dessert which was baked to order. Very good. Warm and comforting with just the right amount of sweetness to it. My favorite part of the whole thing was the marzipan cookie bowl that the ice cream came in. It was a thick, crispy but chewy cookie with this sweetness to it that's to die for.

The Fried Chicken was so delicious, juicy & seasoned perfectly so you don't even need any sauces or gravy. The skin was crisp & of course the best part! The Watermelon is spiced & was a great addition to the dish. The Waffles were great especially because they Vermont Sharp Cheddar Cheese, my only complaint would be was that it was a little cold. The portion was huge for me & it is $36, but COMPLETELY worth it!

I also had the Caramel Coffee Creme Brulee & the Peanut Butter Ice Cream Pie. The Caramel Coffee Creme Brulee was great, it wasn't too sweet & the flavors meshed well as expected. The Peanut Butter Ice Cream Pie is to DIE FOR!! Our server actually recommended the dessert & I'm so glad I got it because it is literally the BEST dessert I've ever had in my life!

This place looks great. Upon walking up, we were greeted by two lovely hostesses wearing white sundresses, denim jackets, and cute cowboy boots. Already I loved it.  Our party of four was seated at a smallish table surrounded by a comfy, yet stylish, leather couch and chairs. It reminded me of being in someone's living room and I dug it. A very nice server came over, welcomed us and explained their specialty cocktails. We ordered the blackberry lemonade and the ""Porkchop"". Both of these drinks were Bourbon based and both of them were outstanding.  

I tried:
The Deviled Eggs
The Fried Green BLT Sandwich (no bacon)
Smoked Chicken Salad 
Chicken Biscuits 
Salisbury Steak 
Whipped Sweet Potato

Everything was fantastic! The standouts of the meal (for me) were the Fried BLT (minus the B because I don't dig on swine). This sandwich was fantastic though I will admit the pimento cheese had me worried when I read it on the menu. When they sat it down in front of me, I could not get enough of it!  The smoked chicken salad was also terrific. The salad, which pairs the delicious smokey flavor of the chicken with cool avocado, is served over the most delicious corn bread I have ever eaten. The flavors and textures work perfectly and the dish is phenomenal. 

The deviled eggs were delicious, as was the Salisbury steak (covered in super yummy mushrooms). The only miss of the meal was the chicken on the chicken biscuit was a little dry. The biscuit itself was excellent. The whipped sweet potato was also delicious. Almost like having dessert with your entree.

The service here is great, from the host, to the server, to the aforementioned bartender. All top notch.

On to the dinner. Wow. Haven't had a delicious meal like that in a while.  Started with the fried green tomato 'BLT', which was great.  Then we split family-style fried chicken, charred okra, grits, and their home style biscuits. The chicken and their hot sauce go so well together.

We were sat down at a nice square table that was set with a cute blue plate, napkin and silverware. The servers offered water; sparkling, bottled, or tap. We chose tap because we aren't too pickey about our water. I will say it was very nice how quickly they are to refill the water glass. As soon as I put my glass down someone was there to fill it up. The special of the day was biscuits and gravy with a piece of their fried chicken and all topped with an egg. I decided on the special with my egg cooked over medium and also ordered a side of the spiced watermelon, I LOVE watermelon and this is one of the things I was looking forward to the most. Silly, I know. And to drink, I choose the blackberry bourbon lemonade. The biscuits were SO good, they were square, not too thick and had the perfect amount of gravy. The chicken was so moist and delicious and the egg was cooked just perfect. Now, the watermelon, it was stacked up like a pyramid and was dressed with lime juice, mint, and cayenne pepper.

We were seated and I remember the seating being a little cramped, there were people sitting just within arms reach of us to either side. But it wasn't too bad and other spots in the restaurant looked a little more roomy so it just depends where you get seated.

On to the food. We both ordered the Smoked Brisket Sandwich and I'm getting hungry thinking about it right now. It was delicious. Also think I got their lemonade, which was good too.

We were here for 7 nights and tried an array of different cuisine's and strange foods. On our last night we thought we'd give this ""southern"" place a try. I knew going in this it wouldn't be exactly southern food but vegasified and I have a very open mind when it comes to food. Before I get to into the food, the atmosphere was great. I loved the decor very mason jars meets southern hipster but in a positive way. The drinks were very good I had a Yard bird old fashioned. It was advertised as having a bacon infused bourbon, I didn't taste that it just tasted like a very simple but tasty old fashioned. We ordered the Mama's chicken biscuits which should be in small plates\/ appetizers not in a poultry entree. It came with two small chicken biscuits. The flavor was great and the pepper jelly was a great addition however it's on a hard barely edible biscuit and was very hard to eat because of this. We also ordered the Mac and cheese and grits both being relatively average. I've had my fair share of down right amazing mac and cheese and grits these were very tasty but nothing extraordinary. Now for the Salisbury steak, this dish was disgusting my husband said it tasted like canned Chile meat very processed and over seasoned. All I could taste was orange! It tasted like they marinated this meat in orange pin sol and then covered in chile powdered. I ate one bite my husband two. Dessert options weren't very interesting and the one that was actually southern, bread pudding was like someone trying to be southern by just adding a bunch of crap into a dish and being like bam this is a great southern dish. Sadly though adding popcorn and m&ms to chocolate bread pudding with very hard old tasting ice cream on top doesn't cut it. Besides the steak nothing was down right terrible but it wasn't amazing either.

Look I don't mind spending money on something delicious but watery peach cobbler, that's a NO NO.

Either way, we got seated in their private room behind the wine case and had a very pleasant experience. We don't remember the server's name, but to the wonderful lady who served us on July 9, 2016, you are awesome!

We started off the meal with coffees and Maple-Glazed Bacon Donuts. A complementary combo. I also got myself a mimosa, which had more champagne than juice, but it was sweeter, so it worked.

The Fried Green Tomato BLT is open-faced and unique. The flavor is subtle, fresh, and savory. We also got the special, which was Biscuits & Gravy with fried chicken, bacon, and egg on top. While the biscuits & gravy aren't anything to write home about, the fried chicken is juicy and the over-easy egg perfectly runny. The whole combination is filling and comforting.

We also got the Iceberg Wedge because it seemed refreshing. Although the iceberg lettuce itself is nice and cool, everything else is fairly heavy. It didn't matter though, as I still polished off the plate after it made its rounds. The house-made buttermilk ranch should be a guilty pleasure.

I'll start by saying that the fried chicken was solid 7\/10.  However, for a $55 whole fried chicken to be worth it, it better be the best.  Also, don't be fooled by the ""serves 2-4"" note, that is for just a half chicken.

Otherwise, the food is mostly ok, expensive, and not cooked particularly well.  The frog legs we ordered came out rubbery and food generally came out cold and a little soggy. They mentioned that dishes come out whenever they are ready, but  seemed like they must have sat for a while before reaching our table.  They make no effort for sides to at least come out with main plates. 

I found it funny that every time the servers put anything down it wasn't just ""here is your chicken.""  They also had to mumble byline (i.e. brined for 24hrs), so you know it's ""special.""

I know they are going for upscale southern soul food, but if Yardbird is going to charge those kind of prices, I would expect their kitchen to get it together.  They could probably reduce their extensive menu until they can get the basics correct.  Frankly, it is nothing special and you should wait go to a Bojangles instead if you need a fried chicken fix.

Would I go back? Absolutely!

I love southern food and living in SF it's hard to find, maybe because it doesn't have kale. (Yardbird does have a Kale salad!) So on our way back from Zion we decided to stop at Yardbird in Las Vegas. It is located in the first floor of Venetian. 
Their logo and website is ""Run Chicken Run"", which I found amusing, although my friend thought it was cruel, she doesn't like to be reminded her food is resulting in death of living. The decor is contemporary and a bit dark. The service is courteous and professional.
For starters we got Fried Green Tomato BLT, Grits and Mama's Classic Buttermilk Biscuits. We were served the Mama's Classic Buttermilk Biscuits first with Honey Butter. The biscuits were warm, firm on the outside but soft on the inside, they went perfectly with the delicious soft butter. I would recommend to eat them as soon as they come to the table. Next we got Fried Green Tomato BLT, do NOT pass on these! I've only been introduced to Green Tomatoes a few years ago, and as a person who does not like tomatoes, I was surprised to find how much I like Green Tomatoes. It comes with house smoked pork belly, smoky tomato jam,
frisée, pimento cheese, pickled lemon vinaigrette. All in just perfect amount to go with the perfectly fried green tomatoes. Grits were creamy and thicker in consistency than the ones I have had before, needless to say, yummier! 
For the main course we had Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken and St Louis Style Pork Ribs. Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken is what they are popular for, and it is all worth the hype. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside with flavors going all the way deep in the chicken! St Louis Style Pork Ribs had the perfect amount of sauce and the meat was succulent. For dessert we wanted to get the Peach Cobbler but it took 25 minutes to make and they didn't ask us in time. We were too sleepy to wait. We ended up getting Salted Caramel Bread
Pudding. It was delicious, a little on the sweeter side and I wish they would substitute the cream with ice cream. 
Overall it was one of the best southern meals I've had. There is a lot on their menu I would like to come back for. I think it is going to be a staple for my visits to vegas.",1,0,0

We skipped the appetizers, but the BLT and the biscuits looked delicious.  I ended up ordering the chicken and waffles at my servers recommendation, and my husband went with the ribs.

We really wanted to try the peach cobbler but we were stuffed, so went back for brunch two days later. I got their biscuits and gravy. It was good but so much food! I'm not OCD about my food touching but I would've liked the eggs and bacon on the side instead of on top of the biscuits, so maybe keep that in mind if having your food touching bothers you. My boyfriend got the brisket sandwich and enjoyed it. To finish our meal of course we got the peach cobbler and ate it all! I'm from Texas but had never had peach cobbler.

I went for restaurant week so luckily I got to enjoy many of the best dishes for a modest price.  We went with 2 separate restaurant week orders which included deviled eggs, the BLT appetizer, the fried chicken plate, and the brisket sandwich.  We also added some very good crispy brussel sprouts, though they were a little salty, sticking to the Southern theme.  The deviled eggs came with some roe on top which as very unique, giving it a nice uniqueness than our typical deviled egg.  The BLT appetizer was actually quite good.  I didn't know what to expect but it was a thick, flavorful piece of pork belly on top of an apple?-flavored has brown.  Very good appetizer.  The brisket sandwich was good for a lunch but I'd steer towards the chicken at Yardbird.  The blue plate special is their specialty and either that or a chicken and waffle platter would be my recommendations.  Huge meals in total with a side of spicy watermelon and thick biscuit on the side.  The chicken was very tasty but not out-of-this-worldly.  It is one of the best on the strip but don't compare it to some old school grandma fried chicken.  I went for lunch so I wasn't drinking, but the beer list was really good and had a bunch of solid local options.  Overall Yardbird is one of the better lunch destinations on the strip.

I was almost shocked to see consistent five star ratings for this joint - but it sparked my curiosity. Happy I checked this spot out. Food was yummy and came out fast. Menu offerings are fabulous and cohesively southern-yardbird like. 

Went for the fried chicken sandwich. Two big, juicy pieces of chicken with crisp veggies inside fresh baked buns. It was POPPIN!! And huge! Could have split it. The chicken itself was fried well with minimal coating. You could see how juicy the inside was from the first bite. It was smothered in a honey glaze that was both unusual and memorable. The micro green salad was fresh and cut the grease of the fried chicken. Loved the runny house ranch! 

If I wasn't totally stuffed I would have tried their bread pudding. All the food I'd seen on other tables looked smacking. Nice list of signature cocktails and large liquor, wine, and beer selection, too. 

Making reservations was easy; and probably not even completely necessary. Friendly and chill hostess and servers. Dark, relaxed mood lighting and hipster country decor vibe. Can't say enough good things about those bed-like couches! Perfect after getting off a plane!",3,2,5

During my recent visit, there were two waiters serving our area, so we never had to wait long for anything; and Thedious, the manager, was also terrific. Everyone was friendly and attentive, making an already amazing meal even better.

The number of restaurant choices in Las Vegas is overwhelming, and the celebrity chef restaurants, in particular, are heavily promoted. But sometimes you don't need a celebrity chef, you just need a great chef. Give Yardbird a try - you won't regret it.",0,0,0

Talk about southern charm and hospitality. We heard about Yardbird from a friend who lives on Maui. While deciding on a new place to eat, my husband remember chicken and waffles in Vegas. I quickly turned to Yelp to look up chicken & waffles. The Yardbird came up as one of the search results. We knew it was on the Las Vegas strip and in either the Palazzo or the Venetian. Since we were already on the strip watching a show, we figured to get dinner after. I made my reservations online and it was as simple as that. 

When we got out of the show, we realized that I made the reservation a little later than expected. Thankfully, they had an earlier time that I changed via online and we didn't have to wait. While walking to our table, their bar area is very cute and resembles an open concept living room. After being seated at our table, our server was quick to greet us. He gave suggestions and advised of house specialties and gave us a few moments to review the menu. [Word of caution - majority of their specialty cocktails include some type of whiskey.] After a thorough reading of the menu, we both decided on the Chicken & Watermelon & Waffles and also the classic buttermilk biscuits. While waiting for our food to arrive, I noticed the mason jars with flowers as the table centerpiece. Simple and quaint. The light fixture in the main dining room was also decorated with mason jars around the light bulbs. I really find comfort and joy in the simplicity of southern décor. 

Our food and the biscuits made their way to our table. The biscuits were so warm and soft. The whipped butter and homemade blackberry jam enhanced the taste of the biscuit. Each piece of chicken (wing, thigh, breast, and  drum stick) was coated with crispy goodness. When you bite or cut into the chicken, you can see the juices ooze out. Definitely not a dry pieces in the pile. [Word of advice: eat the breast piece first] The waffle was truly amazing especially when you pour the bourbon syrup in each little square and let it get soaked up. The watermelon cubes were an interesting touch to the dish. Each cube is infused with spice. It is an acquired taste. I am not a big fan of watermelon so it wasn't my cup of tea. 

We were beyond expanded after dinner and could not enjoy a taste of dessert but we did have room for coffee and bailey's. Nice way to end out night with a night cap and games. 

I would recommend Yardbird to locals and visitors of Vegas. Especially if you are staying at or near the Venetian!",2,0,0

I had the Blue Plate Special- two pieces of fried chicken with spiced watermelon and a buttermilk biscuit. I had to add a side of southern style cheese grits, as they're hard to come by on the West Coast. The fried chicken was easily the best I've ever had. The skin was crackle-crisp and deep golden brown, with dark meat so tender that the juices ran when I cut into the meat. The spiced watermelon didn't do much for me but the biscuit was soft and flaky (combined with honey butter- to die for). The grits were a bit chilly and thus stiffer than I would have liked but the creamy flavor was amazing. Overall the fried chicken is worth making 100 more trips for.

The watermelon accompanying the waffle was refreshing and then chicken was slow cooked and the hot sauce with it was very balanced between heat and sweet. We also had the dulce de leche strawberry waffle that was light and not short on flavor that wasn't too sweet.

The bright spot in our night was the bar. They have several local brewers on tap which impressed me as a beer drinker. The first beer I had was Never Pass Up A Blonde by Sin City Brewing. A light beer palatable with a ABV of 3.8. Was not filling which I like so I can still enjoy my meal. (which did not happen) We got seated and I ordered a Gunshot by Bad Boy Brewing. That was an Irish stout that was lighter than I expected, and good with the meal. 
Let us talk about the meal. Ugh!!! As an app I got the fried pickle spears. Spicy and salty with a spicy mayo dip. Probably the highlight of the food portion of our meal. BBq Pork belly was okay nothing stand out about it. I ordered the Fried catfish....probably a mistake at a fried chicken joint. The breading was bland and the fish did not have any flavor I had to actually ask for pepper in a restaurant which should be an insult to ask for flavoring. It came with gritts which were more like rice balls with sugar added. So sweat it was as if someone put sugar in the salt shaker in the kitchen. I ordered corn bread but never got it because they ran out. It was only a 7 pm dinner. Josie got the chicken. She thought it was okay but it was also very sweet. Again maybe sugar for salt. The table mostly ordered chicken and gritts. Mac and cheese was ordered but that was not impressive when again mine at home is pretty superb. The staff seemed like they wanted us to hurry and finish the meal. Our waitress kept rushing us to order and finish. We did complain to management about the sweet tasting food and the fact I never got corn bread. They offered us a free desert but we were afraid that might be too salty. I cannot recommend the food here or the service. The Bar is outstanding and beer selection choice.

I may not review many places, but I always use Yelp when looking for places to eat & I couldn't help but make sure to give credit to the great staff for this past Saturday nights incredible dinner. I love the fact that we were able to make reservations on Open Table so that we weren't having to wait for a table. We were lucky enough to be seated right next to the kitchen (away from the sounds of the club) where Chef Stephen Austin took the time to talk to us & tell us about several of the dishes we saw going out. This good humored chef personally made sure that our family had a great southern food experience by sending out some extra side dishes. The collard greens with bacon jam (not an item that we saw on the menu) were the tastiest greens I've ever had. They had a nice little kick of spice. Some of my family had never tried collard greens & couldn't stop eating them.
The deviled eggs were ok. They weren't as creamy as I would have liked. 
Loved the biscuits. They weren't at all dry and tasted great with apple butter & strawberry jam.
The chicken n' watermelon n' waffles was the favorite dish at our table. The chicken was crispy on the outside & extra juicy on the inside. Must be from the 24+ hour brining process that we were told about. My fiancé says that this fried chicken is now his favorite fried chicken place. The side of honey hot sauce gave the chicken that bit of spice that some of us loved. The waffles weren't your ordinary plain waffles. They were sweet with cheddar & even better with the maple bourbon syrup. The spiced grilled watermelon was juicy & added a good balance of flavor to the dish. 
My daughter loved the short ribs. Although the dishes were meant for sharing, we barely got a bite to taste since she scarfed the plate down on her own & practically licked the plate clean. The meat was so tender that it easily came off the bone. It came with what I believe were mashed potatoes, corn & green beans but it disappeared so quickly. Obviously she liked the whole plate. We'll definitely be going back to try the ribs & burgers that we heard were also a must try from a friend.
The flavorful cauliflower mash was so smooth that someone at our table kept asking if we were sure they weren't mashed potatoes. 
The mac n cheese was nice & creamy but could have used a little more spice or seasoning to it. 

Pastry Chef Keris (trained under Chef Alan Wong-a chef my uncle raves about in Hawaii) was also kind enough to tell us about the desserts that she had prepared. Although we ordered a couple of the desserts & joked about having 1 of each, she sent over all four desserts. All were delicious. 
The butterscotch cake with the pecan filling, a side of bourbon ice cream & bacon was delicious. I couldn't get enough of the bourbon ice cream.  My fiancés favorite was the strawberry shortcake. It wasn't at all plain or dry, but I can't quite explain the yummy flavors. 
I loved the deep fried Oreos dessert that had the fried rice crispy exterior. The center of the fried rice crispy had a gooey chocolate flavor that I couldn't even place at first. Almost made me forget it was an Oreo. 
I'd go back & ask for a bowl full of the bourbon ice cream with a side of fried Oreos. :). 
The hummingbird cake was ok. I'm not a fan of carrot cakes to begin with but the apric
Over all, we didn't pay as much as we expected for the great service, delicious food & time spent together eating new foods as a family.",1,1,1

The waffle was just as good with their great bourbon maple syrup and the watermelon was quite yummy with a unique flavor. Mac n cheese was very cheesy and delicious and for the grits my husband thought there were good.

You see, my girls and I do brunch once a month and are always on the lookout for something new and exciting. We showed up at 11am on a Sunday (per the website this is the opening time). It looked like they had been open for some time and we were asked by a rather rude hostess if we had reservations. We don't normally consider making brunch reservations, many places around the valley don't even offer brunch reservations. We advised that we didn't and she let us know that they were ""fully committed"" until 11:45. We asked if we could sit at the empty bar and she advised again that they were ""fully committed."" OK, we had to ask if there was a waiting list and she advised to just come back at 11:45 so we walked away. It then occurred to us that we would probably be turned away again, so we went back in and spoke with a much nicer hostess who took our name and number and advised she would call if they had anything earlier. 

We were finally seated at 11:45, at a table that had been empty for at least 15 minutes. When we were seated we noticed that there were actually a lot of empty tables, I guess it's a little exclusive, meaning you have to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated even if the restaurant is empty. The restaurant itself is absolutely adorable. I loved the rustic Southern decor and the really cool lighting fixtures. The front portion of the restaurant has a porch and parlor like feel with couches and arm chairs. Then it blends into communal tables and finally some general restaurant tables. I personally think the parlor area is a waste of space, nobody wants to eat in arm chairs with tiny tables. They should consider making more tables, since there is such a long wait. 

We were seated at a high top table behind the communal tables and I was surprised how small the table was since most dishes serve 2 - 4 people. We ordered a few items to split between the 3 of us and there was barely room on our table. We started with the Blackberry Bourbon lemonade, which was definitely a heavy pour from the bar, always a good thing. I also enjoyed an $11 mimosa, which apparently they only have on the weekends. 

We did enjoy the food, the mama's chicken biscuits were really tasty, but there was way too much biscuit. I was especially fond of their house made pickles, so perfectly balanced. The mac and cheese had a weird orange color but was super tasty, I could have eaten one myself. The eggs and ham was fine, the ham was tasty and the grits were OK, but nothing special. We also ordered the corn bread but it never made it to our table. Our waitress was less than apologetic, but we decided we would just switch it out for the cinnamon apple hand pies. There were only 2, so we had to do a little math, but we split them up and enjoyed them. I really liked them, although there could have been a bit more apple flavor. 

Overall, the food was pretty good, but not for the price. The menu suggests sharing, but the portions are a little on the small side. The service also wasn't that great, we had a few questions and our server told us she would ask but never came back with answers. I really like the decor and the food, wish they would lower their prices or at least offer a locals discount. It seems that they are catering to the one and done tourist crowd. This definitely won't be on the brunch rotation.",3,1,1

The watermelon, waffle and fried chicken entree was to die for. The chicken was moist and crispy, almost as good as Roscoes. The waffle was amazing - super fluffy and that syrup was the perfect complement. Then you get to the cold watermelon chunks that are seasoned with some type of deliciousness! BOMB.

We came in for brunch, and had a pleasant experience - But, maybe I just can not differentiate REALLY GOOD Southern cuisine and just... good... southern cuisine.  I had some fried chicken, which was good, but I've had better.

The eggs served with said brunch were good, but I had a better product from Bouchon the day before. So, not sure if that's really fair. I also found the gravy to be kind of bland and creamy smooth - Is that the point of white gravy? I prefer sodium bombed (salty. flavorful) gravy, ladened chunks of breakfast sausage. The gravy wasn't awful, but it was not awe inspiring to me.

I quite enjoyed the biscuits that were served, and, again, I'm no connoisseur of biscuits in general, but my dining companion informed me that they were mythical. So, there's that to be said.

We did enjoy some wonderful service, and the decor is pretty rad.

I would return, but I'm just not in any hurry. particularly at the Vegas price point. 3 stars is not meant to be an insult. This time, it probably means I need to get an education in Southern food.",0,0,0

This restaurant was above average in terms of food and service. They take real southern comfort food and present it in an upscale fashion with flavors that truly blew my mind. I had a reservation on a weeknight and was seated within ten minutes of my arrival. Located inside the Venetian hotel, this little gem has romantic and hip vibe as far as the ambiance and the mood.  The items ordered included: 

Deviled eggs: 5\/5 they were out of this world. The fresh dill really enhanced the flavors of the egg and they were topped with fresh trout roe (AKA redneck caviar). The caviar added a nice sweetness to the egg. The combination of these ingredients took this dish to another level. 

Smoked and roasted bone marrow: 5\/5 WOW. I've had a lot of bone marrow in a lot of different places but what the chef creates here is beyond fantastic. One of the best bone marrow dishes I've had the pleasure to enjoy. The dish comes with country bread and onion jam. The onion jam was surprisingly sweet and not super overwhelmIng. 

Skillet cornbread: 4\/5 the seasonings and flavors of this cornbread were on point. I really enjoyed the spiciness of the jalapeño and the smokiness of the cheddar and bacon baked into the nice sweet cornbread. The pieces of corn left whole inside the bread also added a great texture. 

Lewellyn's fine fried chicken: 5\/5 this is not your average fried chicken. They brine the bird to lock in that amazing flavor and juiciness and create an amazing texture before frying. I was told that it takes them over 24 hours to make this fried chicken and it is well worth the calories! It is crispy on the outside, not overwhelmed with breading, and just the perfect amount of crunch. After taking the first bite and digging in my mouth was watering from these explosive flavors. The dish is served with spicy Tabasco honey. So simple yet so perfect.

Deep fried Oreos: 5\/5 perfect texture and creaminess. This simple dish was so delish and perfectly satisfying to my sweet tooth. The Oreos are fried in rice crispy cereal and served with Oreo ice cream and chocolate sauce. Honestly one of the best deserts I have recently had 

House cobbler: 4\/5 amazing presentation and very fresh flavors. The apple cobbler was served with a big scoop of ice cream melting on the warm crumble. The tartness of the apple went very well with the sweetness of the crumble. 

My overall meal was fantastic. I cannot explain how difficult it is to find quality food in this city and I believe that this place embodies that and more. Our waiter Justin was the one who suggested most of our choices and was super charming and timely. He made the experience at the restaurant so much better. Whilst eating the cornbread we bit into a sharp piece and were unsure whether or not it was a corn chip. Justin immediately sent us the general manager who took the pieces back to the kitchen and had them examined along with the bread. The GM, Greg, introduced himself and was extremely hospitable and considerate. He ensured us that the pieces were, in fact, corn chips and sent us desert on the house. Having worked in food safety for many years, I truly appreciated his approach and how he handled the situation. Southern hospitality at its finest. When a restaurant has great food and bad service, it will never reach its highest potential. This restaurant had both great food and great service. Kudos to the chef, the management, and the waiters for a 5\/5 experience. I will be back to try the other items on the menu!",48,32,42

The menu is very southern but so hard to decide from.  We had the maple bacon donuts for an app. Because breakfast needs an appetizer when it's this good!! Presentation was simple and clean.

We discovered Yardbird simply because my friend was craving fried chicken and we saw their poster in Venetian. That's it, just one picture of their amazing fried chicken with waffles led us to their restaurant and officially discovered one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas. Yardbird serves Southern comfort food, from homemade biscuit, fried chicken to shrimps and grits. All your classic Southern cravings can be fulfilled here. The restaurant is modernly designed country farm house. I love the wood tables, industrial lighting, and heavy wood frames around the restaurant. It's a very spacious restaurant, another point that really reminds me of Southern states. 

We started out with drinks. They have an impressive selections of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Definitely, I couldn't resist their Southern sweet tea but had to do half and half to tone down the sweetness. OMG, I loved the sweet tea! It brought me back to Texas hot summers! Perfect amount of sweet, ice, and tea flavor in my mouth. I finished the first glass in like 10 minutes. The waiter\/waitress refilled my glass quickly. I appreciate the service was friendly, attentive, and professional. 

Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad - excellent refreshing salad with fresh high quality butter lettuce, lightly dressed with sesame seed dressing. The smoked pecans was just perfect with the dressing. Grilled mango didn't provide too much of flavor because it was very sweet or very grilled. I think the dish could be better with sweeter mango. Excellent salad, just hit the spot for me.

Mama's biscuit with crispy chicken (2 served) - oh my, oh my, oh my! Their buttermilk biscuit was amazing. You can't resist the flaky, freshly baked, honey butter biscuit. I loved it! It gets better when I got to their crispy fried chicken!!! It was sold after just one bite. The chicken was well seasoned and fried. I love the Southern crispy breading of the chicken along with sweet honey and pepper jelly. Oh yes, it was absolutely perfect. With a touch of their honey hot sauce, this dish was one of the best we had in Vegas! On the side, they served with house-made pickled cucumber and onions. Perfect to balance out the greasy fried chicken and buttery biscuit. I couldn't ask for more. The serving was perfect for 1 person and it's only $14! Excellent deal! 

A friend of mine ordered their Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles, which was another wonder dish. The homemade honey hot sauce was absolutely fantastic with their fried chicken. The waffle and syrup were also great. The watermelon was a beautiful touch to make your taste buds fresh for every bite of chicken.

It had just opened when we were staying at the Venetian, and my mom got some kind of coupon that was difficult to redeem (she was ultimately successful). I'm glad we took that enticement, though--I loved this place, and would be happy to go back next time I'm in this part of Vegas.

The space is great, comfortable and lovely, a melding of Southern charm and trendy Vegas pizzazz. We sat at a big table for brunch, and in nice lounge seating for drinks. The place seemed constantly busy, but not at full capacity. Service was great--helpful, timely, and friendly.

I sampled most of the cocktail menu over the course of this day, and I was pretty impressed with the showing. I had a Bloody Mary to start my brunch, and this was a fiery hot Bloody Mary, slightly thinner than I like but definitely tasty, garnished with a stuffed olive, a pickled green bean, pickled okra, a wedge of lime, and some bacon for good measure. Of the constructed cocktails on the menu, I particularly loved the Southern Revival and The Porkchop. The Southern Revival was a balanced mix of Wild Turkey 81, passion fruit, and basil, with just the right amount of sweetness. The Porkchop was more unusual, made with Duke bourbon, dijon syrup, yuzu juice, and apple cider, served with a dijon thyme cube. This was savory, but not aggressively so, and I loved the way the ice cube yielded more flavor as it melted. I liked a few cocktails that seemed made for sipping on a sunlit porch--the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade made with Buffalo Trace, blackberry puree, lemon, cardamom, and Angostura bitters; the Watermelon Sling, with High West Silver Oat Whiskey, pressed watermelon juice, lemon, and Aperol; and the Southern Peach, with Old Forester 86, Aperol, lemon, thyme, white peach puree, and sweet tea. On the boozier end, I enjoyed the Yardbird Old Fashioned, featuring bacon-infused Buffalo Trace, Angostura bitters, orange bitters, and maple syrup. Probably would've been great with breakfast, actually.

The food was excellent, hearty Southern fare presented with a Vegas chef's edge. Our party of seven ordered a bunch of food to share, and it was a satisfying feast, with fried chicken as its anchor. We ordered one each of Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken and the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles. Lewellyn's was the plainer platter, just half a free range chicken made with a ""27-hour"" recipe, served with a honey hot sauce. The bigger dish came with fried chicken, honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, Cheddar cheese chow chow waffle, and bourbon maple syrup. The chicken was delicious, juicy and flavorful with crispy fried skin, and I loved the accompaniments, the soft, chewy savory waffle and the refreshing watermelon. We supplemented the chicken with a Yardbird Benedict, a butter lettuce and grilled mango salad, and a few sides. (My picky husband also had a plain waffle by himself, which he enjoyed with fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and bourbon maple syrup.) The benedict was fantastic, with soft poached egg and house-cured bacon over a buttermilk biscuit crumble, all loaded with hollandaise. There was a little salad with a zippy pickled vinaigrette on the side. The lettuce and mango salad was our healthy order, but it was no filler--it came with fresh butter lettuce, char-grilled mango, smoked pecans, and a benne seed vinaigrette, all very good. For our sides, we ordered the skillet cornbread, the buttermilk biscuits, and the macaroni and cheese, all of which were very strong. The cornbread was dense and buttery, speckled with poppy seed and goat cheese. The flaky biscuits came with house blackberry jam and maple butter. Even the mac and cheese was pretty special, made with torchio pasta, a mix of five artisanal cheeses, and a crispy herb crust. It was fun making a plate with chicken and bits of salad and sides--it felt like a Vegas Thanksgiving.

My Vegas trips tend to cluster around the Venetian\/Palazzo, and if they continue to do so, I'm sure I'll be back to Yardbird soon. It's now at the top of my list for a casual meal or a fancy cocktail away from the casino floor.",9,6,10

Next was the bone marrow, once again I wanted to pull a Fred flu stone and pick that baby up and suck it clean.. Although known for the fried chicken, it lacked the wow factor. It was seasoned well and moist, but I've had better. Forgot to mention it was my daughters bday so of course we needed dessert! We ordered the peach cobbler to share thinking with all the food we've already had, a few bites of cobbler wouldn't be bad. Well out came the waiter with a behemoth size cobbler!! And the flavor!!

The service was fantastic! Water was always refilled. Staff was pleasant. The decor and ambiance was great. Our waiter, Benjamin, was outgoing. 

My husband ordered the chicken. It was moist and flavorful. I read great things about the deviled eggs, so I decided to give it a try. It was ok. I wouldn't order it again.

I ordered off the restaurant menu: blt green tomato (the pork was to die for!) and shrimp and grits (amazing!).

Ordered off the appetizer menu mostly. Sat at the Bar and was served by the nicest bartender on trip she knew I wanted to try a couple of things but was alone so tough to order whole lot so she said I can put an order in for one of each of these three things that I wanted The Fried Green tomato BLT, Chicken and Biscuit and the pork Terrine. For good measure and push the meal over the top I also added the Smoked and Roasted Bone Marrow. LETS JUST Say Wow The Bone Marrow was the big winner smoked bone marrow Yum Roasted bone marrow is normally great but the smoke flavor just made it crazy served with a little sweet jam it was truly decadent. The BLT was amazing also was served with pork belly instead of a thin slice of bacon like normal. The Chicken and biscuit if I had not tasted the Bone Marrow first would probably have been really good but with competiion like the bone marrow and the BLT it was just out shined. The Pork Terrine almost the same thing it was very good but just was overshadowed by the Bone Marrow. Was kinda funny the couple sitting next to me at the bar came over and asked to take pictures of my food. I got a kick out of that. Now that was just the first day then I came back here on the Saturday to try out their brunch menu. I ordered a Pork Chop Drink which sounded about as strange as it could but tasted really good it had dijon mustard and apple cider in it along with bourbon but somehow worked well together. The bartenders here are exceptional Mixologist when she made the Pork chop it poured out exactly to the top with not even a drop more needed. I ordered the Yardbird Benedict which came in a small iron skillet and had a ton of flavor from the porkbelly they used as bacon for the Benedict, Their hollandaise sauce  was good had that bite like its suppose to and the biscuits are just flaky and good the eggs where just right not to soft. For dessert I had the Hickory smoked chocolate coffee cake which when it came out looked just like a regular loaf cake and I was kinda disappointed till I tasted it then boom wow it was good smoke flavor again surprised me that it worked with a simple loaf cake but it took it to another level they served it with coffee ice cream which I never usually like but matched perfect with the cake which was served warm.

When I was researching where to eat on our Vegas trip, this was the first reservation I made.  We went yesterday.  The food was mostly fantastic.  But the service was SO bad, so unbelievably bad, that I have to write this review.  If I was rating on the food alone, this would be 4 stars.  We went for brunch.  Got seated promptly, waitress immediately came over and told us the special and went over the menu.  Then she left without offering to take a drink order or bring coffee, she just walked away.   Okay.  So we look over the menu, decide on what we want, put down the menu, and wait.  And wait.  And wait.  Look around, half the restaurant is empty, so that's not the issue.  Table next to us (different server) sat down after us, they've already ordered.  We wait.  Table next to us gets drinks.  Finally waitress arrives, takes order.  We wait.  Table next to us gets appetizer.  La la la la.  A while later, busboy bring husband's drink.  Wrong drink.  Sigh.  I try to point this out to a waiter as our waitress is gone.  He tells me ""I'm not your waiter and I didn't deliver the drink, so I can't help you"" and he walks away.  Okay.  Waitress must have been alerted as she shows up several minutes later.  We sort out the drink.  We wait.  Table next to us now has entrees (remember they sat after we did, by at least 10 minutes).  Finally food shows up, appetizer arrives with the entrees...  but at least we have food.  Food is brought by server other than our waitress.  He points out the cute little jars of butter and spiced apple butter with biscuits.  I ask for jam.  He says there is none, they only have the apple butter.  I say, but the menu says biscuits are served with butter and jam.  He says ""Apple butter IS jam.""  And he walks away.  No, apple butter is not jam and that nasty spiced stuff would have ruined these excellent biscuits, so we ate them with only butter, until that ran out.  We would have asked for more if we'd ever seen our waitress.  Sigh.  She finally shows up once, halfway thru meal, and asks if I want a refill on my empty cup of coffee which has been empty for, I don't know, 10 minutes?  15?  Yeah, that would be awesome.  I get one refill, but never get another.  Did I mention the cup of coffee was $5?  And that it was a tiny cup and saucer type cup, the kind that holds about 6 ounces?  Yes, FIVE DOLLARS for a cup of coffee with one grudging refill.  And my complaint isn't the cost - this is Vegas, I'm perfectly happy to pay for the coffee, but I should have been offered refills.  Even if they cost more, fine, just give me to option to have coffee during my whole meal!  The coffee I did have was good.  Like I said at the beginning, the FOOD was good.  I had the kale salad and hubby had the biscuits and gravy special, and we shared the Classic biscuits.  Very tasty.  We cleaned our plates.  Which is good because we then had to look at them for 15+ minutes.  Sitting there, staring at our empty plates and wondering if we should just walk out.  I could see our waitress spending a lot of time a table for 6 by the kitchen.  The rest of the time she was invisible.  Either way, she ignored us.  So did all the bus persons and other waitstaff.  The table next to us?  Long gone.  Sadly, part of what attracted me to this restaurant in the first place was the desserts.  I really wanted to try a couple.  But by the time our waitress finally wandered over and picked up our plates, I was visibly annoyed.  Did she apologize or acknowledge in any way?  Nope.  Did she ask if we wanted dessert?  NOPE.  She picked up our plates and walked away with no mention of dessert, then brought us our check with a pen that literally did not work as it was out of ink, and she left.  Never asked if we liked the food, or how we were, nothing.  I couldn't even flag anyone else down for a working pen, we had to take our check to the front and get a pen to sign the check.  Normally I would attach photos of the food and decor, but I'm showing the reality of our experience.  Which really sucks because with halfway decent service, this would have been a great meal.  I would even go back, if I could be guaranteed better service.  I hope management sees this review and that's why I'm attaching a photo of the check with the server's name and number.",0,0,0

I would eat their chicken and biscuits every day if I could! The biscuits were very dense (in a deliciously good way) and came with a sweet butter and a jam. The chicken was extremely moist and the breading was perfectly seasoned. I would like to come back to try the chicken and waffles.

Unfortunately, not everything lived up to the hype. The fried green tomato BLT appetizer was ok but not spectacular. There was far too much pimento cheese on them and I had to scrape a lot of it off otherwise it was completely over-powered. The bone marrow was amazing but I was really disappointed in the portion. We received one small bone and it didn't have much marrow in it at all. Looking through the pictures on yelp it seems we got the raw deal on the marrow. Everyone else seems to have had portions triple what we got. Major bummer.

There was a short 5 minute wait and my party of 4 was seated. I ordered the biscuits n gravy which had chicken and bacon all stacked between the biscuit and gravy. It was delicious and very flavorful! The portion was quite large also. My friend ordered the shrimp n grits which were good also, the shrimp could've been bigger in my opinion but the flavors were good. My mother ordered the chicken n biscuit, it was good and the chicken was juicy with a nice flavor to it. My husband ordered the brisket sandwich w\/fries and a whiskey sour drink. The sandwich and fries were good! The BBQ sauce was good and the meat was tender, fries were nice and crispy. The whiskey sour drink was delicious...I can't remember the name of it. 

The meal was so good that my husband and I went back again the next day. We tried the dulce de leche waffle w\/out the chocolate drizzle, potato and bacon hash and a side of chicken. My husband ordered the peach drink this time which wasn't half as good as the whiskey sour drink the day before. The waffle had a good flavor but it was soggy and the portion was really small. The potato and bacon hash was good, but I never saw any bacon in it. The chicken was good just like the day before!

Let me preface this by explaining that we were in Vegas for a birthday (we are all in our 30s, and wanted to have some nice dinners out), and because we had a party of SEVEN people (one more than they allow for an Open Table reservation), I was required to email a coordinator, sign a contract, agreed to a minimum per person that will be spent, and then put down a $150 non refundable deposit. For seven people. I get it for 10 or more, but there are MORE than enough tables in that restaurant to accommodate 8 people.

I have also eaten at the Miami Yardbird and had an incredible experience -- from food to service. That was also for a birthday, and we were comped dessert (with candle) and glasses of champagne. That was why we went with the contract\/minimum nonsense for the Vegas location (despite the fact that we seamlessly made a reservation at the much applauded Bazaar Meats for EIGHT people and had on of the most exceptional dining experiences ever).

First of all, we arrived on time (actually, early by 10) minutes for our reservation and they weren't ready for us, but seated us at some sofas at the bar. As we were starving, and our table was nowhere near getting ready, we asked for two appetizers with our drinks, but the waitress told us, no, we should just wait for our table to order food, and basically denied our food order... so now we're still waiting (because the table we were waiting on STILL hadn't left -- by the way, the host said ""there's another table in the back, but I'm going to seat you out here"" without even giving us the choice) and we're beyond hungry. He was nice enough to get us a round of shots, but frankly we would have preferred food.

Finally we get to the table, and the waiter from the start is lackluster. He barely spoke to us, didn't explain the menu (only two of us had dined at Yardbird -- in Miami -- before) and basically left as quickly as he'd arrived to take care of other tables. We finally ordered, and when the food arrived, he'd forgotten to put in my ENTIRE order. Just mine. My whole table ordered food, and only mine was left out. This was the first time I had to speak to the manager, Scott, about the issue. He was understanding and offered to take care of something off our bill (great). I assumed it would be my meal, as that was what was completely ruined and poorly handled. So at this point, I returned to the table.

When my food finally did come -- shrimp and grits -- it was pretty much inedible. Gummy, slimy, not at all appetizing. Another friend got the same thing and we both barely touched it. At NO POINT, did our waiter ever RETURN to the table to ask how the food was. Instead some bus boy came over and TOOK OUR FULL PLATES AWAY without even a question as to WHY we hadn't eaten.

So now we get the bill. Scott had taken off one or two drinks and a SINGLE order of side Mac and Cheese (we'd ordered three total). I was honestly appalled. So at this point, I went to speak with him again, explaining my continued frustration. Not only had we had poor service, but the restitution of the poor service had been badly handled.

This was lackluster -- and I think that's being gracious. The food was disappointing (at least four people in our party barely touched their entrees because they were either overcooked or cold) and the service was absolutely deplorable. Scott was great, in the end, but that was the one redeeming factor.",2,0,0

I liked the fact that I was able to make a reservation on open table. Since this is a busy hotel, I would advise making a reservation. Those that did not had a wait time of at least 45 minutes. Now on to the food. I ordered the chicken and biscuits. I wasn't sure if I would like the pepper jelly so asked for it on the side. A lot of the patrons were getting the chicken and waffles and I was torn between the two but decided to go with the biscuits. I was so glad that I did. While the meal looks small, both myself and my husband could not eat it all!!! We were only able to eat one chicken biscuit and forced half of the second one! Next time we can probably share one order. But omg! The biscuits are made from scratch and are delicious! The chicken was fried just right. Crispy in certain spots. The pepper jelly was a little spicy but added a nice flavor. I will probably continue to get it on the side so that I can control the amount of spice. For my drink I ordered a blueberry non alcoholic drink. The presentation was so cute. It came in a small mason jar and was very good. My husband had a peach tea and it was good as well.

-The food tastes wonderful! I would give the taste and quality of their chicken a 10\/10. What makes a good piece of fried chicken, in my opinion, are the following: skin is crispy enough to enjoy the texture but not too hard that it hurts to bite down, chicken is very moist inside, the chicken\/skin doesn't get soggy on the outside. The Yardbird Fried Chicken has each of these great qualities.

-The atmosphere was very relaxed and chill. I liked the fact that it is open and you can fit relatively close to other tables. It gives an excuse to brag about the good food!

-You get what you expect when you come here. You expect great tasting chicken, so you get the great tasting chicken.

**THE BAD**

-Price is very high in general and especially for a Fried Chicken dinner. Unfortunately $36 for a plate of Fried Chicken, Waffles, and small pieces of Watermelon isn't quite worth it in my opinion. I did know this coming into the restaurant so it was no surprise as I viewed the menu before booking the reservation. Even though I think this was the best Fried Chicken I've had, I don't feel the price reflects the plate I had (Watermelon is incredibly abundant and cheap to buy, good quality chicken can be expensive so this drives the price up, and the ingredients in waffles are very cheap to purchase). $25 sounds much more accurate for what type of food you're getting.

I know my way around fried chicken, and needless to say, I was excited. The ambiance and space inside is awesome, with a light fixture that you can't help but stare at. 

Lewellyn's Fine Fries Chicken - Very, very good. Crispy and so so moist. Great seasoning too. While KFC might tout its original herbs and spices, with this fried chicken you can actually taste those spices. Just a great classic fried chicken with a black pepper kick. Truly fantastic and a must-try. 

Macaroni & Cheese - Served in a skillet with melted cheese and breadcrumbs on top. Looked promising when it hit the table, but turned out to be quite dry, as if it were in the broiler too long and dried out the cheese. Great cheese blend, but should have been a bit more creamy. 

Skillet Cornbread - If there's cornbread on the menu, you best believe I'm ordering it. This was disappointing as well. It was more of a dense cake with sweet cream butter on top than actual cornbread. And since it was served in. Cast iron skillet, I expected a bit more crunch around the edges. It's a shame that it relied on extra butter to be good... The menu states that there's bacon in it, but in reality there's not enough to even taste it.

I also really liked the ambiance. My large group couldn't snag a reservation so we pulled together some chairs around a couch. Cool bar area and lighting fixtures. In all, the food was good enough to warrant the stop, but I wouldn't come here again without either a smaller group or a reservation.",0,0,0

Everyone ordered different things off the menu. Some ordered the chicken and waffles, some other the special (gravy and chicken breast) and I ordered the yardbird eggs benedict. For some reason, every time I come to a breakfast\/brunch kind of place, Eggs Benedict is my go to food. The poached egg was nice and gooey and it also had bacon and hollandaise sauce.

I went in here looking for some good old southern cooking.  Yes the fried chicken was really good but after than it was just crappy.  I ordered the wedge salad as a side, it arrived almost frozen with guacamole mounded on the top.  Then the total WORST dressing.  I tried to get sides like butter beans, mustard greens, and etc but they don't have them.  The server asked how the food was and I told them the chicken was great but the salad was not even close to southern or was worth serving.  Then you get the bill..........a chicken breast and thigh with nothing else was $18.00

My total bill was $40 for 2 pieces of chicken, a crappy wedge and guacamole salad and ice tea!

This restaurant is new, and had amazing reviews so I made our reservations. That evening we were seated near the kitchen so we could watch all the action, the staff was AMAZING, they helped us celebrate in a BIG way. JESSICA was our server, so fun and bubbly and went toe to toe with the craziness we threw at her. They have an extensive craft beer and bourbon selection. They sent us out some appetizers to try. Cheese with watermelon, and fried green tomatoes with bacon on top, unbelievable tasty items that we may not have tried. The manager GREGG, came over said Happy Birthday and talked to us for a while. In the meantime, we were not sure what to try, so we asked Jessica to just surprise us, and boy did she! We tried portions of so many things. For the 6 of us at the table it was great, we sampled over 20 items, My fav was the Fried Chicken, waffles and spiced watermelon. We tried frog legs, deviled eggs with a twist, ribs, shrimp and grits plus many other things, The desserts were over the top!

1. Deviled egg appetizer:  YUM!! Very unique and absolutely delicious.

3. Fried chicken and waffles: just order it and find out for yourself how good this is. Words can't do it justice to describe how good both the chicken and the waffles are.

The reason we came here was actually due to words of mouth. The words on the D.C. street last summer among some foodies was to check out Yardbird when in Vegas, some made sure I remember to come here upon hearing about my trip. 

We got a table last minute and were sat right across from the kitchen (YAY for my obsession of seeing the kitchen action!)

The service was GREAT! Staff was very attentive, from door to table. Even the chef (thank you Chef Stephen Austin). Chef Austin was busy making sure everything was done correctly and smoothly, but he also stopped by to check on us when he got a chance, and explained some dishes, and made additional recommendations of some must try items that we omitted. Of course, we ordered some more food based on his recommendation and we did not regret the decision :)

We ordred a lot, including fried green tomato BLT (chef's recommendation), mac & cheese, warm farmers' cheese and watermelon, roasted cauliflower w\/ capers and pumpkin seeds, green beans, kale salad with cornbread crouton (says what?), iceberg wedge, chicken n watermelon n waffle, fried chicken, and blistered tomato with ricotta and chili oil (which I don't think is on the current menu) and ended with some desserts including red velvet cheesecake and lots of berries. 

LOVED EVERYTHING, but the ones I think are must are the farmers cheese and watermelon, and fried chicken (or any sorts, with or without waffles), and kale salad (that CORNBREAD CROUTON?!). I'm not a huge lover for southern food, but I seriously enjoyed every single bite.

We started with the Deviled Eggs topped with Trout Roe. The eggs were creamy and very flavorful with Chives and Dill. The eggs were very flavorful and delicious!

I also got to try a little of the Black Angus Burnt Ends and Tator Tots. The Burnt Ends were caramelized and were full of flavor, tender and meaty. They were served over blue cheese fondue and were topped with pickled peppers that were sweet and spicy. The flavors going on in this dish were incredible. This dish had all kinds of things going on.

I had to try the Signature Dish...The Chicken ""N"" Waffles ""N"" Watermelon. The chicken is quality chicken that's marinated for about 27 hours. This was the best chicken and waffles I ever tried anywhere. The Chicken was so juicy and so flavorful. The honey hot sauce was an added bonus to the chicken. The Cheddar waffles were also so good but went into hyper-yumminess  with the bourbon maple sauce. So good! Watermelon was slightly seasoned and was very refreshing and seemed to lighten up a heavy meal. I do note the Chicken and waffles is a very large plate and could only eat half. They gave me a very large 1\/2 chicken that was excellent.

My husband had to try the Peppered Gnocchi Pot Pie. I have to say the gnocchi in the pot pie were excellent with the correct texture. They also were delicious with lots of mushrooms and a sage gravy kind of sauce. The dish was topped with a yummy biscuit.

These were my exact words when we walked through the hotel on the first day of our trip seeing the Yardbird sign. This is by far one of my favorite restaurants. I live in Florida and Miami being one of my old residence and haunts I've been in love with Yardbird ever since I stepped foot through the doors. 

On this trip I told my boyfriend this was a must do on the list for our mini vacay so one night we rounded up the group and had dinner. I knew going in this location would not have my favorite Miami beer but was still sad to not see it on the list. I was very happy however to see the mac and cheese and Mama's biscuits. That stuff really is what heaven tastes like. There is not one item on the menu that I have had and not enjoyed.

Although Miami is much closer to me I will make a concerted effort to visit this location again on any future trip to Vegas. Yay Yardbird!",1,1,1

We had made a reservation in advance and were seated at one of the primo tables right next to the line, where you can see all the action and food coming out of the kitchen. Our table shared a couple of appetizers--the buttermilk biscuits were good, but the fried green tomato BLT was ridiculously good. Among our entrees, I had the fried chicken and a couple of sides. The sides were fine, but the chicken was juicey and not too greasy or overdone. The cocktails were also on point. I'm not a bourbon drinker but really enjoyed a concoction with passionfruit and basil. 

Yardbird really lived up to their southern hospitality style because their service was beyond any restaurants we had experienced in Las Vegas. When my pescatarian friend wasn't a fan of the gnocchi pot pie, the manager went out of her way to have the kitchen make her an off the menu fish dish. When they found out our group was celebrating a bachelorette party, they brought out  champagne for all of us and a slice of red velvet cheesecake--on the house.

The server (Mikayla) greeted me within a minute if sitting down and took my drink order. Definitely try the blackberry lemonade - so good - especially with the whiskey :).

I ordered the half fried chicken (I mean why would you get anything else when this place is known for it...it's called Yard Bird for a reason). I also asked for recommendations on sides and the server recommended the Brussels Sprouts - heck yeah I love Brussels Sprouts. I saw a biscuit appetizer on the menu but it had 4 biscuits. I politely asked if I could get a single biscuit since I was rocking solo and the server said no problem. I saw good review on the buttermilk ranch that comes with the fries so ordered that to try with the Brussels Sprouts. 

Wow the food came out fast, it was like they were just waiting to drop my order. No joke, it was out within 7 minutes when generally that's faster than most app standards and half as long as most entree times. Chicken? Check. Biscuit? Check. Brussels sprouts? Check.

 The chicken was piping hot and the person who served it to me described the dish as brined for 27 hours. I liked that touch. The skin wasn't as crispy as I had expected but it was flavorful and crisp. The meat just fell off the bone. Usually I struggle to try and get to all the meat when I eat bone-in chicken, but not tonight. There was not a single piece of meat left on those bones. Nothing is safe from this savage when he's hungry.

The Brussels Sprouts were cooked perfectly too. Nice crisp to them and fully cooked and tender. The spiced honey that they were drizzled in was a nice kick up a notch than what I'm used too. I gotta say, even though I bucked the system and ate against the grain of the Chef's intention, the ranch went well with the Sprouts. The biscuit was buttery and crispy just like I like em. It was a decent size, not overly large but not too small. Think smaller than a hockey puck. The butter and jam that were served with the biscuit was phenomenal too. I prefer butters at room temperature and spreadable - this was. The jam was tasty and homemade - you can def taste the heart and love in this food.

Teamwork among he staff was observed throughout my meal. When servers were busy at other tables, bussers greeted and took water orders (tap or bottles). The manager made an appearance at my table and asked how things were. Awesome. Timing for drinks and food orders\/receipt and check backs were within expected and preferred times. The busser was prompt in clearing my dishes and came around as I was putting the last bone on my plate.

I finished with an imperial stout and a carrot cake which was served in a little edible pot. The check was delivered before my last dessert bite and the check was returned with my credit card within a minute. Super service from Mikayla all night. 

Awesome night. Awesome food. Awesome staff. Will be back next time I'm in Vegas.",0,0,0

Skillet Cornbread 
- packed with cheddar cheese, bacon, and jalapeño, the fragrant delicate bread just crumbles in your mouth in the best way possible.  top that with the maple butter and it was an amazing appetizer!

Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad
- sweet grilled mangoes and smoked pecans on a small bed of greens...hmmm it was defintely tasty, but i would recommend saving more space for the hearty stuff on the menu, plus the portion size for this was quite meager in my opinion

Smoked Brisket Biscuit 
- pickled onions, cucumber, tomato jam,  bbq sauce with the MOST TENDER BRISKET EVER!  i would've thought the the brisket would be tougher than the biscuit, but when you bite down on it, the brisket falls clean off along with the biscuit!  AMAZING!!  truly a must-try

Chicken  and Watermelon  Waffles
-  cheddar cheese waffle was perfectly fluffy and was on par with the corn bread
- chicken was PERFECTLY juicy inside with a slight crisp and good flavor on the outside, but what pulled this whole dish together was the bourbon maple syrup!  OMG the bitter\/sweet goes so well with this dish - another MUST try dish

What an awesome happening. First of all, this review is LONG overdue. Our bartender was amazing, friendly, and used to own a restaurant in San Jose. I apologize for forgetting your name, because you made our experience phenomenal. 

First of all, they have Roderer champagne as their ""well"" or basic champagne. Score. It's my favorite. 

Second, their chicken is incredible. I was asked how it compares to Thomas Keller's. That's a tough comparison, but Yardbird is certainly up there. We returned for brunch and were thoroughly impressed with the chicken and waffles, the cocktails, and the service.

In a sea of high priced food, Yardbird stands out as a place that's worth your dollar.

The fried tomato appetizer was the best, but the other two plates were very good as well. As Yardbird serves southern food, the portions are larger than you'd expect at a nicer place like this.

We started off with the Fried Green Tomato BLT and the BBQ Pork Belly.  Well, we both agreed that the pork belly in both dishes was tough and flavorless.  It wasn't even chewy or crispy.  It may have been baked yesterday and reheated.  It was like leather.  No bueno.

Next we had the Shrimp N' Grits and the Fried Catfish (also came with Grits).  The shrimp was pretty good.  The catfish, oh boy.  They give you 3 huge pieces, but don't be deceived.  There was so much crunchy coating on the catfish it was ridiculous.  I wound up peeling it all off just to get the flavor of the fish.  That was a mistake.  Whatever they used as the seasoning\/marinade was so sour, but not unbearable.  Needless to say, I ate the fish and left the coating to the side.  Now for the grits.  The texture was perfect, but it had no flavor and needed salt.

We didn't even bother with dessert since I was so disappointed.

Look, I would go back and try it again since the reviews are so good.  It could have been an off night for the chef (which happens).

Our server was so friendly and attentive.  We weren't lacking for anything thing and I always appreciate that.  The atmosphere is great too.  We were very comfortable and weren't rushed out.

Overall, it was a nice experience even though the food I chose could have been better.  But again, could just have been my choices were poor.

Brunch. '77 Elvis pancakes, Today's omelette (brisket), Mac and Cheese, Cornbread. Everything was great. The pancakes were sweet as hell, the mac and cheese was cheesy and sexy and tasty, the cornbread was the highlight without a doubt. The omelette was good but definitely not share able.

At first I asked about the Butterscotch cake and our server recommended it also informing it was a large serving. I was afraid they would give us a whole cake and changed my mind.

Wow! Felt like I walked into a completely different restaurant. First got the manager, Steve and assistant manager, Scott  who set me up and confirmed with my reservation. Greeted with nice hostess in the front who took us to our table, even though we were a bit late from the time we had reserved. The assistant manager, Sarah, came to greet us shortly after. 

Here's my take on our meal that we left into the hands of our expert waiter, Jerry-

The Welcome: 
-Biscuits came warm with the honey butter and jam that gave you the warm welcome to your belly.  

Drinks: 
-Southern Revival- the balance between the citrus and the mint was very refreshing and good counterpart to all the food to com. 
-Old Fashion- probably one of the best I've had. The maple syrup and bacon.. Mmm. Wow, the flavors.. just smell it. And I'm not even a bacon person! I appreciate the solid sphere ice cube that kept the drink cold through out my dinner for me to enjoy. 

Next up: 
-Fried Green Tomato BLT- crispy, full of flavor, fun dish
-Cheese and Watermelon- refreshing, interesting combo
- Mac- cheese lovers, get this! Explosion of the different cheese, galore! Don't forget to add their hot sauce to this! 
-Salad- made my ""i don't eat vegetables"" bf a vegetarian for a second there. 

Main:
-Short rib- omg the sauce. Yum. The carrot with the pepper on top balanced the heaviness but delicious meat and mash potato. 
-Chicken- good to share portion dipped with their hot sauce, not bad! 

Dessert: 
I was so stuffed but the food kept coming. Couldn't fully enjoy cuz I left no room but I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. 


Every staff there were just as brilliant, clearing our table, switching to a new set for our next dish, filling our drinks and etc. Sarah came by a few times to make sure we were taken cared of. I just love her positive and bubbly personality. 

Jerry was amazing. He knows the menu and he knows our bellies. Take his recommendations and you can't go wrong. I over heard other servers conversations with their guests and they seem just as attentive, knowledgeable, and honest about which dish to go for and stay away from as the next. 

I'm excited for the one in LA to open up but boy do they have a tough act to beat with the three super S team- Steve, Scott and Sarah along with the wonderful Jerry!",2,0,0

I got to taste the shrimp and grits, eggs benedict, fried chicken, and the biscuits with gravy. Everything was DELICIOUS. I loved the spin that they put on every dish, and although Im not a fan of typical American style brunch food (so boring and generic), Yardbird was unique and delicious. The food here is very heavy though, so just be ready for that. 

The shrimp and grits gave 6 big shrimps, and the grits were the least gritty that I have every had. They were very smooth and creamy... I struggled to eat more than half the portion.

The eggs benedict were also special, because the poached eggs were over their biscuits... AND they gave a piece of fried chicken with it. 

The special of the day - fried chicken over a biscuit with gravy and an egg on top - all of my friends who ordered this devoured it in silence in about 5 minutes. It was just THAT good. The small piece of chicken I got to taste was very juicy and just melted.

If you know me, that's a big statement. If you don't, I'm a rather large dude from Texas who was raised on the stuff so I do have a frame of reference. It's one of the most basic of dishes (no sides or accoutrements- just fried chicken) and it is done so perfectly you may not want anything else. However, I usually do when I'm there (big dude, remember?). While I like to find off strip gems when in Vegas, this spot is now on my regular rotation.

WHEN YOU GO- Located in the resto row between the Venetian and Palazzo, Yardbird is unpretentious and at the same time classy. Service has always been good and they understand that the food is the real star here. If you're a little tentative, let your server recommend  add ons and apps.

The chef Reggie's food preparation is over the top, and we come from an area known for culinary excellence. The fried chicken, the ribs and the brisket were were to die for!! The Cauliflower Yukon Potatoes and the green beans with Yogurt and Almond Slivers were scrumptious. The Chef's supporting staff (we sat next to the kitchen) were quick, and efficient.

I ordered the chicken and waffles. There are a plethora of things on this plate. It comes with large square watermelon cubes covered with dried basil. The basil was a subtle and nice surprise.

Shirley temple - strange taste. The server said it was a in-house grenadine that makes the taste different. Thumbs down.

Chocolate Nutella cake - YES!!!!! So good. Not too rich, moist, and just plain scrumptious.

Corn bread - not amazing, but probably one of the better corn breads I've tasted.

Chicken and waffles - had a taste. As good as chicken and waffles can be. 

Blackberry bourbon lemonade - had a sip. Pretty good... refreshing. I could DEFINITELY taste the alcohol.

The place is bigger than you think.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the different  bourbon drinks being made.  I absolutely loved that the drinks were served in a mason jar.  Even the ice wasn't standard cubes but were oversized cubes or a sphere depending on your drink choice.  I had the blackberry bourbon lemonade and the southern peach.  Both drinks were wonderful and while having a lot of flavors, the bourbon was able to be showcased.  

They have a large beer menu as well.

The deviled eggs were delicious and not just your standard devil egg.  They were full of flavor and very elaborate in there presentation.

For the main course we got the fried chicken and the mamas chicken biscuits.  The chicken is SO good.  Fried just enough for flavor but so tender!  The chicken biscuits were amazing!

Although the we had tried so much stuff, we couldn't help but get dessert to go.  Chocolate bread pudding and butterscotch cake.  Both had unique flavors and were great.

I discovered this place because of yelp. But I also happen to have an affinity for fried chicken. This was also my birthday so the pressure to find a good dinner spot was on. 

I made a reservation thru yelp. And the rest was a smoothly orchestrated experience. The hostess sat us immediately (on a Sunday night). I was directed by staff to easily located the restroom so I could wash up. And everyone greeted me with a smile. Brandon was my server and he was totally personable. He talked to my table as if we were his long time friends and make great recommendations. 

Update *** As I'm writing this review, the manager on duty visits my table to ask how my experience was and I was raving!! He was so great too. He ordered me a round of drinks for my birthday on the house. Thank You!

So in a nutshell, this is what's amazing about this place. Tasty food + stylish interior + professional staff = a top notch dining experience. I perceive that everyone enjoys working there. They're so great at what they do and they do it with ease. The wait staff communicates very well. All the little things add up and make for an unforgettable experience. 

Now the food: 
I ordered roasted bone marrow and deviled eggs for appetizers. Soooooooo delicious. 
For dinner, I ordered fried chicken, waffles and watermelon. That receives a 10\/10 from me. And again, I eat a lot of fried chicken. This measures up and probably sets the bar! For drinks, I had a peach iced tea and the bourbon lemonade. 

Another compliment I can give is that when you're in here, you almost forget you're in a casino\/hotel IN A GOOD WAY. There is so much charm in this restaurant. I would say it's fine dining without being snobby or overly posh. The interior is stylish. Feels like it was designed by HGTV's Chip and Joanna Gaines lol. 

Thank You again everyone. I will be back with friends on my next visit. I will only write yelp reviews when the service is exceptional or poor. In this case, it was overly exceptional.",0,0,0

Ambiance was stellar. Country meets hipster meets fine dining. We were greeted by Justin who was phenomenal!  He earned 5\/5 on his own!  He believes in the menu, as he should, there was lots of great dishes to try and he was spot on with all of them!

For drinks we tried the blackberry lemonade, very sweet, and an old fashion, bacon infused bourbon, sign me up! Later in the meal we had a flight of IPAs. All local and great!  One of the perks of this place was they only offer local beers on draft. 

Being it was restaurant week, we got a little more bang for our buck. We started out with the deviled egg... Awesome, and the fried green tomato blt... Also Awesome!  The pork belly on the blt was cooked perfectly!

Next came the bone marrow with onion jam. Hello, can I bottle that stuff? It was delicious!  The bone marrow was like butter on the toast and the onion jam gave it the perfect amount of sweetness. 

Next course were our entrees. Here we go, my fried chicken! Wasn't wowed at all. It was just fried chicken. The chicken was very juicy and cooked well, but for me, batter is end all and sadly I wasn't impressed. Being it was restaurant week, the chicken came alongside ribs which fell off the bone and the heartiest, cheesiest Mac n cheese ever!  I felt it stick to my ribs just as it should! 

Now, with this dish, we got the shrimp and grits. WOW!!!!  This meal was no joke!  Perfect amount of sweet and salt and every bite just melted in our mouths!  I would totally go back for that!

We finished with their mud pie, only because it was part of the price fixed menu. I would have preferred the fried Oreos. Next time (because there WILL be a next time) for sure!

Overall, we had a great experience here. I suggest this place to anyone. A perfect spot for a guys night, though I know a bunch of girls who can sling back their bourbon and eat some finger lickin' comfort food! I'm sure after another visit I could kick this rating to a solid 5 stars!",0,0,0

My husband and I split the chicken biscuits with pepper jelly and each order a mac-n-cheese crock. The biscuits were underwhelming. If you're from the south and you have had a Bojangles Cajun Filet Biscuit, that is better than these biscuits.  The fry on the chicken is light, which is nice but it's no seasoned very well. BUT- the mac-n-cheese!!!  So delish!  It's rich, gooey and worth the trip alone.  I highly recommend. 

The portions are a good size. Many people were eating their signature dish of chicken and waffles and watermelon but that does not appeal as so many places have this these days. Plus it's comes with 4 pieces of fried chicken which is way too much. 

It's worth a stop in- I recommend for lunch rather than dinner.",0,0,0

Chicken was dry and tough (it was dark meat, it's unusual to get dry dark meat), biscuits were ok, macaroni and cheese was also dry and not good. Brisket was very tasty, I'd recommend it. Having traveled in the South and grown up eating Southern food staples, many of which were on the menu here, we just were not impressed.

No matter what I say, it won't be enough about this place.  My wife and I were in Vegas for our 15th wedding anniversary, and we were staying at the Venetian.  We had already had at least two unfavorable experiences at ""celebrity chef"" restaurants at the Venetian by the time we made it to Yardbird, and ended up finding a new ""must go"" place on future trips.

From the phone conversation for the reservation to departing the restaurant, the service was extremely friendly.  Our second visit we did not have a reservation, but it was early enough that we were able to get in quickly.

The dishes are huge, and the recommendation was that we order items and share them.

First visit  
Server: Courtney, and she was a great server!  Very friendly, made great recommendations, and we had constant refills. 
Food:   (it was ALL good)
- Bourbon Blackberry Lemonade
- Shrimp & Grits
- Charred Okra
- Skillet Cornbread
- Mama's Chicken Biscuits

For dessert, we got the Bacon Butterscotch Cake, and this is a must-try!  We had not even told Courtney that it was our anniversary, but she brought it out on a plate that the kitchen had personalized for our anniversary, so the hostess must have told her.  It was a great surprise!

Second Visit
Server:  Jonathan
Food:
- Chicken, watermelon, and waffles 
- Whipped Sweet Potatoes
- Mac & Cheese - so awesome.

On this visit I saw the restaurant manager (Greg-- great customer service person!) coming by, and I stopped him to tell him how much we really enjoyed both visits.  He thanked us for having such kind things to say, and then before we even got around to ordering dessert he personally brought us the Deep Fried Oreos (again, another personalized decorated plate) and a Bourbon milkshake that was so good it's beyond words, and both free of charge.

I had heard great things and as a huge fan of chicken and waffles i had to try it. The ambience of Yardbird is great, they have a good bar, tables, and a lounge with couches and small tables. We settled on the lounge, which was very comfortable. We started off exploring the massive drink menu. They have a long list of their own signature cocktails. I tried the southern revival, which was served in a Mason jar as a cool touch. It was good, though a bit sweeter than i thought it would be. After that i went to the craft beer menu, which is ever changing and always full of great choices, including some seasonal varieties. I didn't get a chance to get to their fantastic whiskey and bourbon menu, but wow there is a lot there. For an appetizer we tried the deviled eggs because they are one of my favorite things to try at restaurants that serve them. Unfortunately these were the one disappointing part of the meal. I've had much better. For the entrees my wife tried the chicken salad sandwich. It was different than most I've had but full of flavor and very smokey. Not too strong on the mayo which is a plus to both of us. I of course had to get the famous chicken and waffles. They were different than i expected but in the most positive way. They were very classic and traditional, most restaurants like to put their own spin on them. I had expected to receive several pieces of boneless fried filets, but they just pile several pieces of their amazing fried chicken on the plate instead! If you don't want the waffles and watermelon, go for the fried chicken on its own. It is some of the best I've ever had.

The food they had on the show looked really awesome and when I found out that they had a Yardbird in Vegas at The Venetian, it was a no-brainer for me to visit!

Yardbird is located at the space that was formally Pinot Brasserie.  I love how it's the next door neighbor to another favorite restaurant of mine, DB Brasserie.  It's funny because you have these two restaurants that are almost complete opposites of each other with one being a Southern joint and their other being a fancy French place.  But it's always a good thing to have variety!

I made a reservation the night before and it was actually pretty easy for me since I was dining solo.  When I came in they immediately took me to my table.  The place is dimly lit but it was a very lively atmosphere.  The lounge area is pretty nice too.

I decided on having the first cocktail that was on the top of the menu since more than likely it's their signature drink which was their Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade.

Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1NcaGms
Made with Buffalo Trace bourbon, blackberry puree, fresh lemon, cardamom & Angostura Bitters
This went well with my meal.  They definitely gave me a good amount of bourbon because I barely tasted the lemonade.

Now onto the food.  I basically ordered everything that I saw Questlove and Anthony Bourdain had on the show:  The Fried Green Tomato BLT, the Deviled Eggs, and the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles.  Yeah, for a solo diner, it was a lot of food!

Fried Green Tomato BLT -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1d7jWLD
Pork belly, greens, tomato jam, house-made pimento cheese
I like how my waitress gave me an option to order just one of these.  I really wanted to try this but I knew I wouldn't have room for it since I had ordered their Deviled Eggs, so having a single portion was a great idea.  And it was really good!!   It almost reminded me of the Bacon Wrapped Bacon from Rx Boiler Room.  The fried green tomato was lightly fried and the pork belly was braised perfectly.  

By the way before I continue, I just want to point out that my waitress was awesome!  She always checked up on me, offered cool recommendations,  and also made sure that I wasn't bombarded with food so she had each course come out in a timely manner.

Deviled Eggs -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1TD2Xm0
Fresh chive, smoked trout roe 'redneck caviar'
OMGFYUM!  Who would've thought that roe would make a great topping to deviled eggs?  These deviled eggs were magical!  The egg filling was silky smooth and it had a nice explosive salty element with the roe.  I probably could've ordered this twice but I still had a huge chicken and waffle platter coming up.

Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1GpqGfn
Yardbird's signature 'old school fried chicken', honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, cheddar cheese chow chow waffle, bourbon maple syrup
This was my main event which I was thought was a little overwhelming with me eating this all by myself.  In a way, it was almost like another food challenge for me.  This is definitely meant to be shared.  You can pretty much break this down into three meals.  The chicken was solid though.  Very crispy on the outside and juicy inside and it went well with the honey hot sauce.    The Cheddar Chow Chow Waffle was tasty as well, but the bourbon maple syrup didn't work for me so I just ate them plain.  And finally the spiced watermelon was refreshing despite having a little kick.  It made for a great dessert.  .As much as everything was tasting good, I really hit the wall with the waffles and watermelon pieces.  I probably could've finished the whole thing though if I didn't have those appetizers beforehand, especially the Deviled Eggs which really filled me up.

How does Yardbird rank with favorite Fried Chicken in Vegas?  It's well up there, but I still prefer the Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken at Brooklyn Bowl.  But not to take anything away from Yardbird, their Fried Chicken is still worth mentioning to my friends if they're looking for other high end Fried Chicken options on The Strip.

So as you've just read, there definitely was no doubt that I left Yardbird with an overstuffed and satisfied belly.  Sure it's pricey but the quality of their food and service justified it.  I would love to come back again for brunch and also to try their other specialties for lunch and dinner or just for another round of their Fried Chicken.  I'll be looking forward to my next visit!",21,13,21

We ordered the Chicken 'N Waffles 'N Watermelon to share.  The portions were generous, but I didn't think that the fried chicken was rave-worthy.  In fact, I thought it was rather ordinary.  I actually think that the fried chicken at the Palms cafe is much tastier.  And I really didn't appreciate the spiced watermelon.  Fresh watermelon tastes good unadulterated; I thought that the spices detracted from fresh fruit.

We also got the ""today's omelet,"" which was a vegetarian one with asparagus and cheese.  Compared to the other dishes, this one appeared chintzy in size.  It also wasn't visually appealing.  It looked like something you would get on an airplane.  It also tasted like something you would get on an airplane.

The butter lettuce grilled mango salad was pretty good.  Very good portion size and tasty.  We also ordered the cornbread and mac n' cheese.  Those two sides were very delicious!

All in all, Yardbird is good food if you aren't too picky and just need to fill up on something.  I thought that the service was slightly on the pretentious side.  Our coffees were never refilled.

This modern rustic restaurant is located in the back section of the Venetian Resort on the north end of the strip. They are fairly popular so you may need reservations or a long wait during peak periods.

This is modern Southern cooking with fried foods and sweet drinks. The star is the fried chicken which is pampered and prepared beautifully to enjoy. The brining makes it juicy and tender with a great crust and flavor. The combination of fried chicken and watermelon is a bit of a stereotype, but it is hard to argue with the flavor especially combined with a decent, but somewhat underwhelming waffle. Try the chicken with different sides.

I had to order one of their specialty drinks, because Vegas sober is like fishing sober. I had a mason jar with whiskey and peach which was sweet and refreshing like a good Southern night. It is hard to drink too much with sweet drinks, so it helps temper the booze into a slow rush. They have a great selection of cocktails and would make a great place for just drinks and shared side dishes to start your Vegas night.

Yardbird is a nice option for the area and a good fit in the Venetian, which is already home to lots of great restaurants. It is rather pricy for the style of food, but you cannot compare it to your favorite chicken shack at home - both lose with that comparison. Drink booze and eat chicken y'all!",13,6,10

Our waiter, terrible I can't remember his name, was fantastic. Knowledgeable of the menu, friendly, and efficient. He pressed us a little too hard to get a second appetizer, but we prevailed!

What we ordered:

Smoked and Roasted Bone Marrow - Meaty gelatinous goodness best describes this dish. Served with onion jam that paired perfectly with it and toasted country bread. 

Chicken n' Watermelon n' Waffles - Best fried chicken I have ever had. They pride themselves on brining the chicken for 27 hours and boy does that patience pay off. Chicken was deliciously tender with the perfect crispy coating. Chicken paired beautifully with the Vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrup and honey hot sauce. An incredible combination. The spiced watermelon had a little kick and was super refreshing.

Peach Cobbler - They require 25 minutes notice to prepare the cobbler and I would have gladly waited another hour for it. This cobbler had a marzipan crumble on top with french vanilla ice cream in an almond cookie bowl served with a cinnamon twist. I may have already been full but I stuffed as much of this in my mouth as I could.

Here The Bird: Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken (one-half free range chicken) is brined 27 hours, which results in consummate tenderness and moist chicken meat.  There is a slight kick to the skin of the animal, but not to the top-drawer meat inside.  Tabasco Honey is served on the side if one wants an even more spiced up bird.  But it added nothing to the tastiness of the fowl for me, which in fact lived up to all of the hype this Southern Fried Chicken has been receiving as of late.

To enhance my lunch entree I opened with an appetizer that towered over the plate: suitably cold, salty, and trouty-tasting Deviled Eggs with fresh dill, Smoked Trout Roe (""Redneck Caviar""), and a little paprika sprinkled on top.  Deviled Egg was also utilized as a base to adhere the bottom of the hard-boiled egg to the appetizer platter.  

House-Cut Fries came with Buttermilk Dipping Sauce and Bacon Salt, and an order of fresh house-baked Buttermilk Biscuits was rewarded with soft biscuits, Honey Butter, and a sensational tasting dark Strawberry Jam.

Throughout the meal, hard-driving Southern music played while photos of iconic personalities like Elvis, James Brown, and Muhammad Ali were projected on the wall.

Servers were friendly and knowledgeable, but service was sporadic, and chicken, fries, and biscuits arrived at the table individually, in shifts.  I had to ask another busgirl for extra Honey Butter, and a busboy for more water.

Fried Green Tomato BLT ($14): House-smoked pork belly, smoky tomato jam, frisée, pimento cheese, and pickled lemon vinaigrette. These are great bites with a little of everything and a very cool mash-up of fried green tomatoes and BLT sandwiches.

Kale Salad ($13): Vermont sharp cheddar cheese, apples, cornbread croutons, house-made moonshine raisins, and cider vinaigrette. I love kale and I love kale salads, but this was not doing it for me. The sharp cheddar really overpowered everything else, so no other flavors could shine.

Virginia Ham Biscuits ($14): Mama's Biscuits with Virginia ham and Vermont sharp cheddar cheese. These are great! The biscuits are fluffy and delicious and the ham and cheese was perfect. I would love to try all the other biscuit combinations.

Swine Burger 2.0 ($18): Short rib, brisket, and chuck blend, house smoked pork belly, house pickles, smoked Gouda cheese, pickled onions, and frisée. This burger, although tasty, was a little overwhelming for me and a bit salty. There was a lot going on with the burger patties, pork belly, and Gouda.

Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles ($36): Honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, Vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, and bourbon maple syrup. The fried chicken is good. Admittedly, not my top fried chicken, but really damn good. The waffle is amazing. I'm not going to hate on any waffle that has cheese in it! The honey hot sauce and the bourbon maple syrup and both phenomenal. This is a solid Chicken and Waffles.

House Fries ($8): Tossed in bacon salt and served with housemade buttermilk ranch. Bacon. Salt. They crisp up bacon, finely crush it, and mix it in with salt. Then, these already delicious fries are covered in this heavenly concoction. It's really good stuff. Also, I'm a huge fan of buttermilk ranch, but you don't need it with these fries.

Hummingbird Cake ($10): Cream cheese icing, banana pecan ice cream, caramelized pineapple. I love hummingbird cake because I love pineapple, bananas, and pecans. The dehydrated pineapple was a nice touch on top of this cake. It's too bad they don't have this on their menu anymore!

Banana Pudding ($10): Rum-soaked banana cake, chantilly cream, fresh bananas, vanilla wafers, and house made banana chip. Another favorite of mine and done really well. Yes to all of it.

Drink orders and beverages were described to help us decide. Some of the drinks we elected to try include the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade, Southern Revival, and Yardbird Old Fashion. Drinks came out well timed. Drinks each had different admirable elements. 

Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade was sweet match of blackberry and lemon. Not tart. Well masked bourbon. Definitely there.

Southern Revival was made with
Wild Turkey, passion fruit and basil. This was one of my favorites. The drink masked the alcohol with fruit flavors. Not overly sweet. Just right balance of sweet to alcohol. 

Yardbird Old Fashioned was strong as expected. Not much else I can say to that effect to describe.

The green tomato blt were nice pieces of pork belly. Not overly fatty, seasoned, and with balance of lettuce and tomato. Chicken and waffles was a large dish that would have been better served for two. Crispy golden crunchy skin, moist juicy meat, maple butter waffles and spicy watermelon. The watermelon was a different complementing piece from the usual chicken. The square pieces were nice on own, I just didn't feel it. The waffles were thicker than I prefer. Maple helped.

Artichoke Pasta with added chicken was well seasoned. Chicken pieces reminded me of the fried chicken from the waffles. Tender noodles. 
 
Daily Catch blackened catfish with cheese grits was not over cooked tender and bursting with flavor.

Mac n cheese was a small dish but not lacking in taste. 

Dishes were all polished off and check was settled promptly. Not the best of the best but certainly good attempts to being pretty good.",1,1,1

I ate the chicken breast which was quite possibly the most tender\/moist fried chicken breast I've ever had! The short rib was fall apart tender.

I loved my Crispy Chicken Biscuits ($14) and that pepper jelly was awesome although it could have used a bit more. The pickled okra and onions on the side were a nice touch. I also enjoyed my local IPA, although I was a little disappointed because I wanted the local flight but no IPAs or stouts were able to be included in the flight. 

The ambiance of the place is cute but loud, and the bar areas are a little impractical with the low chairs and basically coffee tables. Eating my biscuit was fine there, but it would have been awkward to bend down and eat if I had soup or something that required a fork.

The decor is very rustic and fun which fits my personality and I felt at home while I was there. After I had read other reviews, I saw that this place was famous for their fried chicken (fried chicken is always a good way to go) but sadly I was really disappointed. The crust and the chicken was so soft my fiancé and I almost contemplated whether it was cooked enough for us to eat. We started off with a wedge salad and sadly I enjoyed that more, it was crisp and had nice thick cut pieces of bacon.
Our server tried a little bit too hard and actually did more harm than he did good. His selling skills were more harassing than they were suggestive and he was trying to hard to be funny while continuing to run in on our conversations during dinner. He also had a lovely time boasting about himself and highroller table he waited on the other day and the amount of gratuity he walked away with.

The BBQ sauce was sweet with a pinch of savory. Mac and cheese was gooey and the crumbly topping was amazing.

What we ordered:
Beverages: 2 sprites for the kids, Southern Revival, Watermelon slings. 
Appetizer: Chicken liver toast
Entrees: Shrimp and Grits, Chicken n watermelon n waffle + The crunchy yardbird sandwich

What we thought:
2 6oz glass bottle of Sprite at $ 4 each...  too expensive. Just order water for them next time..lol  The Southern Revival is very good, watermelon slings is little bit too bitter
Chicken liver toast is good. Crunchy and warm bread topped with creamy liver, the only drawback is the liver is little bit cold. 

Shrimp and Grits, perfectly cooked gulf shrimp and the grits are very creamy and cheesy. The fried Chicken are very very good, perfectly brined and moist, could be little bit more crunchy though. The cheddar waffle are so crunchy on the outside yet soft on the inside, very tasty. 

Since the menu says both the Shrimp and grits and Fried Chicken are shareable entrees for 2-4 ppl, so we thought the 2 entrees should feed my family of 5 including 3 children.... NOT   The portions are for like 1 adult... 

Thus, I ordered the Chicken sandwich at the end, good sandwich though...

The fried chicken and waffles pictures on here sold me but still didn't even do it justice. When it came to the table, it was twice as big as the pictures!  My husband and I looked at each other wide-eye, ""uh we should have just shared that instead of ordering another dish!""  Little did we know, we polished off the whole dish and his sandwich with a little help from our toddler.  The fried chicken was great and only second to the best fried chicken ever (Ad Hoc in Yountville, CA!). Juicy inside with well seasoned- crunchy skin.  The waffle really WAS the best waffle I've had.  It was the first time I've had a cheddar waffle and it was a savory surprise.  It was also perfectly crispy on the surface and warm and soft inside.  Paired with the bourbon maple syrup, it made a wonderful sweet and salty combo.  The bourbon was shockingly strong in the maple syrup, but even for a non-drinker like me, it was unique and delicious.  Finally, the spiced watermelon was a refreshing finish to a heavy meal.  Perhaps it was the salt and lemon juice bringing out the sweetness, but it was the best and sweetest watermelon ever!  Maybe I was just in vacation mode but I enjoyed it all.",0,0,0

Even though it's just fried chicken and comfort food, there's nothing basic about it.  Everything is spiced and flavored just right.

The biscuits here are better than Popeyes!  And I love Popeyes' biscuits too.

The cauliflower mash taste just like mashed potatoes, but better.  I've had mashed cauliflower before at other places, and they taste like... mashed cauliflower.  Here though, they taste better than mashed potatoes.  Not sure how they made it so creamy and delicious.

The chicken itself is fantastic.  This isn't chicken you eat with ketchup.  You eat this as is, or with hot sauce because it's perfect the way it is.  I say it's comparable to putting A1 on a filet at a steak house, or putting ketchup on a hotdog -- you're not a little kid anymore, ketchup doesn't go on hotdogs....  

Grilled mango salad on butter lettuce and pecans... yes...  You need something fresh to balance out your meal, and this definitely did it.

The service was phenomenal as usual, which has been a reoccurring theme in Vegas since everyone hustles for tips.  What's also awesome about this place is how fresh everything is.  The biscuits are made on the spot, the jams and butter are too.  Plus, almost everything is organic.  I like this meal better than the buffets we ate at on this trip.

The yolk in the deviled eggs was seasoned so perfectly and the fresh dill lightened the richness. The fried chicken and the biscuits were very soulful.

A few of us got the special that day which was sausage gravy over fried chicken and biscuits topped with a poached egg. We also ordered shrimp and grits, skillet jalapeno cornbread, cheese grits, and the famous fried chicken and waffles platter. 

The fried chicken is seriously amazing. The skin is so crispy and flavorful. The meat is so tender and juicy. The sausage gravy and biscuit complimented the fried chicken perfectly. I am such a sucker for grits and they were cooked to perfection.

No, the powers of Gordon Ramsey continue strong as the winner of his show Hell's Kitchen runs the kitchen as yardbird, at least as far as I know. So while it's not a GR establishment, it certainly lives up to the pedigree.

Fried Green Tomato BLT- house smoked pork belly, smoky tomato jam, frisée, pimento cheese, pickled lemon vinaigrette. Christ just orgasmic.

Skillet Cornbread- vermont sharp cheddar cheese, bacon, jalapeño, honey maple butter. You won't find better corn bread anywhere out west.

Crispy Chicken Pepper Jelly Biscuits- could've used more pepper jelly but still delicious.

Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles-honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrup. The fried chicken is dope...the syrup I could eat with a spoon. 

Shrimp 'n' Grits- seared shrimp, roasted tomatoes, virginia ham, nora mill grits, pbr chicken jus. It is heavy, it is rich, it is coma inducing, it is sexy.

This place really is the pinnacle of comfort food you could possibly find in vegas. It is elevated southern food it is delicious southern food and there is truly no reason to have a decadent heavy meal anywhere else in the city.

I am the girl who will eat her weight in BBQ, fried chicken, grits, greens and still have room for buttermilk or chess pie. I say, ""take sushi and shove it,"" so you can imagine how hard it is for me to find favorite restaurants in what seems like an interminable land of sushi joints. All that to say I was completely onboard with Yardbird's concept going in to the visit.

My friends and I tried brunch here. They were out of champagne... On a Friday... Of a holiday weekend. How does that work?! Fine. I'll have coffee instead. It was very good coffee, worth both stars I've given the place. The bacon maple donuts were good too. The cornbread was ok. Eggs Benedict was ok. The sweet tea tasted like something you'd by in a can from 7\/11. The server was nice. 

Overall, I wouldn't recommend Yardbird. I think they may be trying to make southern food ""hip"" for the masses who have sushi and ""trend"" addictions (i.e. Most Californians) who don't understand how amazing good old southern cooking is if it's left unfussy. 

Luckily for me, my work allows me to travel to the real South where I can eat my fill of the real deal.",1,1,2

I mean, you're traveling all the way out here, you're looking to spend some money, and you're in one of the top foodie cities in the country so you want to eat really well. I am here to tell you that you are in the right place! Yardbird was my favorite meal in Vegas, hands down. I read the reviews, looked at the menu, and hoped it would be a good spot. But I didn't think it would be mind blowing - I mean, it was like fried chicken and comfort food. How mind blowing could it be? 

It was. Mind. Blowing. I'm telling you, I literally didn't talk the entire meal. We sat in silence, and in awe of what we were eating. 

We decided to share the chicken and waffles ($36), and sides of mac & cheese and crispy brussels sprouts ($10 each). It was still way too much food for the both of us. The flavors were amazing, and everything was cooked very well. The drink menu is very heavily bourbon and whiskey leaning! It totally fits with the theme of the restaurant, but don't go in expecting a fruity frozen margarita. There's also a very decent beer list, and all draft beers are local from Nevada! I can't remember what my guy had, but I had a delicious bourbon cocktail with white peach puree and fresh lemon and thyme called the Southern Peach. Drinks were expensive, as they all are in Vegas, so I only had one cocktail. :) But they all seemed delicious, and would run you approximately $14 a piece. All entrees are between $26 and $36. If my dish is any indication, the portions are ginormous. I would highly recommend sharing one entree and an appetizer and\/or a side! Especially if you're on a budget. 

We sat at the bar, in the corner of the restaurant, so I can't comment too much on ambience. Service from the bartender was good, but I don't remember too much about it. Both the service and the ambience are definitely nice enough for a nice meal though!",4,1,2

Vegas people do not know what Southern food should taste like. When I retire, hopefully rental prices won't be too high and I can make a killing!

We started with the deviled eggs. They were delicious-- deliciously dill. Southern deviled eggs usually have Cajun spice. 

We continued with the fried chicken and the sliders. The fried chicken was good, but not nearly the best either of us have tasted. I had a brisket slider and a fried chicken slider. I already commented on the fried chicken. The brisket slider was good, but needed honey in the barbecue sauce. 

The last mistake we made was to order peach cobbler. It was good, but it needed more butter, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, and lemon zest. Yes, it needed THAT much help.

No need to do this restaurant again, even though it was a unique experience.

I will get to that in a minute. 

We came into the restaurant pretty late. It was about 10:30. We were looking for something after the show we had seen let out. Happily we stumbled upon Yardbird. We were sat right away. It wasn't too busy since business was obviously winding down for the night. Our server greeted us quite quickly after we had sat and he went over the menu with us. They are famous for their chicken and waffles... we ended up ordering the BLT appetizer and short ribs to share. I also got their sweet tea... love sweet tea but can rarely find it anywhere west coast. The food came out within a few minutes. Even Ken our server was shocked. He checked with the kitchen to make sure it was ours! It was! 

The food itself was amazing! Seriously short ribs have been ruined for me. I could never have any as good as that again. The BLT was delicious with a fried green tomato, cheesey polenta, and pork belly. We were just finishing up when the manager checked in on us. He offered to clear our plates and asked how we liked the food. I started raving about the short ribs. He asked if we tried the chicken. We replied no, he went and brought us out each a chicken breast with honey hot sauce. Completely complimentary!  It was amazing by the way! We were already full, but I managed to eat half the breast and my husband wouldn't let it go to waste so he ate all of his and the remainder of mine! 

On our way out I stopped to thank Greg again and he told me to shoot him a text or email next time we are in town. Then he handed me his business card.

We could smell the food over other eateries in the Venetian. 

Anyways they took our drink order and appetizer order immediately. Drinks arrived very fast and the appetizer right after. They brought out our buscuits with some butter and jam. HOLY S%#@ these were amazing! There were about 4 buscuits in the basket. 

We ordered the shrimp and grits, and the swine burger (or something like that). 

The burger came with TWO patties that were made from brisket, short rib, chuck eye and topped with a thick strip of pork belly. Also served were fries. 

The shrimp and grits came with about 6 to 7 shrimp. Amazing. Grits and ajus were super tasty. 

We ordered the crispy brussel sprouts made with honey and another HOLY S#%@ moment. Those were insanely good.

Fried Chicken and Waffles (4 stars): I think the chicken were pretty darn good, crispy skin and good fry on the chicken. The waffles however were a bit soggy. 

Brussel Sprouts (4 stars): These were crispy with I think a bit of balsamic. Pretty good side dish. 

Gnocchi pot pie: (3 stars): Decent dish but probably wouldn't order it again. Comes with a biscuit on top and the gnocchi was decent but in the dish maybe just a bit overcooked and mushy. 

Fries: (2.5-3 stars) larger cut fries, and sprinkled with Bacon salt with a side of ranch. Larger cut fries aren't really my cut of tea and didn't wow me, but not bad to accompany the chicken.

After sleeping in on a Saturday morning, I started yelping for places with good brunch. I found this place and I'm so glad I did. I got there in the late morning and was immediately seated at the bar. 

My gf and I decided to order drinks. I got the Yardbird Old Fashioned and she got the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade. Both were great choices. My bourbon was exactly what you look for in an old fashioned: cold, strong, and smooth. The Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade was the type of drink you make your go-to. It was the perfect combination of just great taste with a kick. That's a must order for anyone coming here for the first time.

As far as food, I ordered the omelette of the day, which had bacon and cheese. It comes with a biscuit and fruit. The biscuits are amazing. They might be the best I've ever had. The omelet was on the small side but it was well-made and still filled me up. I've had better. My gf ordered sausage biscuits. It came with two of them and they each had egg and tomatoes. I'm not really a fan of sausage biscuits, but these were just undeniable. I wound up eating about half of hers. Like I said the biscuits themselves are amazing, but the sausage patty was about as good as I've had.

So the food and drinks here along with the place itself made Yardbird worthy of 5 stars in my book, but it was the service that really takes this place over the top. The lady bartender, whose name I don't remember, was really attentive the whole time and super friendly. As far as service though, they did have one slip up: our food took about 25 minutes to come out when it probably shouldn't have based on how few people were there. But they more than made up for it. Beau, who had checked up on my gf and I multiple times, noticed that our food was taking unusually long. He apologized for it and even better, he gave us a pumpkin pie milk shake on the house. The milkshake was as good as it gets. It was exactly what the name suggests and more. The manager even came over to apologize for the wait and ask us what we thought of the shake.

Overall, this place is more than deserving of 5 stars. They are a bit pricey (I spent ~$80 for 2 small meals and 2 drinks), but it is definitely worth it. Three items there stood out to me as being top of the line: the biscuits, the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade, and the pumpkin pie milk shake. It's not often you can name three items from one place as being top quality. The place itself, food, drinks, and service make Yardbird a place I must return to next time I'm in Vegas.

For that reason is why I can only give it a max 4 star. Don't get me wrong the food was awesome! I just don't feel like the price is worth it to come back and eat here all the time. Especially for fried chicken. 

We ordered a wedge salad and fried green tomato appetizer and I love love love the pork belly!!! It was so good in both dishes I would just come back for that!! I've actually never had fried green tomato before and I will say it was a memorable dish. The salad was also fire! 

So the chicken wasn't the best fried chicken I've ever had for I feel the batter is lacking. The preparation was actually phenomenal!! You can always tell when they cook the breast perfectly it's not too dry! Was still very juicy and I enjoyed it. I will say the waffle was really good too. The syrup they served with it was MEH. But that's just me I prefer just regular maple syrup would have been better than the bourbon they used. But combine all of it with the hot sauce in one bite and the combination was a party in my mouth. So I recommend taking a piece of chicken and waffle add syrup and hot sauce all in 1 bite! Yummy!! 

If yardbird found a way to bring their prices down or even offer some type of local specials I would see myself being a regular but until then it's hard to say when I would want to eat here again but I definitely enjoyed it!",6,3,3

That mouthwatering anticipation when I picked up a delicious piece with my bare hands knowing full well that my life would undoubtedly be better in a few seconds was semi-thrilling.  

The light crunch from the breading, the crispy skin, and the juiciness of the bird meat had my eyes rolling.  It didn't matter; breast, thigh, wing, leg....I was an equal opportunity eater that did not discriminate.  Shit!  I'd make do with a couple of chicken necks if these guys were frying them up.

If I were to be the bearer of bad news, having the ""Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles"" plate brought out as soon as I stuck it to them would definitely soften the blow.  Maybe Yardbird should set up a delivery program where every human resources department in the valley could put in an order.  Laying off 20 people?  You get fried chicken and you get fried chicken and all the rest of you fired motherfuckers get fried chicken!

The location is good and easy to find. Our experience here got a better as time went by as it didn't really start good. When we first arrived, we were told that the wait would be 2 hours. We had an earlier reservation that day but we needed to change it around to accommodate our entire group. So, we had already arrived an hour earlier, anticipating the wait time. (Please make a reservation and DON'T miss it)

While we waited, we went over to the bar and ordered some drinks and appetizers. We were waiting for about 30 minutes when another group came into the restaurant. This group was for 8 people like ours. They were also told the wait was 2 hours and also offered a space to sit in the lounge or couch area where they could sit and have dinner. This immediately made me upset. Here we are waiting for 30 minutes, and drinking and eating, and nobody has offered us anything! So I immediately approached the manager, a guy, and said, ""hey, we've been waiting for what we thought was a two hour wait and another group as large as ours was just offered a couch area..."" He says, ""oh, well they were in front of me at the time and that space is first come first serve"" My rebuttal was that, we had actually arrived first, but he seemed very nonchalant and had no desire to address my concern. 

We finally got a table after another reservation didn't show up. Luckily, our honoree was running a bit late so it appeared that we had everything set up before she arrived. The food was really really good. The portions were so large we ordered everything to share. Our waitress was AMAZING. Her name was Caroline. She really turned around our entire experience and is certainly a 5 star employee. She gave amazing suggestions for menu items. She was really attentive to our honoree and her bridal celebration. She brought out complimentary Peach Cobbler Shots for our celebration. She also gave really good leads for after party entertainment. I was really satisfied with the food and the overall dining experience. 

The restaurant was really really clean. I ordered the fried chicken and the grilled green beans, but we also had kale salad, mac and cheese, ribs and several orders of deviled eggs.

This chicken literally makes you want to slap your mother...

They go one step further and pair it with a delicious cheddar cheese waffle. Then they elevate the syrup with a little bit of bourbon and a nice shot of hot sauce. Oh, they are not finished there, they then give you six perfectly cut chilled cubes of mint watermelon....

They literally could have charged me $100 for that plate and I would pay you.

I generally steer clear of craft cocktails because most places try to hard to make them taste so fancy and they ruin the alcohol. But this place was on point. We all got different ones and they were all good. Word to the wise: even though the entree portions say serves 2-4 it's really a personal portion. 2-4 servings is if you are ordering family style. We also ordered the bone marrow which was amazing but you only really get 4 bites total for about $16 (?) So not really worth the money on that one.

Everything from the cocktails (loved the Southern Revival, with whiskey, passion fruit, and basil--I'm a sucker for anything passion fruit, but this was especially well balanced...not too sweet; according to my compatriots, the old fashioned was killer, too) to the fried chicken sliders (on biscuits as flaky as all get-out) to the kale salad (a nice counterpoint to all the heavy food--kale, apple, whiskey-soaked raisins, cheddar cheese, all in a light vinaigrette).

We were at a table adjacent to the kitchen, which is fun--you get to see the magic happening--but it's a bit chaotic, too. Overall, the ambience is great...dim lighting, a modern take on Southern style.

Old review-
This southern girl has mixed feelings. I tried shrimp and grits and it was just ok. It wasn't very flavorful. The fried chicken was great. It is pricey so I'm not so thrilled for paying so much for okay food. The service was great.",0,0,0

Normally I don't eat fried chicken since it gives me a headache and heartburn, but not the chicken here. My husband and I got two of the chicken dishes, specifically the Chicken n Waffles and the Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken. What I loved was that the fried batter tasted very light and not greasy at all so it doesn't make you feel like you hate yourself after eating a bunch of fried chicken. Normally my husband and I don't eat like to eat the fried parts (I know, it's supposedly the best part), but we were killing the skin. These entrees didn't come with sides so you'll need to order those separately. Try the Fried Green Tomato BLT appetizer.

For drinks, I had the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade which was tasty but too sweet for what I like in a bourbon drink. I more preferred the Southern Revival which was a bit more sour. And you can't go wrong with an Old Fashioned either. Surprisingly, they have a pretty large bourbon menu for being a chicken place.

For dessert, we got the peach cobbler, which was ridiculously enormous for 2 people since it also comes with a huge scoop of ice cream in a cookie shell bowl and a baked cinnamon twist thing. And even more ridiculous that my husband and I still ate the whole thing despite how full we were.

Maybe it's just me but I prefer Southern restaurants to feel more traditional without all the fancy touches. I like silverware & furniture not matching and the food to be simple and full of flavor. I've been here twice now and there's always something that's off.

The food is ok but nothing blew me away. When the prices are high which is expected on the strip the food needs to shine in my opinion. There's so many Southern options in town for half the price and they taste better. The restaurant is very pretty and has a modern feel with some traditional touches which isn't anything special and the service has been spotty to say the least. 

My favorite items were the chicken & waffles but the watermelon it comes with has never been in season during my visits and still comes on the plate. Look for another option when the watermelon doesn't taste good. The deviled eggs have always been luxurious and creamy and the chicken biscuit sandwich has been a winner when the biscuit isn't burnt. 

So there's tasty things but sometimes it doesn't all come together. As for some of the other items that were bland for me ~ mac & cheese, fried green tomatoes, shrimp & grits, warm cheese on watermelon (bad luck with the fruit). The cocktails here are also a tad too fancy and come with massive ice cubes that leave hardly any room for the good stuff - the liquor. 

So all in all, it's pricey for what it is. It's very fancy which isn't needed and some of the food needs some work. I like simplicity when it comes to Southern cuisine and I think things could get better here.",34,20,33

Stopped in on a Sunday morning after they opened based on their sign in the concourse advertising a Tito's bloody mary. And we need bloody marys!

If you're unfamiliar with Tito's vodka, it is a somewhat smaller vodka distillery in Austin, TX. It is a good vodka and has won awards, but is not an ultra premium vodka. It costs about $33 for a handle in OKC. Cheaper than, say, Ketel One.

We sat at the uncrowded bar and we were greeted quickly, but then ignored.  It took several minutes before we were asked what we wanted to order. We quickly ordered two Titos bloody marys to go. Bartender was unimpressed with us. Probably hungover, but that's no excuse. It's a hospitality business.

The cost for two drinks?  $34.  Inexcusable pricing, even for Vegas. Throwing a fatty piece of bacon in there doesn't make it better. I guess we should have asked before ordering, but that was completely unexpected.

May or may not try it again for an actual meal. We were so offended by the pricing it will be hard to go back.


UPDATE: They communicated quickly after reading my review. They were unhappy with my experience and provided a refund, which really was above-and-beyond my level of complaint.

We were staying at the Venetian and saw Yardbird on their restaurant row and made a mental note to try it.  It always seemed packed when we walked by so I looked them up on open table and snagged a reservation.  Glad I did, because when we went if you didn't have a reservation you basically only the option to sit at the bar.  

We sat in the back and ordered the fried chicken, classic buttermilk biscuits and the house fries (bacon salt & cheese).  Plus a couple bourbons.  It all came out at once and was out of this world.  Seriously, the right balance of crispy, salty goodness.  Nothing was greasy, it was just well cooked and perfectly seasoned.  

I wish we had one in Denver!!! Seriously the best fried chicken I have had in a long time.  Service was outstanding and it had a very down home laid back vibe.

Came during brunch on a Saturday and had a reservation, which made it really easy (thank you Open Table).  I did notice about 10 people waiting for a table.  I had the eggs benedict and my gf had the fried chicken, waffle, and water melon.  Eggs benedict was good but nothing too special.  However, the fried chicken was amazing!  That alone made the meal delicious.  The waffle was also good, on the crispier side but still tasty.  The watermelon was standard.  I would definitely recommend the chicken without hesitation.

The fried chicken at Yardbird does not disappoint!

It's sooo creamy and decadent that I really didn't want the experience to end.  And did I mention the bacon?  They had small bite size pieces of bacon that tasted like it was smoked and cured in house.  Nothing like big chunks of fresh bacon to go along with the custard like poached egg on homemade biscuits.  Seriously, it was like I died and went to heaven.

BEST MEAL OF YOUR LIFE! I thought I knew what love was and then I ate here. I went with a group of friends for an early dinner on October 21 and we all ordered dishes and shared them. My mouth is watering as I type this. 

We had the Farmer's Cheese and Watermelon and Biscuits to start. The homemade jam and delicious butter is what dreams are made of. Then I had the shrimp and grits and this was a creamy, flavorful, burst of love in my mouth!

The star of the show is the fried chicken! If you love fried chicken, you must try this. I personally believe that this fried chicken can change the world. It was juicy, crispy, seasoned, and perfect.

Ambience: nice but not overly stuffy. Chill decor that is conducive to a date night or just chill dinner with the boys. There is a lounge type setting up front next to bar as well as formal table set up in the back.  
Service: pretty decent. We were served right away. Water was refilled at a decent pace. The made it clear st the beginning that the food will be brought out when it is ready and not necessary in which it was placed. So some there was some lag in between but not bad. 
Food: mainly southern comfort food. It was restaurant week so there were pretty decent specials going. Devil eggs were pretty good. A tad much on yolk. I liked the fried green tomato. Nice chunks of bacon on top. Fried chicken was above average. Moist and flavorful. Bbq ribs were ok as well. My favorite item was the mac and cheese. They were actually shells and was nice and creamy. Not too dry. I would live to try their other items.

We ordered a couple of small plates and then the fried chicken. I'm not a fan of fried green tomatoes, but my wife and her friend said they were amazing. The ham and cheese biscuits should just be a full meal. The biscuits were flaky and buttery and The ham was perfect: slightly sweet, juicy, perfectly cooked.

With our fried chicken we had Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were caramelized and were a big hit at the table.

The main restaurant was in the rear. Our experience suffered a bit because our waitress was in training. She was pleasant and tried hard, but some things needed more explanation.

Fried green tomato BLT: Good. Not great. Three large slices of cornmeal crusted green tomato dressed with pimento cheese, bacon, tomato jam, salad. Hard to get all the tastes in one bite.
Biscuits: came with 4. Fluffy, warm.
Cauliflower mashed potatoes: bland, boring.

We had the Green Tomato BLT then shared the shrimp and grits and the short rib. Everything was great but the shrimp and grits were to die for. That was probably the only dish that the portion wasn't generous. We ended with the bread pudding which my wife loved. 

This is one of the few if any restaurants I have been to in Vegas that seems it would succeed in about any other major city. The staff were friendly and attentive, the ambiance was high end casual and the cocktails were great. Will definitely come back.",0,0,0

Lol. We came to Yardbird and sat at the bar since it was so busy. I got my night started with a beer flight consisting of mostly ales. My date had the Deviled Eggs which were made with dill, chive and smoked trout roe. She said there was almost ""too much Devil"" in the egg. For dinner I had the Smoked Brisket Biscuit, which comes with 2 served with pickled onion & cucumber smoky tomato jam, house-made bbq sauce. They were really, really good. My date had Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken which is just 1\/2 a chicken served with honey hot sauce. Their chicken was SO GOOD, but not worth $26.00. They trippin'. We also got a side of Macaroni & Cheese which was torchio pasta, five artisanal cheeses all under a crispy herb crust. Now THAT was good. My friend next to us had the legendary Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles served with honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon a Vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle and bourbon maple syrup. It's the same chicken my date had, but that waffle was good. Again, not worth the money. Overpriced in my opinion simply because the restaurant is inside the Venetian\/Palazzo.

I am a very hard critique on southern food! This place nailed it. As in, 10 out of 10 stars. 

The decor is supercool, think Restoration Hardware meets farmhouse meets blues! Loved the Mason Jar ceiling! The wine collection is impressive, and the bourbon and whiskey selection was grand! My mouth was hanging open reading the list...Basil Haydens, Angels Envy, even Pappy Van Winkle...

We were sat immediately and given menus. We decided to start with Fried Green Tomatoes. I fell in love.
Oh my worrrrd. They are so delicious. They were in a thick but not too thick cornmeal batter and they were perfect! Served with a hearty portion of pimento cheese on top, and ohhh that pimento cheese was the perfect combination of not too much pimento and a hard consistency of finely grated sharp cheddar....and super fresh!!! And then, top it off with a healthy piece of applewood smoked bacon! I mean I would like to eat these fried green tomatoes everyday of my life.....

My husband had the skillet fried chicken. They served it with a hot sauce honey dip that was scrumptious. I had the butter salad and it was delicious, also. Butter lettuce,  tomatoes, fresh and perfectly ripe avocados, corn, and drizzled with a to-die-for homemade buttermilk ranch dressing...I had it topped with fried chicken of course. This isnt a place you want to  count calories! I could have licked my plate. Everything we ate was perfection. 

My husband loves dessert! His favorite part of the meal.
We tried two:
The butterscotch cake and the bread pudding. The 4 layer butterscotch cake is intertwined with a layer of pecan pie filling, and paired with a hearty scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, and the ice cream is garnished with bacon, of course. It was a little too rich for my tasting, but my husband loved it! 

Now for the bread pudding: y'all...that bread pudding is better than ANY I've ever tasted. Even better than Commander's Palace in New Orleans. They put a cream filling inside and it was perfection. Oh my word. I mean, I'm still hallucinating over that bread pudding! 

Our server was so hospitable. She timed our food perfectly, and we loved chatting with your cutie pie manager, Sarah. She's a gem. If I had to get reallly picky, my only recommendation is that I would love to see more wines by the glass. So many great selections were bottles only. I can't drink a bottle at lunch and be productive the rest of the day. 

Do NOT miss this place in Vegas! 

I will be back to this establishment before my trip is over! It is THAT good! And I will PRAY every night that we are blessed with this restaurant expansion in Nashville!!  Well done, Yardbird!",1,0,0

I could go to my parents house and have everything I had here but done right for way less than what I payed. They don't even have pepper sauce for the greens??.. and the chicken I had was again not anything to write about. The highlight of the evening were the brussel sprouts tossed in honey and cayenne..

The fried green tomato BLT was oily, the biscuits were over cooked and hard, the cheese grits were a coagulated lumpy mess, and the frog legs were tough and gamey.

We got a table almost immediately somehow and tried to order quickly because the waitress seemed so busy and there were some large parties we wanted to get in front of. I went there planning on getting the blackberry lemonade, but then a rum drink with banana and walnut caught my eye. I asked the waitress which was better\/more popular and she warned that the banana walnut was pretty sweet. Well I like sweet, so I figured, if she's comparing those two drinks and thinks one is sweeter, I'll trust that. Well I hadn't noticed that it was an ""old fashioned"" so was basically two fingers of straight rum - not exactly what I would ever describe as sweet when you compare it to a lemonade cocktail. It was my own fault for reading the menu too quickly, but that description from the server was odd to me....

On to the food. we'd heard so much about the chicken, my bf got the crunchy chicken sandwich and he really liked it. Again, I asked my server for her recommendation (we ordered drinks and food at the same time, so I didn't know yet that I wasn't a fan of her recommendations haha) between the smoked chicken salad (to try the fab chicken here) or the shrimp and grits. She recommended the shrimp and grits and, lucky me, I loved it. The flavors in this dish went together so perfectly.

1st the deviled eggs. 4 halves for 11$ decent tasting but lots of dill and pretty frugal portion i thought. 

2nd quail under a brick. 17$ for rubbery meat, there was chicken liver mixed in with the rice and the mix of mushrooms throughout the dish just gave too many competing flavors. 

3rd bone marrow. I liked this one the best, the bacon onion relish used to garnish goes nice with the bone marrow. It was nice and rich and everyone you want from bone marrow.

In December I went to the Yardbird with high hopes of it being as awesome as I had been told. But that was not my experience, and afterwards I wrote my yelp review, because that is what I do. Trying to be as fair an honest as possible.

The owner of Yardbird read my previous review, and even though it was not bad, because it was not great he reached out personally to discuss my experience! I was surprised and impressed! He implored me to come in again, assuring me I had hit an off moment in his restaurant. So when a friend told me he was staying at the Venetian, and wanted to meet for dinner I thought this was a perfect opportunity to try again.

I am so glad I did! My experience was completely different! This time we sat in the dining room, last time I sat in the bar. The service was impeccable! We started with drinks, my freiend had a martini, and I had a lemonade (because I don't drink-don't judge! LOL) I still say one of the best lemonades ever!

For dinner I had the Shrimp & Grits, my friend had the fried chicken. It was delish!
And even though they have an AMAZING selection of appetizers, we were seduced with the idea of the cobbler for dessert! Which takes about 30 minutes, so order when you place your food order! LOL Yes, we were happy to order dessert first! LOL

These fried green tomatoes come with house smoked pork belly (I got without), pimento cheese, frisee, smoky tomato jam and lemon vinaigrette. They were delicious, even though I could easily have eaten 5x as many. 

I also ordered the herb garden Caesar salad, served with egg whites, red onion, dried tomatoes and Parmesan capers. Capers are so good, but again, they're not incredibly common. 

My boyfriend opted for crispy chicken biscuits with pepper jelly, as well as the herb garden Caesar salad.

Of course, it wouldn't be a Southern meal without some good ole bourbon! I loved the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade (substituted with Makers), while Sean sipped on the Southern Peach.

Starting out with a couple of cocktails (a Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade and a Southern Peach), we were impressed with the flavor of the drinks and the flair with which the bartender concocted them.

My Kale Salad with Crispy Chicken was exactly what I wanted, although I thought the chicken could have been crispier, warmer, and fresher tasting. Also, their cornbread croutons got soft and soggy very quickly, which was a slight disappointment. However, overall, my meal was good with most of the ingredients being fresh, I was famished, and I hadn't had many veggie-centric meals during our trip, so despite not being completely wowed I still gobbled the whole salad up. 

My partner described his burger as ""like a McDouble, but a hundred times better."" He was neither disappointed nor amazed. This is normal for him.

Shortly after being sat, we met our waiter. He had a peculiar attitude throughout our meal. He seemed annoyed to be serving, he provided 0 commentary even when the table made comments to which any other waiter would have had a response to. Maybe just a bad night?

Drinks

Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade:  I could really end it at that. The flavor matches the name and the alcohol's presence was enough. Refreshing. 4\/5

Southern Peach: The bourbon in this takes over the lightness of the peach puree and sweet tea, it's distribution is in chaser form. 3.5\/5 

Food

Mac and Cheese: The 5 different cheeses made it sloppy and scary since I can only eat measured out amounts of dairy. But the taste was good. I enjoyed it at a normal degree but the rest of my table fell in love with it. 3.5\/5

Bone Marrow: The onion marmalade surprised me in taste. It has a light sweetness to it that went too magically well with the bone marrow on toast. It's good enough to turn people into bone marrow fans. The portion was big and it cost less than a drink, souther oddities. 4.75\/5

Smoked Brisket Biscuits: The brisket was a hands full. Their ""homemade"" bbq sauce was low on the tang but the cleanliness of the brisket made up for it. The biscuits had a fresh taste but nothing that would have me ordering a side to go. 4\/5

I wanted to taste their take on the ribs but with a long night ahead of me, that would of been a bad idea. This is a spot to get your night started. I treated it as more of a drinks and apps place but it wouldn't be bad to spend an early dinner here either. The ambiance is perfect and the selection of drinks is not bad. Good stuff yardbird.",1,1,1

The fried chicken and waffles...OMG. The chicken was tender, moist with a light yet extremely crunchy breading...all with a slightly spicy maple sauce. You MUST try this!!!!

The bacon maple donuts to round out the meal was simply perfect. Warm, fluffy and light bites of heaven with a thick, silky dipping sauce. Incredible.

Our party ordered their famous fried chicken, biscuits & gravy and brisket sliders to share amongst everyone. We also ordered mac and cheese along with their corn bread to pair with our entrees. The fried chicken was served hot out of the fryer and it was absolutely delicious! I believe our waiter mentioned their chickens are brined for 27 hours which explains the moistness behind every bite. The skin wasn't as crunchy as I expected but it was still nonetheless flavorful and good. The biscuits with gravy and eggs was a bit... messy. The egg was cooked over easy and the yolk sort of made everything else on the dish a little soggy. I know most people probably enjoy the combination of biscuits, chicken and eggs mixture; it was just a bit too much for me. The corn bread was good, but I definitely had better. The Mac and cheese was creamy, but it could have used a little more cheddar cheese to add that sharpness flavor to it. 

Overall, I really had a good dining experience here and would recommend others to try this place out. Really cool ambiance with couches and love sofas available for seating. They also have a full bar if you wanted to just chill and have a drink with your friends.

Yardbird Restaurant is literally next door to the venue, so nothing could be more convenient. Plus they honored all reservation which is a major plus. ( the people who walked in in front of us without a reservation were told to come back in 3 hours !) We decided to share their Skillet cornbread, grilled Caesar salad, and the signature Fried Chicken. The cornbread was by far the best cornbread I've ever eaten. It comes out with a honey butter in the center. Yumm! Grilled Caesar salad he's just what it sounds like. It's a grilled Romaine that split in half and has delicious toppings on it. Absolutely delicious. The fried chicken is their signature dish. That was a little disappointing. But in the spirit of full disclosure, I am not ordinarily a fan of fried chicken. This version of it did nothing to convert me. Their dessert menu looked phenomenal. Unfortunately I was way too stuffed by that time to order another dish. Next time I come back, I'll skip the chicken and go straight to dessert. The only drawback to Yardbird is the closeness of the tables.

I was repeatedly told by others that Yardbird was a place I ""needed to check out"" while I was in town. I have, and I'm underwhelmed.

Conceptually, this should be the kind of place I like: southern cuisine, fried and smothered as it is, is generally an easy score with me when it's done half-way right. And perhaps the problem here isn't that Yardbird has done anything egregiously wrong, but rather they simply haven't executed at a high enough level to demand the prices they're charging for simple, humble food.

I started with a refreshing Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade to go along with an appetizer of Deviled Eggs: four hard-boiled egg whites stuffed with the equivalent of eight yolks. The eggs were substantial and, if I was interested in quantity over quality, they'd have won the day. Alas, egg yolks can become monotonous without copious amounts of help in the way of mustard, mayo, hot peppers, ground pickles, horseradish, and so on, and I feel the kitchen was far too restrained in seasoning the yolks. After just one egg, I was done.

I ordered the Blue Plate Special ($16), essentially two fried chicken pieces: a thigh and a drum stick, a biscuit, spiced watermelon, and ""honey"" hot sauce. I guess I should not have been surprised that they gave me the two cheapest pieces of the chicken they could have put on my plate. If I wasn't a fan of dark chicken, I'd be outraged. The chicken itself was middle-of-the-road, not great, but far from horrible. Yardbird fries the chicken at a higher temperature than I typically would prefer. The resulting darker coating creates a deeper cereal-like flavor that overwhelms any accompanying spices. Some people like this style, even if I'm not a fan. There's a fine line between meeting food safety standards and over-cooking chicken, and Yardbird is not the type of restaurant to take risks. Too bad. I would have liked the meat to be a bit juicier.

The spiced watermelon was interesting, more sour than spicy (think sour gummy candy) --but  at just four pieces, not enough of it is provided to win hearts and minds. The biscuit was probably the highlight of my plate. They nailed the biscuit - buttery, flaky, just the right amount of density. I could kiss Yardbird's biscuit and sing to it.

Maybe it's because my father was a chef from the south and I grew up eating this kind of food, but I don't believe the food at Yardbird earns five or even four stars. Also, this place shouldn't be charging $16 for a fried drumstick, fried thigh, and a biscuit. That's insane.

I'd be interested to hear from all of the people who love this place -- did I order the wrong dishes? Am I being unfair? Let me know!

Let me start of this review by proudly proclaiming that I am high maintenance in my expectations of restaurants and bars these days.  I don't say this because I suffer from unrealistic expectations or think my own ""specialness"" requires five servers to be at my beck and call. No, I am high maintenance in my expectations because of the Food and Drink Revolution that has swept the Nation over the last seven years.  What started as a trickle and can now be found on street corners tucked away in your own neighborhoods is the undeniable smell of local ingredients being smoked, braised, fried, sousvide, and grilled in endless modern recreations of timeless classics.  This return to the basics is the result of massive corporate chains that used central plants to create their staple ingredients, which they had shipped nationally, and in the process ensured uniformity, consistency, and preservative laden, tasteless entrees that planted the seeds for the grass roots insurrection that we all have the pleasure of experiencing and tasting.  
This brings us to a last minute weekend getaway with my Wife and another couple that shares our work hard, play hard mentality.  Last minute flights and rooms for Valentine's Weekend are possible while getting a seat at some of the Top ""Occasion"" spots is a bit more challenging.  As a result, we explored newer venues and hidden gems which in this case brought us to the front door of YardBird, which sits in between the Palazzo and The Venetian.  Clean lines, wood, comfortable chairs and tables in the lounge, a prominent bar to the left, and the warm glow that only Edison bulbs can bring welcomed us, while the smiling hostess took us to main dining room for our Saturday morning brunch.  My first glance at the menu had my mouth watering because after 24 hours of Vegas shenanigans, I was ready to coat the stomach with some serious chow and also the hair of the dog that bit me.
We were greeted by Andrew, who helped guide or choices and happily he convinced three non bourbon drinkers to try the house's signature Old Fashioned.  My love affair with this cocktail has lasted for about a year now, and I have seen many bars fail miserably in creating this simple, classic and delicious cocktail.  Andy brought out the 4 drinks and I was happily surprised to see 1 floating sphere of ice in each hi-ball glass.  This ball of ice melts slowly, which reduces the watering down of what the bartender has created for you.  Andy then repeated that the Buffalo Trace Bourbon is house infused for this drink, and let me tell you......it was delicious.  As most old fashioned drinkers can tell  you, the 1st one goes down slowly as you sip at the potent yet simple combo of flavors, but by number two, the sips become larger, the voices a bit louder and of course all the jokes become funnier.  We immediately ordered the Chicken and Watermelon and Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits.  We ordered to share, which is the best way to dine in my opinion, and an awesome benefit to being coupled up!  It was explained the plates would come when ready vs. when the whole ticket was completed to maximize the freshness of the entrees.  I like that!
The 1st dish was the Chicken, and it was awesome.  I was immediately sad that I had to share, then aggressive in my grab of the big breast that was topped with a thigh, wing and drumstick.  The chicken was amazing!  Gorgeous and flavorful crispy skin hid the juicy meat that I picked clean from every bone, while the house made hot sauce, although unnecessary, was the perfect combo of vinegar and heat.  Most chicken and waffle plates, including the LA staple that popularized this dish, aren't very good at the waffle part of this equation, but these guys delivered.  Crispy and hot waffles, served with butter and REAL syrup.  Then 3 perfect cubes of watermelon heart that offer a sweet and subtle palette cleanser.  The four of us demolished that plate, and in turn ordered 4 more cocktails!  The Shrimp and Grits were next and it did not disappoint.  Look, I am from Texas originally and understand the power of grits, which I prefer buttered and served with a nice cup of coffee!  This was not your Momma's out of box instant grits.  The grainy texture was intended and noticeable, while the chunks of ham that were folded in were a nice compliment to the generous portion of shrimp that was on top.  Most places are pretty cheap with the shrimp, but we had at least 8 large tail on sea dwelling critters and the forks were working overtime.  This led to the whole table being parched, so we needed a final round of drinks before we got the check........and entered another good 8 hours of gambling and various other Vegas activities.",1,1,0

I went with a group of about 7 people and we were seated in less than 10 minutes on a Monday evening. The restaurant itself is really chic and cute, with a rustic look. Their lights were made with hanging Mason Jars. It was very cute. 

We ordered our food family style so that came with two large servings of the chicken, and we ordered extra sides too. We also ordered extra biscuits which came with this amazing apple jam and the biscuits were served hot and fresh! We also had a mac n cheese side along with french fries. The mac n cheese was my other favorite side. I definitely recommend the mac n cheese!

The french fries were also good and crisp, but there wasn't anything particularly special about them. We also ordered a side of deviled eggs. They were plated very nicely and tasted just as good. The best part is probably the chicken. The chicken was battered and deep fried perfectly. I really like the seasoning because it was flavorful and has a kick to it. 

They also give you a lot of hot sauce and other sauces on the side to drench your chicken in! Their hot sauce is a MUST!

We showed up without a reservation around 6:45pm and luckily did not have a wait at all. For dinner, we shared the BBQ pork belly, house-cut fries, mama's chicken biscuits, and I also had a small side farmer's salad. 

The pork belly was good -- it is served with a sherry apple glaze and some pickled salad. Make sure you have a bite of everything together. It's got a great flavor. The fries are my favorite!! Paired with a buttermilk dipping sauce and bacon bits... you would be crazy not to order these! Mama's chicken biscuits were good.

There are two little sandwiches -- so you might want to consider ordering more to share or getting a larger entree depending on your hunger levels. When we saw the watermelon and waffles getting delivered to other tables, we were regretting our decision. The farmer's salad is decent to eat alone if you feel like you need a bit of greens in your life like I did. (Greens, an egg, and a smoked onion vinaigrette.)

I had to go with chicken, waffle, watermelon and a side of mac & cheese. The chicken and waffle are great and the plate is generous so perfect size for sharing. We also ordered the fried tomato BLT as an appetizer per the waiter's recommendation and it is was great as well. Crunchy and the green tomato inside fresh, which is very important. The drinks my friends enjoyed and it was ok. They definitely make it strong so those that like a lighter drink, highly recommend reminding the waiter.

Sister and I came here for a random Monday night dinner and it was fantastic from the service to the food. 

We started with some Crispy Chicken Biscuits (delicious but you only get two) and a couple of drinks. She had and loved their Watermelon Sling cocktail, which is made with fresh watermelon juice and White Whiskey. I went with a White Horse Ale beer also good.

For our ""supper"" she went with the Swine Burger which I didn't taste but she enjoyed and honestly looked like one hell of a burger. Was pleasantly surprised and disappointed (lol) she even finished it. I went with famous Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles. This was a tough decision since I'm not much of a fried chicken fan (besides wings) but it ended up being a great decision. Chicken was cooked perfectly and still very moist inside, waffles were good not very heavy just the way I like them, the watermelon at the end was an excellent refresher. This was the first time I had ever ordered chicken and waffles and now I understand the love for them.

We finished the night with their Chocolate Nutella Cake which was the best and most amazing part of the entire meal.

We started out sharing the kale salad with smoked chicken. Made with tender baby kale leaves tossed in a light vinaigrette with moonshine soaked raisins and topped with sour granny smith apples and the best corn bread croutons, each bite had a varying of textures and flavors. With each bite there was some smokiness from the chicken with the tangy dressing and the sourness from the apples and slight sweetness from the raisins. 

If it's one thing that I have learned from eating at Southern places, it's that portions are anything but small - so we decided that we would would share. Called it, when the Bird came out we knew we had made the right decision. This dish came with exactly half a chicken that had been breaded in a savory crunchy coating and deep fried to perfection. Accompanying the chicken was a honey hot sauce and a cheddar waffle, bourbon infused maple syrup and some watermelon that had been chilled and infused in spices.
 
Ok, I will be the first to admit that I was planning to just chow down on the chicken and ignore the rest - but I am sure glad I didn't. 

The chicken definitely pairs better with the  honey hot sauce (honestly I couldn't taste the honey - tasted like plain hot sauce to me) but I accidentally dipped my chicken in the maple syrup and my life changed. I can honestly say that before today I was never a fan of chicken and waffles, that mix of sweet and meaty savory did not sound appealing. But Yardbird has changed my perspective. 

The waffles are something else. Usually when you think waffles, you think dense (ok not dense dense but a heavier cake) and sweet. These waffles were lighter and because it was topped with cheddar has a slight crisp to them - a crisp that remained throughout the meal. The waffle was layered, the bottom was sweet but the top was slightly savory from the cheese. All of these was absolutely delicious doused in their maple syrup. 

It's worth mentioning that there are two types of maple syrup available - there is the bourbon infused maple syrup and the traditional. Not being a fan whatsoever of alcohol I wanted to avoid the bourbon infused altogether but hubby encouraged me to have a taste. It wasn't anything like I expected, it had a nice bite to it - almost an oaky after taste. 

The infused chilled watermelon slices were quite interesting. They had a slight kick to them and were the perfect light crisp end to a heavier meal.

If you're looking for a filling meal at a decent price, Yardbird is a must.

- There is likely going to be some sort of wait regardless of what time you go, leave your number with the hostess and they will text you when your table is ready.

Notice fried chicken is not listed here, which is extremely disappointing given that the restaurant's name suggests that the chicken should be the star of the show.

The waffles from the chicken & waffles were probably the best waffles I've had. They were very crisp and light on the inside. The fried chicken that accompanied the waffles was crispy but had no flavor. It's sad when a fancy schmancy place can't beat a place like Popeye's or KFC for taste when it comes to fried chicken.

The chicken biscuits fared no better since the fried chicken was the same as the one from the chicken & waffles dish.

The shrimp & grits were good. The grits were very good, creamy and tasted good, unlike a lot of other places that can't do grits justice. The shrimp was cooked well and seasoned appropriately.

I was annoyed that the restaurant was almost completely empty when we came to pick up the food. We ordered the chicken and waffle, short rib, and roasted artichoke pasta.

Ugh the food was SO good. The mac n' cheese was delicious, The fried chicken is obviously amazing, the short rib was great and they have really good drinks. We came here with a large group of girls and no reservations, but walked in later in the evening (around 9pm) and were seated right away. The service was excellent and timing of all of the dishes was great.
The plates are meant to be shared so we were able to order a bunch of things and try a little of everything. We also had these brussel sprouts that were done so well- we honestly didn't have a bad thing. 
I imagine if you actually live in the south you'd be critical of this place, but it was a really nice dinner. It is still nice enough for Vegas, but not so fancy that you feel out of place if you are looking for a semi-casual dinner before going out. 
I would definitely suggest having a reservation, we probably could have gotten in a lot earlier if we had made one.",0,0,0

So, we made reservations to try out this restaurant since we had family in town.  We got seated and waiting 10, then 20 minutes before having anyone approach our table for water even.  I asked the hostess walking by for assistance and she was super apologetic and quickly got someone to serve our table right away.  The server took our order and gave us the perfect amount of attention--not too much or too little--but made sure we felt acknowledged and was quick with any requests we made.  The Restaurant Manager, Sean, stopped by our table and apologized yet again!  The fact that the hostess even brought this oversight to his attention was absolutely not necessary, but was just enough to win us over.  To know that this busy, successful restaurant actually cared enough to notify its manager, and for the manager to come and personally apologize, is what's missing in customer service these days.  He asked us if we wanted anything else like drinks or desserts.  We passed on both, but the server was insistent, and so we settled for the bread pudding.  Ok, so I forgot to talk about the food up to this point since I was blindsided by the amazing customer service.  It was DELICIOUS!!! I'm from the South and every piece of chicken, pork, and biscuit was perhaps one of the most delicious renditions I've ever tasted.  The icing on the cake? When we were ready to pay the bill, our server told us it was already taken care of and apologized yet again for the error.

I wasn't crazy about the bourbon syrup on its own, but drizzled on the fluffy waffle with a piece of chicken and a splash of honey hot sauce, everything was delicious together.  The pickled watermelon was something different and complimented the dish nicely.

This time around, we went with a few classics that included Lewellyn's Fried Chicken, the Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes, and the Macaroni and Cheese.  Good thing I do not live in Las Vegas, otherwise I would be here too often.    

The fried chicken is hearty, flavorful, and the meat is cook perfectly...not too dry.  You will not be disappointed with the crispy and tasty outer layer.  Most of us have had our share of mashed potatoes, but the cauliflower mashed potatoes are delectable.  The cauliflower and spices used in the mashed potatoes exceeds any level of gourmet potato dish you might have experienced.  The macaroni and cheese is cheesy and hot with a very slight crust.  All of this was washed down with a classic 24 ounce original Coors and a Moscow Mule.  The Moscow Mule was one of the best I have ever had.

In regards to the service, it consistently exceeds the standard.  Each time I have had the pleasure of dining at the Yardbird, our waitstaff has been excellent.

I ordered the omelette of the day, and my husband got a kale salad. My omelette arrived underdone (to my eyes) and I sent it back. I felt terrible for sending food back in a place that obviously knew what they were doing, we googled omelettes and found that they can be served runny (you get egg dripping out the sides), this is not my preferred way of eating eggs, and the only thing I would have changed was to have our waitress give me a heads up that this was how they were served. I was amazed by how quickly my dish was whisked away and then returned, with no back talk from the waitstaff. I ended up with a dish that was everything I had hoped for and more. 

I also need to give a special shout-out to the biscuits, and the butter they were served with. I have traveled in the south, and this biscuit rivals the ones my great grandmother made.

Finally after two weeks in Vegas I finally made a reservation for dinner, I wanted to see if the food could stand up to the décor and my anticipation.

Everything about this restaurant screamed the South. The walls were covered with reclaimed wood and adorned with Mason jars filled with an assortment of colorful pickled vegetables. The lighting was subtle, as Edison Lights illuminate the dining room. The menu was eclectic in its simplicity with items from Shrimp n Grits, Fried Chicken and Cornbread to Smoked and Roasted Bone Marrow, Grilled Florida Cobia and Roasted Fingerling Potatoes.

The server came to our table and informed us that their portion sizes were quite large and that we may want to consider sharing plates family style rather than ordering individually. She also told us that the Yardbird was known for it's chicken, specially brined for a minimum of 27 hours prior to serving, providing a great unique flavor while keeping the chicken moist and juicy. Well, how do you turn that down?  We ordered a couple starters: Deviled Eggs and the Fried Bread + Butter Pickle Spears. For the main dished we ordered: Shrimp n' Grits, Yardbird Salisbury Steak and Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken. This of course needed some side dishes: Macaroni & Cheese and Skillet Cornbread. 

I know, it sounds like a lot of food but there were three ""well groomed"" foodies sitting at the table and the portions were not as big as she lead us to believe. Overall the food was good; there were some highs and a few lows.  Personally I found the Deviled Eggs to be a little flat, some salt and maybe a touch of heat would have made a world of difference. The fried pickles were good, but the spears made them difficult to manage and they definitely retained a lot of heat; all three of us burned our mouths with the first bite.  The Shrimp n Grits were really good, the grits were creamy, yet held texture and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The Salisbury Steak was delicious. The meat fell apart as you put it into your mouth and it was well pared with trumpet mushrooms and sherry gravy. The Skillet Cornbread had a slower start, it first it was a little too moist and lacked the chew one expects from a decent cornbread, however the more I ate it, the more I enjoyed it. The fresh pieces or corn and jalapeno added an extra layer of flavor that really elevated the dish. The Macaroni & Cheese was nice, Torchio pasta and a creamy artisanal cheese sauce blanketed with a crunchy herb topping (we ordered 2 of these, it was pretty good).  Where the food fell short was the item they pushed the most, the Fried Chicken. This was something that I could easily make at home with my eyes closed and one hand tied behind my back. The crust was bland and unseasoned; the only thing going for it was it stayed crunchy. The chicken didn't weather much better. Although it was moist, it seriously lacked any depth of flavor and desperately cried out for some salt. Even though I enjoyed the majority of the other items we had ordered, I really had a hard time looking past the chicken. 

To wrap this up, I may have set my expectations a little higher than I should have as I was really taken in by the appearance of the restaurant and the sales pitch from the server. In the end I had a good meal with some good people and I enjoyed the Yardbird, but I wasn't amazed as I had hoped to be.",2,0,0

BONE MARROW: 4\/5 - this is some of the best marrow I've ordered because there was significantly more to dish out than many places I've ordered it. The tomato jam added the perfect amount of sweetness to counter the rich of the marrow. The only reason I'm marking it down, because like most places, they never give you enough toast to eat it with. 
GREEN BEANS: 4\/5 - loved the tartness the yogurt added to these. 
Mac and cheese: 4\/5 - smaller portion, but very good!
CORNBREAD: 5\/5 - usually I prefer a sweeter cornbread, but this was really good. 
FRIED GREEN TOMATO BLT: 4\/5 - the tomato was cooked perfectly and I loved he pork belly.
BISCUITS: I was actually too full to even try one, but the family and friends loved these
FRIED CHICKEN: 5\/5 - This was some of the best fried chicken I've had. The coating was crisp and flavorful, and the chicken was juicy and delicious!!! 
SHRIMP AND GRITS: 4\/5 - I loved the grits and sauce...I didn't try the shrimp...but I actually like Lola's a tad better. 

Overall: I really enjoyed the food. I think family style was the way to go, so you could taste a lot, but we had so much food to take home. The atmosphere was nice, and the service was great. I would definitely come back!",4,2,4

My girlfriends and I ordered the ""Mac and Cheese"" ""Corn Bread"" ""Fried Green Tomatoes with Pimento"" ""Maple Bacon Donut"" and of course the ""Fried Chicken""

The Mac and cheese was nothing spectacular, and I always order a Mac and cheese to try out in every resturant I go to. My top places for that is Table 34 and Yard House! Yumm yumm

The Corn Bread had real corn kernels inside the bread with a lime zest whipped butter. The Kernels were rubbery. Didn't taste fresh.

Fried green tomatoes with pimento and bacon need some acidity to the plate. So I added a squeeze of lemon wedge and it tasted better.

The Maple Bacon Donut, ohh so sad.. It was so Doughy and not enough glaze and bacon for the whole donut. We all had one bite and left the other half. They should make 3 mini donuts instead of one large one.

I saved the best for last! The Fried Chicken is definitely the Star on the Menu from our order. Juicy great flavor and breading! It is yummy!!",2,1,0

The hours of operation and location were also very convenient and fit our schedule. Let's get down to what we ordered...

BAR MENU: all drinks came in these cute mason jars. 

Southern Peach - I got this because as I was reading the menu description, it sounded like something I would like. It was a cocktail with lemon, thyme, peach, and sweet tea. However, don't know if it was the aperol or the whiskey...but the whole drink was too strong for me. I guess it's due to the fact that I'm not a heavy drinker at all. I couldn't really enjoy or finish it as much as I would have liked.

Southern Revival - This one claimed to be a Yardbird favorite and was a mixture of whiskey, passion fruit and basil. I took a sip and the taste was too potent for me. My taste buds couldn't handle the sweet and sourness of this one and my tablemate ended up ordering another drink in replacement since she didn't really like it either. She ended up getting The Porkchop and liked that one much better and gave the Revival to our other tablemate.

BRUNCH MENU: we ordered and split some appetizers and the main entrees.

Deviled Eggs - Maybe it was my stomach that day but having cold eggs first thing in the morning didn't sit well with me. The eggs were delicious, however I wasn't a fan.

Fried Green Tomato BLT - I enjoyed this a bit better than the eggs. The pork belly was crisp and the flavorings from the cheese, tomatoes and vinaigrette complimented each other very well.

Classic Buttermilk Biscuits - I don't really care for biscuits and everyone was saying we shouldn't have ordered them because we ended up having too much food that we couldn't finish. The biscuits were alright, nothing special. I did like the house-made jam that came with it though.

Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles - definitely order this as a main entrée. I've never had anything like the chilled spiced watermelon that came with the chicken. It was SOOOO good. The waffles were different too, but I wish I had tried the cheddar cheese waffle WITHOUT the syrup first cause once you mix them - the taste is very interesting. I didn't hate it nor did I like it. All in all I liked this dish the most out of everything we ordered.

Shrimp 'n' Grits - I've never had grits before so this was a new experience for me. I would describe it as oatmeal - it was okay. I couldn't get over the texture and I kept thinking about it as I was chewing so that probably caused me to not particularly enjoy it. I did like the shrimp it came with, they were delicious, just no to the grits for me.

I don't remember the name of our server, but she was very friendly and nice. Upon knowing that it was my first time in Vegas, she started suggesting all these things for me to do and see. It seemed like she really wanted to make my experience here as fun and as enjoyable as possible, so I really appreciated that she went out of her way to do that. We had excellent service thanks to her and it made for a nice brunch and a great way to start off the day.",11,6,9
1968059,OjKtO2CIQl8BZkGX9A91tA,HH7iiWvBqV-20lA7JlSRWQ,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,5,2017-05-19,"Late 2011, I was reading a culinary trade publication article which referenced the opening of Chef John McInnis' Yardbird Southern Table & Bar in Miami.  I kept this restaurant in mind as my husband is a fried chicken-loving man.  Alas, the closest that I got to Miami since 2011 was a visit to Atlanta, GA on business so, Yardbird got put to the back of my mind.

However, since I joined Yelp (late 2013) and continued reading culinary news, it was exciting to find Yardbird had opened in Las Vegas, NV.  Yelp friends began submitting reviews and my taste buds were further excited and Las Vegas is a closer destination for us.  

Knowing how popular this restaurant is, I made reservations through Open Table a week before coming to LV.  The restaurant is located just outside of the Venetian Resort's Casino (near cashier) and start of the restaurant row. 

We were quickly checked in and seated by the lovely and friendly hostess.  Our server came by to deliver menus, describe their specialties of the house and take our beverage orders (Hubs:  Teneya Creek Hefeweisen & Me:  Icky IPA).  Meanwhile, I was starting to feel my ""camera call"" and tried to be as stealth as possible while enjoying the energetic vibes and relaxed Southern Rustic décor.  As I sat back down, the following exchange occurred.

""Are you a gambling gal?"" Asked a man dressed in black as an opening line. 
ME:  Yes, why?
HIM:  If you can tell me how many jars are in the ceiling light fixture, I'll give you a free dessert of your choice.  BUT, you only have 5 seconds to give me an answer.                           
ME:  Ok, as I looked upward and started counting rows and columns while multiplying in my mind""....uh, the 5 seconds were up and I gave my answer which was totally WRONG! 
HIM:  Well, just for playing, I'll still give you dessert...you ought to try the Peach Cobbler and advised to order it when placing our dinner order.  He left a dessert menu on our table then he walked away.

Wow!  We felt so special and welcomed by such gracious Southern charm.  I didn't see anyone else getting this awesome treatment (although, I'm sure there were others).  We were certainly thankful for this additional treat.

Our server, Mandy, returned with our beverages and I inquired who that man was...she said, aw, he's our manager, Randy.  She also said that he had told her to comp our dessert for playing.   We placed our food orders.

SMALL PLATE & SHAREABLE:
Smoked & Roasted Bone Marrow served with onion marmalade & toasted country bread $11. It's not as weird as it sounds but it's rich ""meat butter"".  Its silky, savory, fatty and ""nutty"" characteristics blew us away.  Even though my cholesterol levels probably jumped tens of points, it was worth it!

FROM THE GARDEN:  
Charred okra in browned butter, sprinkled with Cotija and lemon juice $10.  Impressive charring and preparation which minimized the typical sliminess.  The salty Cotija cheese was like the American South's version of a fine Reggiano Parmesan.

MAMA'S BISCUITS:
Classic Buttermilk with honey butter and house made jam, 4\/order $7.  Light, airy and flaky rolled biscuits that makes you appreciate great authentic home cooking of the South.

THE BIRD:
Llewelyn's Fine Fried Chicken - 1\/2 of Yardbird's famous bird served with honey hot sauce.  $26.  All 4 pieces (White & dark) were flavorful, juicy and generously portioned.  The seasoning or brine of this bird was mouthwatering and IF we only came here for the fried chicken without ordering the other sides, I think I could've eaten the whole order.  Oops! I admit that I'm an ""oinker"" in the chicken coop.

DESSERT:
Peach Cobbler - marzipan crumble, French vanilla ice cream, Florentine almond cookie bowl and cinnamon twist (Comped $15).  Thank you, Randy, for your hospitality and amiability.  I'm already fan of American desserts but Yardbird's version of Peach Cobbler tickled my fancy.  As full as I was, I almost couldn't stop eating this dessert.

After paying our bill, we went to thank Randy for his hospitality and wished him well on his upcoming trip to Singapore as Opening Manager.  He graciously showed us Yardbird's private dining room\/event room and ""sister"" restaurant, Chica (Latin cuisine), also owned and founded by John Kunkel.

I returned after a few messages back and forth with the owner of the restaurant.  Not expecting anything except a better experience, we (my husband and I) booked a reservation for Saturday's supper hour (they call it ""supper"" on the menu listing and not ""dinner"", holding true to that southern charm).  I didn't say anything at the hostess counter except for my name and time slot.  The manager sat us at a table near the kitchen were I could peer around the corner to take a decent look at the setup.  Our server was fantastic and made sure we were never without the entire evening.

The kitchen is open to the public eye, showing off a pristine work area, bustling cooks, and chefs.  Even their coffee area located behind a swing door could be viewed when servers flipped by, showing a very neat and tight space.  Nothing stayed at the window for more than 60 seconds, if even that.  All the servers delivered plates with thumbs underneath the plate rather than on top of it.  No wrapper from the fork and knife were left on any tables, nor were water glasses even half empty.  Overall, the kitchen and service are impeccable.

The food started to come out, first course-our french fries with bacon salt and a buttermilk dipping sauce that had even more bacon on top.  I love that they recycle old menus as the paper on their side dish plates.  It adds to that home feel.  The fries were crispy, airy, and the bacon salt adds a unique flavor to the potatoes.  When dipped in the buttermilk and eaten with the bacon crumble and salt, it's truly heaven.  Their bacon salt is smoky and captures that bacon flavor so well.  It took less than 2 minutes to down this pan of fries.


Our food arrived no less than five minutes later.  This time, instead of watermelon and a waffle, I opted for the 2 things I love-biscuits and chicken.  The famous Lewellyn's fried chicken sat on the left, while the biscuits were cut in half, topped with pepper jelly, and a piece of boneless fried chicken right in there.  It's served with housemade pickles and onions.  Trust me-adding both of those into this biscuit makes this sandwich amazing.  The contrast of sweet and spicy jelly, the salty, chicken goodness, then the bite of pickles and pickled onions is absolute heaven.  It's incredibly simple, incredibly easy you may think, but those biscuits are on another level.  The chicken here takes a brine swim for a few days-and not in buttermilk.  They're then coated and pressure fried to perfection.  The chicken is very juicy, extremely tender, flavorful, and that coating packs a punch.  I recall saying I would not pay the $26 for their chicken.  I take it back.  I'm definitely going back for more.  Plates emptied, we had to order dessert, and instead of the oreos we ate last time, we opted for the bacon butterscotch cake with pecan filling, bourbon ice cream, and butterscotch sauce.


Let me start by saying that the cake is Vegas-sized, and every table around us noticed this giant being brought to the table.  Heads turned-that's how big this mammoth mountain of cake goodness is.  I dove right in, letting each layer fall from the tip, gathering it all up with butterscotch sauce and a dollop of bourbon ice cream.  It's served cold with this crazy icing and pecan filling that isn't too sweet, then that salty, sweet, butterscotch goodness mixed with the bourbon ice cream is one of the perfect sweet bites I had in a long time.  Don't worry-the cake isn't filled with bits of bacon, so don't be afraid of this.  Love it.  Love it so much to set a calendar reminder to eat one every Saturday morning at brunch.

I said back in March ""the food was good but I am still searching for my Perfect Fried Chicken in Las Vegas"".  After a redo meal at Yardbird, I have to say that this place is the restaurant for Southern cuisine and has one of the best fried chicken dishes in Vegas.  It's not just the food that impresses-it's the Southern hospitality.  Yardbird is more than just a restaurant-it's an experience.",1,0,1

Get their deviled eggs!  It's a little heavy on the pickle-y side, but overall super tasty!  Tastes like a regular deviled eggs, but flavors are amped up.  I've tried other deviled eggs where they try to be super creative and different by adding all these other ingredients only to disappoint and not knock my socks off.  Kudos to Yardbird on their awesome eggs!  

Tomatoes and ricotta, blistered tomatoes with sea salt, chili oil.. other stuff on top of ricotta.  This was Pinky's favorite, he loved the flavors of this dish.  As for me, I liked the semi cooked tomatoes with the hint of salt and sweetness, but the ricotta was not my cup of tea.  I just found the cheese to be way too grainy for my tastes.  Also, what chili oil?  I felt zero heat!  

Fried chicken, we opted to just get the half fried chicken without all the fixins.  The chicken was seasoned wonderfully, super moist with just enough salt in the meat.  However, we were unimpressed by the skin.  When you think of fried chicken, you imagine crispy skin coating juicy meat underneath.  The skin of our chicken was pretty soggy, as if they had kept it covered or left it sitting for a while after cooking.  Sorry, but Popeyes, Church's, and Korean fried chicken are better than Yardbird's chicken in our opinion, solely based on the lack of crispy skin.  

I would come back however, I saw that they had shrimp and grits on the menu that looked pretty intriguing... but if anything, I'd come back for drinks and 2 orders of deviled eggs.",1,1,2

Deviled eggs are hit in this pace too and the green fried tomatoes ... Worth every cent all of it,1,0,0

First meal during this past Vegas trip. We dropped by for dinner on Wednesday, July 8th around 8:30pm. No reservation and a party of 5. We were seated right away.

Drinks:
*Watermelon sling: High west silver oak whiskey, fresh pressed watermelon juice & fresh lemon with aperol ($14)
*Southern revival: sweet and sour featuring wild turkey 81, passion fruit, basil ($14)
*Yardbird old fashioned: bacon-infused buffalo trace bourbon, angostura bitters, orange bitters, maple syrup ($15)
*Albert's collins: absolut, Avion reposado and spring 44 old tom gin ($15)
*Df evocation ($7)

After drinking all day, I could only stomach a cocktail. My choice of the Watermelon sling was perfect. Light and easy to drink. I nursed this the whole dinner.

Food:
*Deviled eggs: fresh chive, smoked trout roe 'redneck caviar' ($11)
*Bbq pork belly: 4oz house pork belly, sherry apple glaze, sliced pickle salad ($14)
*Iceberg wedge: crisp iceberg lettuce, fresh corn, tomatoes, house-smoked bacon, avocado, gaba goo dressing ($14)
*St Louis style pork ribs: tender slow-cooked, house bbq sauce ($32)
*Shrimp n' grits: Florida shrimp, crisp Virginia ham, Nora mill granary grits ($28)
*Chicken 'n' watermelon 'n' waffles: yardbird's signature 'old school fried chicken', honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, cheddar cheese chow chow waffle, bourbon maple syrup ($36 +$8 one thigh)
*Skillet cornbread: cheddar, bacon, jalapeno, maple butter ($9)
*Macaroni & cheese: torchio pasta, five artisanal cheeses, crispy herb crust ($10)

My favorite dish was the mac and cheese. Just the perfect amount of creaminess and crustiness. I finished off the dish since I liked it so much. Second fav was the shrimp and grits. The grits were kind of chunky with I enjoyed. The shrimp tender and flavorful. Of course I had to get a salad. Not the best wedge salad I've had. Felt like the corn made it too busy, but it added the refreshing element I needed when eating all the heavy food.

The found the mains of ribs and chicken okay. They were a little dry in my opinion. But with the chicken, I'm normally a thigh fan and ended up with a breast, so that may have been the reason. I did like the flavor of the breading though. That's what I get for eating slowly and grabbing a piece of chicken last! The deviled eggs were creamy and huge, but I felt the addition of roe just added an unnecessary fishiness. And the pork belly was waaay too tough and sweet.

Dessert
*'Crunch 'n munch' bread pudding, popcorn ice cream, caramel popcorn, pretzel ($10)

I only took a bit of this since we ordered dessert. I'm not a huge chocolate fan or bread pudding fan, so I didn't care for this at all.

This was probably a case of ordering too much of the wrong dishes. I probably would have enjoyed the bone marrow versus some of the other apps we got. But I believe the fried chicken was good. It was just a shame that I got the wrong kind of piece. But the mac and cheese redeemed it all for me. 3.5 rounded up to 4 stars!",9,8,8

We returned the two days later a day after our terrible valenversary at Table 10. The manager Sarah remembered us and was extremely friendly. We told her how much we loved the food and wish we would've came there for our valenversary. She surprised us with the 30 min peach cobbler we ordered with a candle to wish us a happy belated valenversary. She was outstanding. We plan to return and compare other restaurants chicken and service to this Yardbird and Sarah. Outstanding place with DELICIOUS food!!! We ordered the chicken n watermelon n waffle and the dulce de leche waffle for brunch. The second time we ordered again the chicken n watermelon n waffle with Mac and cheese! I want more at this very moment. Actually at every moment I am hungry! I need Yardbird in my neighborhood. I would eat there every day if I could!!!,0,0,0

This was my 1st trip to Yardbird....and I loved it. 
My daughter took me here on Sunday 9\/3 for lunch. We arrived about 4:30 and was promptly seated. The gentleman that seated us was very friendly so it started off the vibe nicely. 

She has been here before so she knew of the blue plate which is not on the menu. We   both ordered that W\/ (White Meat Only). It's  2 pieces of chicken and a biscuit. 
It was so good. They put 4 lil cubes of watermelon on the plate as well. Very tasty. 
The biscuit melts in your mouth. The Chicken was HOT and crispy, perfectly seasoned. I also ordered a side of french fries which is also not on the menu. 
They serve the fries with the best dipping sauce ever. I should've asked what it was. Next time I go there I will ask, because I can't wait to go back and taste everything on the menu. 
After tasting some more things on the menu I'm sure it'll be five stars after my next visit. 
Our server was nice. Ambience is nice.

For whatever reason, it took a few months us to finally go, but it was my birthday, and as good of as a reason as ever. We just recently went again for the second time for a friends birthday, and Yardbird has definitely solidified itself as one of my favorite restaurants on the strip.

A quick tip for those coming in for the first time. I think it's a lot easier to come into the The Palazzo parking garage off Spring Mountain. When you park, there's elevators that take you right up into the casino, then a short walk through the area with the big fountain, and Yardbird is right there. For me, that garage seems a lot easier to access, and it's almost never full either.

Anyhow, the restaurant itself is pretty cool. A bit smaller than you would expect, but we recently found out they have a little private dining area as well. It, like the rest of the restaurant has a lot of homey, classic southern style decor. Lots of wood, old pictures, and the private room has a wall full of liquors and a view of the wine cellar. They also have a nice section of the wall with a hidden TV that rotates pictures of musicians. If you have a large party to eat with here, definitely ask if that room is available. It makes for an even more enjoyable experience.

Now, the menu at Yardbird is pretty stout. It might seem small at first glance, especially since only one page is dedicated to food...but there's a lot of options, and the portions are huge. Their food is meant to be shared, so order up and have at it family style. 

So far, we've only been for brunch, but I think we've had just about everything on that menu besides the salads. Out of the 5 starter small plates, the only thing we haven't tried is the pork, but everything else is spectacular. Stand outs for me are the Fried Green Tomato BLT and the Mama's Chicken Biscuits. Both on the pricey side at $14, but worth every cent. And that's not to take away from the Deviled Egg's or Chicken Liver Toast either, which are equally impressive, and even quite a bit cheaper.

Moving on to the main dishes, you can't not mention the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles. Yes, it's $36...but if you're idea of eating good involves chain restaurants and fast food, you shouldn't be here anyway. Not to mention, it easily serves 3 or 4 people, maybe more depending on what else you order. The chicken is absolutely amazing. Crispy, crunchy, but still tender and juicy. Their cheddar cheese waffles are unbelievable, and they serve them with this green tomato pepper jam stuff that ties everything in for a taste bud party. And I'm not even a watermelon fan...at all...but I enjoy their spiced watermelon served alongside it as well. 

The Shrimp n' Grits is another stand out for main dishes. A large bowl of creamy grits, topped with large, juicy shrimp, and little crispy bits of ham make for an excellent breakfast. It's another higher cost plate at $28, but even it can be shared with at least 2 people no problem.

A lot of there smaller items off their ""Odds and Ends"" menu are great too. First time visits, I'd suggest ordering the Macaroni & Cheese and Skillet Cornbread. And when you're done with all that, look right over to the right for dessert items. Since I've never had something there I didn't like, I'd say go for it all. The Mini Bacon Doughnuts, Chess Pie, Hickory Smoked Chocolate Coffee Cake and Cinnamon Apple Hand Pies are all excellent choices. 

My one and only biggest gripe with Yardbird is not so much the service itself, as it's almost always excellent, but both times we've been here, they have forgotten dishes. Our first time here, they completely left out an order of Deviled Eggs. This past visit they forgot to bring out an order of Shrimp n' Grits, so one of our party had to exit the room and go ask for it. Then when it came time to order dessert, they completely forgot an order of the bread budding. Luckily we were all pretty much at breaking point, but it's irritating to say the least. Especially when this place specializes on family style eating and having guests order multiple plates. To be honest, I'm not even 100% sure if we paid for the missing items on either visit either. 

When all is said and done though, Yardbird is seriously one of the most enjoyable and memorable places to eat. It's not crazy expensive for what you get, and if you come with a group of people, the experience is even that much better, and your bill will be cheaper to split. On both occasions we've spent close to $300, but that's for big parties of 8 or more, and with tip. There's not many places you can spend about $30-$40 per person while getting that much food and being able to sample that many items. 

Trust me, the bird is the word.",8,4,7

We shared a few dishes based on Yelp reviews and our waitress's recommendations:
- chicken liver toasts
- house cut fries
- short rib and grits
- chicken 'n watermelon 'n waffles
- bacon butterscotch cake

We were promptly seated and given menus. 30 seconds later our waiter wanted out drink order. We asked for water and more time with the cocktail menu. He came back just a minute or 2 later. We hurried up and ordered drinks and he asked for our food order at the same time and mentioned they were out of 3-4 menu items (despite it only being 7:30pm). We asked for more time. We rushed through the menu and when he came back 2 minutes later, we quickly chose what we'd order. We ordered an appetizer, fried chicken, and a side. 

Honestly, less than 5 minutes later all of our food came out at once - quicker than McDonalds (meant in a really bad way in case you're a McD fan). And our drinks didn't arrive for another 10 minutes after that. Our entire dinner was extremely rushed.  

It's not some casual business lunch place where speediness is expected and appreciated. I was on a date with my fiancé after a long day at work and we wanted to enjoy some good food and a couple drinks. It's obvious they just wanted to get you in and out and turn over the tables. 

It wasn't just our table - after receiving their food, the table next to us ordered another entree and more drinks. The waiter appeared obviously peeved that they were staying longer.  We laughed about how ridiculous the service was. My fiancé and I decided not to stay for another drink or dessert.",1,0,0

The service? Wow. We unfortunately encountered a piece of fried chicken that was raw (red, bloody raw). But not only did they bring us a fresh dish or chicken, they comped the dish and the manager gave us a very sincere apology.

+gluten free fried chicken

Really wanted to try this place the last few times I've been in Vegas. While I note 3 stars for having gluten free fried chicken, the chicken itself was horrible. Dry, way to spicy, and had no real crunch. I've made better gluten free chicken at home cheaper than $30. 

The service was great at first then quickly lead to a downhill battle of when would he get the check, etc back and forth. This is another typical ""dress up the inside real nice"" and attract the tourists spot, at least in my opinion or experience when I went. 

They also take 30+ extra minutes for the gluten free chicken which was the reason I went. However next time I'll find a better spot. A+ for effort though, I appreciate any restaurant giving gluten free patrons a substitute.",5,0,2

We split the chicken and waffles which is their claimed specialty. Perfectly crispy seasoned chicken and cheese waffles. Bourbon maple syrup was the perfect compliment! My only food complaint with this dish was that the waffles were not crispy. Served with creamy cheesy mac & cheese and marinated watermelon cubes..both tasty!
Ambiance was barn bistro counter(complete with hard on your booty metal stools), prices were above expectation($36 for chicken & waffles?!? This is peasant food peeps!) service was spotty though we sat at the bar, so we had higher expectations.

Sat at the bar, and was ignored by a pair of bartenders, a white man and woman who seemed more interested in flirting with each other than serving me, handing me a menu, or even making eye contact, despite the man passing by me more than once. A second bar patron sat next to me with a Bouchon bag, and I decided to take my leave.

LOCATION: Located inside of the Venetian on ""restaurant row"" it's not in the actual mall area but follow the signs in the casino for ""restaurant row"" and you'll see it.

ATMOSPHERE: Definitely felt like a place I would see in the south with very low lighting, mason jar chandeliers and open kitchen.  There's a lounge\/bar type area with low couches for happy hour and then there are regular high top tables and booths.  Definitely trendy enough for a birthday dinner or date.

WAIT: We came at 4:45pm (made reservations online although they weren't needed) and there was no wait. I'm sure as the night progresses it gets more crowded.  Most people were at the bar\/lounge area.

FOOD: We just got the fried chicken by itself which is the same portion as the chicken waffle but no waffle.  It comes with 4 pieces (breast, thigh, wing and drumstick) so a mix of dark and white meat.  The meat itself is very tasty and tender, juicy and not dry.  The coating isn't super crumbly and was more on the soft\/smooth side.  It didn't quite have the crunch I was looking for but the flavor was fantastic.  That definitely saved it.  It's more like a fish and chips coating where it's one solid piece around the meat instead of like at Popeyes where it's very crunchy and crumbly.

Overall, a great place for some fried chicken.  It is a little on the pricier side and I wish we had tried some of their other dishes!",2,1,1

The main things we get and highly recommend at your visit are: buffalo bourbon with bacon Bloody Mary; fried green tomatoes; mamas chicken biscuits; and watermelon chicken and waffles. All great items! The green tomatoes are my favorite and have great taste, they really hit the spot. If you choose any of these items you won't go wrong.

We were seated quickly and promptly greeted by our server. He took our drink order as we perused the rest of the menu. I opted to go for two small plates ordering the house fries and the crispy chicken Mama's Biscuit. 

The fries came out first and were the perfect snack after sitting in a seminar all day. The bacon salt offers the right oomph to take the average fry to the next level.

Green tomato BLT (good, but too much batter on green tomato, making the dish heavier than it should be)

The chicken is ridiculously good and seasoned to perfection. Moreover the tenderness was unbelievable and so we plan on taking a trip soon to return.

It's really good eats here... if it was the Olympics and this was 1976.... gold-medal-10s across the board-- Nadia Comaneci good. This place is a stupendous. 

The skillet cornbread was the best ever and serving it in an iron skillet was awesome and it was crispy but not dried out; it's a little spicy though. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the best fried chicken I've tasted ever. The ribs were fall-of-the-bone delicious and nothing short of irreproducible. Dry rub and no need for a table-side BBQ sauce bath. With and without sauce, still amazing. The coleslaw had a citrus twang that I miss already.

Ambiance could be a bit noisy--likely the patrons k'velling over the food. More likely though, incoming calls from prisons across the world, with last meal requests pouring in. [For those prone to political bristle,re-lax...the last meal before being.....re-leased. Ok.] You might need to raise your voice a tad and strain  your ear to hear every so often.

The food was so good, that I got an order to go, stored in the hotel refrigerator, and brought it right onto the plane next day. I was careful to mark the styrofoam with my name on it. It took my last scintilla of self control to not retrieve it from the overhead storage mid flight and chomp it down right then and there.

Blackberry Lemonade, made with bourbon, such an amazing balance of bourbon and sweetness- I could literally drink gallons of this. No problem.

Prices are reasonable, and most portions are meant to be shared between 2-4 people. I dig the large mason jar lighting fixture in the main dining room, and the overall modern-farmhouse theme.

DEVILED EGGS: A simple hit, classic dish with fun presentation. Trout roe is a nice touch, portion of four egg halves is $10.
FARMERS SALAD: There's another hardboiled egg here among the greens, along with a parmesan crisp and a Vidalia onion vinaigrette. Definitely order at least one salad if you're sharing entrees as a group, to balance out the heavier, greasier dishes.
SMOKED BRISKET SANDWICH: An interesting take with pickled veggies, and melted swiss but minimal, understated barbecue sauce. Not a favorite at the table, though it was loaded up with plenty of meat.
CHILLED WATERMELON: Fun jenga-style presentation but underwhelming flavors. Seasoning was too subtle and what was there was unbalanced and not complementary to the natural sweetness of the fruit.
SHRIMP & GRITS: Easily the best dish at the table, with an ample, saucy portion of Nora Mill Granary grits topped with chopped Virginia ham and perfectly-cooked Florida shrimp. There wasn't a drop of this left.
LLEWELYN'S FINE FRIED CHICKEN: Mixed feelings around the table about this. Thin batter, crispy skin, moist meat, but it didn't really wow anyone. We couldn't put our finger on why. Lacked the crunch and flavor expected for Southern-style chicken. Wasn't bad, just wasn't particularly good, either.

They were not friendly and made me want to go somewhere else. Bartenders should know if you treat people that sit at your bar with kindness you will get tipped. Otherwise people won't tip or they will go elsewhere. Which is what I did, I went to double helix bar and got the type of treatment I was looking for. Smiles, friendliness, and great service. I wasn't ignored. I won't be going back to yardbird nor will I recommend it to anyone else. Not even the bar area.",0,1,0

The place was packed and we stalked two people at the bar till they were finished to get two seats. 

On their recommendation we ordered the fried green tomatoes. AMAZING!!! Then we split the short ribs and fried chicken. BEST DECISION EVER!!! The meal was worth the atmosphere, and was worth every Vegas penny. Will for sure go back again.

My server Matt made awesome recommendations and when I told him I prefer dark meat fried chicken because I usually find white meat dry, he brought me out a chicken breast with my order just for me to try. So right there, the dude won major points!

As for the food....lord have mercy! The deviled eggs were tasty. Nothing to write home about but not disappointing. But the goddamn mac-n-cheese and fried chicken?!?!?? Let me just say this, if I did a armed bank robbery with the mac-n-cheese and chicken, and we all got caught, I would plead guilty and take the rap, these things are so amazing. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and moist (yeah I hate that word too). The mac n'cheese appetizer is perfectly sized and the mix of cheese that's both baked & ""liquidy"" is excellent.

Cauliflower mashed potatoes: First time having them and I don't think I'll ever go back to regular potatoes.

My husband got a bacon cheese burger, because you just can't get too much bacon. They put little black caviar in the deviled eggs which really makes them taste unique. The angus steak burnt ends were mixed with some spicey red  peppers which really made those grits come in handy. The grits weren't as creamy as the ones that you get with shrimp and grits, but they did help tame the spiciness of the burnt ends. I did enjoy the meal.

It's not a bad place, but it faces so much impossible competition on the Strip. I understand that the big star of the show is the brined chicken, and yes, it was good. Bursting with flavor, sufficiently moist, really tasty. But small portions, exorbitant price for fried chicken which one tries to rationalize away by repeating the mantra, ""You voluntarily decided to eat at a major hotel\/casino on the Strip"", while trying to slow down one's eating to make those limited pieces of chicken last as long as possible. Bone marrow was on point too, but other places in the area also make the exact same dish at the exact same price point while throwing in some greens on the side. The drinks were fine, but I feel sorry for the person who is responsible for the ""hand cut ice"" they proudly boast on the menu. Does hand-cut ice taste different than machine-cut ice? Am I just too plebian in my understanding of haute cuisine to understand the significance of elbow grease-infused ice vs. ice cut by cold, unfeeling Cyberdyne machines?

HOWEVER! I have to give a special shout-out to the peach cobbler. We ordered it at the beginning of our meal since the menu said it takes about half an hour to make - and were so glad we did. It was DIVINE, and more than enough for two. A delightfully crumbly yet dense layer on top, warm and sweet peaches inside, accompanied by ice cream, a caramel 'cone', etc... it was just awesome. I would not come back for the chicken, but I sure would come back for the dessert. That, and the nice service, is what earns Yardbird a 4 vs. a 3-star rating from little ol' me.",5,3,5

The place was a little less than half full at 10:30am, but by the time we left at noon, the place was packed. So I'd definitely make a reservation or come early!

Seconds after being escorted to our table, our waitress appeared. She was friendly and explained the menu\/concept to us as this was our first time here.Throughout our time at the restaurant, she was very attentive which was great. Other staff bringing our food and refilling our beverages were wonderful as well. 

Food was amazing! Everything on the menu sounded good, so I wasn't sure what to order. Decided on the fried green tomato BLT to start, followed by Lewellyn's fine fried chicken, mac & cheese, and mama's classic buttermilk biscuits. Although I had no complaints about any of the food ordered and enjoyed everything I ate, my favorite dish had to be the fried green tomato BLT (3\/order). The tomato wasn't too thick or thin, wasn't overly coated with breading, and was crispy. I enjoyed the pimento cheese and tomato jam, with each tomato having just the right amount of each. The smoked pork belly on top was the icing on the cake. There was a generous piece on top of each fried green tomato. Everything on this BLT went well with each other. So good! 

Lewellyn's fine fried chicken is half a chicken, so it's meant to be shared family-style. This dish came with a breast and a mix of wings, legs, and thighs. Depending on how hungry you are, it can be shared between 2-3 people. It was crispy, not oily, and had great flavor to it. The honey hot sauce was a good dipping sauce for the dish, but wasn't necessary. It could have been spicier, though. The mac & cheese again was good. With 5 cheese, it was creamy, but not overly cheesy. Mama's classic buttermilk biscuits (4\/order) didn't disappoint.These biscuits were hot, fluffy, and moist. Although they didn't need them, spreading the honey butter and house-made jam onto them made them taste that much better.

I also tried their '77 Elvis pancakes, which I surprisingly enjoyed. I'm not a huge fan of pancakes, but these were tasty! The chocolate chip pancakes were fluffy, not dense. Loved the banana compote and that there was a generous amount of it. Drizzled with the bourbon maple syrup and PB, this was one good dish. I only had a couple bites, but definitely could have eaten it all by myself.

Food and service here was excellent. The only thing I didn't understand was why the drinks were so expensive. Yes this is Vegas. Yes Yardbird is located in the Venetian. However, $6 soft drinks and a $17 bloody mary is kind of insane. Save your money for the food and wash everything down with some water!",9,4,7

In the beginning the service was alright as they put us into a awkward 10 seated table with a round table on the edge. The situation was awkward so we had them reset the entire table which they were more than happy to do for us. Doesn't really explain why they didn't do that in the first place since they took a while to set up our table.... Next we were informed by the waitress that she could make our meals for us as in we'll just give her the criteria and she'll proceed with it. This is good because we had some pretty indecisive people in our group and we ended up getting almost everything we wanted to try. Great experience overall and I love that the meals are shared with everybody so everyone got to try everything.

The food quality itself is sort of an adapted taste though. Due to the nature of this restaurant, they tend to put a lot of cheese on everything. I personally do not prefer cheese most of the time. But I would feel that they would remove it upon request.",1,1,1

Honestly, I saw that Tyoko wrote a review and thought, ok, I know her, I will try it out! It was semi confusing to get to just because it was in the Venetian and that place was big. We did reserve a table via, Open Table, and after a few wrong turns we found the spot! It was really cute inside. Open, high and low top tables, nice decor, pictures of famous old musicians on the wall. I will say that there was a slide show of musicians where we were seated, but the slide show didn't have a ton of pictures, it repeated a lot. I know that is petty, but if we were there for an hour, every 5 minutes the slideshow repeated, it got boring. 

As I am sitting back in Pittsburgh writing this I am still fondly looking back at the amazing meal that we had. My mouth waters at the salad and entrees, and I wish there was one closer so I could go and maybe try out a dessert or a drink. The food was really good for our only one splurge of the trip. I would say, it was delish and would urge people to try it out. It was expensive The two $$ is a little bit of a stretch. We got two meals and a side salad and it was over $100.  I would say it is more like $$$ than $$. But it was worth it!

Salad: 
Iceberg Wedge: baby iceberg lettuce, charred corn, heirloom tomatoes, house-smoked bacon, avocado, house-made buttermilk ranch dressing. How the heck can a salad be so freaking good? This, and I even cringe thinking about it, ICEBURG lettuce, salad was probably my favorite thing that we ordered, side wise. The tomatoes were so sweet you would have thought they were candied and that house-smoked bacon was more like pork belly than bacon and was just magnificent. We fought over this salad. The dressing, honestly was just as fresh tasting as the rest of the salad. We fought over this salad...it was that good.  

Side:
Macaroni & Cheese: torchio pasta, five artisanal cheeses, crispy herb crust. Honestly, this mac and cheese was just eh. I thought that the noodles were over done and the crispy herb crust tasted just like plain breadcrumbs. I wasn't impressed and wouldn't get it again. Chris thought it was ok. But still meh....and for the price and the size of the plate, its a hard pass for me. 

Meals:
Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken: 1\/2 of our famous bird served with honey hot sauce. This was just a plate of fried chicken. BOY was it a huge plate though. The hot sauce was really good too. I enjoyed dipping the chicken into this a lot. My friend, his dish, thought that the chicken should have been done a little more. He enjoys a more crispier crunch to his chicken. I can see where he is coming from. It was still really good and TOO MUCH. We had leftovers for days. 

Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles: honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrup. OK, the same thing that I wrote about the chicken above goes for this one. I really loved it. I thought that it was done perfectly, but wouldn't have minded more crunch to the chicken myself. I thought that the hot sauce stole the show. The bourbon maple syrup, to me, tasted like straight bourbon. It smelled like bourbon and when you dipped anything it in, it was like a shot. I would pass on this dish just because of that reason. The waffle was good. It was not as crispy as I like my waffles usually nor did it have a really strong cheddar cheese taste to it. I was expecting more from this dish. While good, it was all together, meh. The watermelon too was just meh. It was spiced I think with just mint. Nothing fancy, and for the price of the dish I would have liked more than 6 squares of watermelon. 

Overall, I had a good time here and would have liked to try more things than just the chicken. we realized our mistake when we got the dish and kicked ourselves for not ordering different things so we could try more. I would say, try it if you want, but if the menu seems to meh, there are a ton of other places to go in Vegas.",3,0,4

The portions for some of the plates are quite big, they had suggested that dishes should be shared. 

I ended up getting the brisket biscuits which were very good! I loved the BBQ sauce and it was the perfect size, very much like sliders. In addition,  I ended up getting the cauliflower mash, they were delicious! If someone didn't tell me they were made from cauliflower, I wouldn't have been able to tell. 

I ended up getting two whiskey's as well, which I loved. One was Oban ( a fav) and another was their own Whiskey made in Vegas, though it was pricey $30! It was not a big pour at all like the waiter said. In addition this place is known for the Whiskey and Bourbons etc. the waiter was not knowledgeable at all, he had to ask the bartender.

Moist, tender, and a nice crispy skin that is oh so good. Their hot sauce is also tasty and not really spicy at all (mild at best), so you can indulge without having a glass of milk on standby.

Did I mention that it is a HUGE chicken? They claim their chickens are free range and steroid free, but I will need to see a drug test, lol. Unless these Yardbirds spent all day lifting weights, I don't know how they are so big. Nevertheless, it is plenty of chicken and a decent value.

We also had the cornbread and the blistered tomatoes. I liked the cornbread​, but then​ tomatoes were a miss for me flavor wise.

Finally, desert here is equally enormous and delicious. The salted caramel bread pudding was fantastic, and the butterscotch cake was enormous and easily could have been for 2 people.",1,1,1

If I had any complaint it was that the noise level almost prohibited normal conversation. That said, the food was wonderful. 

Found this quite by accident. I did a Google search for something and this came up as an advertisement,  hubby's been wanting fried chicken, we're in Vegas and eating stuff I shouldn't so why not. It's located in the restaurant row of the Venetian and you should make sure to have a reservation because it gets crowded.

Our server was a very nice young man who took time to explain the menu. Food is served family style and the menu says everything serves 2-4 people. Our server said he always suggested that people order two entrees but believe me for normal appetites would be way too much food.  As it was we couldn't eat all we ordered. 

We started with biscuits, we thought they would come with the meal.  I'm sure they had a whole pound of butter in the four we were served and there was a jar of apple jelly and a jar of honey butter.  We managed to each eat one.  The. We shared an iceberg lettuce salad that came with tomatoes, avocado, fried pork belly cubes and an amazing dressing. Again we couldn't eat all of it.  Our main course was chicken and waffles.  OMG, to die for. The chicken was perfectly cooked and those waffles, well I could eat them every day. They had cheddar cheese inside and came with a bourbon maple syrup. I just ate mine plain. Who needed syrup. There was also some huge cubes of watermelon which was pickled and while it sounds strange tasted really good.  It was a half a chicken and of course couldn't finish that either.  Because I love grits I ordered a side of cheesy grits and alas, they were pretty mediocre. Only down side of the meal.  Wish we could have taken the leftovers home with us.

While there were a couple of very expensive entrees, the chicken was very affordable. I had wine, hubby had tea and the entire bill was only $100.  Not bad for a fine meal.",0,1,1

The menu is interesting since none of the main entrees come automatically with sides - everything is a la carte, I think that part threw us off since a few of us wanted to split dinner, normal assumption is entree comes with 1-2 sides.

I really wish we had more chicken, it was like the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life, HANDS DOWN. Didn't need any sauce or herb added to it, just straight up amazing. The beans?! Oh my goodness they were delicious too! Maybe a tad bit too salty for my taste, but nonetheless, those were inhaled entirely too. 

I decided to go with their house Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade too. So tasty! They have an enormous bourbon list [figures], so when\/if I return to Vegas it might be worth to stop and try some.

Fried green tomato BLT - do it! The pimento cheese is perfect and the tomatoes are well done.
Kale salad with Vermont cheddar, apples raisins and balsamic. It's a good salad and perfectly fresh. Ours was a bit over dressed. Perhaps ask for dressing on the side?
Chicken biscuit sliders with pepper jelly - the idea is delicious. The combination, however, was dry. The tenders were the primary dryness culprit.
Cocktail- southern revival. I despise grapefruit but this has changed my view. It's dangerous, addictive, and refreshing. Highly recommend.
We ordered extra pepper jelly and it fixed its chewability. The pepper jelly is sweet with a small kick at the back.

The layout and decor of the restaurant was super charming. The service was PERFECT...and from an experience perspective, I would say it was five stars. 

We had a nice variety to eat. I started with the Georgia Peach cocktail, and thought it was wonderful. It was a slightly liquor forward drink, and the peach really helped sweeten up the alcohol. I would definitely recommend it!

We had a couple appetizers. The deviled eggs stole the show for me. Piled atop with the most delicious yolk mixture - salty, savory, decadent. I would go back for these! We also had the fried green tomatoes. I loved the tomato part - really crispy and wonderfully flavorful. I didn't love the pork belly, because it's just not my go to kind of meat. I would have preferred some crispy bacon. 

For the entree, we shared the 1\/2 bird (Lewelyn's fried chicken). The chicken itself was good, it just wasn't my style of fried chicken. The batter was a great consistency (light and not super crispy) however, it had a slight sweetness that I wasn't a huge fan of. I prefer my chicken to be savory or even spicy. We also shared the mac and cheese, and that was phenomenal! Perfectly aldente pasta and it had the creamiest texture!

Menu looks interesting, but food is presented in an over the top fashion that detracts from the overall impression and dare I say flavor.

We stopped for a late night snack, spent $100 , left feeling so disappointed I wish I had talked to the manager.  The staff seemed more interested in closing \/ recovery duties than helping customers.

So the kicker, ordered too much food, want to take it to my room for later.  Ask for some bread, since you know my ""BLT"" didn't have any, deconstructed etc.  Offered biscuits, to which I say I'll take two.  Get to the room later and notice that they charged $3.00 a piece for biscuits.  Yep, six bucks.  Now I'm thinking these are gonna be some great biscuits, Nope, small, HARD as a rock and tough.  To top it off, NO BUTTER.  Dry as the desert Vegas is built on and not a drop of butter to help you along.  Just for reference, The mega Giant KFC offers biscuits for about a quarter the price and 20 times the taste.  So sad, shame on you Yardbird.

 The chicken was surprisingly tender and smoky. It was quite a tasty dish; something I would definitely order again. They didn't skimp on the chicken, either.

Started with the chicken biscuits (2). Chicken was nice and moist on the inside with a crispy breading. The biscuits were not - they were dry on the inside and rock hard on the outside. Maybe we got a bad batch?

I then had the brisket sandwich for my main. The brisket itself was quite good - a bit oversauced but good. The bread was (again) dry, and the sandwich was sloppely put together. The fries were excellent.

My wife had the chicken sandwich. They used a hamburger bun... an untoasted hamburger bun. It simply couldn't hold the sandwich together and immediately fell to pieces -- Fail. 

Very disappointed.",1,0,0

The last time I visited Miami, this was one of the restaurants I had to bookmark for the next time I returned. It is truly a Miami staple, and I'm glad that the Venetian has one now. If you like Southern comfort food with a different type of flair like I do, you need to head on over to Yardbird.

What can I say? The food, ambiance, and service hit all the right buttons. What I usually get for the table is two orders of the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles. It comes with this honey hot sauce and chilled spiced watermelon on the side. Top it off with some bourbon maple syrup and it's pure heaven. The great thing is that it isn't greasy at all! Didn't feel too heavy or sluggish leaving the place, so that's a good sign.

My wife and I were celebrating our 10th anniversary on our last night in Vegas. I had read the reviews and looked at the ratings and I was impressed. It exceeded my highest expectations.

They had a solid selection of local craft brews. Pretty much every genre of beer. I had a flight of 4 beers for a reasonable $12. My wife chose a Utah beer(Apricot Hefe). We started our meal with Fried Green Tomato BLTs as an app. Best pork belly I've ever had. So creative!

For the main course, I had the fried chicken with mashed cauliflower and Mac and cheese on the side. These sides could have been a meal by themselves. They were amazing. I'm from Michigan and Frankenmuth Fried Chicken is hard to beat. Well it got beat. 
My wife had a wedge salad with fried chicken. Simple ingredients done excellent. And for her side she got honey brussel sprouts. I don't like brussel sprouts and I liked these. Simply wow.

Then to top it off, Andy, the manager, came by to check on us during our meal. We told him our wonderful thoughts. He asked us if we were celebrating anything and we told him we were celebrating our anniversary. He said Happy Anniversary and we thought that was the end of it. Alas, our waitress, Mandy, brought out a wonderfully prepared caramel and roasted walnut bread pudding complete with a lit candle and a nice message.

To get 5 stars from me, food has to be on point. But what it really comes down to service. I listed my great service above, but what really caught our eye was when another patron didn't like her salad Andy personally came over to go over some other menu options to make sure she was satisfied.

We found Yardbird mainly because I had seen it the night before when I had dinner at Grand Lux. We walked up and asked if we could be seated without a reservation. Although busy, they were happy to seat us. The lounge area, as we walked through it, was very noisy. I asked the hostess if the restaurant would be that noisy and she replied that it would not. Well, it was. It's like a Lazy Dog or a Buffalo Wild Wings, in terms of noise levels. I almost turned to C to say, ""Let's go to Grand Lux,"" but I didn't. We sat down and it was the best decision we made all day .

You know how people are always asking, ""Where is the best fried chicken in LV?"" I found it. It's crispy on the outside and moist, tender, juicy and flavorful on the inside and, get this, not one drop of oil or grease. I mean zero!

This is a family style restaurant so we got the chicken, waffles and watermelon. It comes with  1\/2 chicken, two waffles and a bunch of chunks of watermelon. The crispy cheddar cheese waffles are topped with a dollop of relish--not pickle relish but green tomato relish. It's different. I liked it. The platter came with bourbon maple syrup and honey hot sauce. The watermelon was tossed with chile and basil. Interesting flavors and all good.

Now, it is rare--extremely rare--for me to order dessert. I'm not a dessert person. For this meal, I crossed over to the dark side. Yes, they spoke to me. Who spoke to me? The deep fried Oreos that were served on a scoop of chocolate toffee ice cream, topped with some toffee candy and decorated with a slice of chocolate candy and drizzled with chocolate sauce--not Hershey's.

Ambiance is chill, service is attentive, and creativity + execution of food was spot on. 

What to get:
- Deviled eggs: comes with dill, chives and caviar on top (best deviled eggs I've had and I hate dill!)

- Fried chicken \/or fried chicken and watermelon waffles: I don't care which you get as long as you do the right thing and go with what they're known for. These juicy chicken parts are brined for 27 hours before being thrown into the deep fryer. The hot sauce it comes with is also so perfect and exactly what a hot sauce should be. It's not not spicy, not too spicy but has a significant kick that doesn't overpower the star of the show. #divine

- Fried green tomatoes: yes lawd! So bomb.. Crunch of the fried exterior with the overflowing juice of the tomato with each bite. To top it off it has pork belly, some cheesy mixture and frisée to make you feel you're consuming healthy greens :) 

- Bbq brisket sandwich: got this because they didn't serve the ribs at lunch (boo!) but was craving some bbq sauce. Overall it was solid but I feel the chicken is the better way to go if debating between the two.

First impression walking into yardbirds is ..am I over dressed for this place?.. With it's rustic decor and furnishings you initially think your in a southern state at an authentic small town chicken restaurant.. But once you let your eyes settle you easily come to realize that although it gives off a old southern charm you are however in a new modern upscale take on a southern restaurant . 

I must admit Yardbirds got me with their chicken ads plastered all over Vegas Magazines and posters .. Slabs of fried delicious chicken pictures calling my name every time I saw it..  In my mind this is a fried chicken paradise that I must go to. 

So I made it here and with menu in hand...after drooling a bit in anticipation..my eyes start hunting for pages and pages of fried chicken options ..But  after a quick skim through the small one page menu one time, then two times,  I come to realize there menu choices on chicken consist of only 3 items..chicken BBQ .. Fried Chicken with waffles and fried chicken without waffles ..A bit disappointed I quickly sucked it up and placed an order .. So my choice was chicken and waffles which would come just as it states with a side or chilli spiced watermelon cubes and bourbon infused syrup.  First impressions of my plate was.. that's it?. Now Why would I say this in disappointment  .. Maybe because i frequent hash house a go go and used to the giant portions or it could be that for $36 I expected more than 4 pieces of fried chicken..hmmm this upscale thing is not working at this moment for me..

However I wasn't initially impressed at this point, I kept on trucking and then I dug into this moist delicious perfectly fried chicken and all my impressions went out the door.. Yes people the chicken is delicious one of the best I have had.. The waffles to die for with their bourbon infused syrup.. I could drink that if It came in a bottle.. So good.. Spiced watermelons was a nice finish to clean the palate.. This all came with average service, with no extra effort made to take them over the top and truely call them selves upscale.

Yardbirds doesn't stop at the chicken.. You can not only eat here but you can drink well too ..Because they have a fierce bar and lounge scene , specializing in bourbon and whiskey...What makes this bar a little different is that they hand harvest there ice cubes which include handmade flavored ice cubes.. So in your drinks expect to get interesting shaped and flavored ice cubes.. Average drink cost is about 15 dollars and goes up so bring lots of money.. Remember this is upscale southern....right

Overall yardbirds took me up and back down and back up.. This roller coaster of emotions eating here did end on a high note with good flavors and Good drinks.. Am I sold on the upscale southern dining approach, not really ..",13,12,15

My boyfriend got the half chicken and a cornbread skillet, which he loved, but couldn't finish because it was too much food. I wish we had ordered less so we would have been able to try their peach cobbler, which I'm sure was amazing!

I would definitely recommend this restaurant and the chicken and waffles for sure!",1,1,1

Normally I don't go to the strip unless we have company but I'd heard great reviews from some of my other Southern pals living in Vegas and decided to check it out. AND we went on a Sunday. WTH was I thinking?  Also I've had a boycott on the Venetian\/Palazzo for many years so i had to verify if this was owned by them or the space was just rented. I know semantics but it's MY boycott. 

We had made reservations but still had to wait quite a while for a table even though we'd booked though open table & we'd requested ""fat girl seating"" - we finally were seated and in typical Vegas strip fashion the tables were so close together we could feel the heat coming off the table next to us as they were being served. 

So to the food\/drinks: 
Drinks: 
1 round of bloody Mary's served in a mason jar - not original but the bacon salted rim gave it a nice touch. Round 2 was ordered before the waiter left the table. 

Food:  
Deviled eggs:  Piped a delicious with a nice little caper on top and chivy \/ oniony in the actual deviled portion. 
Fried Green Tomato with pork belly:  I found the tomatoes a bit mushy - not the ""crisp"" solid ones i expected but it might just have been because it was a Sunday and they were busy. 
Chicken and Waffles with some type of bourbon maple syrup.  Best part on this was the watermelon in balsamic drizzle. Again the waffle was soggy and while the chicken was savory but nothing really to write to the old homestead about. 
Another round of bloody Marys! - after waiting almost 20 minutes to see any service person we could grab. 
BBQ Pork belly - Worth every calorie and cellulite dimple it added. 
Dessert: Some chocolate pie\/cake something so nondescript I've totally forgotten what it was. 

Seating:  very close together - no arms on the chairs but lots of hip hangover. 
Service:  Not even close to good. Long wait times, excuses and very surly posers - if we were in NYC i'd say they were wannabe actors but i guess these were just wannabes. 
Pricing: It is what you'd expect from a place on the strip. All in with food and 3 rounds of bloody Marys for 2 was $146.00 including tip.

Food: pretty amazing...got the Chicken & waffles with watermelon  , slow and low chicken salad which had fried cornbread and avocados in it, & the special of the day: biscuits and gravy with eggs & bacon. All were delicious! The chicken was delightfully crispy but very tender and juicy (even the breast), and the watermelon cubes were not only refreshing but very tasty! Served with bourbon maple syrup and hot sauce on the side. The low and slow chicken salad was very good too, with shredded chicken was also very tender with a mild smokey flavor which was well complemented by the fried cornbread, avocados, and buttermilk ranch. The biscuits and gravy-can't say it was the best biscuits and gravy I've had...it's more like a Benedict but with a brown colored thick gravy on 4 halves of biscuits underneath, bacon, and a pouched egg-very brunch like and very good. 
The dinner was finished off with a  complimentary dessert....an amazing cinnamon latte ice cream atop a layer of pumpkin bread served in a cute little mason jar in celebration of Christmas!

Yardbird is located in The Venetian, but once you enter you feel like you've escaped the over-stimulating slot machines...for a moment. The space is impressive, a relaxed yet upscale vibe. Nailed the ambiance for sure. Please note, the low lighting isn't the best for taking photos. Don't be like the table next to me with one dude using iphone flashlight and the other hovering over the table trying to get that aerial shot.

What she order: old fashioned, blackberry bourbon lemonade, cornbread, grilled okra, chicken n watermelon n waffle, fried green tomato BLT, and butterscotch cake. 

Drinks: All their cocktails are worth trying. The old fashioned poured over a rounded ice mold was really refreshing with a hint of smoked bacon. Loved the blackberry bourbon lemonade as well, served in a mason jar, not overly sweet, could probably drink like 3 of these.

Food: I know the chicken & watermelon looks dope in pictures, but I would really pass on it. Fried chicken wasn't bad but could use more flavor and fat. Definitely not a fan of the waffle, it was too crispy and airy. Bourbon maple syrup tastes like crown maple, if you into that. Order the fried green tomato BLT - fried green tomato, pimento cheese, and crispy pork belly - a winning combination. Also, the butterscotch cake with bourbon ice cream was on point.

Yardbird's take on southern comfort food is cute but not exactly nuanced or to die for. I've been to the dirty south and had some pretty authentic shit, so that's my basis. But all in all a nice place to grab drinks and chill.",10,6,11

THE DEETS:
- Handy dandy Yelp App to the rescue
- Amazing photos of delectable Chix + Waffles
- Southern food, who can say no?

ON THE MENU:
- Deviled Eggs
- Skillet Cornbread
- Chicken + Watermelon + Waffles
- Peach Cobbler (made to order)
OVERALL:
- Pictures do not lie. Yelper's posted delicious photos of Yardbird's signature dish, the chicken and waffles. Everything looked so good on the menu that we ended up sharing our entrée. For starters we ordered the Deviled Eggs topped with Smoked Trout Roe. The roe was a very nice touch and gave the deviled eggs a nice twist at the end. Would recommend! The Skillet Cornbread was soft and sweet. I wouldn't let the bacon jalepeno throw you off. If you like cornbread you will not be disappointed. Order it to share, someone is bound to love it. The Chicken + Watermelon + Waffles were amazing. The Chilled Spiced Watermelon was surprisingly delicious. The Bourbon Maple syrup was insanely good with the Vermont Sharp Cheddar Cheese Waffles. Next on the menu was the Peach Cobbler. You will need to order this in advance as it takes 25 mins to make. When we received the dessert we were already quite full but could not wait to try their take on this classic dish. The cobbler arrived with a side of homemade vanilla ice cream and cinnamon twist. Both were delicious. The cobbler was very good. But may need to skip if you are too full.

While I'm still not a fan of friend chicken and waffles, there are so many other good things coming out of the kitchen that I could be happy never to see the chicken and waffles.

Six of us came for brunch Saturday morning and we were served by what the kitchen decided to make and send out.  

Items we received:

Buttermilk biscuits with honey butter and house made jam
Warm farmer's cheese and watermelon
Chicken salad
Friend chicken skin cheese sandwiches
Egg and sausage biscuits
Country fried steak and eggs
Chicken and waffles with watermelon cubes and honey hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup
'77 Elvis pancakes--chocolate chip pancakes, banana compote, bourbon maple syrup,peanut butter
Chimichurri steak and eggs with has browns
Strawberry shortcake
Hummingbird cake
Chess pie
S'mores brownie
Butterscotch cake with bacon frosting and butterscotch sauce with toasted pecan bourbon ice cream

Some of these dishes are not on the menu as they're experimenting with some dishes to put on a future menu.  The new country fried steak and crispy skin cheese sandwich are clear winners!  I am becoming a bigger fan of biscuits.  These are flaky and really don't need the butter or jam but they're good to try.  The chicken salad is something I've had before and it's good.

Butter lettuce, grilled mango salad with smoked pecans was refreshing with a lovely vinaigrette, but the mango wasn't quite ripe as out of season. Doubt this will stay on menu very long.

We ordered the chicken n waffle n watermelon, the short ribs with cauliflower mash, wedge salad and honey roasted Brussel sprouts. 

The chicken n waffle n watermelon was good and a big enough portion to share since you get 1\/2 a chicken. The short ribs were bland. I had to ask for salt and the wedge salad had a ranch dill dressing which I wasn't expecting. The Brussel sprouts were off the hook. One of the best parts of the meal.

I tried a couple small plates and the low and slow cooked chicken salad. I had the spiced watermelon which was served chilled. Sounds weird but it works! I also had the biscuits with butter and jam. They were tasty but a little on the hard side. The highlight was my salad. It was far from your traditional salad and one of the best dishes I've ever had! The dish starts out with a yogurt and caper sauce under a perfectly fried corn bread square. Diced slow smoked chicken was served on top with frisee. The bitterness of the frisee paired perfectly with the salty chicken and sweet cornbread. I could not have asked for a better brunch dish. You must get this salad if you come to Yardbird. The place is not cheap, you'll probably spend $25+ on brunch\/lunch. But then again, all restaurants in Vegas hotels are pricey. Service was pretty good and the bathroom was clean.

The service, food, and drink selection is a cut above the rest.

Assuming I make it to the dinner break in my tournament tonight, I will be eating at Yardbird.

We were feelin' lazy and luckily this place sits right by us. Came here for a late lunch on Friday around 2:30 so we didn't have to wait for a table for 6. The atmosphere and interior design is super southern country chic and had a very nice ambiance. We were seated right by the kitchen window\/counter so you could see how they prepare food. All the food we had was absolutely delicious and amazing! I loved everything! 

For drinks I got the Porkchop ($14). A very interesting flavor as it is mixed with bourbon, Dijon syrup, Yuzu juice and apple cider and then has a Dijon thyme ice cube that secretes more Dijon flavor as it melts so it kinda pronounces the flavor more as time goes by. I admit I was quite confused when I started drinking it and the waitress described it as ""a fun drink,"" but grew to love it. The lemon shandy (also $14) was also suuuuper nice and very refreshing, I would def recommend that too. 

We started with the Mac and Cheese ($9), roasted cauliflower, and the Deviled Eggs ($11). All our appetizers were super yummy but if you are a fan of deviled eggs, you MUST get the deviled eggs here!!! They are absolute HEAVEN!! Definitely on the top list of deviled eggs in my book. I saw so many pics of them on Yelp and knew they must be good and boy I was not one bit disappointed! Probably one of my fave things at this restaurant in all honesty, but I'm a huge fan of deviled eggs so perhaps I'm biased. 

For entrees I ordered the Chicken Biscuits ($14). The biscuit is so good and the chicken was top notch. Thick, tender, juicy hunk of chicken, loved it! It was 2 biscuits sandwiches but I was very full after. My friend and her husband split the Chicken and Waffles with watermelon ($36) and its served with hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup. Another friend just straight up ordered the Bacon Maple Donuts and seemed to enjoy that just fine. They looked delicious but I didn't get to try it. 

Now for dessert.... I thought dessert was amazing. What I didn't think was amazing is our waitress clearly forgetting to put our order in early for the Peach Cobbler yet not willing to admit it. RUDE. Waitress had warned us when we were putting our food orders in, the the cobbler would take 30 min to prepare. My friend and I hesitated but committed to dessert as we were in Vegas for vacay and didn't care! So it was very clear to the waitress that we wanted one. Yet when our meals were finished and she asked if we wanted anything for dessert, we just said we would wait for our cobbler and she had a slight confused look until saying ""yea, right, ok"" and walked away. After waiting 30 min our friend asked her if we could get something complimentary since we had to wait so long. They brought us our bread pudding (which I just thought was OK) and then finally after several more minutes, our cobbler came out. AMAAAAZING!! So good!!! I loved it!

What I didn't love was waiting for it almost an hr after finishing my meal. Kinda messed up considering I'm paying more here than a regular restaurant and expected better service than that. Was glad that they didn't charge us for the cobbler, but curious if they would have had we not said anything about us waiting. And bc of that ordeal I didn't give them 5 stars as I originally would have had everything gone the way it should've, so 4 stars it is.",1,2,0

We had a group of 13 and made a reservation months in advance. We were told we had to pay a deposit (I believe $150) and had to meet at least a $60 minimum pp. This should have been our first clue to run. I've never heard of such a thing in my life. The experience only went downhill from there.

When we arrived, there were several open tables, making the entire reservation\/deposit situation unnecessary. The service was extremely slow, with some entrees coming out way before or after others. There was no rhyme or reason to the timing of the meal; entrees and appetizers came out seemingly whenever. The menu was small. We were there for hours. The food was nothing special. When the bill finally came, a manager accompanied our server, who told us that we didn't meet their asinine minimum per person requirement. We were presented with a bill of the most extremely random and shady charges, such as drinks that cost $40+, and a large amount of ""miscellaneous fees."" We also were told they were unable to split the check, after being told at the beginning of the meal that we could. 

We paid without incident, because I didn't want to cause a scene. I took a picture of the bill and called my credit card company the following day. I explained the situation and said I would pay for our food, drink, and gratuity, but I refused to pay any fees or extreme upcharges. Capital One filed a dispute on my behalf, and Yardbird, who had to have known they were in the wrong, did not fight it. I received a full refund on the items that I paid for but did not receive, which totaled over $100 in excess "" miscellaneous fees"" and upcharges.

The hubs and I were in Vegas for a wedding and ended up here for breakfast the morning after. To be honest, the reason we chose it was there was no wait and we could be seated immediately. 

Boy am I glad we came here. It was the perfect morning after cure - good down home American food. This place is not healthy so please stay away if you're not looking for a heavy meal. We started with the cinnamon apple hand pies and HIGHLY recommend them if you like sweet in the morning and are a fan of apple pies. They were absolutely delicious. All of the apples were covered in cinnamon sugar and just divine. We also ordered the crispy chicken biscuit which was delicious as well - the perfect blend of savory and sweet. 

The ambiance is super cool. There's a bunch of old rock mementos. I liked that you didn't feel like you were inside a casino and its as if all that didn't exist. It probably helped that we weren't seated by the door\/windows facing the casino.

The service was great. As we were most likely our server's first table of the morning, he was super attentive and didn't seem slammed or stressed as it can sometimes be during brunch. He gave us the recommendation on the biscuit and I'm glad that we took him up on it.

I ended up ordering the blue plate special and some cornbread for the appetizer. Cornbread was very yummy -- I love the little bits of jalapeño inside! The chicken was very juicy, crispy, not greasy or oily, and surprisingly not heavy, if that makes any sense. The biscuit was pleasantly crunchy, but not overly so. I was expecting the biscuit to be fairly dry like any other biscuit but it was not! Quite refreshing.

fried green tomatoes: tasteless, and the piece of pork belly on top was chewy on the inside, crusty on the outside... Not good at all. 
The cornbread: extremely salty and the crust tasted like rust possibly from the small iron skillet it was served in.
Chicken biscuit: again the biscuits were salty and stale and the chicken was rubbery and over-cooked.

Thankfully, Yardbird still had some reservations available on Friday at 5:45pm for 4 people so my family rushed over as soon as we could. To my surprise, the bar area in the front of the restaurant was really dark and had lounge tables and chairs everywhere. There were some people eating in this area but I think it was mostly for people who only wanted drinks. However, later when I was leaving I did see some families eating in the lounge area, probably since it was busier and there were no tables available. 

My family was seated in the dining area of the restaurant, which was towards the back, closer to the kitchen. Our waiter carefully explained the menu to us and gave great recommendations. We ordered the shrimp n' grits, Lewellyn's fried chicken, and short rib at first and then realized that wasn't enough, so we added the swine burger. We ended our meal by sharing the salted caramel bread pudding. 

Shrimp n' Grits: (4\/5). I don't eat this dish too often so I can't say much on the grits except that it wasn't too mushy. The shrimp, however, was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. I don't remember exactly what the sauce was on this dish but my family actually ended up dipping our fries in it. 

Lewellyn's fried chicken: (5\/5). Ugh there just wasn't enough chicken...4 pieces ain't enough!! The chicken was fried perfectly, with all the juices still trapped inside the skin. The breading was thin, but it was fried well that the skin was still crunchy. I actually enjoyed the honey hot sauce that it came with too. It wasn't too sour like some hot sauces are, and added a nice kick to the chicken. 

Short Rib: (4\/5). This dish comes with green beans, mashed potatoes, and corn. Everything went very well together and the short rib...omg it was cooked so well. The meat just fell apart in your mouth!! 

The Swine Burger: (4\/5). A solid burger. I loved the pork belly in it, as it melted in my mouth. There's different meats in this burger (short rib, pork belly) so it was a little messy to eat. However, they give you the vegetables on the side (lettuce, tomato, picked red onion) which made it a little better. Fries were also pretty solid. They don't give you ketchup though so you have to ask. 

Salted caramel bread pudding: (4\/5). I definitely tasted the whiskey in the whiskey anglaise. It wasn't too strong but still noticeable. My favorite were the dragee pecans, which were really salty\/sweet but went so well with the bread pudding itself. 

Overall, a nice restaurant with great Southern comfort food. Service was pretty good and our water cups were always filled. It is a little pricey but I think it's worth a try, especially if you're craving fried chicken!!!",2,1,1

Our very first Yardbird dining experience was the location in South Beach and was such a memorable meal we figured we had to hit the one in Vegas while in town. Having to travel a lot for work and being a foodie, I'm always amazed and appreciate when restaurants are able to extend their footprint and keep the quality and service levels high.  If I had not eaten at the other location previously, my review would be higher as I wouldn't have a baseline on the chicken (which is what really killed the rating for me). 

I'll start with some positives though - the bourbon and whiskey selection and pricing is amazing.  Why pay $13 for a single pour of woodford when for only $15 you can get cask strength Stagg JR?  Wine list and beer lists are fantastic as well. 

Our Order:
On this trip we ordered the Charcuterie as an appetizer and shared a chicken and waffles along with a side of Mac n cheese.  

The charcuterie ($26) came out and our eyeballs about popped out of our head. Great visual appeal and looked awesome from a portion perspective, but in hindsight was too dominated by prosciutto.  You're probably thinking this guy writing the review is a schmuck and is complaining about getting too much expensive meat, but in reality it was gagging. Have you ever had too large a deli sandwich and you get done and feel meated out? Of all the charcuteries I've had there is usually a nice balance of multiple types of meat, cheese, accompaniments for sharing.  I guess shame on me for not investigating contents first and assuming there would be a nice variety, but here is what was on it - 2 small 1"" cubes of cheese, 4 half slices of bread (limp greasy pieces not toasted nearly enough), pickles, pickled onions, pickled okra, their 3 spreads, and 3 huge rose shaped pinwheels of prosciutto (totally not shareable either as everyone would have to paw up the meat to separate it). It wasn't all bad news, ion the positive side, their pickled okra is awesome but you only 2 small pieces.  The onion marmalade, cheese and pimento spread, and seeded mustard side are all awesome accompaniments that you do need to find a way to try.  Heck cut the meat quantity in half and give a small variety and this would be top notch. 

Mac n cheese - no issues - was excellent, noodles cooked perfectly, awesome crispy char on top and perfect blend of cheeses. Far Better than most BBQ joints who claim to have great Mac!  

Fried Chicken - definitely a minus 2 star here and was let down.  Crispy fried chicken.  Crispy fried chicken. Just saying it conjures up a great visual and pending taste experience.  I love visiting places such as Gus's (chain out of Memphis) and Babe's in TX because it's awesome crispy fried chicken. Our server did a great job painting the picture and explaining the super crispy fried chicken but it came out as soggy as 1 hour old bucket of KFC I picked up at the drive thru on the way home from work. Now don't get me wrong, flavor and quality of meat were second to none. We were hungry from walking around all afternoon and really were looking forward to chicken and waffles.  It was a late dinner for us and the sound of air being let out of the balloon was all I could think about as I ate it.  Look you could chalk it up to a bad batch or a chicken cook rushing out the food, but the chicken should have never been served like that. I'm going with the ""rushing meals out"" part because the waffles were shorted a good 30 seconds in the iron too as they were missing that fine balance of cook time between soggy to crispy.  That crispy is what holds the syrup back a bit from being absorbed like spongebob.  Ours were definitely undercooked. 

Our first meal in South Beach location was that memorable it jaded me for this review.  Unfortunately we were let down.  I didn't complain to Mgmt because I didn't want my meal comped or have it re-cooked, wanted my check and go back to my hotel.  We paid full price, enjoyed a good (not great) meal and really have no regrets.  Hopefully my off night for the cooks doesn't happen to you when you visit.",0,0,0

Tried their ""Fried Green Tomato BLT"" This consisted of a house smoked pork belly, smoky tomato jam, frisée, pimento cheese, and pickled lemon vinaigrette. It was so good!

I had their ""Blue Plate Special"" (two pieces of Lewellyn's fine fried chicken, honey hot sauce
chilled spiced watermelon, house-made buttermilk biscuit) which was amazing. The chicken is brined for over 24 hours and is super moist. The batter was spot on.

I also tried half a ""Swine Burger"" (short rib, brisket, and chuck blend, house smoked pork belly, house pickles smoked gouda cheese, pickled onions, frisée). This was a delicious. There were so many flavors going on with each bite! Try it drizzled with their bourbon sauce

The cauliflower mash potatoes complemented the charred corn and green beans really well. The  chicken. Omg it was so good.

The waffles were perfectly made - crunchy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. And the syrup. Their bourbon maple syrup has to be what the Gods would use. It was ridiculously delicious.

The fries were great, but super small for the price.

The fried chicken is DEFINITELY something you should order when you're here. The batter was flavorful, crispy, and light enough to appreciate the meat underneath. They served it with a spicy sauce that tasted similar to tobasco.

The short rib plate was delicious. The meat fell apart and the cauliflower\/potato mash paired SO well with the charred corn underneath. This was my favorite dish!

I honestly thing our server made our dining experience as great as it was. Not only was he always checking in on us, but he was so nice, funny, and super helpful in guiding us through the menu giving some great recommendations. 

We started with the fried green tomato BLT which we couldn't get enough of. It had so much flavor and texture; three fried green tomatoes topped with some sort of amazing sauce\/aioli and a nice thick slice of smoked bacon. It was amazing! Once the BLTs were gone, they brought out our cornbread skillet. May have been some of the best cornbread I have ever had. It was so moist and cake that you almost expect it to be the sweet cake cornbread, but nope, it was how cornbread should taste but wasn't dry like most cornbread becomes when prepared this way. I loved every bit of it! We ended the most amazing dining experience with the fried chicken, waffle, and watermelon. The fried chicken is fried in lard, not oil so it is about as legit and tasty as it can get. I cannot even begin to explain the watermelon, you just HAVE to try it! The cheddar waffle was amazing!!! The meal is served with house made Louisiana hot sauce, bourbon syrup (basically straight bourbon), and our server recommended adding honey as well and I'm sure glad he did. all the sauces were so great and added unique flavor and twists to the chicken and waffle but the honey was definitely the real MVP.

I heard about Yard Bird from a friend who recently ate at the one in Miami. He highly recommended that I try it and I am so happy that I did. 

We started out with the house Bloody Mary. Jalapeño infused vodka is what makes this one special, it's spicy, but not too spicy. Served in a mason jar and garnished with a lime, stuffed olive, picked green bean, pickled okra and a slice of bacon. It was a delicious mini meal in itself. 

For appetizers we tried the fried green tomato BLT and the deviled eggs. Both were delicious!  Really enjoyed the BLT! 

For the main course I had the blue plate special which is two pieces of fried chicken (probably the best I have ever had) watermelon and a biscuit. Oh that chicken is good! So tender it almost falls off the bone. 

My friends had the crunchy chicken sandwich and a chicken salad sandwich. They too loved what they ordered and said they would order it again!  

We skipped dessert, but there were some pretty great looking treats on the menu. I will be sure to try one next time. 

Yard Bird is a little pricy but I think it's worth every penny. Our server was Iris, she was fantastic and took very good care of us.

It's conveniently located if you're staying at the Venetian or palazzo. I came here for a quick meal right before edc with a group of friends. I ate a few hours beforehand with my boyfriend so we wanted to share something small. We decided to get the crispy chicken biscuits. As we were ordering, I felt like the waitress kept pressuring us to order more food. She was saying that the dish is small and made it out sound like it won't fill us up. It's fine to notify us that the dish is small, but in the end it's our decision to order what we want. We also didn't want to be extremely full right before heading to the festival.

Made reservations almost 2 weeks in advance and the only time they had available was 4:30pm for our group of 10. So tip: make reservations early! 

The restaurant itself is located downstairs of the Venetian. Follow signs for ""Restaurant Row"". We got lost trying to find it. Once inside, the decor was very ""Southern-charm"" kind of welcoming. You'll see the bar stocked with all kinds of whiskey and bourbon. I was definitely liking the vibe.

When seated, our waitress offered us a ""chefs choice"" type of menu served family style. Basically we tell them our price range per person, any allergies, and likes and dislikes. This was a pretty cool option, since it allowed our group to try a variety of dishes with portion sizes large enough to feed everyone. Our budget was $20-25 per person. 

First 3 dishes were salads. 
- Butter Lettuce & Mango Salad: The actual butter lettuce pieces were huge and made it difficult to eat and share. The dressing was light. Nothing spectacular.

- Kale Salad: Also meh. Did not like the chucks of cheddar cheese, but the croutons were good. 

- Iceberg Wedge: The only salad I really liked. Mostly because of bacon, charred corn, avocados, and ranch! Yum!

- Fried Green Tomato BLT: Individual appetizer. One for each of us. Not your standard BLT because of the odd additional of melted pimento cheese. I liked it but many in my group didn't.

Entrees
- Chicken n Watermelon n Waffles (with 2 sides of extra chicken): Their house specialty. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside but still tender and juicy in the inside. The waffles were savory cheddar waffles, which were really delicious and paired well with the sweet maple syrup. Really liked the watermelon, which had chili spice on it and cleansed your palate after each bite of chicken and waffle.

- BBQ Pork Ribs: Not the best I ever had but pretty solid. They could have been more fall-off-the-bone tender. It had just the right amount of BBQ sauce and was not overpowering (and most importantly, not drenched like some other places are). Two of us got 2 ribs, but the rest of us only got 1.

Sides
- Mashed Potatoes: Good. I love all mashed potatoes.
- Heirloom Tomatoes: Not a fan. Ate one and was done.
- Green Beans: Good. The yogurt sauce was interesting.
- Okra: Did not try. Don't like okra in general.

Dessert
- Bacon Butterscotch Cake: On the house for my friend's birthday! And they gave us the regular large portion rather than a small sample. It was a little too sweet if I ate more than a few bites, but definitely a good way to end the meal.

With tax and gratuity, it came out to more like $30-35 per person, which was totally worth it for all the food we got. Service was attentive and very accommodating (we made them switch our tables in the beginning and they did it without question).

I ate at Nobu, Bouchon during my trip to Vegas, and this was the highlight of my meals. I'm super happy we stumbled across this place. Amidst all the steakhouses and Italian trattorias, something like Yardbird was sorely missing from the Vegas restaurant scene.

It's hard to find good Southern food in most places, and this place does not carry the price tags of the South. It is expensive - you're looking at $6-$15 for an appetizer \/ salad, and ~$30 for main plate, and $8-10 for a side. But it's Vegas, so to be expected; you don't normally come to Vegas to save money.

We were a party of 4 and we shared a bunch of things so that we could try a little bit of everything, which I highly recommend.

Fried Green Tomatoes BLT ($14) - Pork belly with the perfect amount of fat and perfectly crisped, and delicately fried tomatoes. It comes with 3 pieces, so portion it out  or order appropriately. I ate half of one but could have probably eaten 1-2 alone - it was that good.

Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad ($14) - This was good, but not outstanding for me. The butter lettuce was delicate and fresh, and the candied smoked pecans were a nice touch. But I could probably make this at home and the portion was not very big. I felt like i ate 3 pieces of lettuce when we shared this dish. If you want to feel ""healthier"" and get salad, this tastes good, but I don't think I would get it again.

Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles ($36) - Probably the most expensive fried chicken I've had in my life. 4 pieces of fried chicken - delicious, juicy, and not overly battered, 4 pieces of spiced watermelon (could have done without, but interesting), and a cheddar waffle which was delicious.

All in all, a very delicious meal that came out to about $25 per person after tip & tax. I would love to come back here for brunch, as they had brunch items that looked even better than the dinner. (if you come for lunch, you will get the dinner menu, it's a bit confusing). Cute ambiance, not overly crowded or stuffy, with a trendy and fun vibe. Great service and something different than what you normally find in all the resorts.",1,0,2

The fried chicken is good, but I don't know if it lived up to the hype. I think we came in expecting mind-blowing fried chicken, but then realized there is no such thing, because at the end of the day there is only so much you can do to fried chicken. It was about $35 for a plate which two people can share if 1 person has a light appetite. Not cheap by any means.

Cocktails were great. Service was amazing. Felt very welcomed there. Someone who appeared to be a manager even stopped by to ask us how it was.

Overall, while the fried chicken might not blow your socks off, the vibe of this restaurant is just very enjoyable. From the service to the upscale southern theme they have going, it feels like you're walking into an establishment that is managed by people who are very proud of southern food.

My husband and I were there for the holiday, and last Friday was our first time going to the restaurant. We found the place from my favorite TV show ""Hell's Kitchen"", and thought we should give it a try.
It started with our crappy Uber ride from the airport, then we went straight to Yardbird for dinner. Though our reservation was made for a later time, somehow they were able to accommodate us for an earlier dinner time. We ordered the chicken and waffles for our shared dinner and had the mac & cheese, as well the devil's egg. Which turned out perfect! 
We got sat in Andy's section, he was our server for the evening, and so I made a small conversation with him, and Andy made us feel very welcome and pretty much took care of us until the end. On a later time, I got to meet Tajeh, one of the executive chef working that night. She was quickly visiting her family's table, and I just jokingly stopped her and made a small conversation. 
I must say...This place didn't feel like just your typical restaurant, it seriously felt like you're part of their family. You come, you eat, drink, then they'll feed you some more until you can't eat anymore!
The chefs were amazingly kind, Andy pretty much took care of us, and he even introduced us to the morning\/daytime chef. Their food is really beyond my pallets, and I've always loved the southern type of food. 
I am sure they don't get to see the same face every day and make friends with random guests. But in my case, if you know the right place to make friends and dine....It's with those folks who makes and serves your food. Yardbird is just that southern comfort, with the right type of food, great staff, and just superb service.
Thank you, Andy & Tajeh for taking care of us during our visit!!! :)
We will for sure be back to visit you guys, whenever we're in Vegas.

Deviled Eggs

Mama's Chicken Biscuits
Bacon-Butterscotch Cake
Coffee

I was raised on a farmer's diet in IL and I work a desk job in Seattle now. I grew up with the idea that food was love and I get very picky about anything I love. I love biscuits, I love fried chicken, and I love coffee. Check, check, and check.

My biggest complaint is actually that the flavor of my two old fashions was inconsistent. The bar probably accidentally doubled the bitters in the first one, as the second was much sweeter and tasted more of the Buffalo Trace. I've never been one to complain about extra kick in my cocktails though, so I let it be.

Our waiter was friendly and attentive. It was a Tuesday night and they may have been overstaffed. Food came quickly and water glasses were never empty. The manager came to check on us and was similarly friendly and engaging.

We have never had to wait more than a few minutes and the service has always been great. I have seen it grow in popularity over the past few years but our last experience with the food makes me wonder if we will be back. 

Granted this visit was last year but I felt it was necessary to review. As always we ordered a sampling of items which includes Lewellyn's fried chicken, biscuits, fries, and something else that was on special but I forgot what it was. While the other items were fine the fried chicken this time was not good and I now regret not sending it back. I should have realized when it came out so quickly after ordering. While I can appreciate this, when one pays $26 for a half chicken it is expected to be piping hot and fresh...unfortunately this wasn't. I'd gladly wait longer for something freshly fried versus a batch that has been sitting out for a while. Again, my mistake for not mentioning anything but we were hungry.

We were seated after a few minutes of waiting, since there was almost a full house that night. The lighting and ambiance was very nice and casual, and their seats were very comfortable too. We ordered drinks, as well as some of their popular dishes: Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits. For a starter, we ordered the waiter's recommendation of their crab cakes.

The crab cakes were super fresh and delicious. We popped them into our mouths and had to discipline ourselves to enjoy them to the fullest because the plate only had four of them. The cakes were paired with fresh greens and a tasty sauce, making a plate full of different textures. The food was savory, salty, sweet, and each taste didn't clash with one another. Just a warning though, like I said, the dish only contained four of them, so if you eat them up too quickly, you may end up regretting it!

The Shrimp and Grits dish was actually the first time I've ever tried grits before, and because of this, I now have high expectations for grits! Hahaha! Again, I have to say that this dish was also savory too (I love savory food). If only I could order more grits because those grits were just very fluffy and delicious! The shrimp was good too and both complimented each other very nicely. I would definitely come back to this place and order this dish again and again!

My friend ordered their most popular dish, Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles (I think that's how it's sequentially ordered...either way, you'll know what I'm talking about once you take a look at the menu yourself!). I especially LOVED this dish because it was their own twist on chicken and waffles. It's been almost two weeks, since eating there, so all I can remember is that it was one of the best chicken and waffles combination I've ever had. Their fried chicken was very crispy (I would have tried to request crispier skin, but I was already too hungry to wait for them to edit the dish), the waffles were sweet (even sweeter when doused in their maple syrup), and the watermelon was juicy! I do wish, however, that the dish had the full plate of waffles, instead of only using half of what was made in a waffle maker. For that price (around $33), they could have definitely added one more fried chicken and the other half of the waffles from the waffle maker. I'd get this dish again too!",0,0,0

I was like HELLS YES!!!--mustard!?  Never drank anything with mustard in it!  Well................

Other Yelpers had mentioned that the cheddar cheese waffle was hard. Ours was no exception. Because they had cooked it for so long, the cheese got very hard and made our waffle tough -- it was hard to cut through. We mentioned this to our waitress and banged on them with our utensils to accentuate our finding. They brought us out a new one. Now this second one was great! It was perfectly cooked, soft, looked really cheesy, and the cheese stretched when you cut into it, and could actually taste it. Our first one was basically a dark, plain waffle with a hard cookie consistency. 

For me, I could taste the bourbon in the syrup, yum. Hubs was like, meh, but then I don't drink. He also didn't care for the herbed watermelon, I kinda liked it.

We went in with high expectations. Not only did we elope the night before so we were still on cloud 9 but we were looking forward to another memorable experience as we had in SB.

We started with an uncomfortable table that included a small chair and bench seating. I asked to sit at a different table-pointing to one that included chairs with more support, explaining I had a bad back\/disability. The hostess was quite rude and I didn't care much for her lack of compassion. We made the best of it, again focusing on enjoying our meal.
Our chicken and waffles were disappointing. Chicken batter was soggy and not crispy at all, as described in the menu and as we had in SB. Waffle, under cooked, so the bourbon syrup just sat in the top.
Our server was inattentive and disappeared for extended periods. We waited for and had to ask for water several times.  I was never able to order another glass of wine due to the lack of support from our server.
We did not complain to management, paid our bill and left. The food was good, but given our expectations from the South Beach location and our special occasion, we just wanted to pay our bill and leave.

I can best describe this resto as being a nice little upscale southern spot located in the Venetian. Definitely a place for special occasions if you're into Southern food. Thankfully a friend of mine treated me here because I was hosting him for a bit over the weekend and felt that it was necessary to do so. 

Fried Green Tomato BLT- there was definitely a lot going on here compared to your traditional fried green tomatoes, but I assume that should be expected since everything in it was in the description. The pork belly was perfectly done and cheese pimento combine the 2 major components (pork and tomato) nicely. There was also a jam at the bottom of the tomato between the place and that made it a bit much with too many flavors going on. To top it off there was some type of greens, which added height. Although this was a very busy appetizer, my friend and I both agreed this was our favorite part of the meal.

Salisbury steak- we enjoyed this dish as well. The mushrooms, shallots and gravy was delicious- to the point that they out-shined the steak itself. The steak was very ordinary, nothing special almost homemade like at your Aunt's house or something but I guess that what the other components was for. 

Sides- biscuits, mac n cheese, and corn bread. The biscuits was very upscale flakey and were delish. I loved dipping this into the gravy of our main entree. This also came with honey butter and jam. The honey butter was good, but not as mind blowing as other southern places I've tried. Mac n cheese was a solid dish as well, which came in a mini cast iron. The corn bread was pretty moist from what I remember. 

All in all the food here is a step of from your typical Southern food, but safe at the same time... I don't know if that makes sense, but if you eat here you'll know what I'm talking about. The service was of course impeccable, which is expected for a restaurant at this price point. Honestly, the food here was $3-$5 priced more than it should actually be. I'm a local so I can complain about that, but my friend who was a tourist said it's ""strip prices"" which is absolutely true. Although I enjoyed my overall experience here, I don't think I'll be coming again because it's a bit much for my budget.",1,1,1

Yardbird is THAT place that will make you bear traffic, fight with taxis on Las Vegas blvd and walk through casinos for some chicken and waffles.

Was thanked for stopping by, and making the trip to the strip to see what they are about. He explained the menu in about 35 seconds and left us to make our choices. 

We started with the fried green tomato BLT. Fried green tomatoes remind me of growing up in my home-state of Indiana. No one can really fry them like my grandparents..but this was an updated version topped with pimento cheese and a fat piece of bacon on top! Delicious!
Next was the main dish. I ordered chicken n watermelon waffles. The chicken was perfectly fried..like seriously...""perfect"" I'm still trying to figure out how you can fry chicken like that. lol. I can't describe it, you'll have to taste it yourself! The waffles were thick and tasty but lets have a moment of silence for that bourbon syrup! *bows head* DO I TASTE LIQUOR ON MY WAFFLES? YES!!! It was perfect since I also had a blackberry bourbon lemonade. My taste buds had never been so drunkenly happy!

On to dessert: the peach cobbler. Peach cobbler is that dish  in a southern family, gets passed down generations and you do NOT allow just anyone to make the peach cobbler at a family function. You seriously just cannot eat anybody's cobbler! I'm convinced that Yardbird has someone's  grandmother in the kitchen cooking. Yep, my grandmother must have came out of retirement and didn't tell me.",1,0,0

We had the Fried Chicken and Waffles. And they were the BEST fried chicken and waffles I have EVER had! It was a generous portion (well it better be, for $36..), big enough for two people to share. The fried chicken was SO flavourful I did not even need the sauce that came with it. The waffles were a jalapeno cheddar waffle that was once again, good enough to eat by itself, although it came with a side of maple syrup and hot sauce. There were some cubes of watermelon on the side, drenched in hot sauce. Great combination! The fresh cold watermelon was a really good complement to cut the rich taste from the chicken and waffle. This entire plate was such a FLAVOURBOMB! 

We also had some okra on the side. It was good, but not as phenomenal as the fried chicken and waffles.

We tried two cocktails - one blueberry bourbon, and the other was a watermelon cocktail. Both were good, but the food outshone the drinks.

That, my friends, is what a Yardbird fried chicken addiction sounds like. After sinking my teeth into the crisp and juicy 27-hour fried chicken, there was no going back. Out the window went my plans to try out epic Vegas buffets and posh restaurants. All I wanted was my Yardbird chicken fix.

We went to Yardbird twice during our trip to Vegas, and the only reason there weren't any more was because we flew out soon after our second visit. Everything we ate was ridiculously delicious. We ordered a wedge salad with minimal expectations but were soon singing our server praises. The lettuce had that perfect crunch, the hunks of bacon were substantial and tasty, and the avocado slices, cherry tomatoes and corn added layers of flavor I'd never experienced in a humble wedge salad. We also tried the brisket biscuits: fluffy and tasty biscuits overflowing with juicy and flavorful slices of brisket. The superstar is, of course, the fried chicken with cheddar waffles and chilled spiced watermelon. What an addictive interplay of delicious flavors, textures and temperatures! Quite possibly the best chicken and waffles I've ever had, period. On a separate visit, we had just the chicken so we could try other dishes and they hold up perfectly well on their own, too. For dessert, we had banana pudding, which was quite impressive and very tasty. I do regret not ordering their peach crumble (it takes 25 minutes to make so order ahead if that's your jam), but that just gives me a reason to come back. Service is excellent; the servers are very attentive, have great recommendations and always kept our coffee cups full. I thought the cocktails were just okay ... great variety but to me, they didn't seem so strong. I'd say save the stomach space and $$$ for more of that brilliant fried chicken!

2-1\/2 years ago, my wife and I visited Las Vegas on our anniversary trip and ate at the Yardbird for the first time and it was nothing short of magical. Fast forward 2 years and we returned with a friend and it was 180 degrees from our first time. 

I documented the experience here and received a very courteous reply from ownership imploring me to give them another chance. Last week, I did just that, joining them for their take on Thanksgiving dinner. 

From the start, this was a different feel for me. Not just because it was me, by myself, having lost my wife to cancer a month before, but the feel of Yardbird was different to me. 

I was seated in the front room and greeted by my server Christina. I'm just going to say, I could not have asked for a more attentive, friendly, courteous and knowledgeable person to guide me through my meal. 

I already knew what I wanted, having previewed the Thanksgiving menu in advance, so I wanted little time ordering and then sat back and began enjoying a glass of 10 yr Old Rip Van Winkle. I managed to nurse that single glass through all 3 courses of my meal, enjoying how the flavor altered in pairing with the items in my meal.

My appetizer, butternut squash ravioli with sunflower brittle, was visually enticing. I'm not a fan of brittle, but in this particular combination, it was a perfect bite with the delicate butternut squash ravioli. 

My entree and stuffing came next and after over 18 years of frying turkeys for Thanksgiving and reveling in the moist delicate flavors, this turkey exceeded mine and I'm not ashamed to admit it. The gravy on top, mashed potatoes below and cranberry compote along with the biscuit stuffing made many, many happy bites for my mouth. 

Last, but not least was the bourbon pecan pie with salted caramel ice cream and I now know what to do to pecan pie to make it better; add bourbon. Works for me. 

During the meal, I had the pleasure of speaking with a couple of management members, Scott and Kim, as well as exchange foodie thoughts with a couple at the table next to me, who were enjoying theirs as much as I was mine. 

Timing of the service was ideal, no rush, no lag. Interestingly, I'm pretty sure I saw the waiter from our previous visit and he appeared to be slinging drinks, not waiting tables. Probably a better role for him. 

I was asked back to give Yardbird another try and show what they were capable of and I do not regret doing so. My only regret is that the love of my life wasn't there to enjoy it with me.",0,1,0

Fried chicken was great, moist on inside and crunchy and full of flavor on outside.

We definitely drew the short straw with our server, who clearly didn't like his job, and acted like he barely tolerated us. He pushed a few menu items, and then completely vanished- no coming back to check on us, or anything. My friend had ordered biscuits that never arrived, and I had an issue with my meal, so we had to flag someone down to find him. We never saw him again after that. Absolutely lousy service.

I started with a Georgia Peach cocktail, which was weak to the point of just tasting like a juice drink. They had a good beer selection, so that would have been a better choice. We shared the deviled eggs, which were excellent, and definitely the best thing we both ate.

As for my meal, I originally ordered shrimp and grits, a dish that I usually love. The grits were the lumpiest, gummiest, most awful grits I have ever been unlucky enough to receive. They had the texture of cottage cheese, and having lived in the South, I can tell you that is a cardinal sin of Southern cooking. Although the shrimp was fine, the dish as a whole was inedible. 

To his credit, the manager came right over to address the situation, comped us an order of biscuits, and made other menu suggestions. I ended up ordering the fried chicken, which was enjoyable, although I wasn't a fan of the sauce. And frankly, a $20+ price point for a la carte fried chicken is a bit much to take. On a positive note, the biscuits were hot and fresh, so they were a nice addition to the meal.

I'm always leery of pre fix menus and usually find them to be a total rip off.  I also find that with ""group dining"" the service can be lacking.  Yardbird proved all of this wrong.  We had the most fabulous meal and cannot say enough good things about this place.  Our guests left raving.

Booking and planning the large party was fairly easy minus one issue in the contract that limited the time we could dine in the restaurant.  After we questioned this and worked it out  the rest was a breeze.  Nicole the catering manager was great to work with and was super accommodating with our questions and menu modifications.  We were sat in the private dining space which is awesome.  Tasteful design, good lighting and just a fabulous space overall.  

On to the food - OMG there was SO MUCH OF IT AND IT WAS ALL EFFING AMAZING.  Nicole assured us that no one would leave hungry, and we all left stuffed to the gills.  The food was too good not to splurge on and I loved that it was all served family style.  Here are the highlights:

Deviled eggs:  One of the better renditions I've had.  For deviled eggs, they felt really light and fluffy.  The trout roe on the top brought the dish together.  Highly recommend these.

Fried green tomato BLT: This dish was the highlight of the meal to me.  A++  The combo of the tender pork belly with the housemade pimento cheese was amazing.  I don't even like tomatoes and the fried tomato was divine.  Somehow they managed to not make this dish greasy one bit.  I don't know how they did it given the ingredients, but wow.  Just get this dish.

Mac n Cheese:  I liked this version.  It had a nice smokiness to it and I dug the breadcrumbs on top.  Presentation was great too.  

Ribs:  Fall off the bone good.  Solid sauce - not too heavy and not too light.  Just right.

Fried chicken: Again, how do they manage to not have everything be greasy?  Skin was crisp just how I like it.  The sauce that came with it had a great tabasco\/vinegar flavor to it too. Meat was tender.   Personally, I like a little more  spice to the rub, but that's just a personal choice.

Biscuits: Great flavor and texture and I loved the honey butter and jam they served with them.  Perfect temperature too.

Shrimp & Grits: Another standout dish.  Perfectly cooked shrimp in a great sauce with tender pieces of ham.  The sauce mixed so well with the grits and shrimp that I wanted to lick the plate clean.  

Good lord - we were so full by dessert time, but how do you not swoon over crunch and munch bread pudding with popcorn ice cream and mini m&ms?  Again - get this dish.   Just when we thought we couldn't take anymore, out came a butterscotch, bacon, layer cake with bourbon ice cream.  Perfect combo of sweet and savory and if you are like me and don't like your desserts too sweet then get this dish.  

We were so full by the end of the meal, but the food was too good to leave around.  Oh and we had a ridiculous amount of leftovers.  

This place is not to be missed.  With all the crap food popping up on the strip these days by absentee chefs, it was nice to go to a place with some substance.

The owner contacted me and asked us to try again on him. We did recently. We had a great table, service and food. We had deviled eggs, tomato bacon pimiento cheese and roasted bone marrow appetizers that were all good solid 10's. The fried chicken lived up to the hype and being from NC I know fried chicken. The mac and cheese was the best ever (another thing I know) and my wife's short ribs were fabulous. And let me say again they understand and deliver great service. I would give it six stars if I could. We have some 'go to' restaurants around the world to which we always return. Last year was an anomaly without doubt. Yardbird is fabulous in every way and is now on our 'go to' list. Thanks Yardbird and run chicken run!!! Wish we had had room for dessert.",0,0,0

Macacaroni and Cheese: (4.5\/5) tastes like creamy creamy childhood mac but more rich! Has different kinds of macaroni :)

Deviled Eggs: (6\/5) so good! So much yolk! Make sure to scrape that yolk on the bottom too! DEFINATELY GET THIS!!

Classic Buttermilk Buscuit: (5\/5) sooo good and buttery and rich! Comes with butter and apple marmalade. Nice and dense. Crispy ish on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside.

Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken: (5\/5) this was so goooood! GBD: golden brown and delicious ;). The inside was still so juicy while outside was crispy and perfectly fried! It's not super salty.. It's perfectly seasoned. Definately my favorite of the two main courses we ordered.

Short Rib: (4.5\/5) pretty tender meat in a kind of bbq-esque sauce? The string beans with this dish are delicious too, not bland!! The creamyyyt mashed potatoes with the meat sauce are sooooo good. The corn is pretty good and sweet too!

Peach cobbler: **THIS TAKES 40 MINUTES TO MAKE SO MAKE SURE TO ORDER IT FIRST!** freshly baked to order! Comes with a long sweet buscuit thing and vanilla ice cream in a sugar caramel bowl thing. The peach cobbler is really hot so be careful! It's pretty good and not too sweet! There is a breading crust on top that covers the peaches that is soo good and not too sweet too. I really liked the breading.

Surprisingly, all the flavors of the food go really well together! all the food we ordered was soooo good. 10\/10 would come again!

Service is so friendly! Carrie (spelling?) was so nice and peppy, and helped us decide that we wanted to have our dinner family style and share everything! She was very sociable and asked more about us!

Everyone constantly came around to keep our waters filled. I squeezed some lemon into my water and it was really refreshing to drink with my meal!

He decided that he wanted to go here because he liked the menu and was impressed with the Whiskey\/Bourbon list. It was pretty darn impressive but I stuck with my norm, Basil Haydens.

Upon arrival we were promptly greeted by the hostesses. Who sat us in the back part of the restaurant; it was nice because it was quieter than out front in the bar\/restaurant area. The restaurant itself was very unique; it was like a modern twist on an old farmhouse. There was ample seating and all very different but it all worked well together. I liked the little room off to the side that felt like another world and the slide show was interesting. Despite being a fairly large restaurant the way they had it set up felt very intimate. 

Service was excellent! Upon sitting down the busser quickly filled our water glasses, brought us bread and asked if we needed anything to drink. The server arrived shortly after and told us the specials. He seemed to really know the menu and was very excited about the quality of their food. I liked that the menu is served on a clipboard, it was a cool twist. Our drinks came very quickly and our food came out SUPER QUICK! It's like they knew we were coming and what we were going to order. 

The food was so good! The quality and attention to detail did not go unnoticed. I ordered the half chicken, French fries and fried okra. The chicken was so moist and flavorful! The fried okra was delicious! Fries were fries. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles. He devoured it so quickly I'm not sure he even tasted it, haha. Actually he said it was probably the best chicken and waffles he's ever had. 

Unfortunately we were so full from our delicious dinner that we did not have room to stuff any dessert in us. Overall a great experience, a little on the pricy side (but normal for Vegas strip) but the food and service was excellent.",15,12,14

My friend and I ordered the fried chicken, buttermilk biscuits, and the BLT. My favorite dish was the BLT because of the crunch factor from the fried tomato while also retaining the sweet juiciness on the inside. Just wanna say that I normally only eat tomato if it is diced or in a burger, but I would order the BLT again. The bacon was on point as well. The fried chicken was pretty good in terms of crunch and flavor, but way overpriced for the amount you get and for what it is. There wasn't a wow factor or a unique take on the dish. Glad that we opted for just the fried chicken and not the special dish that comes with fried chicken, waffles, and a few pieces of watermelon for like $35. The biscuits were really tasty with the butter and jam that they give you, but again not worth paying $7 for 4 pieces.

Overall, the meal was really good and I would recommend this place if you haven't been here yet. The prices do reflect the fact that it is a restaurant on the strip, but it would be nice if they did some special takes on their dishes to justify the price. I can't help but think that the food I can order here can be bought at a much cheaper price elsewhere and still taste just as good.",3,3,3

Came in on a weekday, late afternoon, around 4ish, not busy, we were seated right away. Nice\/simple decor, casual ambience.

Service was attentive and friendly. 

The crispy chicken (fried chicken on biscuit) I wasn't too impressed. They had a tiny bit of jelly on the 2 sliders, but not much. The meal overall was a bit dry. There wasn't anything special about the flavor either. I ended up asking for some honey to try and remedy the dryness and lack of flavor. 

Hubby ordered their burger. It's huge and came with fries. He enjoyed it. 

Their macaroni and cheese was also pretty good. Had a nice cheesy flavor, not too salty. If anything, it also was just a tiny bit on the dry side.

Cornbread... Was my favorite. Comes in a skillet with a huge spoonful of soft butter ok top. Super tasty. It didn't have much of the flavors its described as having (jalapeño cheddar.... Bacon.. I think, I can't remember)... If anything it was very subtle.. But it had a nice flavor overall...

Excellent service - Our server recommended the Chicken N' Waffles N' Watermelon and I decided to get the Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad. Our waiter was really nice and our water cups were always filled.

The Food - The food was amazing. The salad was really good, but the star of the show was the chicken and waffles. So the chicken was cooked perfectly - juicy, tender and full of flavor. The skin was crispy and just oooo so good! The waffles were out of this world delicious and the syrup (which we think had some rum in it), was smooth and a nice compliment to the dish. The watermelon seemed like it was marinated in some type of sauce that just went really well with the entire dish. 

The mango salad was fresh, crisp, and full of nuts and berries. It complimented the chicken nicely.

Then we got the peach cobbler for dessert. It took about 20-30 minutes to come out but that's because they make it to order!

I was a little sweaty by the time I got there but it was so worth it.

On Friday night ~7pm, we were seated right away. Everything on the menu looked delicious and we agreed to share everything. The three of us ordered:

-Deviled Eggs - I have a soft spot for deviled eggs and these were perfect. The white had a soft texture and the yoke mix had the right amount of seasoning.
-Bone Marrow - Another solid appetizer. The bone marrow was served with bread and onion marmalade.
-Fried Chicken (a la carte) - When the chicken came, I declared that I only eat dark meat chicken. But as the dark meat ran out, I decided to give the white meat a try too and this must have been the juiciest white meat chicken I've ever had. Actually, this may have been the best fried chicken I've ever had. Anyway, just order it. You won't regret it.
-Short Ribs - Short ribs are one of those things on the menu that I can never resist. Luckily, my dining partners felt the same way. The tender meat was served with corn, mashed cauliflower potatoes, and green beans. Good stuff!
-Peach Cobbler (had to order 30 minutes in advance) - For $15, I was hoping this dessert would not disappoint. And let me tell you, it was great! The cobbler itself was served in a huge ramekin. The crumble on top was sweet, cinnamony and had the best texture. It was served with a scoop of creamy french vanilla ice cream that was presented in a beautiful ""bowl"" made out of sugar and almonds. It was also paired with a long pastry twist.

However, Yardbird delivered, on a recent dinner visit with my mom. First of all, make a reservation! The place gets packed very quickly, and the tables are tight. We had a two-top against a wall, and it was pretty cozy next to the other tables. I'm not holding that against them though! Just FYI. 

My mom and I decided to share a few things: the Iceberg Wedge, the Classic Buttermilk Biscuits, and the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles entree. I also tried one of their the signature cocktails, the Southern Revival. First of all, I loved my drink; it was composed of Wild Turkey 81, passion fruit, basil, and served over block ice in a Mason jar. The flavors really melded well together. The iceberg wedge was fresh and delicious, and the unusual addition of charred corn added a unique flavor. The biscuits were flaky, buttery delights, and I wanted to smear that house-made jam and fresh honey butter over everything and anything. Last but not least, we received our entree. That fried chicken was amaaaazing-- juicy and tender on the inside, perfect crispy skin outside-- and everything that accompanied it was fantastic too. You could really taste the bourbon in the syrup, and the hint of cheddar in the waffle was the perfect amount. I wanted more of everything!

Since we were pretty full from our big comfort food dinner, we took a dessert to go: the Butterscotch Cake, which has bacon frosting (!!!), butterscotch sauce, toasted pecan and comes with bourbon ice cream. We ate the ice cream at the restaurant and it was very good. We had the cake later and it was a bit dense, but still quite indulgent and yummy.

We had a delicious meal at Yardbird, and we appreciated the friendly and attentive service as well. I would love to return in the future and try more of their awesome menu.",10,8,7

As most have mentioned, it's a very good idea to make reservations in advance.  I didn't expect it to be so busy on a Monday, but it was packed solid.  My party was seated right across from the open kitchen, which was awesome. I'm a huge foodie and it was quite a sight to see how well-organized and quickly the food went out to customers. 

We had two servers (one was new and being trained and the other was the trainer).  I wish I could remember their names-The new server was from Hawaii and the trainer had tats all up and down his arms.  Both were PHENOMENAL!  Every time they saw our glasses half full, they'd come by to fill it up without us having to ask.  They often stopped by to ask how we were doing and if we needed anything.  

The food was EXCELLENT.  My party (of 3) ordered and shared the cauliflower mashed potatoes, skillet cornbread, kale salad, crispy chicken biscuits, Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken and for dessert, the peach cobbler (they will ask during your order about this specific dessert because it takes time to prepare). Everything came out freshly cooked\/made. From our experience, when (not if) we return to Yardbird, we would reorder Lewellyn's Chicken, kale salad, cornbread and try the fried green tomato with pork belly (just couldn't do this dish this time around).  The most surprising dish to us was the peach cobbler-I've had many different cobblers over time and this one tops it.  Many times, cobblers are filled with a lot of gelatinous ingredients to help bind the fruit together.  With this cobbler, I have never spooned up so many fresh peaches with each serving! The scoop of butter pecan ice cream and the twist on top was heaven!  We still talk about this dessert :)

I highly recommend Yardbird Southern Table & Bar at the Venetian in Las Vegas.  Wonderful ambiance, fantastic food and excellent service!",1,0,0

I probably went overboard on ordering here, but I knew I needed to try more after the first two dishes arrived. I started with the butter lettuce and grilled mango salad. What a great contrast of flavors with the sweet mango and the smoky pecans. The shrimp and grits justify having ""Southern"" in the title. Wow, this was amazing. The grits were really good, shrimp plentiful and the flavors were out of this world. Last, but not least were the mini bacon donuts with maple glaze and butterscotch dipping sauce. I love, love, love that they pair the donuts with butterscotch sauce. That flavor combination is out of this world.",0,0,1

I don't have a drawl, but I grew up on the Southern Cooking present in the last capital of the Confederacy where my family has lived since before the Civil War.  Therefore, I really didn't have high expectations when I sat down to eat at The Yardbird in the Venetian in Vegas.

We had been present in Vegas for the PAC-12 Games and had just watched the first round of March Madness with the University of Arizona winning.  To celebrate, we went downstairs for some Virginia Ham Biscuits and Peach Cobbler.  Wearing UA shirts which proclaimed our school loyalty,  we were warmly greeted by new manager, Thadius. (Hope I didn't slaughter his name!) He congratulated us on our win and shared that the restaurant had just had the game on their television.  We excitedly talked about it as he showed us to our seats.

The food was amazing and the portions were very large.  The peach cobbler was presented BEAUTIFULLY.  It was hot and full of peaches.  The Ham Biscuits were as good as my Mom's.

But what we took away, more than even the food or the warm decor, was the SERVICE!  Thadius checked on my boyfriend and me several times and made sure that our Cobbler was exactly how we liked it.  We spoke of family and we truly felt that we had come home when we left The Yardbird.  A restaurant must be a delicate mix of service, efficiency and friendship.  Thadius accomplished this in every way and is a wonderful representative for the restaurant.  We will be back soon!",0,0,0

They either serve fried chicken on it's own or also Chicken and Waffles but in a somewhat fancy way.  I tried their Chicken and Waffles in their Miami location, that portion was huge.  Go ahead and share it, the chicken is moist and sweet and salty.  Very good, and the amount of waffles and watermelon are excellent.  

At this Vegas location we got the a la carte fried chicken which was still enough to share 1 order with at least 2 people.  This allowed us to get some sides like the okra, french fries, cornbread.  I enjoyed the okra a lot.  The fried chicken was once again moist with that hint of sweet and salty.  It's a slight twist on fried chicken that is worth the try.

We came here for lunch and were able to get seated right away.  The atmosphere is pretty cool, modern with some high top and low top tables.  There is going to be a day\/night in Vegas when you're going to want some fried chicken.  Come on down to Yardbird when that hits.",1,1,2

Ok enough silliness.

I first learned about yardbird from my recent visit to Miami. Imagine my excitement when I learned that this amazing restaurant was going to open in Las Vegas.

Going in, i thought back to the fond memories of the original location in Miami.  The basic look is the same however I do feel that the Miami location is much more charming and intimate. Vegas felt a bit corporate and felt like the swankier brother of Miami. That being said I still really enjoyed the ambiance.

Anyway...

I ordered a blackberry bourbon lemonade. It's the same taste as what I remembered. Great job!

When it comes to food at the Vegas location, there are several different choices of entrees which is very different from Miami. That being said, we ordered the ribs which to me reminiscent of Chinese style ribs. Everything else we ordered we the same items from the Miami location. BLT, which is fried green tomato, pork belly, frisée, and pimento cheese. Nailed it!  Also had chicken and biscuits and fried pickles. All amazing and on point. Nice to see that Vegas was so consistent with their executions. We ordered the bourbon pecan butterscotch cake. Monster piece of cake. I only wish that the cake was served a bit warmer. I can tell it was from the fridge and had not sit enough to bring it to room temperature. 

We came back for our last meal before we had to go home as well. Had lunch. Ordered the blue plate special which was a great value. So good.

Overall, if you like southern food, you are in the right place. Good place to eat in groups. Wonderful alcohol selection. Spectacular execution and good service.

This place has a great on line presence. They showed up in my Facebook feed, their ads were off to the side when I browsed the Internet.  Clearly it worked because here I sit.  

I could ramble on about the lack of warmth or friendliness from our server. I could lament the fact that the time between our appetizer and main course was excruciatingly long.  I could bemoan the fact that our waiter never once offered us another drink or asked us how our meal was. 

I could type all those things and more because I have been sitting waiting for my server to return and take my dessert order. 

What I will say is that the food is average to decent.  The portions are sizable and if you like bland food or have an aversion to seasoning, this is the place for you.

The special was a  biscuits and gravy with an outstanding gravy, fried chicken, eggs, and house made bacon.  The gravy wasn't too thick with a lot of house made sausage.  Fried chicken is what this place in known for and for good reason!  The biscuits were good, they didn't stand out next to the other things on the plate but nor should they.  Yardbird's bacon is amazing!  Sometimes house made bacon gets carried away with the salt, this didn't, it has great flavor (maybe the best I have had) and was cooked in a way that held up with the gravy for a little while which was appreciated on this dish.

I flew to Vegas on Allegiant and read about Yardbird in the in-flight magazine. I was stoked to chow down on Southern fare, the cuisine of my homeland (I'm from Atlanta).

I had a brisket sandwich, which was awful. The meat was fatty (and NOT in a good way), stringy and chewy. The BBQ sauce was cloyingly sweet and one-note. 

I also had the fried green tomato BLT. We expected a sandwich, but it was just 3 thick slices of tough, chewy underseasoned tomato on a plate topped with tasteless pimento cheese. (How can you mess up something as glorious as pimento cheese, y'all?!)

I didn't taste any South in my mouth. Only bright spot of the meal was the cocktail, which was stellar.

We had a reservation in advance but were pleased to get a single big table to accommodate all 12 of us (actually 1 person didn't show up but the restaurant didn't give us a hard time with seating us anyway).  

Cocktails were exceptional - I first tried their cocktail that had hints of banana and rum, which actually came together great.  Their version of an old fashioned was also spot on; I order this drink at a lot of places and this was one of my favorites, and it was fun to get the huge ice sphere inside.

Since we had a larger party I got to try multiple appetizers, including a fancy version of deviled eggs, and the BLT with fried green tomatoes.  The BLT with fried green tomatoes was mind-blowing; pork belly pieces were thick, well-seasoned and not too fatty.  The chicken and waffles was perfect - chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and also came with a spicy sauce on the side that added flavor but wasn't overpowering.  The waffle was composed of a special batter that lends itself to the chicken (this isn't some IHOP waffle), and the syrup was on the lighter side and not too thick.  My wife was over the moon to be able to order gluten free fried chicken (she can't usually have it), and she enjoyed every bite.  Since my wife and I were freshly married, they also threw in a few desserts for the table to share, which was a nice touch (somehow I wasn't bloated enough to eat some of these).

Jim G. and I posted up at the bar for some Saturday afternoon brunch.  Our server, Mallory, came over to get a drink order. Jim G. was famished so he also started us with some Deviled Eggs right away.

The Deviled Eggs came out and were tasty.  The portion, while only being 4 eggs, is huge, since the 'deviled' part is piled might high!  It took close to 20 minutes to get Mallory's attention so that we could order our actual food. Sitting at the bar, we would've expected it to be much easier to get someone.  Sadly, she was at the other end of the bar talking with another bartender or someone.  

When we did order, we got the Fried Chicken, Watermelon, and Waffles.  Huge portion!  We shared half a friend chicken!  The chicken was super good. It was very moist and the meat had great flavor.  I do believe the oil could have been a tiny bit hotter, so that it'd be a bit less greasy, but it was still good.  The spiced watermelon was awesome!  The waffles, however, were a bit of a letdown.  Seemingly lacking in real flavor and not all that crisp.  They made me want the waffles at Bouchon!

We had lots of other time basically getting ignored by Mallory and had to flag down someone else for more drinks and, eventually, our check. The getting ignored at the bar was especially detrimental to our ability to enjoy our time there.  Mallory, another bartender, and what looked like a manager spent about 15 minutes seemingly deciding where to put bourbon bottles on display.  Perhaps it's better in the main dining room, but my experience is usually that sitting at the bar is the way to go.

Could Southern-inspired comfort food really manage to stand out -- especially somewhere as over-the-top as the Venetian\/Palazzo hotel-casino megacomplex?

The answer to that is an unqualified YES.

Yardbird is one of the best things going in the Venetian\/Palazzo, and on the Strip in general.

Of course, step one is just finding the damn place.  Yardbird is buried deep in the resort, and you have to muddle your way through the endless expanse of the Venetian casino just to find it.  The hike is worth the trouble, though.  The slot machines and poker rooms become a fading memory once you make your way into the dark, stylish restaurant.

I was at Yardbird with a few friends (and reservations, which are an absolute must).  After we were seated, we immediately started with a round of appetizers to share.  First up were deviled eggs with dill, chive, and trout roe.  These deviled eggs were easily the best I've ever had.  They were enormous, packed with flavor, and had an incredibly silky texture.  The combination of egg and dill -- spiked with the saltiness from the trout roe -- is pure heaven.

Next was Yardbird's signature dish, the fried green tomato BLT.  And believe me when I say that this dish is totally worth the hype.  Perfectly fried tomatoes (without an iota of extra grease), nicely smoked and crisped pork belly, smoky and spicy tomato jam, fresh and crispy frisée, pungent pimento cheese, and tangy pickled lemon vinaigrette make every bite a party in your mouth.  The flavor in this dish is just out of control.

I was already almost full after these appetizers, so I opted for something (quasi-)healthy as my entree -- the farmers salad, with a side of fried chicken on top.  The salad itself was excellent, with abundant fresh veggies and a hard-boiled egg for protein.  But the superstar was really the fried chicken, which was some of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  It beautifully crisped on the outside, juicy on the inside, and coated with a wonderfully peppery mix of spices.  Total perfection all around.

My friends each loved their entrees.  One had the shrimp and grits, while another had the special of the day, which was a gluttonous mess of fried chicken, buttermilk biscuits, bacon, and gravy.  You know it's a fantastic meal when everyone is so enamored with their dish that nobody wants to share.

Another plus is that the prices at Yardbird are surprisingly reasonable.  Most brunch spots on the Strip charge twice as much for food made with half the quality and care.

Yardbird is just fabulous.  It's probably my favorite casual spot on the Strip these days.  I foresee additional visits here in the (hopefully) not-too-distant future.",7,3,5

I believe during the week they have a happy hour from 4-6, but we went on a Sunday night so no happy hour specials. Either way, the food and drinks were very tasty.

I went with two other people and we shared some of the small plates\/appetizers. The jalapeno corn bread with the butter is so flavorful and just the right amount of jalapeno heat (definitely not spicy) and a very large portion to share. Be warmed: it does have bacon it in but easy to navigate around if you are picky like me. The mac n cheese is totally worth ordering double. We all managed to get 2-3 big scoops of it. The carrots were something different and I'm glad I ordered them. Very flavorful and a bright, fresh dish. The tomoato salad dish was good, but not my favorite out of everything. The tomatos are warm, so it's not a traditional salad but more of a side.

My friends shared the fried chicken plate which came with 4 pieces and a hot sauce. I don't eat meat, so I did not partake, but they were very pleased and the dish is large (so enjoy sharing!). 

I ordered the half sweet, sweet peach tea and it was perfect. Usually sweet teas are TOO sugary, but I'm glad they were able to make it half sweet. 

Unfortunately, I had to rush away because I was going to be late for a show, but I will definitely order their dessert next time. They have a peach cobbler they tell you about before you order that takes about 25-30 minutes. Their other desserts sounded great too and all for about $10 each!

Now, about the meal. Look, I am writing this review approximately 6 months after dining here and I still remember how good my meal was. I opted for the chicken and waffles and it did not disappoint.  Juicy chicken that was seasoned so well throughout and hard to put down. A waffle with the perfect texture which was soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside with bits of cheese throughout. I didn't care too much for the bourbon maple syrup because it was too strong and overpowered the delicate waffle. I also can't say I cared too much for the chilled spiced watermelon though. I like my watermelon in it's natural state with nothing added to it. Whatever they flavored it with made it more savory and just didn't mingle well with my taste buds.

The menu looked interesting from outside so we went in and got a table in record time (though the place was pretty busy) for 4 people. 

Service: Can I do 20 stars? Hatch, our server, was incredible! Just the right amount of everything. Great personality, super knowledgeable, visited the table exactly the right amount. We had to hug him when we left because we instantly loved him. And the manager came to hang out with us and tell us the history of the place when we asked for him in order to convey our adoration for our server. It was a fabulous experience.

Food: We ordered one of everything that looked good on the menu, and all 4 of us ended up rolling out the door totally stuffed and groaning in ecstasy.

First, our less favorite items:
Warm Farmer's Cheese: It was good, but not to die for. And with all the other totally incredible items, I almost forgot about it.
Heirloom Tomatoes with ricotta cheese: Again, tasty, but nothing incredible. A little too much salt on the tomatoes considering the bed of ricotta which is also salty.

Okay, here's the amazing stuff:
Buttermilk Biscuits with Ham and Brisket: All the flavor in the world, amazing and delicious. I even stole a bite from my husband when he wasn't looking because I couldn't get enough.
Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad: The perfect amount of everything. Grilled mango is my new favorite fruit.
Iceberg Wedge: Incredible bacon and avocado on this salad. The name sounds boring, but it was so good we actually cleaned the plate dipping the BBQ chicken in the small amount of dressing left.
Smoked Backyard BBQ Chicken: The chicken was a little dry (smoked, not baked, so totally expected) and was perfectly flavored. The charred okra was so tasty and perfectly done (it's too easy to screw up okra)
Cornbread with jalapeno: Not spicy at all, just a hint of the pepper flavor without the bite. Went perfectly with everything.

Bottom lines: 
Don't be a vegetarian at this restaurant, you'll be missing out. They do meat, salad, and biscuits the *right* way. 
Order all the things that look good, you won't regret it.

The web address says it all.   Bye bye Mr. Clucky.  

Yardbird is a farm to table eatery serving up prettied up versions of Southern classics in a loud, jovial, communal environment.   True to it's Southern roots, there isn't a thing healthy about the food.  All the fat and fried goodness one expects.  It translates to flavor and that's a good thing.

To our fine, feathered, friends, from the beginning, the deviled eggs.  The simple 70's starter brought to the 21st century with the addition of trout roe mixed into the yolky filling.  Good textural contrast, the brininess adds complexity to what is usually a boring dish. 

The other standout starter, the chicken liver toast.  Similar to the Italian counterpart, enriched with butter and fat, spread over grilled bread and topped with a fresh, pepper relish.  Earthy, minearly...oh heck, its just good eats.

Moving along, do not pass on Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken.  Chickeny free ranged meat picking up moisture from a long brine, perfectly cooked to crispy perfection.  The slight spice of the crust accentuating the natural sweetness of the bird.  The accompanying honey hot sauce is excellent.  Might not be for the purist but it's good.  Take the same chicken and serve it up in a flaky, moist buttermilk biscuit or along side an aggressively seasoned cheddar cheese waffle with bourbon infused maple syrup and spice infused watermelon.  Any way you have it, it's great.

Friendly service that still needs some polish.  This has been improving with each successive visit.

Well chosen wine list and beer selections at extremely high Vegas resort markups.  Pass.  Opt instead for one of the great southern classics or better yet, a few fingers of bourbon.  To the Pappy's fans, this place has them all.

Which came first?  The chicken or the egg?  At Yardbird, it doesn't matter.  Neither is safe.",22,18,23

Make a reservation! For a Wednesday night in Vegas, it was packed even at 8pm. Reservations are easy to make.

Server was good and a new manager in training named Joe came by to check on me, which I appreciated. 

Ok here is what I had:

Angus burnt end - it was appetizer sized (4-5 burnt ends and 5-6 tater tots). This was ok but did not stand out. The burnt ends had decent flavour but the price and for what you got, I wouldn't order it again. 3.5 stars

Southern Revival cocktail - I like cocktails and this was good. You can taste the basil and the passion fruit as well as hints of the liquor. It was sweet but had a tart aspect to it which cut through the sweetness. Good 4 stars

Fried green tomato BLT - this was good. It had the right amount of spice in the deep fry coating around the green tomato, and the tomato was still hard inside after being deep fried. That texture mixed well with the rich and soft pork belly. All the other ingredients helped to bring the dish together. 4 stars

Lewellyn's Fried chicken - comes with 4 pieces of chicken and this is what I came here for. The coating on the chicken was great. Perfect amount of spices. The chicken was moist inside (due to the brining process I assumed). Great dish overall and well executed. 5 stars

The price point sits a little higher than it should, but if those winnings are burning a hole in your pocket, it's definitely worth a try.

Let me start by saying the Fine Fried Chicken is a pinnacle of fried chicken. The skin crisp and light, but potent with spices; the meat was tender throughout, even the breast (we surmise it's been soaked in buttermilk) -- BUT, for $27 for 1\/2 bird, the concept seems underdeveloped. The only accompaniment was a dilute Tabasco\/honey mixture, but that seemed like an afterthought.

If you do get the chicken, a side of biscuits is a must. The biscuits are heaven, as flaky buttery biscuits with honey butter are wont to be.

The deep fried green tomato BLT also had good and bad elements. The green tomato was wonderful -- thick, umami, and delicately battered. Unfortunately, the huge slab of pimento cheese unbalanced the dish quite a bit and made it very heavy.

Bloody marys are great! Served in a bell jar -- spicy, salty, with a slice of bacon (of course).",4,2,1

Now with a Singapore outpost flying high and more expansion soon to come it was once again on Friday that Yardbird continued to show itself as a standard-bearer for Southern Food and Hospitality, a party of five including four first-timers all impressed by a multi-course feast featuring three new savories and a half-dozen Desserts pending release as part of the new Fall menu.

Undeniably a fan of the restaurant, and as such apparently in good company as this visit once again found Yardbird packed to capacity while it's 50 Eggs neighbor and several other spots along Venetian's Restaurant Row were less than half-full, it was moments prior to 7pm that guests were sat at a high-top in the front section, drinks ordered a la carte while the Menu was prix-fixe crafted by Chefs Sandra, Keris and Joe.

Now marking the sixteenth visit in what will soon be three years, the sustained popularity of the space a testament to both the concept and the quality in a city where dozens of restaurants come and go in half as much time, it was with Cocktails and Tea in hand that the night got started with several classics, the Buttermilk Biscuits still reigning supreme while the BLT and tricked out Deviled Eggs were as delicious as ever, as were the caramelized Brussels Sprouts and a fried platter of Seafood including flaky Fish, jumbo Shrimp and sweet Crawfish Tails.

Presenting some dishes in larger portions than the menu versions, though most entrees remain more than capable of feeding at least two, it was with an oversized plate of the Shrimp n' Grits impressing all present that NOLA-classic Etouffee additionally made an appearance, the smoky Roux clearly time a time-consuming endeavor given its complexity and smokiness while the house Short Rib remains as meaty and tender as ever atop Cauliflower Puree buried beneath a blanket of blistered Corn.

Looked after by a team of servers, the same thin fella' as last visit happy to take on the role of southern gentleman in playing up an accent throughout the evening, course four saw Yardbird's signature dish broken down into three separate plates along with Cornbread, the 27-hour Brined Bird, crispy Cheddar Waffles and cubes of Melon all dialed in while the Muffins were piping hot and lightly spiced, though not quite as impressive as the menu's skillet version.

At this point turning the show over to Keris Kuwana, her Las Vegas Dessert Menu soon to undergo substantial change after a trip to help the team open up in Singapore, it was with only one repeated plate that a half-dozen items were presented, the Popsicles not for the faint of heart as they pack a hefty punch of Booze while everything else was straight forward and delicious, the Donut Tree drawing a lot of looks thanks to the service piece while the potted Red Velvet has evolved a lot since it was first seen, the Vanilla Ice Cream layer playing well off of two layers of Cake while the Peanut Butter Pie is downright decadent even before a tableside pour of molten Chocolate.

***** Always a great time, both the food quality and the service continually impressive for a place doing such big numbers, Yardbird remains the reference-standard for Southern cuisine West of the Mississippi, a situation that seems unlikely to change even as John Kunkel and team focus on Global expansion.",6,2,3

We ordered the charred okra as well.  We were surprised to be delivered whole okra in a bowl.  It was ok.   Nothing special.  However, the cornbread is a different story.  The cornbread was served in a skillet, with melting honey butter on top.  It was moist, with little corn kernels inside. 
Definitely not for those on low card diet. 

Since it was my husbands birthday, we ordered a slice of butterscotch cake, mostly because we were curious how bacon frosting tasted.  A huge slice of cake was served to us.  It looked wonderful, surrounded by pecans on the bottom and in between the cake layers.  The cake and icing were non descript.  Nothing special, with just bleh flavor.

After making some reservations on Open Table for 6:30pm we were expecting to arrive on time. Unfortunately traffic that night was a disaster and missed the original time. Ended up calling the restaurant to move the reservation 3 times! They were friendly on the phone and super understanding. Once we arrived around 7:20pm we we promptly seated in the front of the restaurant.

The decor was super cool! Staff was more than just friendly, they made us feel like a valued customer, not just a another tourist. The conversation we had with the Scott (the manager) was genuine. 

The Food: The chicken, shrimp and grits, green beans, mac & cheese and corn bread! 
The breading on the chicken was light and crisp! The shrimp and grits was my favorite. Totally forgot that Scott had brought us the fried green tomato with Pork belly... A M A Z I N G!

I am known by family and friends as a 'picky' Easter, but I prefer to look at it as dedicated to delicious food and not willing to compromise. Knowing that I am selective where I eat, Yardbird is AMAZING! 
There are plenty of places to eat in Vegas, but this place was so good we ate there twice. They are known for their fried chicken and for good reason, it was juicy and flavorful. The first night we ordered the Deviled Eggs as an appetizer and they were phenomenal. My wife and I ordered the chicken to share along with the four classic biscuits, and green beans. It was all very good. The meal was excellent other than the green beans and they were okay. 
The second night we ordered the fried chicken with an extra chicken breast because I was extra hungry. We ordered the classic biscuits again because they are amazing. Instead of the green beans we ordered roasted cauliflower and it was really good. We also ordered the mango salad and added grilled shrimp which was superb. Service both nights were excellent.

The 5 star customer service was evident from the moment we sat down. One of the managers came over and gave us a few of his menu favorites: the fried chicken, the southern Caesar salad and the peach cobbler which is made to order.  His description of the Caesar salad had my mouth watering so I tried that as an appetizer. We also added the deviled eggs to our pre-dinner meal. The salad was so good I may have dreams about it but it was the entrees that had our eyes rolling to the heavens they were so good!

I shared the fried chicken which is marinated for 20 plus hours with my cousin and we both agreed we never REALLY had fried chicken until that moment. I usually douse my chicken with hot sauce no matter how good it is and let's just say the hot sauce virtually remained untouched. I don't know what there secret is but suffice it to say the chicken was amazing. I paired my fried bird with pan fried okra topped with cheese which was magical.  

My other cousin had the fall-off-the-bone short rib and we shared both biscuits and corn bread. The only thing that was just okay was the macaroni and cheese but everything else was so good it really didn't matter. We also attempted to share the peach cobbler which was also quite good but we.were.so.full. We couldn't really smash.

They serve a buttermilk biscuit with sweetened and apple butters. In a word ... DELICIOUS!!!! The biscuit is so light and fluffy and made to perfection. I don't order a lot of fried chicken because I've learned that it is rarely as good as folks think and bread is generally something to keep you company while you wait for your meal. And, while the meal, in general, was very, very, very good, the chick and biscuits are unmatched. I didn't care as much for the watermelon they serve with the chicken and waffle - nothing special but not an issue because the portion sizes are so large. The deviled eggs and collard greens (which are served with fresh pork rind on top) has just the right bite, seasoning, and heat. Six of us ate dinner at Yardbird last night so we had an opportunity to taste each other's food. All I can say is you would do yourself a HUGE disservice if you came to Las Vegas and didn't check out Yardbird.

The only negative (for lack of a better term) was the wait - even though we had a reservation it took a while to be seated. Although the decor is amazing and they have created a nice smoky lounge type feel, the dining tables are far too few.",0,0,0

Started off with the special of the day. Which was ribs and fried chicken. then we had a couple of sides to compliment that. The fried pickles were my FAVE! I had a sparkling wine to compliment the Ribs and Fried pickles as suggested by our server as my boyfriend had blackberry bourbon lemonade. Each quenched out thirsts. 

I enjoyed that after each item was brought to our table*well presented by the food runner* and we FINISHED the dish the server came back and asked how did we enjoy it. Although one item was not to our satisfaction(mac n cheese) I know it was just a work in progress because I know how their mac n cheese tastes(AMAZING), coming from Miami and going to the location there. Upon telling Christian about this slight problem less than 2 mins passed and the General manager Gregg came by to apologize. Super sincere and real he was about the situation made me feel that much better that they are always on top of things and wont let something as small as my mac n cheese pass them by!

They have the southern thing going which is always correlated with hospitality. The designs in this place has southern touch: projector on the right showing still shots of famous musicians or just anything south, the music playing older country\/blues\/jazz, the jar covered lights on the next room, the big wood tables, etc. They also have a lounge area where if you prefer to eat, they have tables to serve food on. 

So enough about the looks, what about my experience. To say the truth, I expected more from this place. I ordered their ""famous"" Chicken and waffles, wife ordered their burger that comes with fries, a beer and mix drink, and the BLT appetizer. Our appetizers did come early. The appetizer was good tasting 'cause of the thick bacon and sauce they had on it. A part of me think it would have tasted better if the bacon and fried tomato was freshly cooked and served; it got to the table, not warm anymore. 

Next were the drinks. You'd think it'd come early, but it didn't. After the appetizers, it took 20 minutes before our drinks came: a beer and a mixed drink, which was not hard to do at all. 

Then came our main entrée. I had to check my watch several times as to the fact that our drinks came that late, it felt as though the meal was going to be late as well. The manager noticed and reassured us that the food will come in a couple of minutes. I thought that was great. I saw him actually go to the kitchen to check on the food. And the food came couple minutes after and he helped serve the food, which was a nice gesture. Food came about 30mins after the order was in; so in terms of waiting, overall, 6\/10.

So how was the ""famous"" fried chicken and waffles? I can say that I expected more. The breading on the chicken was made well and chicken was perfectly fried. But it came to the table not even warm anymore. I didn't expect how it tasted; it was bland, like chicken defrosted, then breaded, and fried. It didn't taste like they had time to brine it, hence couldn't taste the chicken at all. Even when it had the hot sauce on the side, dipping the chicken, I could only taste the sauce, not the chicken. I had a drumstick, a wing, a thigh, and a breast. I thought it was just the drumstick that didn't have flavor; all didn't. The waffles also didn't come warm. Was it great? I can say it's so-so with the whiskey syrup. I tasted my wife's fries and those were freshly made and hot, as well as her burger.  I saw how the others were served after us and I think the manager tried to correct this for the others as their drinks and food came on time.

The fact was, chicken and waffles were the ones RECOMMENDED by the waiter, but it failed to deliver. A southern looking place where their overpriced signature chicken and waffles didn't taste great. That's how I'd remember this place. I've been to lots of places where they serve fried chicken. Hattie B in Nashville tasted way better. And for the price as well, it pales in comparison. Order something else from this place and NOT the ones recommended by the waiter to be sure you get a warm meal.",0,0,0

We went for brunch last Saturday.  The first warning sign was when the food arrived ~5 minutes after we ordered it, before our drinks were made and before I had a chance to unroll my napkin.

My best guess is that the kitchen had batch cooked certain items to handle the weekend crowds.  Unfortunately, this affected the quality of the food.  The waffles from my chicken and waffles were room temperature at best and tasted bland.  The fried chicken was tasty, but nothing extraordinary.  My husband's biscuits and gravy was a very small serving of tasty (but not outstanding) food.

Deviled eggs: Bleh, it was mediocre. I was expecting deliciousness.

Chicken n' watermelon n' waffles: My favorite! The chicken was perfectly seasoned and fried, juicy and delicious.

Shrimp and grits: tasty, I wasnt a big fan, but my husband was. I thought they put too much sauce and it masked the natural flavors of the shrimp and grits. 

Mac n cheese: its mac n cheese, good flavors and very cheesy!!

Bone marrow: DELICIOUS!!!! This was actually my favorite. I probably can eat 3 orders of this. Yummy, delicious fatty marrow on perfectly toasted bread and that jam. Mmm!!

We came back for lunch two days later and ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich, perfectly seasoned and filling.

The acidity of the green tomatoes cuts through the salty and fatty goodness from the pork belly. Interesting flavor and texture contrast in a bite or two. 4\/5

Deviled Eggs:
It is because of these deviled eggs that I found out what I've been missing out on. Delicate egg white with fluffy egg yolk with mustard and spices, topped with salty roe. I'm addicted! 5\/5

Chicken Biscuits:
Crumbly warm biscuits lightly drizzled with honey on top. The pepper jelly is a nice touch. A pretty thick cut of breaded fried chicken in between. Delightful! This is what I always get if I have plans of stuffing my face with their other delicious food. 5\/5

Mac and Cheese:
Overflowing with tasty cheesy macaroni with a mild heat. It is topped with bread crumbs for texture. 4\/5

Chicken n Watermelon n Waffles:
Perfectly seasoned and cooked chicken. The inside is tender and juicy. The outside is crunchy and has glorious flavors. The waffles are savory and come with a bourbon maple syrup. All that comes with a side of seasoned watermelon cubes. They just totally 1-upped everyone else's chicken and waffles. 5\/5

Maple Bacon Doughnuts:
These are only served for brunch. They're small, light, fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth, sweet and savory rings of fried dough. It comes with a side of maple glaze to dunk your doughnuts in. The best maple bacon doughnuts in this town! 5\/5

-        The melt-in-your-mouth biscuits with the homemade apple butter were also a winner.

-        Fried green tomato with bacon--an addictive combo of salty bacon and slight sweetness from the tangy tomato

-        Brunch special Fried Chicken, Scrambled egg and gravy - I have dreams about this dish and wish I could have it for breakfast every day.

You know, new restaurants are typically on their game when they first open...so I thought let's do this.

We wanted a light lunch and the place was not busy so we immediately go a table. A good sign?

I ordered the Florida Heirloom Tomatoes salad. It was awful, oh I mean GOD awful. It was like a bowl of soup. Yes I know tomatoes are wet, but these 'cherry' tomatoes were old...wrinkly old and did I mention wet. I'm not sure I knew what to expect, with this dish, but it was the wrong grouping of ingredients, horrible textures and just inedible. 

I also order some roasted heirloom fingerling potatoes. 30 minutes after I got my 'salad' came the potatoes...not fingerling potatoes, but baby potatoes...(there is a difference) and they were swimming in oil. No real hint of roasting...but very very very oily...super oily.

As I become more aware of the food I eat...this was a waste of calories.

I hope they work out the kinks, but I don't think I'm ever going back...the best hint is to keep walking.",5,3,0

Considering the cost of a few mimosas and three entrees was almost $200 bucks I may have chosen something else. The service was good until the very end. We had a hard time getting our servers attention....I could see him standing at the register near the kitchen talking and laughing with someone for a long time which was annoying. 

We had:
The deviled eggs - standard tasting with the added trout roe making them pop a little. Without that though, kind of basic.

Chicken and Waffle - Really good, probably the best thing on the table that day. I didn't enjoy the melon on the side, it had a taste to it that for me didn't go with anything. The chicken was excellent and the waffle was good. I expected to taste the cheese a bit more but the hot sauce with the chicken and the syrup with the waffle were great.

The sausage biscuit - Its just that, On a plate and pretty awkward to eat because it was so large. 

The shrimp and grits - This was a great choice. Small bowl of grits with 6 shrimp placed around the top. Nice light meal.

The mimosa - very small, not very strong. Order something else.


All in all not a bad stop, just not wowed by the food considering the cost. I was also disappointed in our server after the food was delivered. (by someone else) I feel like he was just trying to collect a tip on a high costing ticket, the service at Denny's was a bit more attentive.",0,0,0

We ordered chicken-waffles-watermelon, shrimp and grits, biscuits, the farmers cheese, and a bourbon cocktail. Plenty of leftovers for two. The farmers cheese is lightly grilled and served on a thin slice of watermelon... Delicate and lovely. The biscuits are light and flakey, but substantial... They're jam and bourbon-butter are phenomenal!

i love southern food so i was intrigued.
unfortunately, most of the items fell a bit short for me.
i think i only half enjoyed every dish that we had.

country pork terrine - this was my favorite, i think.  the terrine was very rich and flavorful without being fatty and heavy.  the bread was nice and crusty.  the pickles were delicious.

kitchen pickle jar - another favorite.  i love pickles and their pickles are, again, delicious.  a nice serving of pickled cauliflower, turnips, green beans, mushrooms, peppers, carrots, beets.

warm farmer's cheese - basically a less flavorful feta, warmed up, over some not-so-ripe watermelon.  i can definitely do this better myself.

short rib n grits - the short rib was dry and overcooked.  the grits were pretty good though.

chicken n watermelon n waffles - greasy waffles just aren't my thing, chicken wing.  chicken was overcooked and it appeared that the oil in their fryer needed changing.  again, not-so-ripe watermelon.  if you're gonna have watermelon on your menu, please make sure it's ripe.  otherwise, don't serve it.  take it off the menu.  putting salt on the watermelon to disguise how not sweet it is doesn't work for me.  

skillet cornbread (cheddar, bacon, jalapeno, maple butter) - not very fluffy.  a little crumbly which is not my jam.  it could've used some jam, actually.  and then jalapeno?  there was no jalapeno flavor at all.  maple butter?  what maple butter?  all i could taste was saltiness from the bacon.  but i love cornbread so i half liked it.

Only truly exceptional experiences would motivate me to write a review.  

On Saturday, 6\/10\/17, I had one of my best (dare I say THE best) dining experiences (my basis for comparison is casual and fine dining on the regular as well as VIP events hosted by casinos).  If you have not dined at Yardbird on Restaurant Row inside Venetian--GO NOW--RUN--the food is fantastic (Com'on it's Southern Cooking = Deep Fried *almost* Everrrryyythang), and the service is phenomenal!!!

It was about 3pm, generally speaking, the lag time between lunch and dinner crowds, but it was Brunch-o-clock on a Saturday (I really hate waiting for more than 10-15 minutes for seating.  There are so many options in Vegas, that if you try, prompt seating is available somewhere.).  When in Vegas, you gotta gamble and just roll the dice.  My husband and I walked up to the hostess stand with no reservations and was offered immediate seating.  To two hungry people, this is almost better than winning at slots.

Smartly dressed in a black suit, the hostess was friendly and engaging while showing us to our table.  

She asked, ""How's your Saturday morning going?""

In a city brimming with tourists, participating in typical tourist activities, typical responses will vary from: 1) I'm SO hungover from last nite, 2) I lost $ XXXX, 3) I WON $XX.

I probably could have just been normal and responded with the standard polite response that we all have on file, ""Fine, thank you, and you?""  I'm not sure if it was low blood sugar, or I just really needed another human being to know that I battled a plumbing problem for 2 hours and was victorious--I stammered a bit and chuckled, ""Do you really want to know?""

Without missing a beat, the hostess replied, ""Sure, I'd love to know the real story.""

So I proceeded to tell her how my husband and I started this Saturday in a terrible way, entrenched in plumbing hell for 2 hours, but luckily, the problem was now resolved.  And we were tired and hungry, and ready to eat some delicious fried thangs...

Meanwhile, my ultra private and conservative husband was  giving me the side eye, which translated into, ""Why are you telling this poor lady our plumbing problems?  She doesn't want or need to know.""

You can't really end a conversation on plumbing problems--it leaves a bad aftertaste.  So we chatted about other random things, such as the fact that we were both servants to attention-needy little dogs who demand belly rubs by showing us their bellies.  Ah, that's much better.

Minutes after we ordered, the hostess showed up at our table with a beautifully plated Fried Green Tomato BLT and said, ""I hope this BLT will ease your troubled morning with plumbing problems.""

WHUT?!?!?

The primary job of a hostess is to seat customers (and to make small talk on the way to the table, sometimes possibly learning bizarre information such as plumbing problems, lol)--bringing a complimentary appetizer is probably not a part of her job description.

I was confused.  

Well, as it turned out, our hostess was actually the manager, Sarah Crain.  

MIND. BLOWN.

Having worked in the restaurant industry for over 10+ years myself, and dining out for 20+ years, I know and have observed that restaurant managers do not work the hostess station, especially not during lag time.

The manager Sarah actually seated us herself, rather than made us wait for the hostess who was already seating another party.  On the way to our table, affable Sarah engaged us in small talk and made us feel like welcomed guests.  She even gave us a complimentary appetizer to soothe our plumbing woes.  My husband and I thanked Sarah profusely for her thoughtfulness--this small act of kindness lifted both of our spirits.

In a city that preaches hospitality, today, I experienced the GOLD standard.  Thank you Sarah for your warmth and hospitality--you made dining at Yardbird so magical, like a visit to Grandma's homecooking with love.

Please see the attached pics for the amazing food--they tasted even better than they looked.  And as already described in detail above, the service and hospitality at Yardbird is Phenomenal!!!!",0,0,1

First off I was blown away by the prices of the food considering it's southern food. Southern food is usually cheap or reasonable.  I didn't expect the prices to be as high as they are. However, I don't mind paying for quality food. I ordered the chicken and waffles ($36) shrimp and grits ($28) , and Mac n cheese ($10) for an appetizer . As soon as the server walked away from the table the Mac n cheese came out within 5 minutes . I thought to myself hmm that's kinda quick, but didn't mind it because it's Mac n cheese and maybe it's pre- prepared given its a side. So I began to eat the Mac n cheese which wasn't to bad, but wasn't anything special and holy cow the chicken n waffles is being served (approx 5minutes) . Now I'm concerned because fried chicken cooked to order should take longer. As expected the chicken was lukewarm as if it had been sitting under a warmer. The chicken was cool to touch and was soggy. I tasted the chicken and the chicken was very very average and to top it off wasn't fresh. The waffle was dry and had a bourbon inside. Terrible terrible mix. Approx 10 minutes later the shrimp n grits arrived . The grits were under cooked and hard and had no flavor like it it was nothing like southern style grits . The total bill came out to $86.00 . I wasn't pleased at all given the price of the food and quality. I will never go back. Eat there at your own risk!",0,0,0

We first walked into Yardbird to meet up with some friends after attending a convention. Upon walking in I was instantly impressed with their decorè. I am a huge fan of restaurants that make you feel like you walked into a completely different era or country. Onto their menu... the menu is a bit underwhelming as far as food options go if you are gluten free or vegetarian (me) but it was great for our group who all happen to enjoy flour and meat. When our server approached us she immediately went to clean the table rather than saying something along the lines of ""excuse me let me get this out of your way."" We also had to ASK for a menu rather than being handed one. When we were finally asked if we wanted something to drink, we responded that we wanted something non-alcoholic but she didn't list all the options and seemed irritated. I went ahead and asked if they had lemonade and luckily they did and they muddle the fruit and squeeze the lemonade fresh, so I was instantly sold. She then came back with my drink, and forgot my boyfriends; left and returned to tell us there is last call for food so we would have to order now - without clarification on why the restaurant would be closing hours earlier than listed on Yelp. I went ahead and inquired and she said ""I'm not sure when but we have a private event and I was told its last call now for food and drinks"" When I asked what time we would need to leave by she didn't know and would find out, but do we want to order? I went with their warm cheese and watermelon appetizer since I wasn't too hungry and the pictures of the salads on Yelp were underwhelming for the price. My boyfriend ordered the burger and mac and cheese as a side. Unfortunately the watermelon was so thin and light it wasn't rebought to even satisfy my moderately hungry stomach and it was too late to order anything in addition and we needed to ""rush"" to finish in time before getting kicked out for the close. Personally I think that anyone who shows up two hours before a buy out should be notified. Some of us like to sit, enjoy and communicate while we eat and drink, not rush through food in under an hour. Needless to say I left very displeased after this first visit. 

Second visit. 

Only a few hours later we stopped back in for the private event after hearing that a group of our new friends from the convention would be attending. I was not looking to drink but since there wasn't table service we went to the bar to grab something refreshing. I decided to go for a tea and was pleasently surprised that the bar back left the bar to the kitchen to fetch me this lovely tea kettle hot tea and entire box of tea bags to choose from. They also brought the kettle out with honey and a variety of sweeteners. 

Pros: 

-Ambiance 
-Unique Menu 
-Amazing Tea 
-Fresh Blackberry Lemonade 
-Great bar staff customer service even those who weren't drinking alcohol

Cons: 

-Limited gluten free options
-Poor server customer service
-Not enough notice that they were closing early 

All in all I would come back for the appetizers and tea but it's not likely that I would choose to eat here since there aren't many options for me and their salads didn't look appealing from the photos.",1,0,3

The treatment of the bird.  26hrs of brining makes for tender delicious flavourful fried chicken.  The waffles: crispy on the outside.  Fluffy on the inside.  Perfect combination.  A side they add to the plate: spiced watermelon.  Honestly I wasnt crazy about the watermelon and didnt finish it but I can see the appeal.  Sweetness of the watermelon combined with what tasted like a cajun type of spice and then there was a weird sour taste to it.  Tried 3 cubes to see if my opinion would change after the first 2.  Nothing wrong with it.  Just not my taste.  Omg the cornbread i LOVED.  Comes in a cast iron pan topped with a giant dollop of butter...melts...drools...  Collard greens and chicharons... did i spell that correctly?  It was the perfect level of heat for me.  Could have used a little bit more acidity but was yummy.  Service was impeccable.  The lady that was our server was super attentive.   Checked on us a few times.  Not annoying or obnoxious at all.  Just right.  The managers on site (2 of them) both checked in on us as well.   Normally with 6 check ins by wait staff and managers combined would really annoy me but this was a different feel.  Definitely going back to this place!,2,0,0

As we walked in, hostess didn't even greet us. She just said we are setting up your table and it'll be ready soon. She sat us in a very small table and their were three of us. No big deal...as we were excited to try the place out. Server came and never introduced herself or really welcome us. Just straight asked if we been there before. After looking at the menu I still couldn't decide so we ordered 2 appetizers ( BLT and pork croquet). After a few bites, server came back and asked ""can I get you anything else?"" In a ..(are you going to spend more money or what) tone and facial expression. I said yes we are ready and please take the lady's order first. She took her order and was about to leave without taking or asking if I wanted something. I had to stop her so I can get my order in. 
So after 10 seconds...10 seconds!!! One of our entrees comes(chicken and waffles) I told the food runner that we just ordered it and can't be possibly done but she tried imposing it to us. I kept explaining that we just ordered it so I picked up the plate and told her take it back because she just dropped the aps no more than 2 mins ago. After finishing our aps, entrees came (chicken and waffles, chicken and biscuits, and shortrib and grits) dropped by a different runner and literally slamming the plates down our table. At this point, we were so irritated but hoped the food will make up for the terrible service we received thus far. I'm disappointed to say that the food didn't do it either. Biscuits, shortrib and grits were all dry. The chicken is good tho..crispy and juicy. Our server didn't check on us maybe after halfway thru our dinner and I really needed some ranch n bbq sauce and our waters refilled. A friendly busser checked on us and asked if she can box the rest. Then after another long wait our server comes, never offers dessert and asked if we were done..I guess so. We found out her name from the bill ( Nycole = terrible service ). Total came out to $150. Paid $200. Nycole dropped off the changed without an actual tendered receipt so we asked for one and even on that she gave us a hard time and gave us excuses how she can't do it. Lol sure Hun, I'm not stupid. I was going to speak to the manager as we were walking out but lady said don't worry about it and it's not worth it.

Alas no eggs on the menu, but we all got a great bloody mary (with crispy, crispy bacon in it).

Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles- we were planning on ordering some sort of fried chicken entree and the shrimp and grits, but our server informed us that this chicken and waffles dish was their most popular and that it'd be enough for two people. It was $36 for a plate of 4 pieces of fried chicken, watermelon, waffles, hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup. My favorite thing about this dish was the bourbon maple syrup. Drenching my soggy waffles in this made it taste a little better. I'm glad it came with hot sauce for dipping too, because the fried chicken definitely needed it since it wasn't that flavorful. I honestly prefer Popeyes chicken over the fried chicken here.

Mac n cheese- it was okay. We were expecting amazingness since the menu says that this is made with ""five artisanal cheeses"". It wasn't that saucy or cheesy at all.

Deviled eggs- soooo good. I've only ever had deviled eggs homemade at potlucks and never thought such a simple dish could taste this amazing. They make it with dill, chive and smoked trout roe here. I'm going to have to try to replicate this dish. Love.

We didn't even have to look at the menu, our server Jessie or Jessica (not sure what she goes by as her busser called her Jessie and our receipt said Jessica, but she was quite a character... had brunette hair done up in a really southern debutant style) was so knowledgeable, informative, witty and elegant she made us feel like VIP's at the chefs table, not to mention she was absolutely hilarious and went toe to toe with a few gentlemen in the group who had had ""a few"". She walked us through the menu, described several items and made recommendations and then when she saw us, group of 5 men all from different walks of life (business trip), struggling to figure out how and what to order she asked us to allow her to tailor our dining experience for us. Boy did she deliver! Deviled eggs, fried pickle spears, fried green tomatoes BLT, bone marrow...all amazing. Then came 3 salads, Ice Berg wedge with fantastic cubes of bacon and most amazing dressing made from a yogurt, tomato salad with peanut hummus, and a grilled mango salad followed by the best fried chicken I've ever tasted with an amazing sweet hot sauce, ribs (which they smoke right there), a spectacular short rib over grits (wish I could remember what the sauce was, it was phenomenal) and some sides, mac & cheese, charred okra, buttermilk biscuits and whipped sweet potatoes. We finished everything, Jessica knew exactly what and how much to order and didn't just try to push the pricy items to rack up a big bill to get a big tip like many servers would do, she truly wanted to please the customer and I can honestly say it was one of the best meals and certainly the BEST SERVICE I have ever had. The manager GREG stopped by our table close to the end of our meal and again, WOW WOW WOW, a true professional, very classy service!

There was a bit of a wait before a server a checked in on us. Normally I would have already walked out, but my love for Fried Chicken won over my impatience. Our sever Mikayla and the nice gentlemen bussing the tables won us over with their customer service. No easy feat to do with a guest like me.

To start off, we received the biscuits with butter and homemade jam. After tasting this, we automatically agreed to get some to take home. That is all I feel I need to say about that.

We had the wings for our appetizer. Good wings, not overdone and coated in their hot sauce. The hot sauce is straight to the point with a prominent vinegar taste followed by the flavors and heat of the chilies.  

For my entree I had Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken, the same chicken is present in the Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles. The crust is on the sweet\/savory side. I am biased to more salty\/peppery crusts, but this coating was still good. The crust was perfectly browned, had a bit of crispness to the exterior, and tender just underneath that crispness. The meat on all the pieces was cooked evenly. Both dark and white meat pieces were tender and juicy through to the bone. Everything you would expect from a temperature controlled deep fryer. I use the word ""juicy"" because several friends have issues with the ""M"" word when referring to something not being dry ;)
  
We had a deep fried Oreo dessert to finish. The coating on the Oreos was creative and the ice cream was good.

I don't have an incredibly refined or ""fancy"" palette, but I thoroughly enjoyed the entire meal. As a cheese lover, the charcuterie & cheese board was perfect for me! Also, it was enough to for the table to share before having entrees. As far as the main course goes, there was not a single complaint at the table. The fried chicken was crispy and juicy and practically melted in my mouth - incredible. The macaroni and cheese, grits, and biscuits were also very delicious and in good portions. The mac and cheese had enough for the 4 of us to share as well. I would also recommend the cheese & watermelon appetizer, which had a different taste than what I was expecting, but it was delicious nonetheless. Also, shout out to our waiter JULIAN!! Wow, he was pleasant and awesome. He had a smile on his face the whole time, seemed genuinely excited about the menu, and was very attentive and overall just an amazing waiter.

The mac and cheese is very good. Okra, not fried but grilled, was not our favorite (I think okra is best served fried but oh well). Sweet tea was ok but did not taste like authentic southern sweet tea to me.

The place feels equally at home in NYC as Vegas. The great smell of BBQ smokiness and the rustic chic light fixtures give this place a warm, welcoming character. The local list of beers always wins points with me. I don't normally go for fried chicken, or chicken anything for that matter, as it's usually a overcooked, dried out piece of rubber, but the fried chicken and biscuits were tender, juicy and flavorful. The pepper jelly perfectly cuts through the savory fat of the chicken and the buttery richness of the biscuits. Service is great. Everything just very on point. 

It's worth knowing there's a whole back dining area with full size tables. I was originally a little concerned we'd be eating on the couches in the front, but there's a whole back you can't quite see from the front of the restaurant.

Walking in the front room is dark and cozy with large couches and bar-height tables and being close to the bar can also be full and loud. 

We called ahead to make a reservation as some of the other yelpers mentioned long wait times without one. They sat us right away in the back room towards the kitchen. It had more light was somewhat quieter and had traditional height dining tables. 

My husband and I ate here for dinner and shared the warm farmers cheese and watermelon and classic buttermilk biscuit for appetizers. 

The Warm Farmer's Cheese is served on top of a cut of sweet watermelon and is soooo good. I'm not sure what farmer's cheese is, but it's so amazing I'd eat it on everything. My only suggestion is to give me more! For me, it would be a miss to come here and not experience it. 

I ordered the vegetarian entree, Gnocchi Pot Pie. It sounded amazing but when it came out it had so much fresh rosemary it was slightly bitter and I usually like Rosemary. I love that they make it from scratch in house and is served with half a biscuit above and below. I think with less Rosemary it would have been pretty incredible. 

My husband was a huge fan of the fried chicken and honey hot sauce. He says it will be his go to meal here.

There were a few hiccups, wrong drinks brought (on receipt said guest changed mind), had to ask for silverware multiple times (5 of us but only setup for 4).  They asked when making the reservations if we were celebrating anything but no mention of my birthday during dinner.  Not a big deal, but kinda funny to ask and then nothing.

Cocktails: Watermelon Sling and Southern Peach.  Both good and very strong. 

Apps: Deviled Eggs and Fried Green Tomato BLT.  I've never met a deviled egg i didn't like....until now.  They were extremely dry and tasted old.  Way to much dill for me.  Fried green tomato BLT on the other hand was great.  

Entrees:  Shrimp n Grits, St Louis Style Spare Ribs and Chicken n Watermelon n Waffles.  Shrimp n grits are my favorite food.  Anytime they are on the menu I have to order them.  These were good.

Not a single thing we had was good because every single thing was AMAZING. The fried chicken was so flavorful and not greasy, the watermelon was delicious and I don't even like Brussels sprouts but these, I ate. Everything was delicious.

Our waitress was amazing, the drinks were perfectly made and the food was worth every penny and the portions were huge. I can't say enough how good it was. 

When we walked in, they initially told us 2 hours to wait, but we could sit by the bar and still have the full food menu without waiting so that's we did. It looks to me like maybe the table was just smaller but there was literally no difference between the bar and the main dining area.

The biscuits had a more pronounced crust than mine at home, but they look and taste wonderful. To be blunt, they are more buttery than mine, & the apple butter is amazing, so hats off.
The chicken is to die for. Juicy & lightly breaded made this half chicken a delight.
The sides were great & the peanut butter pie reminded me of home.

Visited for dinner Tuesday night. Menu is pretty simple for food. The menu for alcohol is about 5 pages...

Ordered the chicken, waffle and watermelon plate, with sides of Mac & cheese, fingerling potatoes and chiken biscuts.

Mac & cheese was okay.  Fingerling potatoes were delicious and the chicken biscuit were moist and tasty.

Main course was awesome. Chicken was juicy and flavorful. Waffle was soft and paired with a chutney and maple burboun syrup really pairs amazing with the fried chicken. The watermelon was rediculous! Spiced watermelon with flakes of mint. Completely took me by surprise.

Wait staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Always had a full glass of whatever i was drinking.

Probably the only disappointing part was the mac n cheese, but that's more because we had chowed down on everything else by the time it was brought to the table. I'm not a huge jam fan, but I think they could have a successful business just selling bottles of that stuff. It's like an apple pie in a jar- apples with cinnamon on a hot biscuit, was amazing!

Our meal here was a symphony of flavors and textures out of this world! The drinks were strong and creative (Get the Southern Revival) and the food was just excellent.

I had made reservations ahead of time. My BF and I came her our last night in Vegas on a Monday night so we were greeted a seated right away. The decor was beautiful and very ""Southern"". Mason jars everywhere, little quotes here and there and there was even beautiful linen napkins on each table. The restaurant ambiance was just perfect, extremely cozy and inviting. The kind of place that made you want to stay for awhile. It was also immaculately clean. Once seated we were greeted by our server, given menus and time to think:

The menu is pretty awesome and we had a hard time not ordering everything... Though we tried (it was our first meal of the day and we were hungover = starving!). Most items are meant to be shared. We ordered the following:

APPETIZERS 

Frog Legs: These were absolutely amazing! The meat was juicy and flavorful and the skin was light, crispy and perfectly seasoned. The best appetizer we ordered that night. 

Roasted Bone Marrow: Very rich, unctuous, and savory. It went perfect with the grilled toast it was served with. I also took my BF's bone marrow V card! This was the first time he had ever had it! Now he's hooked!

Deviled Eggs: These were delicious. Super rich and the perfect amount of salt. They were HUGE. 

MAINS AND SIDES:

Fried Chicken: Of course we had to get the chicken. This was what they were known for. It was good. Juicy, Crispy and Flavorful. The hot sauce it came with was crack and I wish I had my own personal bottle to carry around in my purse. It wasn't the best I've ever had in my life but it is pretty high up there on my fried chicken list.

St Louis style Pork Ribs: These were freaking delicious. Juicy, tender, meaty and addicting. They had great texture and mouthfeel. The sauce on the ribs was just perfect, smoky and luscious. I liked the ribs better than the chicken!

Big Ol Cheddar Waffle: This was okay. A little too sweet for my taste and the cheese was overwhelming the waffle. I kinda wish the had a plain buttermilk waffle option. The bourbon maple syrup it came with however was wonderful and I used it to dip my chicken in. It was unlike any other maple syrup I've ever had... You can really taste the bourbon.

House Cut Fries: These were hella bomb. Super crunchy on the outside and fluffy like mashed potatoes in the inside. They were also seasoned perfectly... That bacon salt... Wow.

Service was good. Our server was very engaging, friendly and helpful. He checked in on us often and always made sure we had everything we needed. I also felt like the prices weren't bad, especially for Las Vegas. Our meal was pretty much close to perfect. Well played Yardbird... Well played... We will be back!!!",5,1,4

Basic fried chicken should not be spicy... unless of course, they say it's spicy on the menu. As a person who can't eat spicy food this was a huge disappointment. There is NO mention on the menu that the chicken is spicy and it is. Because of the spiciness, I had to remove the crispy skin with the seasonings, but to me the crispy skin is the true experience of fried chicken. The mac and cheese was delicious. The fried green tomatoes were good. Others in my party had the jalapeno corn bread and loved it.

Here's what I didn't like:  it was very dark. The decor was confusing. It was very modern styling for touting to be a Southern fare restaurant. Too dark to read the menu without my flashlight on my phone. No Coors light so we ordered Bud Light but the only size they served were huge cans. We split the LewEllen 1\/2 chicken and cornbread. The chicken flavor was wonderful but the pieces were small considering the $26 price. The LewEllen plate was chicken only; the bill was nearly 60 bucks for 4 small pieces of chicken and a small pan of cornbread and 2 beers. No salad no sides, those are extra. The waiter was very efficient but almost to the point where it felt more like fast food rather than southern hospitality which is not what we were expecting. The one redeeming quality was the manager stopped by our table as we were waiting for our waiter to pick up our payment. We told him about our experience and he listened intently. He asked to see our bill and told us he would make it right. Soon after he brought our bill back; he gave us the beer compliments of the house and cut the rest of our bill in half. In short the final price resulted in a fair price for the fare. This idea of a restaurant chain has so much potential but it's not there yet. It doesn't deserve to be ranked in the top 10 restaurant in the yelp list.",0,0,0

The reviews were so good we decided to see for ourselves. The restaurant is chic, but relaxing. When you first walk in there's a bar area, a couple of sofas and a few tables. The lights were dimmed low which immediately softened the mood. As you walk to the dining area, the lighting is brighter and there's a projector flashing old pictures on the wall. 

Appetizer - We tried the fried green tomato BLT. I'm a Mississippi girl so you know I've had my share of fried green tomatoes. This appetizer definitely had its own twist. It was smoked pork belly, tomato jam, frisée, pimento cheese with pickled lemon vinaigrette. That was a unique mixture, but I truly enjoyed this appetizer. 

Beverage - The Southern Peach cocktail was befitting with the comfort foods. It contained Old Forester 86, Aperol, fresh lemon & thyme with white peach purée and sweet tea. To top it off it was served in a mason jar with a 1 1\/4 block of ice. This just took me right back to my hometown. 

Entree - The shrimp and grits had roasted tomatoes, Virginia ham, nora mill grits in a chicken base gravy. Spoon licking good! 

Dessert - We did not have room for dessert, but we tried the butterscotch cake anyway. Talking about hurting yourself. This cake had bacon frosting, butterscotch sauce, toasted pecans and bourbon ice cream. The sweet and salty was a perfect combination.

The cheddar cheese waffles drizzled with the bourbon maple syrup was savoury and the chilled spiced watermelon was refreshing. My wife had the Blue Plate Special. She concurred with me on the Fried Chicken and raved about the biscuit.

With that being said, the highlight for me was the Skillet Cornbread. It was moist, warm and very tasty.  The portions were beastly so I begrudgingly had to share my corn bread (lol).

So when I realized that I was going to finally be able to try it out in Las Vegas I was excited.

The ambiance here is pretty cool: dimly lit, southern lounge kind of vibe with plush couches spread all about.  It sort of reminded me of one of my southern cousin's living rooms in Georgia.  You can opt to sit at a table here, but let's be serious-- considering how cozy the couches are, I don't see a reason to wait for a table or sit at the the bar on a hard stool when you can have fried chicken served to you on a couch.

Upon first glance at the menu my inner fat boy was overwhelmed with excitement.  Mac n cheese, pancakes, fried chicken, waffles, shrimp and grits, cornbread and not to mention an array of southern inspired cocktails that sound really good when you're not hung over from the night before like we were.  We opted for the fried chicken, cheddar waffle and cornbread.

The presentation of the plates at the Yardbird is great.  The plates look like your Auntie from the deep south who hasn't seen you in 15 years is excited that you've come to visit and because she's so excited, she has piled the fried chicken high on your plate and added extra butter everywhere because she loves you so much.  Meanwhile the flavors of the food here are kind of hit and miss.

The cheddar waffle wasn't very good at all, but the bourbon maple syrup that comes with it was really good.  I would have been happy with a regular fluffy waffle and not a fancy cheesey one.  The fried chicken left a little something to be desired.  The skin was crispy as it should have been but something about the seasoning was off.  I didn't really enjoy the chicken.  The plate also comes with watermelon, which by itself would have been nice and refreshing but at Yardbird they douse it with a little seasoning, that to me at least, is overkill.  The cornbread was just alright.

I left the yardbird slightly disappointed as my conclusion here is that while everything we ordered sounded really good, it didn't quite deliver on taste, but as with all things in Vegas, if you're drunk enough, you'll probably enjoy it!",8,2,2

Because we had a party of 12, a dinner reservation before 9pm required a huge deposit\/commitment. Thankfully, they allowed us to make a commitment-free reservation as long as we made our reservation after 9pm.

They had a private room set up for us. Despite us being separated from the rest of the restaurant, we were still given great service throughout dinner. I was dehydrated from the heat and drinking outside by the pool all afternoon, so I drank a ton of water - the waiter must have refilled my drink at least five times, but each time was prompt and I never had an empty glass.

The food: shared the shrimp and grits and the fried green tomato BLT. Shrimp and grits were just alright. It was decent but I've definitely had better elsewhere - I prefer my grits to be cheesier and softer.

The fried green tomato BLT was definitely the winner of the night. It was fried perfectly and not too greasy, and the bacon was savory and not overcooked.

Tried some chicken and waffles from another part of the table - decent but I'm glad I got the other dishes instead.

Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a decent place to eat on the Strip. They also have an extensive selection of whiskey - wish I could have taken advantage, but I was already drinking all day and night in between! Worthwhile if you're a whiskey lover like I am.",0,0,1

The ambiance is LOUD.  

My wife had to tend to our 15 month old in the restroom. Since we had never been here before, I wished our server had waited to go into her ""spiel"" about the place. She considered for a moment to wait but then changed her mind and went into it anyway. Seemed rushed even though the place was at 25% occupancy.

We were told that whatever we order will come out in the time that it takes to prep, so nothing will come out at the same time. I thought it strange that the kitchen would operate that way but new concept, new rules.

We ordered a couple of bloody marys and an old fashioned. Bloody's were ok. 
Tastes like they put pickle juice in the mix, meh not a fan. The old fashioned was good, but 2oz of liquid for a $14 price tag? It was gone in 3 sips. 

My son got a half glass of milk for $4.50

We ordered the skillet cornbread on the brunch menu that is prepared with bacon and jalapenos. MMMM! nope......

What we got was a lemon poppy seed cornbread that was like eating a muffin. 

Not what I was expecting. A manager did visit later to explain that on brunch they do things a little different than the regular menu but we wondered why the brunch menu had a bacon jalapeno cornbread on it if they were offering lemon poppy seed? 

My wife was having the BLT, my mom the offered omelet, and I was sharing a wedge salad, fried chicken with a side of mac n cheese and a side of bacon.  

The BLT and my side salad came first. The BLT was good. Pimento cheese rich, creamy. She liked it. My salad was good. I liked the deep fried bacon and dressing.

I ordered a Southern peach cocktail. This took some time to get. When I got it it looked watered down like it sat for a bit or was prebatched. The flavor was ok, but could barely taste the whiskey. I passed it on to my wife and got the blackberry lemonade. This was also ok, and I could taste the bourbon so it was worth finishing. 

Fried chicken, bacon, and omelet was next.

Half of bird, you get 4 pieces. The chicken was tender. You can tell they marinade it for 27 hours. It was lukewarm though, so I did not enjoy it as much as I wanted the $26 price tag to justify. I've had better (and hotter) from (and don't hate me) certain supermarkets.

My moms $16 dollar 2 egg omelet was also lukewarm. We wondered what held
up the order that both dishes would be (cold) lukewarm. We were hungry so we ate. I finished all my chicken by the time the mac n cheese arrived ( late & yet again, lukewarm.) You get about an 8oz scoop for $10. It was good, but still I found myself wishing it was (hotter) better.  

We declined on desert and I balked at the check total of $167.00 

It's not about the $$$$, I've been to Jose Andre's Bazaar Meats and was skipping out of there paying well over $400 for 2 people. It was THAT good. 

This experience felt like, I had just been had, if you get my meaning. It's like paying way more for front row seats when you could have gotten closer to the stage if you sat on the side that included a close up video screen to boot. 


We did find out at the very end of our experience that Yardbird had been open for just over a week. After opening 7 corporate restaurants myself, suddenly it had explained a lot. I wished then I had waited before going, but I was misled by all the daily ads on Facebook and certain Yelp reviews. The menu sounded like a slam dunk to me so I did little research. 

It seems like there are a lot of people giving out 5 star ratings like its free for this new concept. (One of the disadvantages of Yelp) I'm seeing a trend in them like they were written by friends or family of the company. Based on my experience, I find it hard to believe they could be legitimate this soon. 

Even if I loved the place, there are very, very few restaurants that I would rate 5 star. It gives legitimacy to the ones that really deserve it.  

Based on the price\/portion\/menu selection\/value factor I don't think I would return to Yardbird as I could get the same food almost anywhere at a fraction of the cost, and a fraction of the distance to walk from my car. Another strip venue that boasts higher prices with such little value.",4,1,0

My sister had a list of new restaurants to try out in Vegas and this one caught my eye.  I love me some Southern food!  We started with the Pork Croquette, which the hubs loved.  Great pork flavor and some good smoked ham!  We also had the Farmers Cheese and Watermelon app. Nothing to write home about, but tasty.  The main star of the evening was the Fried Chicken!!  So yummy!!  It ranks right up there with the Nashville Fried Chicken at the Fremont Diner in Sonoma, CA (which is the absolute best!).  We also had the Biscuits and Mac n Cheese.  Hubby and I agreed they were the BEST biscuits we've ever had.  The Mac N Cheese was super tasty as well!!

We wanted to try the Crunch N Munch bread pudding but our server recommended the Deep Fried Oreos and we were not disappointed!!  They were crunchy, tasty and a great sweet treat!  All in all, a great restaurant!  We have already started to tell our friends about it!",1,2,1

Fried chicken w\/ watermelon and waffles ($32): The fried chicken was full of flavor and quite juicy on the inside.  The waffles were good, but the whiskey syrup was definitely a bit too much...especially if you've been shootin' whiskey all trip long...

Burger ($18): I wasn't a huge fan of this burger.  While the flavors were good, it was too much.  This tasted like something you would order at the heart attack grill...full of grease, meat, bacon, and sauce.  I'm more of a traditional burger guy, though I do make exceptions.  Because they add pork to their patty meat, they have to cook the patty medium well, which made it dry.  For comparison, Slater's 50\/50 has the same concept but pulls it off better.  The fries that came with the dish were fried perfectly.  

While service was decent and the food was solid, the prices leave much to be desired but you already know that when eating on the strip so I won't deduct stars.  

3.5 stars for a nice addition to the strip.",7,2,3

We had a few special drinks... The Watermelon Sling and the Dark Chocolate infused bourbon, both drinks were a little pricey($15 & $19). As for our appetizer, the Fried Green Tomatoes with in-house slab of thick smoked bacon..OMG... this could be an entree it's so delicious. Trust me you would want a few orders of these it tastes so dam good. Great suggestion by our waiter Tracy, aka ""Hatch"" 

I had the Short Rib which had great flavor and it wasn't overcooked. The cauliflower mashed were delicious, it tasted like potatoes. We also shared an order of delicious collard greens for the table.

My group had a really nice brunch here - we all enjoyed our food, it wasn't *too* pricey (relative to Vegas), it was in our hotel, reservations were easy, and the service was great.

RESERVATIONS: Made for 10 about a month in advance for 11am on a Saturday. I called at 11am that morning to change it to 11:30am, and they were fine with that. In fact, it felt kind of empty there with plenty of tables open throughout our brunch.

THE SERVICE: Friendly, prompt. Overall great!

THE COST: $400 total (including tax\/tip) for 10 people. We got lots of sides, entrees, and drinks.

MUST-HAVES: Fried Green Tomato BLT for its uniqueness, Mini Bacon Doughnut, some form of the Fried Chicken.

THE FOOD: See my photos for additional details on the dishes below!

* Southern Revival (Wild Turkey 81, passion fruit, basil. $14) - 4 stars
Recommended after I said I like something ""light and refreshing."" This was perfect!

SMALL SHARES
* Fried Green Tomato BLT (pork belly, greens, tomato jam, house-made pimento cheese. $14) - 4.5 stars
Very unique! A really interesting take on a BLT, and it's really not like eating a BLT because everything's rearranged (and a really good way). The crunch to the fried tomato is intense and delicious.

* Deviled Eggs (fresh chives, smoked trout roe 'redneck caviar'. $10) - 4 stars
This had unique flavors and a variety of textures. Very tasty!

THE BIRD
* Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken (1\/2 free range bird, '27-hour recipe', honey hot sauce. $26) - 4.5 stars
Excellent fried chicken, and many pieces to share with the group! I love the breading - a thin layer of crisp on top of very moist meat.

* Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles (signature 'old school fried chicken', honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, cheddar cheese chow chow waffle, bourbon maple syrup. $36) - 4.5 stars
The chicken was great. The watermelon was old - lacking that crispness to a perfectly ripe watermelon (also the spice wasn't really there). The waffles were great (didn't taste the cheese). You get 3 things in one! Albeit it's quite pricey.

ODDS AND ENDS
* Skillet Cornbread (cheddar, bacon, jalapeno, maple butter. $9) - 3.5 stars
This was good, but it could've be more moist & flavorful.

* Mini Bacon Doughnut (maple glaze, bacon, butterscotch dipping sauce. $8) - 4.5 stars
Very tasty and rich! Definitely the soft yeast donut style, with stretchy dough. It's almost too rich with the dipping sauce, so start light with that to see what you can handle!

TODAY'S SPECIALS
* Smoked Brisket (picked onions and cucumbers, tomato jam, house bbq. $15) - 3 stars
The brisket was quite dry and flavorless. I wouldn't recommend getting this one!

* Country Ham (Vermont cheddar. $15) - 3.5 stars
This looks impressive, and the biscuit is moist and the piles of cheese tasty. However, what should be star of this dish - the meat - is quite lackluster.",6,2,2

I ordered the chicken n waffles n watermelon. Supposedly that's one of the more popular dishes. I gave up my reservation at STK to try this dish. Welp. I wish I had gone to STK. 

If you've had great fried chicken before then this fried chicken will not impress you at all. I was really disappointed. The chicken wasn't cooked hard enough and the flavor was non existent. 

The bourbon syrup was good, but the cheddar waffle was just okay. I ended up eating just enough to not be hungry, but I definitely wasn't happy.",3,1,1

It seemed to showcase much of their menu at the reasonable price of $40.15 per person. We had friends join us, our party of four was promptly seated in the center of the dining room for our 7:30 reservation. 

In addition to our restaurant week appetizer, we got started with Warm Farmer's Cheese & Watermelon ($5) it is a refreshing bite that is equally salty and sweet. A nice way to whet our appetite. 

Extreme richness followed with Deviled Eggs, the stiff peaks were topped with trout toe. The stunner was the Fried Green Tomato BLT. I've never had anything like it and it was mighty delicious. Crispy, creamy, salty, smoky... it was a fiesta for my taste buds. 

No one in our group opted for the shrimp & grits. Instead, we each had the 27 hour Fried Chicken and House Smoked BBQ Pork Ribs, with a side of Mac & Cheese and biscuit. We were blown away by the portion size. No one was going hungry tonight. The chicken is moist and it has excellent flavor - considerably better than most, but when it comes to fried chicken, I want crunch. Unfortunately the breading was soggy. Still, I liked it better than the Pork Ribs. The mac, was extremely cheesy. I cannot believe I'm saying this, but it was too cheesy. I wanted bits of bacon or jalapenos to make it more complex. Once I ate the crispy topping, I lost all interest in it. The biscuit was fantastic. I only wished there was honey or butter to slather on it.

It took us an extremely long time to receive dessert. We began to wonder if they were milking the cows to make the ice cream. I found the Apple Praline Bread to be worth the wait. Warm desserts with a cold ice cream is a weakness. The Mississippi Mud Pie was rather run of the mill. 

Overall, I was satisfied by the experience. It was a ton of food! Even if it wasn't all quite up to par. It is a fine choice to share some comfort foods among friends.",3,1,4

Deviled eggs came out chilled which was alright.  It was a bit of a ripoff at the price.  green tomato BLT was very good.  It's not a burger but literally thick bacon, frisee on top, and fried panko crusted green tomato on the bottom.  Very creative and tasty, though small portioned at 3.  The bacon had very fatty layers in it which was a downer.  Highlight was the half fried chicken which they are famous for. 4 pieces at $26 which again is not of value but it is indeed the best fried chicken out there.  Why? Even the breast meat inside was juicy.  Virtually no one could replicate that.

At Yardbird, it took five minutes from ordering to being served, which immediately signaled the fact that the chicken was fried in advance and kept in a warming oven. The chicken skin was soft instead of crispy as a result, like the kind you'd get at KFC. The chicken pieces were warm instead of piping hot. The french fries were limp too. For two orders of fried chicken and drinks, the bill was about one-hundred twenty dollars. Definitely over the top for mediocre, almost cold, fried chicken.

I like the upbeat vibe of the place. Seating is what I call ""community style"", so, if you're searching for an intimate dining experience, this is not it. You'll likely be seated side by side with your neighbor.

Service was okay until my server Tanya D got smart. Someone other then Tanya served my chicken and waffle. She was busy serving other surrounding tables, so, it took some time before she came back to check on me. When she finally made her way back to my table, I politely inquired as to whether the waffle was supposed to be served cold. Her immediate response - ""well, it WAS served a while ago!"" I knew by her sarcastic remark that we weren't going to get anywhere with this. I just smiled and said ""that's ok, no problem."" She must've sensed her inappropriate attitude and response because minutes later she reappeared at my table stating that a fresh new waffle was being made. Said the chef explained that it could've been cold due to the cheddar cheese. That's fine Tanya, but the slick comment you made was rude and uncalled for. You could've just offered an apology and offered to bring a fresh hot waffle in the first place. I explained that a new waffle was not necessary because I would not be able to eat it. I noted that I heard what she had to say in her original response to me stating my waffle was cold. Once again, she managed to get smart. Her response, ""Well, one is being brought to you anyway!"" At this point, I was ready to bounce. The chicken was good, but this chick was really putting a damper on my dining experience. 

Thanks for acknowledging my birthday Yardbird, but you guys sure know how to make sure a birthday celebration is ruined.

This place is worth a solid four stars...for the chicken, however, I'm deducting a star for the ratchet ""oh no you didn't!"" service.",5,6,4

The short review: Go eat the chicken. Man has long set out to put forth chicken such as Yardbird Southern Table & Bar's fried chicken! ...My love and I recently came in for an incredibly fun time eating some delirious food at Yardbird.

We were blessed to experience service from Tracy (AKA Hatch) on this visit, and we allowed him dictate our entire meal. As such, we started off with a Yardbird Old fashioned and a Southern Revival cocktail. The Old fashioned was boozy, but accented with maple syrup for a unique taste. The Southern Revival was special though--passion fruit meets whiskey in a perfect combination. Immediately following our drinks, the signature Fried Green Tomato BLT came out. This is a signature item for a reason. If you remotely enjoy fried green tomatoes then you would do well to try this. 

Our experience of signature items continued as we shared the Shrimp 'N' Grits and their world famous Fried Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles. These are both standout dishes, but side-by-side the chicken received a lot more love from both of us...succulent, juicy, moist, 27-hours-worth-of-brining flavorful, and encased in a perfectly crispy skin, this chicken is no joke. It carries a hefty price tag, but it's also absolutely freakin' delicious! The shrimp 'N' Grits were one of the better version you will find. The grits are treated with a pbr chicken jus that ties in wonderfully with the fresh seafood flavors of the shrimp. 

Our evening finished with the Velvet & Berries: red velvet cheesecake with sweet macerated berries and a cream cheese mousse. The red velvet cheesecake is spot-on, but the cream cheese mousse is ridiculously good.

Sometimes it's like they say, ""Second time's a charm."" ...on my first visit, I came here with friends for Yardbird's famous Fried Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles. We ended up sharing that as well as Deviled Eggs, Mama's Biscuits, Mac n Cheese, Country Pork Terrine, Short Ribs, Peach Cobbler and a few other smaller items. The Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles was the best item of the evening, but there was not a lot of chicken to go around for four people. In general, everything was good but did not leave the lasting impression that I encountered on my second visit. Both occasions confirmed that Yarbird is elevated comfort food...but that chicken...5 stars for the Fried Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles as well as the outstanding service of Hatch. Hatch could make you feel welcome in a viper pit, but his charm wasn't required to convince us that Yardbird Southern Table & Bar is an excellent choice!",22,17,25

I'd been to Miami earlier in the year and didn't stop at the location there and knew I would regret it if I missed my chance again! We ordered the bone marrow appetizer, shrimp and grits, fried chicken\/watermelon\/waffles and biscuits. Honestly, one of the best meals I've had.

We went as a group of five and had the chance to share a number of items.  Food was excellent.  The Kale salad is delicious if you want some greens,fried green tomato blt was great,  the biscuits are amazing, the fried chicken was incredibly moist and tender with perfectly crunchy skin and the bread pudding was delish.  I thought the deviled eggs were just okay, although my friends all seemed to like them a ton and I did not care for the blistered heirloom tomatoes(and I love tomatoes).  I found the prices to be fair, especially for a Vegas restaurant on the strip.  I'd give the  food a solid four stars.  

Service was awesome.  We had the best waiter whose name I don't remember! Brandon maybe? Super friendly, quick when appropriate but we were not rushed at all.  Totally helpful with what to order.  He actually gave us a recommendation for a chill bar to hang out at the next night.  They seated us at one of the tables right outside the kitchen.  It was super nice and fun to see all the food, but really too loud for our group.  It was difficult to hear one another.  It might be better if they switched these tables to four seaters instead of six.  If you're a group of five or more, I would not recommend sitting down in the main restaurant.  Really cool ambiance and decor.  The restaurant is a bit small-be sure to make reservations if you want to go.  

Drinks were good but largely bourbon based(in keeping with the southern theme of course).  I had the blackberry drink and it was a little bit strong for me but awesome flavor.  

Our bill was about $200 including tip for five cocktails, two salads, deviled eggs, two huge orders of fried chicken(we had some left over even) an order of biscuits and one dessert.  Since there were five of us, they were kind enough to add an extra egg and biscuit so we could each have our own(for a small charge).

It didn't end there...Maple Bacon Doughnuts, Skillet Cornbread, Granola, Shrimp and Grits, and Chicken Liver Toast showed up to the party as well. The birthday boy even got an Apple Turnover which was pretty good. 

The standouts for me were the Shrimp and Grits, and Chicken Liver Toast, with everything else not far behind. Fried chicken wise, it's not true Southern Style like Kathy's, but a modern brined version. Yardbird's was good, but my favorite is still Thomas Keller's version found at Ad Hoc\/Addendum\/Bouchon.

Service was great from start to finish, and the 5-star company made this visit that much better. It is located in  the Venetian so I don't need to tell you the price range of spots located on the strip...ALOHA!!!

We arrived about 20 minutes early for our 9pm reservation.  I was going to kill some time gambling until I realized I left my cell phone at Harrahs before we walked over. We rushed back to see if we could find it. I called YB to explain what happened and that we would be late. They were super sympathetic and understanding and said they would gladly hold our table. We arrived at about 9:20pm all flustered and the hostess staff were really great about reassuring us that it wasn't a problem and were very happy I had found my phone. Well the service only got better from there.  Our server, Mikayla, was the best. The perfect blend of knowledge of the menu, attention to our needs, and friendly personality with a great sense of humor. She gave us great recommendations, which you totally need when you want to order everything on the menu. Highlights include Fried Green Tomato BLT, shrimp and grits, Brussel sprouts, biscuits with apple butter jam, and of course their phenomenal fried chicken. It was all sooooooo good!!!  If you don't like Brussel sprouts, you have to try YB's. They are crispy and delish and they cook it with honey which adds the perfect touch of sweetness to counteract the bitterness of this vegetable. Heaven!!  
But as good as the food was, I will never return to a place that has bad service. Well not only was Mikayla awesome but we observed excellent customer service throughout the restaurant. For example, there was a couple next to us who were halfway through their meal. We chatted a bit with them and got some feedback about what they ordered and how they liked it. Well when the food runner brought out our Fried Green Tomato BLT as a starter. The man said, ""What is that?"" The food runner told him and you could tell the man was really upset that he didn't see this item on the menu and was regretting that he hadn't ordered it. However by this time he was about 3\/4 through their meal. Well five minutes later, that food runner came back with a small plate of just one fried green tomato BLT for the man and said it was ""compliments from the chef"". Well the man was thrilled and I thought ""Now that's how you take care of your guests.""  Very classy!!  But that was theme for the whole night, great atmosphere, delicious food and excellent customer service. Mikayla even compd our dessert. I can't say enough about this place and will definitely be back when we return to Vegas.",0,0,0

Chicken and waffles: one of most juicy fried chicken I've had. Waffles were really crispy. Goes really well with the fried chicken. Was told by our server that chicken was bribed for 26 hours.

In true Southern fashion, portions were huge and the food very rich (read: heavy). We started with the deviled eggs and those were very fluffy, creamy, and very well seasoned. Worth trying for sure, but perhaps didn't live up to the Yelp hype. I had the chicken n watermelon n waffles, and my favorite part was actually the watermelon. It had an unexpected savory element to it and was super refreshing. The cheese waffle was outstanding: moist with a hint of cheddar flavor. The chicken was pretty darn tasty, but I can't say it was the best fried chicken of my life. Eaten with the bourbon maple syrup and cheese waffle though, it was delicious, especially followed by a bite of watermelon. Overall, it was a good dinner choice and I was very full and happy. 

The bf, on the other hand, had the swine burger, and it was just okay. He didn't know it was a double patty, in addition to pork belly, and it had a generous amount of cheese. It was just too much. His fries were also overly seasoned as well. Lesson to be learned here: come for the fried chicken. We rolled back to our hotel room afterwards.",0,0,0

Heads up - Their signature fried chicken has every ""i"" dotted and ""t"" crossed. The flavor from the marinade is definitely infused in every bite and the hot sauce served with it compliments it like an exclamation point. 

The grits were super creamy and the short ribs, melt in your mouth tender. Don't let the menu fool you; the cauliflower mashed potatoes are mainly potatoes. Just the way I like it.

I have wanted to go to the Miami location for awhile and, once I saw there was a Yardbird in Vegas, I knew that was where our Saturday brunch was destined to be. Four of us went here this past weekend and had a reservation. 

We were seated promptly upon arrival at a comfortable table. The decor is homey with southern influence and cool lights made out of mason jars. Our server welcomed us almost immediately and took our drink orders. I had a Bloody Mary, of course, made with Tito's jalapeno-infused vodka. Full Bloody review is on my website (this one got a 97%!). Link is in bio.

For our meal, we had the chicken 'n' watermelon 'n' waffles for the table-- a dish that I have been waiting to try ever since laying my eyes upon Yardbird's menu months ago. It was AMAZING. The chicken is brined for 27 hours, which allows all of the delicious flavors to come together. We also had two orders of the smoked brisket and biscuits. The biscuits were succulent and buttery, while the brisket was tender. We also ordered two Yardbird bennys, which represented a new rendition on the classic benedict. It was served in a cast iron skillet and seemed more like a skillet than a benny, with biscuit crumbles, bacon, and hollandaise all layered in a pie-like situation. Best benny I have ever had and oozing with flavor. 

The ambiance, service, food, and cocktails were truly out of this world. I highly recommend Yardbird.",0,0,3

We got an order of the cornbread for the table. Came out very quick and very hot. For entree I went with the chicken, watermelon and waffles. The dish comes with a side of kicking hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup. The syrup was a bit much for me but it blended well with the chicken. I thought the waffle was only half at first but you do get a whole waffle they cut it in half. My sister had the chicken wings and mac and cheese. Probably the cheesiest mac and cheese I've ever had so that's a big plus. Our other friend had the shrimp and grits and was pleased. For dessert my sister had the butterscotch cake and I shared the velvet and berries with a friend. Veryyyyy yummy. Warning: the butterscotch cake is big!! Lastly to review: the chicken itself. Phenomenal. Coming from a semi southern household I have high fried chicken standards and Yard Bird met them no doubt. From the crunch to the seasoning to the meat itself.

One point off - The restaurant was way too loud, hubby and I had to lean over to each other's ears to have a conversation, which was not a bad thing btw lol. It was quite dim, we were seated at a high booth which was a bit tight with another table next to us. I am quite petite and found it difficult to get in and out between the two tables. 

The appetizers appealed to us more so we ended ordering five.
1. Fried Frog legs - yummy! It was served with sweet and sour jelly, and some bacon bits. Crispy just like chicken. :)
2. Fried Green Tomato BLT - served with a piece of crispy pork belly, a special pimento cheese mixture that tasted like mayo, all on top of the thickly sliced bread crumb fried tomato
3. Manchester Quail under a brick - The quail was delicious, soft and tender, even had a piece of liver. The green farrow was flavorful but be warned that the presentation does not look appealing ;)
4. Mama's Chicken Biscuit - the same chicken that's marinated for 27 hours but served with a biscuit. I love the house pickles that came with it. I wish I knew the secret recipe for the pickles. The chicken was very good but nothing that I never had before. 
5. Pork Belly - A piece of crispy sweet tender pork belly on a pickled relish with some hot sweet jelly. So delicious! 

Drinks:
1. Yardbird Old Fashioned - bacon infused Buffalo Trace Bourbon. Anything with bacon is yum! Very, very, very strong!
2. Southern Peach - Love the peach puree although couldn't taste much of the tea.

Service was excellent, Howard was all smiles, super friendly and cute lol.

I've had better marrow and it's not clear to me how one makes one marrow better than another. Just stating fact-pinion. I went for the full chicken dinner (i.e. no waffle) and a side of biscuits. Excellent biscuits. The chicken is very tasty. White and dark are moist.

This place does family style southern food (with a twist) and so the meals are meant to be shared. We decided to try a few things - chicken\/waffles, Salisbury steak (that was my husbands strange choice), with sides of Mac and cheese, cornbread and grits. It was WAAY too much food but we wanted to try a few menu items. We were informed some items require additional cook time. They do, however bring the food out as it ready so you can eat other things while waiting. 

The food was ok. Chicken was crispy and moist but lacked flavor. Waffles were waffles. The Salisbury steak had an overpowering taste and the grits were dense. We left a but disappointed - but for all we got it was only $100. 

The service, much like the food, was average. The waitstaff work together so various people came by to refill drinks, clear plates and bring food. 

Would we return? Probably not. We kept lamenting that we were not eating the delicious chicken and waffles from LoLo's (in the Phoenix area).",1,0,0

I bookmarked Yardbird, since we were staying at the Venetian and also for a nice place to go for dinner during my bachelorette party.  After drooling over the menu in the hotel room, the few of us that arrived early on the first night decided to get an early dinner at Yardbird.  The restaurant is very dimly lit, and has a cute sort of rustic meets mod decor.  Old southern clips (lots of Elvis) projected on the wall.  

It was so hard to decide on what to get.  Per the waiter's recommendation we ordered our own dishes, but shared.  We got the fried chicken ($27), shrimp and grits ($28), mac n cheese side ($10), and smoked chicken salad ($16).   Food came out quick!  The fried chicken was so moist and golden brown.  They gave us a breast, thigh, wing and drumstick.  It was very flavorful and the honey hot sauce was definitely hot.  The shrimp and grits had lots of plump shrimp and ham.  The grits were creamy and smooth.  The smoked chicken salad was deconstructed.  I told my friend the chicken kind of looked like a big brain!  However, it was very tasty.  The chicken was moist and was placed on top of a fried cornbread with avocado a light dressing and a little bit of frisee.  If you're looking for an actual greens salad, don't get this.  The mac n cheese was one of the best I've ever had.  Super cheesy without being too rich!  

This was pretty much our first meal of the day, so we refrained from over eating and refrained from ordering a drink, so we could drink appropriately later on.  The service and food were great.  It's the Strip so, higher prices are expected; would have liked if my fried chicken came with a little side though, like even a biscuit, but no biggie.  I definitely would come back here again for some more comforting southern food.  I heard they have not only a great dinner, but a great brunch too.

My husband and I each had the $20 lunch special, which was a fried green tomato BLT, two pieces of chicken, a biscuit, cubed watermelon, and creme brulee. We split an added order of deviled eggs for $10, which were good but totally unnecessary because we had more than enough food! There were two BLTs apiece, topped with tasty pork belly and pimento cheese. The tomatoes were plump and juicy, and they were a meal by themselves! Loved the chicken (although I've had better--and worse!), and I'm not usually a fan of biscuits but these were flaky and delicious. I wish dessert had more of a Southern vibe, like banana pudding or apple pie, but the creme brulee had a nice hint of coffee and was a pleasant end to a great meal.

Our hostess and server were both surprised that we were locals, and I'm surprised at their surprise! You would think more locals would have found Yardbird by now.

Not that I was let down, but I would not say I was overly satisfied either. This is mediocre food at best, with a great presentation. However, there is this thing called accuracy, and when you claim at $36 plate of chicken and waffles will serve 2-4, and it only feeds my 17 year old, that leads to major deception. 
Sure, the fried chicken is delish. I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich. But am I going to drive to the strip for a decent fried chicken sammy, no, it has to be extraordinary. I think that is the concept. To be above and beyond the average southern food. Add a twist such as the caviar on the deviled eggs. The service, the environment, and event the execution were all flawless. Between flavor and prices, I am just not that impressed. 
I have had southern style food in Arkansas at a diner, that tasted better. This is an overpriced Cracker Barrel with a few upgrades. Upgrades like $5 Mexican Cokes. When you pay .60 for something, you can safely up charge for it, but $5 for a small bottle, kiss my a%$. Wait, maybe that $5.00 coke included an ass kiss? Just maybe.

We got the chicken and waffles to share (very smart to share because we still had leftovers) .  Chicken was good, waffle was good but being a huge fan of the waffles at Roscoes if your waffle doesn't taste like there's it will never be amazing to me, but nonetheless a damn good waffle. There was some spicy watermelon bites that came with the plate which were also very good.  That syrup however just took everything to the next level. I think it could probably make just about anything taste the bomb! It was sweet, rich, buttery bourbon goodness. Just melts in your mouth.  

We also had the mac cheese which wasn't bad but it didnt have any crispy slighlty burnt cheese pieces which I weirdly enjoy.  My husband also said he had the best bloody Mary hes ever had here.  

I couldn't give it 5 stars due to price. The chicken and waffle plate was about 39 dollars alone. Ouch! Drinks were expensive too. I know its Vegas but I like my southern food with southern prices.  I'll still be back whenever I'm in Vegas. My new go-to!",1,1,1

(Cluck, cluck, cluck)"". I know my super chicken reference will go over most's head, but it drives the point home for what yardbird has perfected: the chicken! Even as I type this I can still taste it and that's a marvelous thing.

With a few visits now under my belt I can honestly say I would not go anywhere else in Vegas for fried chicken (well maybe if someone can prove better chicken exists). The Palazzo has done right here for sure!

I'm so in love with their brunch menu and it's a shame they only offer it on the weekends. Thankfully most of the items on that menu are offered regularly, but someday I will have returned for the maple glazed bacon doughnut which I've yet to have, but keep an eye out for that picture down the road. 

The first visit here I wasn't aware of the huge portions here so keep that in mind before doing a menu sample like I did (it caused me to have this as one meal the entire day). I began with their deviled eggs and I have to say these are some of the best around. As you can tell from my picture they are artistically presented and more important taste amazing! I can't quite put my finger on it, but I think it's the dill that made it burst out with flavor. Either way a must have item. Then silly me progressed on to the macaroni and cheese. The portion size will fool you as I thought it was small at first, but boy is that far from the truth. You'll be pleasantly plumped out and have to say the five cheese blend is the star here. Super gooey and another 5 star side for sure! If that wasn't enough I washed all this down with the chicken\/watermelon\/waffle trifecta. The cheddar cheese waffle surprisingly is not heavy and was perfectly crisped while still edging on the soft side. The spicy watermelon was definitely a new twist on things, but I thought it worked really well combined with everything. It gave the chicken a little kick while the sweet made you feel like you were on top of the world. The coup de gras here is definitely the fried chicken. It is moist as the southern humidity (hopefully that reference is understood) yet the breading is crisp as can be. 

On my recent outing I twisted it up and had lunch yet again was pleasantly surprised with their crunchy Yardbird sandwich. I hate to say it, but I know this will put the next chicken sandwich I have to shame. Oddly enough it's the hot sauce that made the meal pop. It won't lead you to guzzling down gallons of water so that's certainly a plus. Another highlight was the bun. It truly was like eating a pillow. It was so soft and soaked up all the sauce to perfection! In closing I finally saved room for dessert and went with their banana pudding, but certainly I will be back for the cobbler to see if it's worth the hype. The sad part is I didn't prefer it to come out in the mason jar as I did find it a bit trying to get every morsel and I did leave chunks of things I couldn't get to because of it which was depressing. All in all though it's one of the better versions I've consumed. The house made banana chip is to die for as it wasn't overly sugary like most I'be been exposed to. 

As I end this I can't help but flock to the same thought. The chicken is legit here and I am flapping wildly for a return visit sooner rather than later!",1,0,1

I was prepared to pay too much for fried chicken, but my expectation was that they would keep it authentic. The chicken was raw, and when we complained to the waiter he said it was because it was brined. We've had brined chicken before, many times. This was raw. He didn't remove it from the bill, as most good servers at most good restaurants would offer to do. He didn't care that it was Valentine's Day and we had a bad experience. 

We had the charred okra, which sounded promising but was soggy. The grilled romaine had barely any dressing and was overpowered by the anchovy croutons. 

The chicken liver toast was the best thing we ate, but it would have been better on crusty bread instead of limp bread. 

I can say only two good things about this place: 1) the wines by the glass selection was good. Most restaurants get that wrong--they did a good job. 2) the music they play is the only authentic thing about this place.

First of all, I had requested a booth when I made my reservation, and while there were plenty available, including a perfect one for my party of three, they seated us at a regular table top.  We requested to switch to the booth for three, though, and they were able to accommodate us.  Second, I later found out my Open Table reservation for our dinner was cancelled even though I checked in at the hostess stand (?), so I was not awarded my Open Table points and I now have to get this resolved :\/  This has never happened to me before!

Most of all, the food was just not that good.  We ordered their Deviled Eggs, Grits, and Chicken n Watermelon n Waffles.  I've had better deviled eggs from just about everywhere :p  The grits were just ok - nothing special about them.  While I was eating their chicken, I was wishing I was eating Popeye's Chicken instead :p  It came with honey hot sauce on the side, which made it less blah but it still wasn't all that great.  As for their waffle, I don't know if it was the waffle or the syrup or what, but how could you go wrong with a waffle?!  It left a bad taste in my mouth.  It came with some kind of relish on top.  I'm not a relish person so I only had one bite with the relish - the waffle tasted even worse with it!  Then there was the watermelon.  I love me some watermelon!  Not theirs though!  It was some kind of ""spiced watermelon"" - not for me.

Note: I like my food no frills and basic.  My palate is not too sophisticated lol.  If you're like me this place probably won't tickle your fancy too much.  Read the descriptions for the menu items and these dishes are not all that basic.  Was expecting things to taste better than they did, though.

Another note:  This place serves their dishes family style and it was more than enough for three girls to share.

While I wasn't crazy about the main part of our meal, the dessert was pretty good!  I had my heart set on trying their bacon-butterscotch cake, but one of my dining companions was set on having their ice cream sundae.  Luckily, we were able to substitute their hot fudge for butterscotch sauce :)  I forgot the name of our sundae but it came with a shortbread cookie, caramelized banana, caramel popcorn, and a couple of different flavors of ice cream.  Yum!!

My meal wasn't ready when the other two were so the waiter dropped off a piece of fried chicken which was so delicious. I would for sure order fried chicken the next time I come. Sadly we were all dieting so we didn't eat most of the crunchy deliciousness.

Unexpectedly, we were hosted in a private room to the side of the main dining room - I would guess it can accommodate 20 guests; a really classy space where the music can be turned down, affording easy conversation.

Our head server (and I apologize profusely for not remembering her name) was very professional, engaged and helpful, making great recommendations for appetizers. We all thoroughly enjoyed these with cocktails; the BLT (green tomato) was a standout. Also enjoyed the deviled eggs. Frankly, the servings were very generous and when it came to the main course a few hungry folks ordered while the rest chose to share a few things. Short ribs - among the best I have ever had!. Shrimps and grits - also A+. Honestly, for the money, in Vegas (really, anywhere metropolitan) this is a no brainer. Superb service, great beverages, not one single dish that we regretted ordering.

I asked to speak with the manager simply to pass on my thanks - he was very humble and professional; I'd come back in a heartbeat.

Even if you can't get the private room I'd recommend dining here, but be aware that the ambiance and noise level in the main dining room is lively - conversation for a party of 4-6 or less would be OK, more than that you'd want the private room.,,, and Kudos to the Yardbird team for recognizing this and putting us in the private room.

Overall Highly Recommended.",3,0,1

Atmosphere- When I stepped in, I felt as if I just stepped into an up-scaled modern southern restaurant. I saw the wine cellar to the left filled with the most beautiful glasses of wine, there was plenty of room for our table to navigate in between the tables and not disturb anyone while they ate. It was perfect. 

Food- I got the chicken and waffles (pictured). As a California native, i'm definitely used to gauging the amazingness of these types of dishes with Roscoes chicken & waffles in mind--- and safe to say it definitely was up there with its authentic southern flair! The seasoning and crispy skin was just amazing and so savory. The waffles and syrup was just absolutely delicious as well. 

Service- The server was very accommodating given that we waited for our other co-workers to make their way over to the restaurant. And when our entire party didn't end up showing up, he was quick to notice and get our orders.

Hahaha OMG YASSS so good! Definitely go. Haha so embarrassing I went 3 times in 3 days - but at all different times I swear! Lunch, Dinner, and Brunch.
So, first, obviously - the fried chicken and waffles. Delicious - the fried chicken is really good, but it's the combination with the kinda savory waffle + maple syrup, plus there's watermelon on the side...I ate it with my hands. No utensils. I had it at dinner, but I think it's on the menu no matter what time of day. There is an awesome salad that is only on the lunch menu - a low+slow smoked chicken salad. Like so good - it's more chicken than salad though, not a lot of lettuce (which I was kinda happy about) and there is a slice of pan-fried cornbread on the bottom that like soaks up the dressing. That smoked chicken is no joke man. The cornbread is good, but their biscuits are good too - I wouldn't be able to say which is better. The plain biscuits come with a homemade apple jam that is really good. At dinner I also tried the short ribs - which were good, but not anywhere near the chicken items so I'd stick to chicken haha. There is a fried green tomato BLT appetizer (pork belly!) that I got 2 out of 3 times haha. I didn't get any cocktails but they all sounded good.

Clearly I love food a little too much. Let me know if you like it!

A new-age southern style restaurant in the heart of Venetian.   Quite a few exemplary choices here, just with the strip prices you'd come to expect.

Let's start with one of the best Fried Chicken dishes you may encounter :

Chicken n' Watermelon n' Waffles ($36): Honey Hot Sauce, Chilled Spiced Watermelon, Cheddar Cheese Chow Chow Waffle & Bourbon Maple Syrup. The most tender and juicy fried chicken I've had to date, the waffles crisp and flavorful. I prefer my fried chicken to be full of spice, but this was an excellent rendition!  A bit spendy, but worth the go ahead with the large sharing portion.

Mama's Chicken Biscuits ($14): Free Range Fried Chicken, Pepper Jelly, House Pickles & Buttermilk Biscuit. Incredibly fluffy, buttery sweet biscuit with lightly battered chicken, moist and flavorful. Recommended!  I could eat these biscuits for days :D

Low & Slow Smoked Chicken Salad ($16): Haas Avocado, Warm Cornbread & Yogurt Dressing. Loved the cornbread texture and flavor, the chicken full of flavor and pairing perfectly with the yogurt dressing. Wonderful! 

Fried Green Tomato 'BLT' ($14): Pork Belly, Greens, Tomato Jam & Pimento Cheese. Succulent pork belly, fat rendered and buttery, with a nice crunchy cornbread and pimento pulling it together. 

Fried Bread & Butter Pickle Spears ($6): Spicy Salt & Spiked Dukes Mayo. Light breading, similar to Fish & Chips consistency. Dipping mayo very enjoyable!

Deviled Eggs ($11): Fresh Dill & Smoked Trout Roe. Well balanced and fresh, the roe adding just a hint of salt to finish

Chicken Liver Toast ($5): Grilled Country Bread, Cuke & Fresno Pepper Relish. Mildly mineral in flavor, the acid in the relish complimented well. 

Florida Heirloom Tomatoes ($16): Toasted Peanut Hummus, Basil, Smoked Tomato Sorbet, Field Shoots, Crunchy Puffed Ca. Dressing was very enjoyable with a nice addition of peanut hummus 

Macaroni & Cheese ($10): Torchio Pasta, Five Artisanal Cheeses & Crispy Herb Crust. Well rendered, just missing some spice to set it off from the cheese.

Country Pork Terrine ($10): Pickled Cauliflower, Grilled Country Bread & Whole Grain Mustard. Very heavy and lunch-meat like terrine, it paired well with the mustard. 

And for dessert :

Key Lime Donut Bites: Coconut Pudding & Mango Jellies. Interesting combination with the citrus, I enjoyed the pudding \/ mango jelly, light and delicate.

Crunch & Munch Bread Pudding: M&Ms Bread Pudding, Popcorn Ice Cream & Candied Pretzel. Incredibly sweet, the bread pudding was thick and rich, almost brownie-like.  A bit too sweet for my tastes, but one can figure that out reading the ingredients.

Bacon Butterscotch Cake: Pecan Pie Filling & Bourbon Ice Cream. Delicious cake, fair bacon flavor throughout, with a very crispy bacon piece for garnish. Good! 



Stick with the fried chicken, biscuits and cornbread concoctions, and you will fare well!

Waitress was obviously new, very nice but too busy. Manager took our dirty plates and brought us desert menu, then took our  order, cobbler was very good. took awhile to get the check.  
Bill was $115 and left normal $20 tip (I was a waitress in college and know its not an easy job,  i thought she was trying, but she was overwhelmed).

If you are craving for Southern food, here is where you need to come. I'm not a fan of greasy food unless I'm hangover. So what's better to do than having brunch here after a long night of clubbing and strip club. You hear me right!

Yardbird, a traditional Southern eatery for themed decor, chicken & waffles, grits & more, plus craft cocktails.

- Waffle and Crispy Chicken, pepper jelly

- Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken, 1\/2 of our famous bird served with honey hot sauce - their infamous chicken dish.

- Fried Green Tomato BLT -house smoked pork belly, smoky tomato jam, pimento cheese, frisée lemon vinaigrette - a must order.

- Deviled Eggs - dill, chive, smoked trout roe

- Skillet Cornbread - Vermont sharp cheddar cheese, bacon jalapeño, honey maple butter - after this, you'll be like ""WHAT HANGOVER?"" 

- Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad - char-grilled mango, smoked pecans, tomatoes, red onion, benne seed vinaigrette. This was such a refreshing and nice surprise dish. The flavor and texture will surely wake you up. 

Service was good and attentive. I'm not a Southern food person but this is 1 good solid restaurant worth to check out.

Since we had a suite at the Venetian anyway, we didn't have to walk through half of Vegas to get to dinner - very nice, since the temperatures around Christmas were super chilly.

Anywho.... I was super happy with our selection. I would have loved to get the roasted bone marrow for starters, but the guy on the table next to us got the last portion - which made me stare at him madly all evening, haha!
So we ended up sharing the fried green tomato BLT and it was SO GOOD!
As an entree I had the shrimp 'n grits and the hubby the pork ribs. I was happy, he thought the sauce on the ribs was a bit off... that was a bummer, but didn't kill the mood at all. 
Oh, btw... we had a coupon from the hotel for a house cocktail each. I can't remember what it was, but it was really good. I don't drink alcohol very often, so it gave me a nice buzz... sweeeet!

We skipped dessert, because of the fullness of our bellies, but got into a funny little argument with the waiter about one of the pictures on the wall.

Our waiter was polite and explained that the restaurant is heavily influenced by Southern style cooking and also let us know that the ""Shares"" dishes were pretty big and enough to share between 2 diners at least, possibly more. Cool! 

My boyfriend and I shared the 9 oz. flat iron steak, with 2 eggs and hash browns on the side. However, I was really surprised when our dish arrived because the portions were very average-sized. The other couples in our party also chose to order ""Shares"" plates and it became a point of discussion that these were not the ""huge"" portions we were expecting (ie. dishes from Hash House or the Tractor Room). I think their advertising for these dishes is super misleading. We ordered our steak medium but the edges tasted charred and very overcooked. The eggs and the hash browns were only okay. Overall this meal was very disappointing and NOT worth the $28 price tag. They definitely marked up the price since it's a restaurant in a Las Vegas hotel. 

Also, customer service here is not great. One of my friends who I sat next to asked for straws for our water cups, which never came. She also asked for ketchup for her fries, but it took two requests before that came AND they were halfway through their fries at that point (my boyfriend had to ask again when he saw that no one returned with ketchup for a while).

If you're hungry and in the Venetian area look for another restaurant, this place offers mediocre food and even worse customer service. The only thing this place seems good for is their swanky house cocktails. My friend got a blackberry bourbon lemonade (their most popular drink) and it was well-made and quite strong.",1,0,0

Do yourself a favor and just go. It's all about southern deliciousness, awesome drinks, huge portions, cool decor, and great service.

Brunch was a great idea for us as our last meal on our girls trip. We would head to the airport on a full stomach, soak up the weekend's liquor, and ready to sleep through our 4 hour trip back to Florida.

Some of the plates are cliché (chicken, waffles, and watermelon for example) but it works. I ordered the two breakfast biscuits option. I filled them with sausage, egg, and cheese. These are NOT your McDonald's S.E.C breakfast sammiches. These sliders were bigger than I thought and I couldn't even dig into my second slider. 

The mac & cheese was everything baked gooeyness should embody. Lastly, the three birthday guests at my table were presented with a red velvet cheesecake. I'm not a fan of cheesecake, but this was a really good desert.

The ambiance is modern\/eclectic with that hint of industrial that so many places are doing now. I like what they are doing at Yardbird. In theory. I just was immensely disappointed with the execution. 

SERVICE 

They stagger their food delivery so that items come to the table as they are prepared. Do you know what that means? We started eating our side dishes before our meal. And one side dish was scheduled to arrive last. Meaning it was to have been the LAST thing delivered to the table. I don't understand how that makes for a pleasant dining experience.  The server was certainly not to blame since this specific service plan is deliberate. I could see this pacing working when the dishes are all appetizers or finger foods or tapas. But you want to eat the mac and cheese WITH the chicken, not before. 

Pacing aside, when we had some unexpected issues with our meal, the manager was quick to address them and worked professionally and diligently to remedy the situation. That says a GREAT deal about their commitment to providing good service. And as much as I may not have enjoyed the food (see below), I did not leave having had a bad overall experience.

FOOD 

The Chicken: The meat was certainly tender. But the batter was not a southern\/ country style that I know (and I guess prefer). Aside from needing seasoning, it had a light crisp as opposed to the deeper crunch and texture I like on a fried chicken. It reminded me a bit of Pioneer Chicken. If you know this old So Cal chain you know the type of batter Yardbird uses. It is a light batter with solid overall crispness.  While all sections of the bird are crisped, there is a lightness and smooth texture to the skin I do not enjoy. It is a totally personal preference.  I wonder if they are cooking using the ""broasting style"" I have heard about. 

The chicken wasn't bad, It was just not something I would go out of my way for. I found the ""lightness"" of the fried skin to be unsatisfying and the lack of seasoning was a huge disappointment. I do not like to pick up salt and pepper in a restaurant. And certainly not for fried chicken. 

The Grits: They were sweet. I could not take more than a few bites. They are also advertized as ""course ground"", but I've not had grits quite this course before. I was totally willing to have an experience with this style of grits (new to me), but the light sugaring was too much. I needed a savory compliment to the meal and the grits were a disappointment. I read that their fare is based on food traditions in the Carolinas.  I've never had grits in the Carolinas, but if this is what grits are like in those states, It'll be a hard pass from me in the future. 

The salad: butter lettuce with mango and sesame dressing. It was fine. The veg was fresh. And the salad toppings had a blend of sweet, crunchy, and savory. 

We had other dishes, but not one was tasty in the way we wanted them to be. Our dishes included mac and cheese, fried pickles (under seasoned), deviled eggs (too much dill), catfish. Nothing was terrible. But the problem of under seasoning seemed to be an issue in most dishes. 

The catfish had its own set of issues. The fish (like the chicken) was moist and well cooked within the skin, but it was under seasoned and the skin was coated in a batter that did not stick to the fish and crisp around the skin the way I like. 

All in all the food was disappointing. We all bring our experiences and biases to every meal and I certainly brought mine to Yardbird.  I thought the food was overpriced and underwhelming.  I hate to write a review after just one visit, but it left a strong impression. But hey, the restaurant was packed, so people enjoy what they are doing. I didn't. And I won't be back.

I scanned the menu and was undecided. Isidra recommended I try the lunch special which was a blackened salmon with shrimp served over jambalaya. That was exactly what I was looking for!! Seafood with robust flavors and some heat. The well plated dish arrived and was a 5 out of 5. The blackened salmon was moist and executed PERFECTLY. Shrimp was succulent and the jambalaya was the rich, spicy, and starchy component that connected all the dots. The portion was extremely generous.

If you plan on coming here with a group larger than 6, they don't take ""regular"" reservations, you have to go through corporate sales in order to get a reservation. BUT with that reservation you have to pay up front and have a pre-fixed menu (that's why I would knock off a star). 

However, one way to circumvent this issue is to just find a bunch of seats in the lounge area for your party since it's first come first serve. I ended up doing that for my birthday with a group of 12. We pulled a bunch of little tables and chairs together and were able to make it work for dinner. It was a little awkward but they offer the full menu in the lounge area and service was awesome! They were definitely willing accommodate us and our server was very attentive.  

The food and drinks are awesome! The fried chicken and waffles with watermelon is so GOOD!!! The chicken is so juicy and moist with the perfect amount of crunch. Even the white meat was super moist! The waffle was pretty good too, but the only problem is the bottom waffle gets soggy once you actually get to it. The shrimp n' grits, mac and cheese and brussel sprouts are also delicious!

My cousin had been to the Yardbird in Miami a couple years ago so we made a pit stop here as she wanted to reminisce and it's never really a bad time for another cocktail in Vegas! 

There was not any space for us in the lounge for six people but there was at the bar.  We pulled up a few bar stools and ordered with the bartender.  My husband is really into Old Fashioned's right now as he's been making them at home and ordering them wherever he can.  All the guys got that, and us three girls ordered something different to try.  My cousin got Watermelon Sling which was really nice and refreshing.  Her friend got the Blind Lemon Shandy.  I usually don't mind shandys because I like the light taste of lemon, but it wasn't her thing.  She mentioned it to the bartender and the bartender gracefully made her another - which she decided on another Watermelon Sling.  I had a taste of the shandy and thought it was ok - a little too sour even for me.  As for me, I got the Blackberry Bourbon.  I'm into sweet and fruity drinks so I did like this - but thought the Watermelon Sling was the winner out of the three.

The guys really enjoyed the Old Fashioned.  My husband enquired about what kind of bourbon they used for it because it tasted a little smokey.  It's really neat because they infuse the bourbon in-house with bacon fat!  He was really interested in it that when we got home he started researching how to do it himself.

Having visited Atlanta over the summer, we were well aware of the type of meal and portion sizes to expect from a James Beard nominated Southern food restaurant.

Restaurant appears small as you stand at the hostess station, but as you walk to the rear of the restaurant, the place is huge!!! Dimly lit, in a good and bad way. Good cause it's got a cool and romantic vibe to it. Bad cause it's nearly impossible to read the menu when you can barely see. 

Fried Green tomato BLT's:

Wow, such a decadent and well established dish. Green tomatoes were fresh, fried to perfection and packed an excellent crunch with a zip of tang.
Pimento cheese spread, obviously made in house, was the star. Creamy, almost crab salad ish texture and wonderful flavors. 
Crisp pork belly was a bit rough around the edges, literally. I suspect that would be standard for a pig belly, but it was a bit tough to chew on. 

Over all 5\/5

Fried chicken biscuits:

What, what?? Freshly made Southern biscuits in Vegas? Yeah, they done did it now!!!

Delicious doughy biscuits with giant slabs of perfectly fried, delicious chicken inside. We were way over our ski's cause we ordered this thinking petite Vegas portions, but the bird didn't fly that way at all!!!

Swine Burger:

Holy sheep bleep!!! Fresh ground blend of short rib and swine n stuff. Served up with more pork belly and a buttery bun and oh my oh my oh my!! Fantabulous burger that was easily enough for two to split, but my lovely wife did her darndest to complete the challenge. She fell short and failed, but please, don't tell anyone bout it.

Short Rib:

This is an item that I have a really difficult time not ordering when it's on any menu. Plenty of Yelpers raved about this dish, so of course, I ordered it. 

Pretty darn delicious BUT.... Nobody is perfect, right? It could probably be served off the bone and with the costal cartilage removed. I know, I know. It's easy to toss shade when you've never cooked in a kitchen, but BUT, I've made this dish a dozen times and prefer to serve the deliciousness and not that nastiness. Just sayin' though.

I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a delicious and cool dining experience. As for meself, I think the next time I make it to Vegas, I will stick to a giant, bloody steak cause for some odd reason, it's easier to stay awake after that meal than it was this meal.",1,1,1

We liked it so much that around dark thirty, which is an accurate time in Vegas, we came back and were immediately sat back down in the dining room, were Sarah, with an ""h,"" was tasked with reviving and hydrating our band of Merry Men.  She brought her own style of sassiness, and did not disappoint!  Without much of a surprise, we had Old Fashioneds, and this time started with Llewellyn's Chicken, which is the same center piece we started with last time minus the waffles and watermelon.  Perfect Execution the second time around, and even though my wife hates it, I could not help to lick my fingers for every last morsel and flavor I could get.  We happened to see Andy there, and he came charging over to say hi and to ask if we would play a quick joke on his Bar Manager, Michael.  Let's just say that it involved cupcakes and another ""member,"" and that the joke went over well, and was a .....pun intended......ice breaker with Michael.  This guy has a passion, and it is noticeable.  He returns to the restaurant scene after spending time in personal finance or investing, if I remember correctly and adds ammunition that you need to chase your passion.  His bar is amazing, the infusions unique, and the cocktails carefully selected and calibrated for certain flavor profiles.  What sets him apart is not only the attention to the drinks, but to the whole drinking experience.  I have never seen an ice program in a bar like this.  This guy is hand pressing spheres from large ice slabs and uses some serious Japanese tools to hack at the behemoth blocks of ice.   I am sad that I won't be there for St. Patrick's and see his ice clover creation, but recommend everyone in town to get there!!!  Bottom Line, Mike is awesome, his bar is great, and his is doing a heck of a job over there.
Next, Sarah brought out the Steak Tartare, which is covered in a BBQ sauce sorbet.....awesome....and the intended vessel for consumption is a fried rectangle of cornbread......AWESOME.  You mix in the Sorbet, to chill down and evenly spread the BBQ within the Tartare, and the fried cornbread acted as intended and we happily shoveled it into our cake holes!
After Beef, came the other white meat, Fried Frog Legs that are served with sweet and sour jelly, bacon bits and a house made escabeche mayo.  DELICIOUS!!!!!  They were served with an order of the buttermilk biscuits, and let me tell you.....hailing from Texas but now living in San Diego, buttermilk biscuits are an art, and this art is not found very easily outside of the Southern States.......these guys nailed it.  Small jars of honey butter and seasonal house jam added the right amount of sweet and velvet to the biscuits that could stand on their own!
They surprised my wife and me with a massive wedge of cake that was described as bacon butterscotch cake.  It was filled with pecan pie filling, covered with bits of bacon and served with Bourbon Flavored Ice cream..NUFF SAID!
We had a round of Patron XO layered with Baileys, and I had a Macchiato, and then we went over to personally thank Mike, Sarah, and Andy for making the experience memorable not once, but twice in a 12 hour period.
Sarah did a great job with us, took all our jokes in stride, had a zang for every zing and made sure that we had a pleasurable dining experience.  Andy, who we found out is from location #1 in Florida is out in Vegas making sure that the staff understand s what the owners\/creators intended and he doing a heck of a job.  I think Andy has a bright future at YardBird's and we wish him success.  Look, I know food and spirit, but you don't have to be an expert to get this place.  The intention is to serve high quality creative food and drink without being pretentious, and they have nailed it.  In 2015, you don't need white table clothes to get award worthy food, and that is the beauty of the revolution that we all get to experience firsthand.  Someone that has 0 experience or expectations would have the same awesome time here, and would NEVER feel out of place or unworthy! We were sharing pictures of our kids with Mike, joking with Andy and Sarah, like we had known them for years, but at the same time were drinking world class cocktails and eating steak tartare that was covered in a BBQ sauce Sorbet.  If the intention is excellence and elegance with being pretentious, these guys are spot on. 
Overall, this place gets 4.5 out 5 stars and not because they slipped at all, but we all must pursue perfection and always strive to be better.  We can't have it handed to us and risk getting lazy and uncreative, because if that happens we will find ourselves back into a culinary dark age, where faceless chains will multiply and divide like cell mitosis and we will be back to pre-made frozen food and sauces being schlepped to the masses.

I started with the peach tea cocktail, which was refreshing and reminded me of a Long Island iced tea in a way. We had the fried green tomato BLT which was delicious. It was deep fried and the breading was crispy and the tomato was crunchy. It was topped with frisée, pork belly, and pimento cheese. I'm not a huge fan of pimento but the pork belly mellowed the flavor. We also had the wedge salad which had buttermilk ranch which I enjoyed since I'm not a big blue cheese fan. The roasted corn added a smoky sweet flavor and the avocado on top added creaminess. The fried chicken with waffles and watermelon is a must. The breading on the chicken wasn't as crispy as I hoped, but it was juicy and the hot sauce added a good flavor. The waffle has a cheese crust on top and is nice and crispy. The watermelon added a sweetness. Definitely a must stop!",1,0,0

I think i cried a little inside (I hope my girlfriend didn't notice and I also hope she felt the same way too as well as my bff because if i'm gonna cry inside of happiness, i want everyone to cry along)

After extensive yelping, I found the perfect no fail restaurant. And by perfect I mean, Chicken and Waffles! 

**FRIED GREEN TOMATO BLT $14 (house smoked pork belly, smoky tomato jam, pimento cheese, frisée lemon vinaigrette) -- OH so Goooood. I do not know why, but i never liked pork belly. But here, the fat\/meat ratio of it was so on point (thin layer of fat) that after being fried (i know!) made me feel less guilty than if it hadn't been fried! No, it's not supposed to make sense. It might've been a tad too cheesy but I enjoyed the two bites it lasted. 

**Jalapeno CORNBREAD -- Now, this was not on the menu for lunch (it's only on the dinner menu) but i still asked the server about it, she wasn't sure but went ahead into the kitchen to bring me the most amazing news i've hear that morning. They had it!!!! and so i had it!!!! and it was amazingly moist (a rarity for cornbread) since it was baked directly in the cast iron skillet. Excellent dish, the perfect carb side dish to all your other carb dishes. Can't forget how sexy it looked after the spooned butter started melting and sliding off it's curvy top.  

**FRIED CHICKEN N' WATERMELON N' WAFFLES $36 -- This is true about all the reviews here, it is truly extraordinary. The brining for 27 hours must be magical, and go figure why not a minute longer. Juicy, hot, the skin was so nicely crispy i even ate it (which i never do) because it didn't feel oily. The waffle was great too! I feel sad thinking about it already. When the attraction is so strong, it is just so hard to let go of the memory. 

**MACARONI & CHEESE $10 (trottole pasta, five artisanal cheeses, crispy herb crust) trottole is fancy for twisty. This effing cute ass mini dutch oven mac n cheese was possibly the best i have ever had in my life. And listen, i eat a lot and almost always order it when it's a southern restaurant. You can taste the high quality of the cheeses! Just perfection in the creaminess, saltiness, crunchiness of the crust. Excellent! we couldn't stop eating even though we were stuffed. 

The problem with this place is that there is absolutely nothing bad about the food! God dammit. I feel so vulnerable when I rank something 5 stars because then they know, that I have a weak spot. And I don't like that...

Although there was a 1.5 hour wait around noon time on a Sunday, first come seating is available in the bar and the lounge. We accidentally snagged a  table that we thought was considered the bar area and even though we were ready to give the table up (I promise we're not jerks; we felt really bad), the server pulled some strings with the hostess to let us stay there. She didn't have to do that but we are extremely grateful that she did! I guess you could call that a string of birthday luck! 

We ordered a few different dishes to share: the deviled eggs, wedge salad with added fried chicken, the fried green tomato BLT, macaroni and cheese, a brisket biscuit, a chicken biscuit and plain biscuits. Being a southern girl vacay venturing in the Vegas valley, I felt right at home here. The fried chicken seems to be all the rage at the yardbird (the name  says it all) and I can see why! It is the kind of fried chicken that the wannabee chicken imposters can only dream to achieve. The chicken is cooked perfectly: crispy and extra juicy. It's like slow cooked chik fil a (I love chik fil a so that's a huge compliment). Everything else we ordered here was also an ""omg this is so amazing"" type of deal. 

The best part was the server told the birthday girl to choose a dessert on the house. We went for the banana pudding and our server brought it out with a candle. The banana pudding is legit. It's rich but the flavors are explosive to the taste buds.

The yardbird serves the kind of delicious southern food that keeps you coming back for more despite the wait time. Word to the wise: make reservations.",0,0,0

First, the decor is something you might see Joanna Gaines design. It is amazing. The menu is all southern cooking and centered mostly around chicken dishes if you couldn't tell from the name. My boyfriend decided on the blue plate special. Two pieces of their fried chicken, spiced watermelon and a homemade biscuit. They gave him the option of what pieces of meat he wanted which I thought was neat. He decided on half white meat and dark meat and chose a breast and drumstick. He loves fried chicken and said this was the best he's ever had! Juicy and full of flavor. I had the grilled chicken BLT. The combination of chicken, pimento cheese, bacon, and a fried green tomato was amazing. The chicken was juicy, bacon was a large thick slice of what almost reminded me of back bacon and the fried green tomato was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside! We also split a side order of skillet cornbread. Yummy! Not just your ordinary cornbread. It was also made with Vermont cheddar, bacon, jalapeños and a big slab of honey butter on top.

The portion size chicken&waffles&watermelon was extremely generous. We were both full for hours after. We shared a side of biscuits and fries. They were both delicious.

Service was absolutely amazing. Our waiter was attentive and fast. Whenever we needed something, he was there. When he was busy and we needed, say water refill, he made sure another waiter was there to refill our glass. Our food arrived probably 5 minutes after we ordered. I was shocked.

Its something that I have never tasted before, but it was delicious).

But they made me a believer lol. Instead of mayo they add vinegar and cilantro. DAUM!). Then lastly for dessert I had the fried oreos (It was dipped in a rice crispy batter and then deep fried to golden perfection. Also it was paired with home made oreo icecream, OH BABY!) and my boyfriend had the home made blueberry Sunday( Everything was decadent, the home made icecream, the home made blueberry sauce and the home made chocolate sauce at the bottom.).

I feel that many of the restaurants on the strip are totally overpriced and not even close to worth it (last time we ventured to Craft steak and were very disappointed by our VERY expensive meal).  Yardbird is reasonably priced.  Is every dish amazing?  I don't think so, but most of them are pretty darn good, and the fried chicken is awesome, especially with their really amazing hot sauce (we are now on a mission to try to replicate at home -- my fiancee considered offering them $100 so we could take a jar home!).

Other favorites -- the biscuits!  so good and delicious with the honey butter and apple spiced jam.  The roasted cauliflower was also very good - kind of melted in your mouth.  I don't love mac and cheese, but there's is pretty good (maybe not quite as good as how much your waiter\/waitress might rave about it, but very solid and worth a try).  The fries were also very solid (and try them with the hot sauce - perfect!).

Less excited about -- the fried pickles - not my thing, but my fiancee thought the pickles were too sweet - wanted something a little more bitter to accompany the batter.  The whipped sweet potatoes - they may be for you, but they seemed very sweet to me.  A few bites were nice, but I couldn't really eat more. 

There were many other things on the menu we wanted to try, but loved the fried chicken so much that we had to get that as our main course twice.  It's pretty crowded, so reservations are recommended and easy on the open table app.  I thought all the staff were very friendly, and were very attentive, seeing if we wanted more food, drinks, or water.

Chicken was the same as the first time, crispy, tender and tasty! The hot sauce is amazing but you really don't need it. Pieces are on the small side and it could be considered expensive at 15 bucks but this is The Strip and it is good so to me it's well worth it!

When you walk in you see mostly just the bar and couches and coffee tables full of people drinking, eating, and being merry. I was slightly intimidated being a party of 1 since it looked like all the tables were communal. I was delighted when the host turned a corner to another room that looked more like a typical dining room. I love the decor, the style, the bathrooms, all lovely. Rustic, industrial, modern, comfy. Lively and energetic ambiance without being too loud. Casual, but nice. I feel like I could return with my kids. 5 stars for ambiance.

Service was great. Hosts were really friendly, servers were attentive. Food runners were a little more attentive than my actual server, but she was still very nice. 4.5 stars for service.

The menu was creative. A modern twist on southern\/american favorites. I came for the Restaurant Week menu which was 3 courses. I chose the fried green tomato blt, blue plate special, and ended with creme brulee. The runner actually brought out deviled eggs first, but when I notified him I had ordered the blt he left the eggs so I could have both. Deviled eggs were good but a little much for me. A little salty, herbs a bit overpowering. Just not my thing. The BLT was very good. It was my first time having fried green tomatoes, which I loved. The pork belly was delicious. The spread that was on top of the tomato was, again, a little much for me. Nice flavor, but too intense for me. The main course was the blue plate special, which was fried chicken, biscuit, spiced watermelon. The spiced watermelon was interesting, a great palate cleanser. The biscuit was delicious! The fried chicken was nice and crispy, but once again, very seasoned which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just not ""my"" thing. I ordered a side of the gravy they serve with biscuits and gravy which was creamy, rich, and meaty. If it hadn't had rosemary in it I would have really loved it. It seems like chefs love to use rosemary here in Vegas because it grows EVERYWHERE. But that's the very reason why I don't like it much anymore; I smell it every time I walk through my front yard. Enough of that tangent. 3 stars for food.

Here's what I loved: The Arnold Palmer and the Creme Brulee!!! 
I know you're thinking, Arnold Palmer? She's impressed with iced tea and lemonade? Yes, I'm off the sauce currently so I really love when restaurants create delicious non-alcoholic beverages. This is one of the best drinks I've ever had. I'd return just for the Arnold Palmer. Oh, and the creme brûlée. Again, you're thinking, creek brûlée? What is this, 1990? But their take on it is absolutely delicious. 5 stars for dessert and drinks. By the way, their drink menu looked pretty amazing. If their cocktails are made with the same care as the iced tea and lemonade, you should give this place a try.

All in all I had an enjoyable lunch. I might return and give them another shot.",0,0,0

We arrived for our 8:15pm reservation and were promptly taken to to our table.
Out knowledgeable server, Kenneth, gave us a great run down of the entire menu.
For a table of two we ordered the following to share:
Mac N Cheese: It was super cheesy and amazing we had it come out first like a mini appetizer.
Short Ribs: They came with green beans, corn, and mashed potatoes. This meal was good but didn't compare to the chicken.
Chicken and Waffles with Watermelon: Order this! The chicken was so moist and flavorful. The watermelon added something different and the waffles and bourbon syrup were great also! The portion was pretty large.

Overall it was a great experience! The food, service, and ambiance made it a nice relaxing evening!

Call early for a reservation! If they say they are booked for the night check Open Table!

Cons: pricy

Yardbird is located in The Venetian, which is great for people staying in the hotel. It also takes reservations so you don't have to wait to be seated. The front area is full of couches and high tables, while the back has more seating for when the restaurant is full.

I had the deviled eggs and crispy chicken biscuits. I also saw a lot of people getting mimosas and other drinks when I went at 11AM (welcome to Vegas!) The eggs were good, but not great - they're presented beautifully and I love the roe on top. The chicken was moist and the biscuits delicious, but the overall dish was on the drier side.

YB gets 5 stars for their amazing service. From the second we walked in, everyone was wonderfully pleasant and attentive. The server overheard us talking about our friend's birthday and he brought us a huge slice of chocolate cake without being asked.

- Deviled eggs: awesome. Ended up ordering a second plate, they were so good.

- Fried green tomatoes with pork belly and pimento cheese: tomatoes were freaking fantastic - crisp and sweet!  pork belly was a little overdone, but good.  
- Mac & cheese: standard, nothing amazing.
- Brisket biscuits: these were very awesome.  Juicy, tender slabs of brisket on fresh baked southern styled biscuits.  Very good.  
- Fried chicken: 1\/2 chicken with delicious breading, spicy, flavorful, juicy served with Louisiana hot sauce. 
- Raspberry cheesecake: not very good, wouldn't recommend
- Deep fried oreo: incredible.  can't go wrong when you bread anything with fried dough and serve with ice cream.  
- Butterscotch cake: not good, wouldn't recommend. served with a whiskey ice cream, which was okay.

I ordered the omelette which consisted of ham and mushroom, a side of fruit, and a biscuit. I substituted the eggs for egg whites and also added avocado. I was a bit disappointed in the portion size. The omelette was half the size I expected. The avocado was was almost ripe, so it lacked a strong avocado taste. The fruit was fresh and sweet. My favorite part of the dish was actually the biscuit. It was dense, but light in texture. It came with whipped butter and apple jam, which was absolutely amazing.

This is such a cool little fried chicken place! The couch areas and bar toward the front are open seating and there are some tables in the back too if you're willing to wait or make a reservation. While the vibes are great here, the food is even better!

We got some Buttermilk Biscuits to share to start and they were amazing: perfectly buttery and flaky with a tasty apple jam to spread on them. I would say these are a MUST! For our meal, we got the Lewllyn's Fried Chicken and a side of Mac and Cheese--both were some of the best I've ever had. The fried chicken was spiced well and the batter wasn't too thick or too thin so it was just crispy enough to complement the tender chicken underneath. It came with a honey hot sauce as well that I honestly need served by the bottle because it was so good. They even had gluten-free fried chicken for my wife! And the mac and cheese was really cheesy but not gritty or soupy and the breadcrumbs on top gave it a nice little crunch.

Since then I've had my share of southern dishes, but a recent trip to Yardbird in the Palazzo\/Venetian for a friend's birthday has given me an even greater appreciation for the cuisine.

Standouts dishes included chicken 'n waffles with some of the best fried chicken I've had in town topping crispy and airy cheese filled waffles that puts to shame any similar dish. The St. Louis style pork ribs were coated with a dry rub with much depth, giving it hints of sweetness and smokiness with restrained heat. The low and slow smoked chicken salad may not catch the eye of most diners but it's a dish that shouldn't be overlooked. Other notable dishes were the pot pie and fall-off-the-bone-tender short ribs atop charred corn grits.

Desserts were equally amazing. With the bacon butterscotch cake, I've finally found a sweet dish that uses bacon effectively. Devoid of a cold, rubbery texture, the bacon is used perfectly to enhance the cake flavor. For traditional southern-style desserts you won't want to miss their seasonal cobblers or the chess pie.

-Classic Buttermilk Biscuits (4 of them)---best I ever had..even better than in SC and GA!...............served with honey butter, house-made jam

-- Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles-
with honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, Vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrup.....at $36\plate..it's not cheap for fried chicken..but is was some of the best I've ever had and a whole 1\2 chicken to boot..the contrast in flavors made them all a perfect match...gotta get all 3 in one BIG BITE!

Nearly all staff I encountered was hospitable and proud of where they were and what they were serving!  Sadly, the terse, disinterested staff at the host stand (a critical part of the visit) delivered an absolutely incompetent experience on TWO consecutive visits.  

*  Welcome Experience
-  Shameful

I was excited to approach Yardbirds!  I had read great things and was eager for this new experience.  I approached the front desk where three staff and no customers were standing.  I waited for what was definitely too long to be acknowledged in some way - I wasn't.  I asked one of the three, ""am I in the right place for us to be seated?"" - that idle person said, ""yes but we are working on something.""  

Hmm.  All three of you?  Working so diligently that eye contact and acknowledgment was out of the question?  You shouldn't be in your role if some elementary multitasking (across three staff) is out of question.  So the four of us were a bit put off, and started discussing other options.  (After all, the place is teeming with competitors right?)

I was finally asked (without eye contact) ""how many?""  I gave my response and was seated.  The demeanor and interaction with the front desk staff was awful.  I take a minute to describe the experience because it's an easy fix - move the people who hate their job to another job - find someone with a modicum of hospitality to greet your patrons.

*  Establishment
-  Outstanding

This place was very cool!  Unique, modern decor, comfortable seating and lots of interesting features that made for a good experience!  It was very clean and the decor was consistent throughout!  They spared no expense!

*  Service
-  Awful at first thanks to the ""hosts""
-  Outstanding after that thanks to the servers who were warm, personable, attentive and kind.  

*  Food Quantity \/ Quality \/ Presentation
-  Outstanding!!  (See photos)

During my two visits I tried:

Kale Salad with Shrimp - extraordinary!  How did they cook that shrimp??  It was PERFECT, with a well balanced salad that was delicious to the last bite!  My favorite thing about it was the seasoning and cook on the shrimp.  

Fried Chicken Sandwich - extraordinary!  (Although the quiet and bored runner who brought it to me should have enthusiastically told me about the honey-infused crystal hot sauce and stuff, but she just mumbled something and walked away.  A runner for the table next door did a great job and I overheard their pitch). The chicken was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly and surrounded by a soft warm potato bun.  I can't stop dreaming about it!

Biscuit with Ham \/ Vermont Cheddar - extraordinary!  A soft, warm biscuit with melted sharp white Vermont cheddar and sliced ham.  Ugh I need it again!!

Biscuit with Pulled Pork - extraordinary!  The quality of the biscuits is outstanding and the soft, warm pulled pork and pickles onions were just so good.  

French fries with Bacon Salt - great!  Probably the most ordinary thing of the bunch.  The bacon salt was sparse, definitely needed more...

Salted Caramel Bread Pudding - OMG I HATE how good this was.  This brick of tender, delicious bread pudding sitting in a puddle of creme anglaise next to a dollop of house made whipped cream topped with salty sweet candies nuts was absolutely absurd.  I'll visit yardbirds every time I visit Vegas just for this.  

Butterscotch Cake - outstanding!  Creamy rich frosting, moist cake drizzled with (something) with some ice cream on the plate.  I wanted more buttery butterscotch (the flavor wasn't bold) but it was still delicious!

Peach Cobbler - honestly - meh.  The menu says it takes about 30 min to bake this fresh.  We waited.  It was hot and bubbly, but the peach filling was just ok, and the crust was just ok - to me.  My friend who grew up in New Orleans raved about it and loved every bite.

You must give this place a try.  Unique cocktails, extraordinary food and quite a nice atmosphere once you get past the gatekeepers who seemed like they were a third party staff disconnected from the rest.  Owners - you gotta fix that!  Imagine if you had hospitable, personable people at that desk who didn't act like they hate their job??  You'd be unstoppable!!",3,1,1

Yardbird Southern Table & Bar boldly declared that they had one of the best fried chicken recipes out there, so to put them to the test, my family and I made reservations here for Sunday night dinner. It was very last minute, but the hostess kindly accommodated our large group without a fuss. 

The restaurant itself is cozy yet classy at the same time. Like most Vegas restaurants, the lighting is low and creates an intimate mood that would be nice if the volume wasn't eardrum-breaking loud. At one point, I felt as if I was in a shouting match with my family. We sat at a high table with comfy bar stools while behind us were parties sitting on plushy couch seats, enjoying a nice cocktail or glass of wine. 

The menu is constructed like a flip book with one page dedicated to food and the other four to various types of liquid courage. Because we were still quite full from our late lunch, my family and I decided to eat food family style. For our appetizers, we got the deviled eggs, mango grilled salad, and crab mac and cheese, then for our entrees, we shared the crispy fried chicken with hot sauce and the chicken n' watermelon n' waffles. 

While service is friendly, there was no denying that it was slow. The wait times between each appetizer and between each course was uncomfortably long. When all the appetizers finally hit our table, we did agree that plating was nice. The creamy yolk of the deviled eggs appeared like a yellow beehive and it was easy to eat in a single bite. It was the favorite appetizer of the three. As for the salad, I had to cut up the lettuce leaves with a knife while the mango pieces were way too mushy. The mac and cheese tasted decent overall, but the cheese was slightly congealed. 

Hoping the entrees would be better, we were at first very impressed with the look of the fried chicken, especially the chicken n' watermelon n' waffles dish. I think that dish is always meant to be shared because it is a monster of a plate. You get an entire, thick waffle, four pieces of fried chicken, and spicy watermelon pieces. As for the regular fried chicken entree, there were three pieces served in an iron basket. 

There is no denying that the chicken was juicy. UNBELIEVABLY JUICY. The flavors were vibrant and the meat fell apart with ease. But one of the best things about fried chicken is the skin, and unfortunately at Yardbird's, the skin was not crispy at all. Even though it was nicely spiced, the lack of a crunch was quite a crime.

In the end, we still had room to order dessert so we got the banana bread pudding to share that was neatly presented in a mason jar with a hill of Chantilly cream and a crispy banana chip. I loved the bread pudding, tasting surprisingly light with plenty of banana flavor. The only change I would make is to have less of the cream since it eventually overpowered the entire dish. 

Like most Vegas restaurants, prices aren't the most reasonable, but for good flavors, sometimes the wallet pain is worth it. I can't say that that is the case for Yardbird. The chicken was good, just not great, and the service was friendly, just not efficient. 

I guess the whole experience was just average for us.",34,23,36

We started with the watermelon and cheese salad paired with the fried green tomato BLT. Both were beautifully presented. The watermelon was fresh and sweet, nestled on top was mouth watering farmers cheese, contrasting warmth against the cold of the watermelon. The green tomato was fried perfectly. All the components fit together well, The only downfall was the pork belly was a little bit on the toothy side. 
My companion had never tried grits and was skeptical but we ordered shrimp and grits nontheless. The grits were creamy and perfectly seasoned. The shrimp were huge and cooked to perfection.  The sauce was savory deliciousness. Additionally, I ordered a side of the roasted cauliflower with pumpkin seeds and raisins and it absolutely did not disappoint. 
The restaurant was packed but the hostess welcomed us in and offered up seating at the bar due to the long wait time. The bar has adequate counter space which made for a comfortable dining experience. Our bartender\/servers name was Joe. Joe was so helpful and he knew the menu like the back of his hand. He was attentive and had such a great personality he completely made us feel welcome and put the meal from excellent to super excellent based on his awesome personality and attention to detail.

My friendly waitress advised me that this establishment has another location in Miami. The interior decor is hip and chic lounge\/bar area are really trendy looking. Being I'm a fried chicken fan, I went with the Lewellyn's fried chicken at $26.00 - 1\/2 of free range chicken - marinated for 27 hours and served with spicy tabasco & honey sauce. Instead of ordering a full order of biscuits my waitress said she could just order me one which was perfect with an order of Charred Okra. Overall,  I thought the food was decent and tasty but I've been to southern states and have enjoyed as good if not better fried chicken for less money. Again, what would expect being that it's Las Vegas? The service by my waitress was solid and the music playing in the background was hip older rock.

That being said, this place is AMAZING. The ambiance is great, the servers are lovely, and the food is to write home to mama about. The biscuits, chicken, fried green tomatoes, honey butter, bread pudding, and peach cobbler were all delish. The chicken biscuits were probably my favourite. Get all of these things!!
But the best thing in the restaurant is one of the managers, Sara Crane. She found out we had come back because we loved the food so much and came over to talk to us as we were stuffing our faces. She invited us back for the weekend brunch (if we were staying we would have gone!!) but we told her we were flying out in a couple of hours. We made a comment about taking some chicken biscuits to go and she laughed and said we should. And we decided to do just that! But before we could, she came over and gave us some chicken biscuits, wrapped tight for the flight, for the road, on her. Before we left we thanked her and hugged it out with her because she was so genuinely kind. 
Here's the awesome thing: meeting Sara was one of the best things that happened to us on our trip (and I was celebrating my birthday!). Her kindness reminded us that there are amazing people in the world and that life is about giving and being kind. The rest of our day was amazing. We paid it forward and thought about how we needed to be good people. 
We now plan to have a Sara Crane moment daily and do something kind. (We also want to be her besties!)

It is said to have been coined in the 1940s and was a reference to a soldier under a disciplinary measure or a convict (restricted to a specific place, the yard), and now it is being used to refer to the humble chicken, as in this particular establishment.

I was doing a day trip to Vegas for a conference and hobbled (stress fracture in my foot, I'm in a boot) from the Mirage over to the Venetian to try their fried chicken. They note, in their menu, the long preparation time for their chicken. I got the blue plate special which is two pieces of chicken, a buttermilk biscuit and their cubed watermelon (I think it was service with mint).

The chicken wing was good, nice and crispy, and quite tender. The other piece, breast meat, was also quite tender but the crust was more of the KFC original recipe versus a thick, crispy, outer coating, which is my preferred format for fried chicken.

As for the biscuit, folks, if you are going to do a buttermilk biscuit, realize that is much of a cultural envoy of Southern Culture as the yardbard. The one i received was square and seemed like it was pulled from a series of connected biscuits. It was a bit dry and felt more like an afterthought and not like the chance it is to impress the true lover of good Southern cooking.

As for the watermelon, it didn't have much flavor at all. it needs a little something to also stand out on the plate.

I did like that all the beers on draft were from local breweries in Nevada and I had a great IPE called a ""dirty dog."" 

Accordingly, I can say, i wasn't unhappy with the meal but all three main food items have an opportunity to be better. As with many things in Vegas, though it is a great city, the hype, at least for me, did not live up to expectations. Though I may come back for the twice fried chicken wings if I'm back in Vegas again. Hope springs eternal in the heart of any lover of Southern cuisine, including my own. :-)",2,2,2

We ordered the crispy chicken and pork belly\/fried green tomatoes apps. I can easily say that these were the boneless fried chicken thighs I've ever had and the best fried green tomatoes I've ever had, and I wasn't alone in that judgement. Our whole table was speechless during the devourment. 

My main course kept the party going with the short rib and it delivered big time with the meat falling off the bone with the touch of a fork.

We also had the collared greens, jalapeno sweet cornbread, Brussels sprouts, mac n cheese, short ribs with cauliflower mash and pickled veggies.  EVERYTHING was so tasty. We cleaned those plates, no doggy bags for us.
Customer service was excellent. We originally tried to make reservations and weren't allowed to because they were booked up.  However the host informed us that we could try to walk in, and the wait may not be that long. Well lucky for us we only waited maybe 20 minutes, and we were seated right by the kitchen.

They had good alcohol options, I added a pear cider. 

Opinion on the chicken: 
I am from the south (SC), and I hate to say it, but the chicken here is the best I've ever had. I don't know how they do it. I am ashamed to say it.

Maybe my memory is just bad and I can't remember how good it was, I haven't lived down south or visited in a few years now.

Waffles: 
I enjoy waffles but have never been a fan of chicken and waffles. I tried them, because they looked pretty good. 
Why were these waffles so good? Now I am going to want this more often and I don't have a local Yardbirds. 

Watermelon:
Didn't try it. Priorities are chicken & waffles. 


Size of meal:
I am not a big eater, so it isn't uncommon for me to order a burger and leave a 5th of it or so. This was way too much food for me. I had 2 quarters of the waffle, and only 3-4 of the chicken pieces and didn't even pick them clean. I felt guilty not eating it all, it was so good. They didn't have a ""half-size"" though, so what can you do. 


Dessert:
Caramel bread pudding - I didn't like it much, but there are many ways to make this and they did it fine. It just wasn't for me. 



Wait staff: 
It was @10pm when I ate there. I had 6 different people check on me & ask how things were. The waiter was very attentive as well. I am not very picky or anything, so I didn't ask for anything except a check eventually. They gave me water without me needing to think of it. 


Noise & atmosphere:
For anyone in their 30-40s like myself, it should be pretty hip \/ fun. I really liked the pictures they had rotating on the wall of Elvis, Ali, and a few other famous people, I hadn't seen them before and they were just plain cool. 

Everyone who works here seems chill & cool.

We walked in and asked how long the wait was for two people. The hostess told us it would be a 45 minute wait for a table, but if a spot on the sofas opened we were welcomed to enjoy dinner there. Upon hearing this, Andy approached us and told us to give him two minutes. He went to each sofa and gathered two chairs and a few small tables and put them together so that my husband and I can sit down immediately. A M A Z I N G!

-devil eggs (really good, seasoned well, extra creamy!)

-fried pickles (skip this, too salty)

The restaurant only makes reservations for groups of 6, and larger groups are first come first serve in the lounge area. Surprisingly though, the staff did an amazing job accommodating us and made my friends birthday a success.

Environment: located in the lobby between Venetian and palazzo, the southern themed restaurants offers a bar\/lounge area that is communal in addition to a back area where there are additional table seating. 

Service: obviously I am quite impressed by their care. I can imagine it being tough to service a group of 10 in the lounge area where we moved couches and coffee tables together, but they did everything they can to make our experience enjoyable. They constantly checked on us, made sure we were hydrated, and gave us our food actually quite quickly. They even offered a birthday ice cream cobbler for my friends 30th, which was super delicious. 

Food: this spot is known for their fried chicken and waffles with the watermelon. It taste soooo good. Extremely juicy chicken, nicely fried surface that is not too salty or hard. The waffles also taste good, and paired nicely with the chicken. It also came with syrup, hot sauce and watermelon squares. It might sound random, but the watermelons add a nice quenching touch after eating some fried food. I also had some shrimp and grits which were bomb. Actually my first time having it, but there was plenty of shrimp and it was also very juicy and slightly grilled. My friend had the mac and cheese also, extremely cheesy and a great selection of a long macaroni. 

Drinks: I had the old fashion, which is apparently marinated in bacon or something. My greatest appeal was the round ice cube. You know a bar is good when there is no white bubbles in the ice cube, it's just classy. My friend also had the blueberry lemonade cocktail. It was refreshing and worth ordering.

Boyfriend made reservations last minute for dinner.
We arrived the restaurant 10 minutes earlier and was able to be seated.
The ambiance is dim and nice.

We ordered:
-biscuits: The biscuits were decent. I think i could have enjoyed dinner without these. The waffles that came with the chicken were plenty of carbs. 
Also the biscuits were plain Jane. Nothing out of the ordinary.

-Chicken & Waffles w\/ watermelon (shared w\/ bf): The chicken was fabulous. Although a lot Yelpers complained the chicken skin isn't crunchy enough, I still found it extremely yummy. The chicken was so moist and juicy. Never experienced a chicken like that. Even the chicken breast was so good!

The waffles were also perfect with the chicken. The waffles were crunchy and sweet and perfect. Not too dense and light.

-brussel sprouts w\/bacon: The brussel sprouts were good; ours came with thick cuts of bacon.

I was double confident with my Yelp peeps nearly perfect stars, so confident I invited guests to join us and raved about how great this place is said to be. Ugh! Where
Do I even begin! 
1) showed up and told we had no reservations and perhaps I made them for their MIA location? Party of 5 no reservation. Asked the hostess if I could put our name in and was told wait was over an hour but we could find a seat in the lounge. Let me say that again ASKED to put my name down and hostess said find a seat in the lounge. She did not take my name. 
2) We found an dirty table that still needed busing but it accommodated us awkwardly. Within 5minutes area was cleaned but it took longer to get menus or service. We weren't in a rush so that's okay but just not expected from such a place. 
3) food order taken we started with deviled eggs and Mac n cheese. Solid nothing above basic. Food comes out and our small table still has our dirty appetizer dishes and Un-filled water glasses on the table. Hubby is now peeved. 
4) food was not at all what the southern story of the owner describes. The chicken although was juicy and tender it was bland in flavor and my 3 squares of salted watermelon were really good but seriously, 1 inch 3 bites? That's it. THe brisket was over sauced, drenched in BBQ sauce and my husband only ate 1\/2. Mango salad on butter lettuce with grilled chicken was exactly that. The only dish that was worth an honorable mention was the slow roasted chicken salad that had this delicious sweet corn bread in it. 
5) I ordered a $5 sweet tea with my meal and it was really good! Served in a mason jar for that southern feel, I liked that. However, never asked if I needed a refill or wanted to order another. Out comes the check and I had to ask the server if the tea included a refill or could I order another? Her reply, "" oh, yeah..."" walks away. Ummmm, ok. I get the refill she takes the bill. We pay we leave. 
Moral of the review: 
A 2 stars ""I've had better, been treated better"" review. As Gordon Ramsey would say, "" Un ( insert F word) Believable!

Came here with a group of 12 while staying in the Venetian for bachelor party recovery brunch. We initially were turned away because we tried getting in without a reservation, but managed to get a reservation in the private room the next day. We sat in a side room with a giant mirror that doubled as a television, which was awesome. Most of my buddies were LSU fans, so we were able to catch some of the SEC games as we ate. Despite recovering from some previous night debauchery, we still went for the bacon Buffalo Trace old-fashioneds, as well as copious amounts of beer. C'mon, it's Vegas.

Some of the favorite dishes among the group:
- Deviled eggs with salmon roe: Not much we can say except how much filling was piled up, and as always, the salmon roe created the right amount of saltiness
- Fried green tomatoes with pork belly: Crunchy fried green tomatoes with pork belly just made for a really great combination, and the contrasts in texture really worked well 
- Biscuits and gravy with fried chicken (special): Super rich and meaty, with bits of pork sausage in the gravy, and the biscuit really held up throughout the meal without getting too soggy. Oh yeah, and there was bacon in it too. Whew.
- Fried chicken and waffles: Their classic dish, executed perfectly, and easily the favorite of the group. Waffle was crispy and chewy at the same time, and the fried chicken was perfectly crispy and juicy at the same time.

Service was very accommodating throughout the meal, and drinks were refilled at an incredibly efficient pace. Prices were reasonable, even at the sheer amount of food and drinks we ordered for 12 hungry dudes.

The staff, ALL that we encountered, were outstanding as we were rushing to head to the airport and the service was super efficient, warm and friendly.

Everything we ate was delicious and after 3 days in Vegas it was our best meal and our least expensive. 

We didn't have the chicken but it looked fantastic. We had quiche and eggs and bacon hash and a salted caramel bread pudding, which really ought to be subject to them requiring a license to serve. It was spectacular.

We started off with some classic biscuits.
Biscuits- They were so soft and fluffy. The honey butter and peppery tasting fruit jam were delicious. 

Low and Slow Smoked Chicken Salad- My mind was blown. The flavors and texture were so so good!! I am not a salad person, so I am very thankful that my friend decided to order this.
The chicken is soft and mixed with corn and a creamy buttermilk dressing that had a citrusy flavor. This is placed on top of a slightly sweet fried cornbread. There was some chicken and crunchy cornbread in every bite. I wish that dish would have lasted forever!! 

Fried Green Tomato BLT- Even though there were only 3 small pieces, they were packed with flavor. The fried green tomato was topped with some hummus made from peppers and pork belly. This is an interesting pairing of flavors, but they work well together. The pork belly melted in your mouth. I wish they gave more of the pork belly!

Bacon Hash- The hash was made of Yukon potatoes, yams, and pork belly. It was good, but was my least favorite appetizer item. I would not get this again.

Dulce de Leche Strawberry Waffle- The waffle sounded delicious so we got it. But, it was just a waffle topped with some cut strawberries and a dollop of cream. It was a decent waffle. This was definitely not worth the $15 price tag.

The theme of the restaurant is a upscale southern parlor. There is a bar that features plush couches with chicken feathers in the seams. There's a projector with Elvis and other artists. 

We arrived at 11 and were seated immediately.  We were informed of the famous chicken dishes and my party of 4 decided on the fried chicken, Mama's chicken biscuits and Mac & Cheese. 2 of my friends ordered a mimosa and Southern Peach cocktail.

Very similar to how the Haitian culture makes Gratin Macaroni and Cheese. Large noodles, thick like a casserole and oozing with cheese and flavor.

The atmosphere of the restaurant itself intrigued me, setup as a half-bar, half-restaurant establishment painted in black but somehow trying to imagine itself as modern southern chic? That is the best way I can describe it, especially considering that there was a projector displaying images of various southern icons on one wall mixed aside barn-style egg baskets hung up by the ceilings. All of this decor would be perfectly fine, if this restaurant actually had food that lived up to its southern-inspired roots. 

After our waitress gave us an incredible overview of their southern fried chicken, I decided to order a southern fried eggs benedict from their brunch menu. Although it was presented nicely, there was something about the chicken that just didn't taste right. It almost seemed like it was slightly undercooked (although it was hard to tell because the mood lighting i the restaurant was very dark). Additionally, the skin was not as crisp as authentic fried chicken that I have had at other restaurants, which of course is the main appeal of fried chicken in the first place. My boyfriend was lured into this restaurant by a burger that promised a pile of brisket, bacon, pork belly, and other meats stacked on top of it. However, when the burger came out there was barely any meat on it and from what I saw there definitely was not any brisket on it (unless the brisket was so thin it couldn't be seen?). 

We were so tired from walking around the strip, that we chose not to waste our energy on complaining about the burger and simply left, full but unsatisfied.

Part of me regrets saving the best for last and going to Yardbird for our last meal while in town. I made a reservation a month prior and added people to the reservation twice. The staff at Yardbird was extremely accommodating and helpful. I'm glad we made a reservation because it was over an hour wait to get in Yardbird on a Sunday at 12pm. 

Not only did we have the best food of our Vegas trip at Yardbird but we had the best service too. Our waitress, Carolina made our experience five stars. She recommended cocktails, appetizers and entrees. She took the time to answer everyone's questions and requests. We were a big group and she separated checks without the slightest problem (apparently it's a problem every where else in Vegas).

Now for the food.. oh em gee. We ordered the fried green tomatoes topped with thick bacon and it was a culinary experience. The green tomatoes were crisp and the bacon was perfectly cooked. We also shared the chicken and waffles and the Mac and cheese. The chicken and waffles was amazing. I have never had such juicy, moist fried chicken. The syrup was delicious and the cheddar cheese waffle complimented the chicken perfectly. The Mac and Cheese was also killer. I loved the crispiness of the breadcrumbs on top, mixed with the creaminess of the cheese. 

Another highlight of our experience was the baller cocktails. We ordered the Revival, an Old Fashioned and a Bloody Mary. All were equally great in different ways. The Bloody Mary had a nice thin mix to it that tasted fresh and light. The Revival is the perfect brunch drink for a bourbon lover. It was light and had a fresh citrus hint, making the bourbon not as heavy as a normal bourbon cocktail. The old fashioned was also delicious.

Both Carolina and Fernando were amazing, attentive, and made sure I was doing alright. The Gluten free fried chicken is not on the menu, you have to ask for it. But it's totally worth it. 

Already knowing that I wanted the GF Fried chicken, Carolina suggested I try the okra as well, which I had never had before.

My bf and I were craving chicken and waffles (out of all things in Vegas) when we stumbled upon this place on Yelp. We made our way to the Venetian and were seated almost immediately. 

We ordered the deviled eggs ($11) to start because it's one of their most famous dishes. Well, it was super delicious and had the right amount of seasoning on it! It had trout roe on top, which was a change but it totally worked well with the eggs and gave it the extra flavor. 

We also ordered the Chicken 'N Watermelon 'N Waffles ($36) and that was definitely one of the best dishes I've ever had. It may seem pricey but the entire plate was bigger than the two of our heads and it was actually really filling for two people. Plus, the whole dish was so heavenly and mouthwatering so the price was so worth it!

First of all, the chicken was fried perfectly and had this delicious seasoned flavor to it. We didn't realize how tasty fried chicken could be and Yardbird turned this comfort dish into a masterpiece! The watermelon had this spicy Cajun taste to it and it was such a unique flavor and it went so well with the fried chicken and waffles! Now the waffles were amazing as well and they had the perfect, cheesy and savory taste and soft texture. I seriously wish I could recreate the waffles and this entire dish at home! 

I'm so glad we didn't order more things because we were STUFFED after that and we wouldn't have been able to finish. But I'm also sad we weren't able to try anything else since we were so full. I've recommended those two dishes to all of my friends and they all enjoy them as well.

So I spoke to the waiter and expressed my concern and he suggested the southern revival he said I will get the flavors I want without the strong whiskey like taste and he was not kidding that drink was good!

Apps - we ordered the deviled eggs. It was good, filling had a lil too much mustard in my opinion but yummy. 

Entrees - daughter ordered fries and buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. Aunt ordered fried chicken and I went big by ordering fried chicken, watermelon and waffles.

We decided to get The Chicken and Waffles, the egg Benedict,  the brisket sandwich, biscuits, and peach cobbler. It was so interesting to us how most of the dishes comes with biscuits. It was pretty over whelming having so much carbs. But for the chicken, it was delicious!!! I would def come back and just order a bucket of it and eat it with hot sauce. The chicken was so crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The egg Benedict was just okay. Nothing special. About the brisket, don't get it! I thought it was so average. I was pretty impress with customer services there. Our waiter and one of the manager was so accommodating. He offered us a round of shots or desserts bc it was my friend bday. He also made sure we got everything we need and explained the menu very good. My friend was complaining how the waffles was soggy and he brought us out a new one on the house.

The Preacher's Ham Biscuits were just drool worthy. Probably the best thing we ordered. I'd say that and the ribs... Which we didn't order, but a friend did and we stole... because they were so good! We also ordered the chicken, waffles and watermelon, which was crispy and moist, plus the waffles were awesome.

The absolute only reason it didn't receive the 5th star from me is that the mac n' cheese and gnocchi pot pie and fell a little flat. The gnocchi seemed out of place, almost like a middle eastern inspired dish. Not southern at all. It was good, but just didn't mesh with the other items on the menu. 

I also ordered an old fashion, which was on point. The only thing we thought was weird was that they really pushed the desserts on us, HARD... Right when we got sat. Their schtick was that the one dessert needed to bake for 30 minutes, or something like that. I get it... Up-sell. But, it came off annoying. 

You definitely want to make a reservation. I made mine a couple weeks in advance and it was still one of the only spots left. Not too hard to find in the Venetian either. I'd even come here for drinks and snacks... And probably just the ribs alone!",4,1,4

Yardbird is not one of those places. If anything, they subvert it, because who comes to Nevada to get high-end preparations of dishes from the South? 

The fried chicken is obviously the thing to get here - juicy and incredibly crunchy - though the biscuit turned out to be a serving side that lent itself well to exploring other parts of the menu, too. The large bones delivered to our table rendered their marrow easily, though it was upstaged by the orange marmalade and tomato jam that came with it. Even a tomato salad in February was successful thanks to golf ball-sized heirloom tomatoes and homemade ricotta. 

After several of beers from one of the best tap selections on the Strip and an impossibly large butterscotch cake, the friends I brought to Yardbird were suitably impressed at the meal they had. It's maybe not what you come to Vegas to get, but it's excellent all the same.",4,0,2

Carolina was our server, along with a cast of support that never left you waiting for anything. Perfect balance of not hovering and leaving you alone too much if you know what I mean.

However, if you are a real southerner who is used to home cooked meals by your grandmother\/mother then you will not be impressed. 

The chicken is not as nearly impressive as it looks. It is NOT crispy, rather the skin is falling off with an almost too soft light texture. So you never really get that awesome and satisfying crunch when you think of great fried chicken. The concept was ideal but they didn't pull it off. 

The best dish was the Short Rib $32 14 oz. bone in short rib, charred corn, green beans sweet garlic bordelaise, cauliflower mashed potatoes. Expect a small portion of this with over-powering flavors of lingering oils!

Like, absolutely amazing. After making a reservation for my boyfriend's birthday dinner, we hit Yardbird on a Saturday night. It was packed and rightfully so. 

We were instantly greeted and seated. The decor is like... modern southern? If that's a thing? Anyway, it's super cute. We were in the area with the mason jar lights, which made my inner crafty girl want to come out for an at home project. 

For some reason we didn't anticipate that the dishes were large enough to share. So started with the Mac and Cheese then each ordered a chicken dish. He got the regular fried chicken and I go the Chicken, Watermelon and Waffles. First off, that Mac and Cheese was heavenly. It was served with bread crumbs on top and had excellent flavor. The watermelon that came with mine was marinated with some sort of spicy goodness, so each bite was a spicy bite followed by the sweetness of watermelon. Then the waffles are cheddar waffles, and were amazing dipped in the bourbon maple syrup or the hot sauce. But the chicken is the real winner. It was SO GOOD. I also got their bourbon blackberry lemonade which did not tasty boozy at all and I could have easily had like 5 of them. 

If you can, go to Yardbird. It is amazing and you will not be disappointed! Depending on your appetite, you miiiiiight want to share the chicken and order several sides to share. Stop what you're doing and make a reservation, because you won't regret it!",3,0,2

Me and 8 of my friends had rented out the gorgeous private room for the evening. We were busy talking for about 30 minutes until we noticed no one had come to help us. I went to grab a server and she apologized for the wait. Later, she was joined by one of the managers who also apologized. He then decided to hook us up with some complementary grub for the inconvenience. He did not have to do this, but because they were so apologetic and wanted us to have a good time, we had a fantastic experience the rest of the night.

The food was outstanding. The chicken and watermelon and waffles were on point. Chicken was moist and the outside was crispy. The fried green tomato BLT was tasty. They also have quite a list of cocktails, which did not skimp out on the alcohol.

My trusted Yelp confidant, Greg F. informed me of this place and then I noticed my other yelp peeps who visited as well. This place is beyond doubt one of the best stops I have ever had in Vegas. Since it was 3pm securing a spot was easy. I was able to make a reservation through OpenTable on the short ride over. When you get to the Venetian you can walk through the casino towards the theater or if you are upstairs in the canal shoppes find your way down to the bottom floor. 

The front has a nice open look and there is a large bar with some lounge seating available with plenty of TVs at the bar. We weren't sure what to expect with the seating arrangement. We were taken to the back of the restaurant closer to the kitchen. Some of the tables are kind of tight. You will have to squeeze in between other people eating to get in your seat. That was probably the only negative thing about the seats but the seats were comfortable and the table had plenty of room. The lighting was nice, not too bright or dark but just right. Tyler our server came by right away and introduced himself and then shared the daily special and explained the brunch menu. Then we were given some complimentary champagne, which was very good. I informed the restaurant on OpenTable about our anniversary. It was a nice little surprise for the wifey. 

Just a warning: The food portions are ginormous and can easily be split. With that said, it was no holds barred and I dove into the deep end without my floaties. I knew there was no way we would finish everything but who cares, it's Vegas and going all in is the name of the game. I started with some maple bacon donuts and I was very impressed. The deviled eggs were something I have never been into but my wife insisted that I give them a try and I was glad I did. Tyler recommended the brunch special for $20, biscuits topped with a fried chicken breast, bacon, gravy, and eggs. It was beyond delicious. I wanted to slap myself because I thought it was all a dream and did not believe that this concoction of gravy, biscuits, and bacon could be so rich. I have tried similar platters at other run of the mill breakfast spots and never had the same euphoric feeling. I usually feel miserable after eating at those other spots. It was completely different here. It was like I never wanted it to end. 

My wife ordered the Chicken n Watermelon n Waffles ($36). I would have paid 2x that for that plate. The fried chicken was cooked to perfection. Tender, moist, and no dry part on the bird. The waffles are cheese infused and the watermelon had a sweet flavor to it. The food is densely packed with all the carbohydrates and calories you will need for a week. We even ordered a side of biscuits but those pretty much went to waste because we barely ate half of each of the plates. I even offered to share some appetizers with the guests around me because we had so much food. 

During our meal, Sandra one of the main chefs overheard we were Dodgers fans from the LA area and she offered to buy us dessert. We went the banana pudding. I thought it was going to be a bowl of banana pudding but it was a jar with sponge cake and vanilla wafers, with the pudding topped with baked shaved bananas. It was truly amazing. Thanks, Sandra for the wonderful dessert. I wanted to give a special shout out to Tyler. He made our experience that much more memorable. It was like he knew what we wanted before we ordered it. He was very friendly and lots of insight on the menu and different offerings. We were lucky to be seated in his section that day. He needs a medal or a raise would be better. 

The strip is a great place to hang out but most of the time you find overpriced food or restaurants that have a very trendy look inside with loud music blaring in the background. I was surprised to see such a simple yet classy looking set up at the Venetian. Yes, the food is not cheap but it is not that expensive. Our entire meal with several beers and cocktails ran me close to $130 which was not bad. Give them a try. BTW, uber from one end of the strip to the other is $8-14 depending on the time of day.

After getting no text we walked back and asked if we could wait at the bar.( Should have asked that to begin with.) We were told we would be seated in two minutes.   Not so much, must have been almost ten with other people being seated before us. Also between ten  to fifteen minutes for our drinks. And when the food arrived only two of our three people were served leaving the other to wait about five minutes for their food. Awkward!

This was more than enough food to share between the two of us. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the bacon hash and chicken, while I was more into the chicken, waffles and watermelon! Let's start with the chicken, my goodness it was the juiciest and most tender fried chicken I have ever eaten! The waffles paired very well with the chicken and bourbon maple syrup. I enjoyed every single bite. The watermelon was chilled and spice, to me it was very herb-like and fresh. I enjoyed the watermelon and found it to be somewhat of a palette cleanser and a good way to end our meal, whereas my friends and husband did not like it so much. If you're a fan of seasoning your fruit then I think you'll enjoy the watermelon as much as me, it was so refreshing!

Now, for the food.  We ordered 
Ribs - Delicious and cooked to perfection.  Will order again.
Chilled Watermelon - Huge cubes of chilled watermelon with herbs and seasoning to make it savoury.  Neat!
Fried Green Tomatoes - I like!  This is so good.  Breaded Green Tomatoes, topped with belly pork and little bits of greens.
Devilled Eggs - Tall and swirly egg yolks don these eggs.  Need more seasoning, I believe.
Mac & Cheese - Needs more seasoning or a sharper cheese mix.  Probably won't order this again unless they change the recipe.
Charred Okra - Delicious!  Such a simple dish with a dash of vinegar and charred okra really works!
Fried Chicken - Pretty good fried chicken; good dipping sauce with a kick.
Biscuits - Nice, warm biscuits with whipped butter and homemade strawberry jam.

First, the setting and staff were excellent.  They knew the menu down to fine detail, including the ingredients of each dish.   

The food was amazing.  The fried chicken kicks the Colonel's butt handily, and comes with a honey hot dipping sauce.   The fries were terrific, as was the Mac and cheese.   The highlight though was the cornbread.   It is a must try, gotta have, don't leave without it dish.

I was contemplating the chicken & waffle dish, figured $36 is a little ridiculous and went with the crispy chicken biscuits instead. No regrets here, the portion was still massive and very affordable at $14. I loved the pickled onions that came with it and pepper jelly on the chicken for a nice little spice. Also winning was the Kale salad - very fresh and some much needed veggies. 

From food to service, everything was just right here and we enjoyed a nice Saturday morning brunch. Reservations are recommended, it seemed to fill up pretty quickly. I'd definitely try to come back on future trips to Vegas",3,0,2

Yardbird was recommended by our family friend Olga, who works there as a food runner. We were met with a big smile of the hostess, who made sure we liked the table she offered us. In just a few moments, our server Jojo came over and showed a deep knowledge of the menu, and made all the right recommendations. 
We started off with a Green Tomato BLT, which was simply amazing. For a main course we ordered one of the most popular dishes - Fried chicken w\/ waffles and watermelon. The chicken was tender and juicy, it seemed that it was even partially deboned for an easy splitting. We loved every bit of it. The watermelon cubes were tossed in some sort of mint and pepper flakes mix, which was surprisingly refreshing. 
The service was top notch, and we were even surprised by a luscious red velvet cheesecake for our first time visit :)

About 5 min later a waitress brought our water and said a server would be with us shortly. After a 15 min wait of admiring the sweet southern touches of decor, I went in search of someone who would help serve us.  

I landed a gentleman, forgive me I can't remember his name, who explained that he is working for Yardbird as they expand to multiple locations. He apologized profusely about our wait.  He sat with us for several minutes as we placed our order....but then he said we needed to order more. He suggested the deviled eggs (heavily dilled), blt sandwiches (a fried green tomato topped with a a hunk of fried pork and frisée salad) and the blackberry lemonade. He comped all of those items for us. And, well, he hit the nail on the head. They all were amazing. We also had ordered the fried chicken (a massive meal of THE best chicken I've ever had), a wedge salad (corn, ice burg, dilled ranch, tomatoes) and fried okra.

The table, of course, shared the infamous fried chicken and peach cobbler (which takes 30 min. to make so order early). The fried chicken just fell off the bone! Would have wanted a crunchier crust, but all is forgiven with that sauce! The peach cobbler was enjoyable.

I believe in 2nd chances so while still in Vegas, I decided to take my work friends to Yardbird on Friday night. As soon as we sat, I explained my previous experience to our server. He wasn't an ordinary server but the corporate trainer who was filling in. He assured me that they will not repeat the performance from earlier and I am glad to say he was right. I upped my rating to 5 and would go higher if possible. I wish I could remember his name cause he was great. Brooklyn Hipster looking guy with a bad ass mustache. He knew the menu and made great recommendations. 

Everything was really incredible. We started with the Deviled eggs, Short Rib Biscuits, Grits, Cauliflower and the Wedge salad. The Wedge was the best Ive ever had. The pork belly melted in our mouth.

We then destroyed a Chicken & Waffles & Watermelon, 2 Lewellyn's and 1 Smoked BBQ. It was hot, juicy, crispy and everything that I expected. 

Steve, the director of operations, made sure to come by and check on us. The treated us like VIPs. 

The group collectively agreed that this was the best meal we've had during our last 4 Vegas trips and we've eaten at some fancy steak joints and other celebrity restaurants. 

I will say that YardBird has redeemed themselves and is back to being the BEST FRIED CHICKEN I've ever had.

During a slow lunch service, we ordered the Mama's Chicken Biscuits, the Crunchy Yardbird Sandwich, and the Mac and Cheese.

As far as the chicken biscuits, the actual biscuits were wonderful: buttery and fluffy. They were exactly what a biscuit should be. The pickles were gross. I have never liked sweet and sour pickles, and I was in for a surprise as I popped one in my mouth. (We opted to order the biscuits without the pepper jelly). 

The chicken is very weird. It's almost as if the staff takes a piece of white meat, a piece of dark meat, and sticks it together before battering and frying. I am not big on dark meat, so I was not happy with it. I could only take a few bites before I decided it really just wasn't worth the calories, and I did not enjoy it. I will give it to the chefs, as it was juicy. 

The Crunchy Yardbird Sandwich had mayo and more of the yucky pickled vegetables. This was not listed on the menu, and I would have a preferred a head's up on these items, as I do not like them. the bacon is not so much bacon as it is pork belly. The hot sauce is definitely the same honey hot sauce on other items. Again, they're adding sweetness where I would really prefer they left it out. 

The Mac and Cheese was okay. Not bad, but I can make better, and why come to a restaurant for something that you can make better? 

The food is also fairly pricey. Especially because I left feeling that my calories could have been spent better elsewhere.

The decor and service were top notch. Not only is the environment warm and welcoming, but the staff is so attentive that it is on par with a fine dining restaurant. But, ultimately, I don't come to restaurant for the service and atmosphere.",2,1,1

Nice list of Nevada beers on tap and numerous bottles. 

Two of us shared the Mac and cheese and lewellyn's fried 1\/2 chicken. The Mac and cheese was very good and served in a small skillet. They are known for their chicken that is marinated for 27 hours and then fried. I have to say, fried chicken should be pretty crispy in my book, this was really greasy and soft. $26 for the chicken and $10 for the Mac and cheese. $8 for a pint of beer. 

Just average and doubt we will be back with all of the other great restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from.",1,1,1

The service was not good. From the moment we got there Tracy questioned just about everything we said. He asked if we wanted water... we said no and he acted surprised and then didn't take our drink orders at all. When he came back he asked if we were ready to order and we did and he seemed annoyed that we didn't ask him what to order. I felt kind of bad and asked if we missed something and he told us the biscuits were to die for. So we ordered a basket to go with our meal. He then asked if we wanted a drink...

I ordered the shrimp and grits and my wife ordered the brisket sandwich. The shrimp and grits was ok but my wife said the brisket was unreal. The biscuits this guy went on and on about were ok. I'm not trying to bash this place as the food was good but it's not all I was expecting for a $60 lunch. And disappointed in the service, my wife ran out of water completely, and was more than half way through her sandwich before he managed to bring ketchup, salt and pepper.

The lounge area was doing a brisk business and many tables in the dining rooms were occupied. We were seated in an area that consists of a row of 2 person tables.

These tables are close together and results in hearing the next tables conversation. This was our situation in that next to us were 2 women and 1 man. The man was monopolizing the conversation and overly loud. Must have been trying to impress.??
Service was spot on and friendly. Water glasses were promptly refilled and our server walked us through the entire menu.  
We shared an order of chicken, (basically a half  a chicken) since it was described as enough for 2 people. Our side was the roasted fingerling potatoes. Food is delivered as it is ready and not held until all items are done. The chicken came out first followed a few minutes later by the potatoes. A small container of tangy dipping sauce is served on the side. Overall wait time for the food was short.

The chicken was hot and juicy with a nice crunchy skin. The sauce was a perfect complement if you like it a little spicy. The fingerling potatoes were excellent and the quantity was more than we could consume as the chicken was the first priority.

The decor is interesting with many pictures of celebrities and various mason jars displayed around the restaurant. The specialty drinks are also served in mason jars.

I was sold the moment I saw the fried green tomato BLT online prior to visiting. My initial plan was just to stop in for a few pieces of chicken and some fried green tomatoes but ended up ordering a mini feast for myself. Going through the menu I saw cheddar waffles...CHEDDAR WAFFLES!!! with spiced watermelon and chicken. I'm use to the traditional chicken and waffles so I had to give these waffles a try and I was blown away. DELICIOUS!!! Adding maple syrup to the waffles didn't take away from the cheddar flavor mixing quite well. I glanced at another table and saw the mac and cheese so of course I wasn't leaving without ordering some also.

Funny story for kicks. I came to Yardbird after drinking on the strip with a friend and ended up going into the restaurant next to Yardbird thinking it was Yardbird before realizing it wasn't. Ordered drinks and everything only to have to leave and go next door. This actually gave a couple of staff members who were very nice by the way at Yardbird a good laugh when telling the story.

Glad I finally made it to the correct restaurant and will be paying future visits because those chicken and waffles are awesome.

On our way, we passed by Yardbird, so I went in to see if they did indeed have no availability.  They didn't.  HOWEVER, they did have seating in the lounge area.  It's basically some couches surrounded by a few chairs.  I thought this was a great idea and even better than a regular table.  Right when we picked our own seating area, the hostess sat us down and we were given some menus.
 
After a few minutes, Kerri came over to help us.  She explained some of the more popular items and answered a few of our questions.  We ended up getting the Fried Green Tomato BLT, Mac and Cheese for the kids (no kids menu, but this was perfect for them), Original fried chicken (also for the kids), Short Rib, and a special of the day, which was fish.  First, the BLT was surprisingly good.  I normally ""like"" fried green tomatoes, but I ""love"" this appetizer (not a sandwich).  The tomato was such a refreshing take on the classic BLT.  The kids also loved their meals and I would have to agree that both the Mac and Cheese and the chicken were good as I had a little taste of both of them.  While the fish (cod) was cooked perfectly (crispy skin and all, along with some fabulous risotto), my favorite was easily the short rib.  The meat was incredibly tender and was so flavorful.  Since we were sharing all the dishes, I almost told my wife to get something in the room, so I could finish it all by myself!!  I'm just kidding, I would never do that.  I would send her to the nearest bathroom instead............
 
All the people working there were fantastic!  Unbelievably friendly and just made our whole experience there a blast.

We got 2 deviled eggs with trout eggs...  the fried chicken, and a ham sandwich...  cost $101.00       The food was average at best.

My suggestion.... go to KFC, get the original recipe and add some chives and black pepper it is the same thing!   The ham Sandwich nothing more than store bought ham on a KFC biscuit.   The Trout Eggs added salt to the boring deviled eggs... again, a pinch of table salt..  would do the same thing.   Total bill should have been about $35, and that would be pricey.

Dinner:

Fried chicken: DELICIOUS probably the best I've ever had. Flavor, crispy and moist. My friend has been to Willie Mae's in New Orleans and she said it was not Willie Mae's good but comparable.

Mac n Cheese: so simple but yet so cheesy and so good

Deviled Eggs: so creamy and flavorful

Shrimp & Grits: oh man flavor explosion...everything in each bite is just perfect. The seasoning was on point and the grits itself is so creamy.

Kale Salad: simple yet good 

Skillet Corn Bread: best cornbread I've had ..... so moist and tasty

Brunch:

Chicken Salad: so good & not over mayo which i love 

Yardbird's special biscuit & gravy: OMGGGGGG this one was amazing. Biscuits with bacon and fried chicken topped with gravy and eggs. Need I say more? Just get it

The hype of this particular place is buzzing, and honestly, this has been on my ""hit-lists"" spot to try, even before I landed in the city of lights. On our most recent trip, we were staying at the Palazzo, so obviously we headed here with no hesitation and heartful of expectations. 

We were lucky enough to snatch a reservation just a few hours prior, as this place is always crowded and RSVP is definitely a must! The restaurant is quite spacious, they got two separate areas for bar and dining and the latter was especially gorgeous. It has that Southern charm atmosphere and at the same time sophisticated and warm. The glass jar light bulb on the ceiling was the most noticeable feature about the interior, #creativemuch. 

Yardbird dead on simple menu was superb. It listed Southern comfort fare that sounded scrumptious, but for my first visit, I had my eyes on the main star of this restaurant. THE BIRD. Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffle: each order comes in 4 cuts, deep fried! blocks of chilled spiced watermelon and 2 slabs of cheddar cheese waffles. On a detailed note, the chicken was wonderful, crispy, juicy and flavorful. The waffle was yum, fluffy and buttery. The spiced watermelon, even tho playful with the flavors, it was just not my thing. 

Overall, this was good, but with a $36 price tag, it was a little heavy on the pocket. The portions, however, was pretty generous, could easily be shared between two, but as for me, I could have this all for myself, happily.

Our server Tracy, aka Hatch, was one of the best servers I've had--personable, playful, and professional with such an authentic character. He knew exactly what to recommend based on my preferences and I was impressed with how well he knew the menu.

My love and I shared Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles with Louisiana hot sauce and Maple syrup, Fried Green Tomato BLT, Shrimp 'N' Grits, and Velvet & Berries...oh, and I also enjoyed a Southern Revival cocktail.  It confused me so much how delicious the fried skin part of the Chicken was. The dish came with a half chicken which included both dark and white meat, but it really didn't matter to me as long as it was covered with fried skin. I could do without both the watermelon and waffle, though the watermelon was nicely seasoned and refreshing. Prior to dinner we stoped down the road and enjoyed a cocktail from master mixologist Juyoung at Delmonico. I certainly enjoyed this cocktail, but my tastebuds were pleasantly surprised by the Southern Revival--perfect to my likings.   

Throughout our dinner, service never fell short of being the best...from the hostess to our delightful server we were professionally taken care of...the floor was well maned with servers and front of house managers looking out for happy patrons.   

I am not typically a fan of anything-fried, but I am a huge fan of Yardbird's fried bird...we will be back soon.

We had the chicken waffles and smoked chicken salad to share, loved both dishes!  Beautiful presentation on the salad and large portion size on the chicken waffles.  Good taste, I liked the bourbon syrup too.

Service was good and food came promptly despite a large crowd as there were many people from the Adobe Summit dining there.",0,0,0

Being a Vegas restaurant, I realized it wouldn't be cheap, but I don't mind paying for really good food.

I ordered from the bar. Service was excellent and knowledgeable.  I had a cold pilsner while I waited.  As it turned out, the half chicken arrived in less than two minutes.  A wing, thigh, leg and breast came with a small ramekin of honey based sauce.  Unfortunately, the chicken was tepid, and the coating soggy.  The skin beneath the coating was flaccid.  

I really didn't use much of the honey sauce, because the breading was already wet.   The chicken itself was good quality, but I suspect had been sitting under a lamp for quite some time.  I scoffed it down quickly before it got cold. 

The bartender asked me how I liked it, and I answered honestly.  He apologized and offered to replace it (I really should have asked when it arrived) and I declined.   Minutes later, a very sincerely concerned manager arrived, and explained that pressure frying did not result in crispy chicken (which I believe KFC had proven otherwise.)  He was polite, and sincerely wanted my feedback.  In the end, they comped the $18 draft beer on the bill.  It was a nice gesture.  I'm certain it is a well managed restaurant, but if you are expecting to be wowed by this signature dish, you might want to look at some other menu items.",1,0,0

My wife ordered fried chicken and we had great expectations.  My wife took a few bites and told me...'it's good, but it's not as good as yours'.  I love my wife!  We shared the ribs and chicken and macaroni and cheese.  I agreed with her, the fried chicken missed the mark.  It was battered too much and hence not crispy enough.  It was also rather bland.  

However...lets talk about that macaroni and cheese!  OMG.  Quite possibly the best mac and cheese I've ever had anywhere.  We both agreed on that!

The ribs also - fantastic .  Not over cooked - just perfect with great flavor.  

Also, the drinks were great! 

Highly recommended.

That mack and cheese, though..seriously...yum.",1,1,1

This came with four pieces. Also the classic biscuits (4) which were served with butter and apple butter. Yum! The mac and cheese ($10) was amazingly creamy and cheesy. Big enough for a side for two people, but I also could have eaten the whole thing myself! The deviled eggs were delish (6 halves) and filled very high. To finish, we got the chocolate Nutella cake. It was large enough to share and very yummy as well. Overall we were very happy with our meal and service. Everyone was very friendly, manager even came over to chat, and we were thanked multiple times as we left. A server was walking by with something that I said looked delicious and he stopped to tell us what it was! I believe it was the peach cobbler (I was trying not to drool)! He also mentioned that it takes about 20-30 minutes to make, just FYI! Also, the restaurant is really cool inside. And there are lots of whiskey\/bourbon drinks!

A week before our Vegas trip I saw it listed in my AAA Via email in their 6 places to go in Vegas article. For some reason this stood out more than the rest and I decided to make reservations for my husband's birthday. I saw pictures of the maple glazed bacon donuts (mmm, bacon) and couldn't miss out on those so brunch it was. We arrived and were greeted by the friendly hostess, and immediately after sitting we were greeted by our waiter. In Vegas the service is always pretty good because hotels live by their reputation, but each person on the wait staff from top to bottom was A+.

We ordered the donuts along with coffee and a couple cocktails. I had the Rumble N Sway, and my husband had the Southern Revival. I'd have to say mine was a bit strong for brunch (better for dinner) but it was smooth and tasty. The Southern Revival was a bit more refreshing. I'll have to try the Bloody Mary I saw next time - it had a whole slice of bacon as part of their garnish! Yum! I didn't see it on the brunch or cocktail menu somehow. Bummer! Anyhow, back to the donuts...they were SO tasty! They weren't overly sweet or heavy, and the butterscotch dipping sauce was the bomb! I saved half of them for later, which were needed after a heavy drinking day in Vegas let me tell you haha.

Then I had the fried chicken and waffles and the hubby had a special biscuits and gravy. The chicken was so juicy and flavorful, albeit a little heavy on the salt but better than bland, am I right?  I didn't need much of the bourbon maple syrup because everything just melted in your mouth. I wasn't a fan of the watermelon but it was refreshing with all the heavy food. His biscuits came with a piece of chicken and then slices of thick bacon and country gravy over them.

After the meal, our server brought out a birthday ""dessert"" for the hubby's birthday. Because we already had the donuts he gave us a coffee cake, but by then we were STUFFED to the brim! Really nice gesture though. Again, the service was a real star here. I'm going back each time I go to Vegas now because I still need to try the shrimp and grits, and for sure that bloody Mary!",0,0,0

The crispy fried skin on the outside was just perfect. I was very impressed by their award winning chicken. For sides we got the Mac and cheese. Again, delicious. And I also tried the shrimp and grits. I thought this was okay. It's a wonderful set up in the restaurant. There's a casual lounge in upon entering with a large bar and community tables and booths.

The only real disappointment was that the man next to us had paid for our meal & drinks prior to him leaving because we were newly engaged which was extremely nice of him, but because of that we stopped getting service. I didn't know for sure until we had asked for the bill, but now I understood why our bartender had suddenly stopped acknowledging and serving us. She had probably already been taken care of by him.

Chicken on a biscuit was so good. Makes you want to slap your momma...(that's a saying, I don't endorse violence).

My husband's cocktail was some bourbon with basil and infused with bacon mixture. It was well balanced and I even drank a few sips.

My salad was grilled and I added pulled chicken: mistake. Salad good, a little warm with a light but tasty ceasar-like dressing. The pulled chicken tasted just like beef jerky. I made my husband try it to make sure I wasn't crazy. He agreed. It was cold, beef jerky flavored chicken. It wasn't very appetizing so I ate the salad and left most of the chicken. Also, I stole from of his food. 

The mac & cheese was 3\/5. It wasn't worth the calories or the $10 for a side. 

We saw a few families. It's pretty casual but in an elegant setting.

I would've never thought of trying a cocktail with passion fruit in it, but it tasted so delicious. What a concoction!

For my entree, I ordered the Swine burger which came with a side of fries. My bf went with the 1\/2 smoked bbq chicken. It came with French fries and charred okra with cotija cheese as its two sides. I had nothing bad to say about the food at all. It was simply delicious. 

The food was amazing and so was the service. I can't wait to come back here!",1,0,0

Being from the Deep South, this wasn't straight up southern fare - it was a southern fare base with a chef uptwist.  The deviled eggs were a must have.  Not mom's Sunday afternoon but a great mix of home with flair.  And I watched them carry them around the dining room the entire time we sat for lunch.  But if you only get one item, it has to be the fried green tomato BLT.  A solid fried green tomato topped with pimento spread and a sweet slab of pork belly.  That alone was worth the price of admission.  For the entree I went with the swine burger.  It was a carnival of BBQ meats.  The fries were done well- a little crisp outside.  We passed on the desserts but they looked worthy as well.  I also tried the crunchy yardbird sandwich.  It had a whole bunch of flavors going on.

I had more people join my party than my original reservation and the hostess was very accommodating.
I had a double whiskey sour while I waited for my table and it was exactly what I needed after a long day at work. The table was ready pretty quickly for a group of 7 people. 

My staple here is usually the fried chicken with Mac & cheese and it didn't disappoint. It was crispy, tender on the inside, a little spicy and full of flavor. It was just as good as I remember from Miami, if not better! The other people in my group hadn't tried the fried chicken before and were blown away by it.

But then what caught my eye was the spiced watermelon. So I made a reservation for four @ 9:30 on a Saturday night and when got there surprisingly it wasn't crowded. (the crowd came after we were leaving which was around 10:30ish, then it was busy!)  so the host was very nice and friendly, and I told her about my reservation and she was happy to seat us 15 mins early. 

The way this place is set up is, when you enter it's dark like a lounge, there isn't like normal chairs and tables setup. So I thought to myself, well alright, I don't mind trying this out, but we were taking to the back and then it looked like a regular restaurant, lights were bright, normal chairs and tables. 

So we were looking here on yelp for anything that stood out to us and I saw a pic of the watermelon with fried chicken. I wanted it right away lol. Plus our server is that was one of their most popular dishes. Our server was nice, friendly, very positive. I really liked her. It's called Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles.

Wow!! That was amazing! Just thinking about it right now, I want it!! The pieces were BIG! We got five big pieces of spiced watermelon, four big pieces of fried chicken, a whole waffle that's fold in half to make four pieces. It comes with syrup and honey hot sauce which is amazing! I didn't like the texture of the waffles though. To me it was overdone. I like my waffles soft and not where I need to keep chewing on it. So that wasn't fun. That watermelon was my favorite!!! Juicy, with some spice and it went really well with the chicken. The chicken was good too. It wasn't dry, it was crispy and oh how I wish I could have more now!

The decor is nice and service was great. And the food is certainly better quality than KFC. Therefore it gets 3 stars. But at the end of the day it is still just fried chicken with a hefty price tag.  The dark chicken I had was good. The fry was good and didn't fall apart when eating. Though it was very greasy. My white chicken was overcooked.

As for the other items, the roasted carrots weren't roasted long enough. The fries were good, but for $10 bucks they better not mess up fries. The fried green tomatoes with pork belly were okay, but the pork belly was overcooked. 

You could get the same quality fried chicken at a LA hole-in-the-wall chicken joint.  In short, don't waste your money here.",1,1,1

Anyway, came tonight with a reservation to celebrate my mothers birthday. The hostesses were sweet and accommodating. The bussers were also very friendly and on top of things. When I made the reservation I asked for a birthday note on the dessert plate along with a candle( and for them to keep it under wraps---surprise!). They executed that perfectly and made our evening very special. 

The server though....
I think his name was Bryce( name on receipt).
He was so dope! He was so friendly, engaging, and very kind. He explained the concept and offered great suggestions. Although I've been to Yardbird Miami, he let my mother know how things work. And not even that, the way he did it was awesome it didn't feel rehearsed or forced--just genuine.  Little things like offering another round before my drink is empty, checking in on food quality and taste after a few bites...those things matter and he gave us an opportunity to express any displeasure. There wasn't any, everything was amazing from the fried green tomatoes to the dessert!  The kindest thing was that they told my mom dessert was on them. Bryce looked directly at her and told her. I honest to god really appreciated the extra step. 

Thank you Bryce, YardBird staff, and management for such a great memory! I'll be sure to visit every time I'm back in town.

Boy, it did not disappoint!

I started off with the Violet Beauregarde Old Fashioned. It had Patron in it which intrigued me...and Tequila Lisa wanted to come out. It was very tasty, not too strong but you can definitely taste the tequila. 

The biscuits are sooooo addicting. Still nice and warm when brought out to the table, soft and fluffy on the inside. Eat it with their honey butter...ooohwee!

The chicken and waffles is the dish to order, it's actually their most popular dish. Everything about it made me so happy. The chicken was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and perfect with the honey hot sauce. Waffles were warm and fluffy, drizzled with the bourbon maple syrup that wasn't overly sweet either. I'm a waffles kinda gal.

We also ordered the mac n cheese and crispy brussel sprouts to accompany the chicken and waffles and both were really good as well. 

Our server was very accommodating and friendly. He checked on us frequently, and made a few trips back to the kitchen to ask about cinnamon being in any of the dishes for my friend who is allergic.

The food and the service clearly were exceptional.  Having eaten at almost every restaurant in The Venetian it's clear Yardbird is No. 1.

Dinner began with a killer watermelon cocktail with whiskey.  I should of only had one; however, chose to have 3, maybe 4?  We then split the bone marrow appetizer.  It was an interesting presentation, very Fred Flintstonesque.  It may have been a tad too rich for me but was tasty.  They also lacked marrow spoons to facilitate eating the meat.

I then had the best iceberg wedge salad of my life.  The dressing was yogurt based and the bacon was cut into cubes fried and served hot.  It was a massive portion clearly enough for 2.  It was yummy.

Entrée was shrimp with grits.  It was exceptional once again and something I will eat again.

The lady and I were staying at the Palazzo and looking for somewhere awesome to eat, and we found Yardbird which appealed to her southern tastes and my love for pretty much anything BBQed or fried.

The food is just insanely good.  We started with the fried green tomatoes which were perfect.  The pork belly was cooked just right and the tomatoes were so juicy.  She ordered the ribs and I got the fried chicken and both were so delicious we had to keep sharing with each other.  I also have to give a shoutout to the okra.  Probably the best I've ever had.  Just incredibly flavorful.  That's what literally everything we ate there was.  Straight flavor.  We could barely walk out of there afterwards.  Also, the blackberry bourbon lemonade.  Damn it's good.

Also, the service was top-notch, arguably the best I've received at any restaurant.  Carolina was a terrific, attentive server and chatted with my lady about being from Florida, and the manager stopped by as well to check on us.

In regards to the food, the food was okay.  My friends ordered two appetizers, which were the bourbon glazed donuts, and biscuits.  According to my friends, the donuts and biscuits were delicious.  I ordered the chicken and waffles, my friends ordered an open face omelet,  deviled eggs, fried green tomato, and the shrimp n' grits.  I enjoyed my chicken and waffle minus the watermelon salad ( I only removed the watermelon because I do not like it) however, the presentation was nice.

I couldn't wait to get to Yardbird after reading the reviews- and the food did not disappoint! A girlfriend and I had reservations on a Friday night around 8pm, and were taken back immediately to our two-top. The restaurant was busy but not packed, although we were seated quite close to two other tables and it was a little awkward getting in and out without shoving my butt in someone's face. Our server was odd from the get-go, dropping off menus and only making eye contact with my friend, speaking to her, and handing things to her. Perhaps he was particularly enamored with her, but it was like I did not exist. I had to get my menu from her after he handed her two, and then tell him that I too, wanted a cocktail, after he had taken her order. He didn't come back much throughout the rest of the evening, and it took us quite some time to get more water and the bill, but service aside, the food was phenomenal. 

Salivating, our eyes glazed over as we read the menu, and it was hard to narrow down our choices as we easily could have ordered everything. It all comes out as it's ready, so there really are no ""appetizers, mains"" etc., which is fun to share but we also quickly accumulated a table full of food that we couldn't keep up with, so the pacing might need some work. 

We had the FRIED PICKLES w\/ aioli, which were long, crunchy spears- really delicious. The DEVILED EGGS are a must order, savory and plentiful, and I love the addition of dill. (Try pouring the hot sauce on them!) The FRIED GREEN TOMATOES were good, topped with pimento cheese, pork belly, and frisee. I wish there was more of a crunch aspect to this, as the tomato and cheese tend to blend together as one mushy texture, but still pretty tasty. By far, the best thing we had was the FRIED CHICKEN WITH CHEDDAR WAFFLES AND WATERMELON. Honest to god, the best fried chicken I've ever had, with the best hot sauce I've ever had. I believe they brine it for 48 hours. The waffle, which I usually don't love because they are too sweet, was savory, with cheddar baked in, and was topped with a fresh and spicy pepper salsa\/relish. Big cubes of watermelon were on the side with some sort of thyme garnish, and man..so good. I dug right in and ate with my hands- which is how you eat fried chicken- but you will get stares if you do this. I had a whiskey cocktail with passion fruit puree and basil that was pretty tasty- and considering what it usually costs to eat on the Strip, this was a good deal. I usually leave restaurants like this feeling disappointed by mediocre food and a huge bill but this was worth every penny and I can't wait to go back.",2,1,1

As a southerner living in Las Vegas, it is nice having a place to get warm biscuits, endless sweet tea and fried green tomatoes. I brought two friends for Thanksgiving lunch and we enjoyed every bit of it. We arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation and the hostess was really accommodating, telling us to let her know when we were ready to take the table. We started out our afternoon at the bar where Amanda, who was really sweet and made us some great drinks, and gave us good food recommendations.  Lizzette (Lizetta?) was our waitress and she was amazing. Really friendly, very knowledgeable and got us everything we needed to enjoy our meal in addition to providing fresh cutlery and plates for our main courses. We shared the biscuits, fried okra, fried chicken, fried green tomatoes, collard greens deviled eggs, shrimp and grits and a turkey dinner, which came with cauliflower mash and mac and cheese. Everything was delicious, although it would have been nice for the turkey dinner to have come with a little bit more (more meat (the slices were tiny), more gravy, green beans, more cranberry sauce, maybe a couple more biscuits, it was a $32 plate and seemed a bit bare for the price). All in all, we enjoyed our meal and Lizette(ta?) packed up all of our leftovers for us, even splitting some items for us to take separately from each other. I also took a piece of the bourbon pecan pie as a late night snack for later and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere of the restaurant is also very nice. It is quietly busy, if that makes sense, and the tables are nicely spread out so you don't feel as if you are BFF with the table beside you. I love the entire layout of this restaurant.

This could've had something to do with our earlier arrival time (we sat down for brunch at around 10:30 am) and the amount of staff they had on hand, but our main server was great.  He was very attentive and inquisitive, and seemed very committed to delivering a quality experience.  The bussers also appeared in a snap to pick up discarded napkin rings as soon as they hit the table and clear plates as soon as the last bite had been consumed.

The atmosphere is also great.  Kind of a early 20th century southern feel, and they project old photos of musicians on the wall to keep your eyes occupied.  

The food is tasty, although very heavy.  I started off with a bourbon blackberry lemonade.  We also got the deviled eggs, kale salad, mac and cheese, and the savory cheddar waffle.  It was all very tasty, though the flavors were so heavy and rich I felt pretty sluggish for the remainder of the afternoon.  Definitely a strong bourbon theme running through their food, so if you hate bourbon be wary.  

They also have a very extensive drinks list.  In addition to the very interesting mixed drink options, they have a solid wine list and an excellent 2 page beer list.  They feature many local beers on draft, which is tough to find on the strip.  We ended up trying a flight of their local Nevada pours.

So with 5 star service, 5 star atmosphere, 5 star drink list and 4 star food (yummy but just a tad heavy for me), I'd give this an overall 5 star experience.",2,0,1

It was like a scene from a movie and the ambiance was perfect. I think this would be a great spot for drinks (they mentioned they might add a live band which would be an added bonus!)

For the food: the best way for me to describe the food is that it's different. It's not your average southern fried chicken joint, they put a twist on everything. 
Also, we tried some of the unusual items that I've never heard of before, we wanted to be adventurous! 


Here is what we ordered:

Quail egg- very good quail (my first time trying that) but it was a little weird nibbling on the bone, it's much smaller that a chicken (obviously) but the meat was tender and juicy.

Pork Croquette- I have to admit, when I saw it come out, I was a little uneasy about it. This is probably the most unusual item I have ever ordered. I only took a small bite and could not stomach the rest. My friend tried more of it and described it as sort of creamy and rich. 

The pork belly BLT - a fried green tomato, house made jam with pimento cheese, pork belly and topped with frisée. This was my second favorite item! It all came together so well and the pork belly was like a thick cut piece of bacon, this is definitely worth ordering.

Watermelon and feta- my most favorite item. They grilled the feta cheese so it was still warm and the watermelon was cold. It was a perfect combination that sent my taste buds into a frenzy! Only 3 pieces came on a plate, so of course we ordered more.

Mango salad- the pecans were smoked, but I think candied pecans would have been better. The salad really missed here and flavors were very underwhelming. 

Deviled eggs: the presentation is the most impressive part! They look so neat with their tiny little layers leading up to the peak. Unfortunately, I thought they were dry and lacked flavor. They didn't seem fresh, it tasted like they had been in the fridge for some time.

All in all, I probably won't be back for the food, but if I am in the area, I might stop by for a drink and some music considering the atmosphere is delightful.",0,0,0

Im so glad I did. This was a great experience all around, from the hostess, to the server and the food. We basically stuck with Thanksgiving option, except with ordering the deviled eggs and a dessert that was on the regular menu.

Let's start with the deviled eggs. Perfect! Presentation was great. Flavor was phenomenal. I opted to have the ""trout roe"" (aka fish eggs) on the side as I was not sure how this was going to taste. And if you are kind of ""freaked out"" by fish eggs, dont be. The smokeyness adds an extra flavor. And our server brought out a side of what was comparable to a wing sauce to dip in. This as well added an extra flavor.

Our main course was the Thanksgiving special. This consisted of the ""Turkey Duo Plate"" with chicken fried turkey, smoked turkey leg, cauliflower mash, green beans, cranberry dressing and a cornbread muffin. This definitely did not disappoint. The fried turkey was great. Perfect amount of breading and the turkey was cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes along with the gravy were great. Could have been a tad bit creamier, but that's just me. The green beans were actually a tradition green bean casserole. And the cranberry dressing served as a base in which the mashed potatoes and one of the cutlets sat on. A great combination of foods.

And dessert was a pumpkin cheesecake. This was a little more than a typical cheesecake. It had a slice of what could have possibly been a piece of pumpkin cake. The cake portion could have been a little bit more moist, but the cheesecake portion was great. This also came with some pumpkin seed brittle. This could have been left off. It was a little nasty. But luckily I was able to move the pieces away.

I definitely want to come back to try what else is on their menu. Thanks for the great meal!",1,0,0

Boy were were surprised when the brisket biscuit sandwiches, watermelon salad and deviled eggs were all ridiculously fantastic!!

First off, that watermelon salad, it's really 3 triangles of watermelon with a dollop of grilled farmer's cheese on top with a lemon vinaigrette The vinaigrette had been grilled into the cheese and formed a crystallized texture on top of the cheese and it was amazing! I've never had anything like it.

Deviled eggs were perfect once I sent them back to take the god damned salmon roe off the top...what's with places shoving roe down our throats? I hate it! But, I loved these eggs! 

The biscuits weren't fluffy, but they had the perfect texture to hold the meat in. The brisket was a little fatty but it really was a great sandwich!

The set up makes you feel like you're sitting in someone's backyard at a BBQ...and they projected various images of Elvis, Johnny Cash and other folks whom I presume were southern-type musicians from the days of yore onto the white brick wall.

My friends and I were seated at the chef's table and it one of the best dining experiences I've had. The chef came out and recommended the best dishes to try and he even guaranteed to pay for our bill of we didn't like any of the recommended items. Recommended items were the BLT, short ribs, shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles. My favorite was the BLT it had a thick fried green tomato with house made bacon. The short ribs were delicous and fell right off the bone and I would definitely order those again. The chef even gave us complimentary cornbread and bone marrow. The cornbread was standard and the bone marrow was good and served with bread and jam. We also had complimentary desserts and my favorite was the red velvet cheesecake and I never really was a fan of red velvet til now. I am definitely going back and excited to explore the rest of the menu.",1,0,0

In my head, there was no way a strip restaurant could possibly turn southern food into a fine dining, high quality experience but I was dead wrong!!!
Our sever was Rebecca and she was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. Her recommendations were great and she did her best to help accommodate our 2.5 year old son with a few limes and a piece of bacon. 
We had the fried chicken with waffles and boy oh but there was a bunch of big pieces of chicken that was fried and flavored to near perfection! I could have used one more slab of waffles but I managed. We had the shrimp and grits also which initially came with a hair but was replaced quickly and apologetically. It was underwhelming but decent.

The cornbread was very good. Not as moist as I would've liked but still very good \/ it had bits of bacon, roasted corn, and jalapeños. Yum! 

We also had the deviled eggs - they are topped with little fish eggs for a pop of flavor! Definitely the most tasty deviled eggs I ever had. 

For our meals we had the fried chicken, which is prepared in a brine soaked for 18 hours and yes... you can tell. It was so juicy!! And the hot sauce that comes with the chicken is so good! 

I ordered the short ribs - they literally fall apart - one touch of your fork and pull it away - WOW. 

But... literally my FAVORITE part of the dinner was a side of the roasted carrots. No joke made the entire dinner what it was. A MUST HAVE!!!! 

For desert I had the bread pudding. Honestly it was just ok. I saw someone near my order the peach cobbler - that looked like a much better choice...

It's a bit expensive. It's basically the same price as Mon Ami Gabi but not quite on that level. We ended up going here 2-3 times despite staying several hotels over. The fried chicken is really good but if you're from the south it's just really good fried chicken, not life affirming. The desserts were very good, I got the bread pudding and it was well worth it.

what i ate:
- fried chicken and waffles and watermelon: yes yes yes soooo good. i loved the crispy fried chicken skin (although i have to say, the second time i went the skin was not as crispy as i would have liked), married with the sweet\/savory waffles and the oh so refreshing spiced watermelon chunks. i loved loved loved the relish??  that came on the waffles. spicy, vinegary, savory, perfect balance for everything else. all the flavors you would want are on this plate. i know it's meant for sharing, but i think i could finish it all on my own. but yea, sharing is caring, so split this with your table, be a good friend. 
- fried green tomato BLT: this was probably my favorite dish of the night. i wasnt expecting much, but seriously, it met all the flavors i would want in a dish - salty, sweet, hot, cold, savory, acidic, cheesy\/creamy, fried... it was so good. every bite was delicious. the second time i went i insisted on ordering this dish again, and my friends were wowed by it
- pork croquette: this was a stick to your ribs kind of dish. while the croquette itself was fairly small, the black eyed pea cassoulet underneath was dense, just as the croquette. i thought this dish was good, but it needed something vinegary or pickled to lighten up the flavors. unless you just want something hearty and rich, then this is the dish for you. 
- chilled watermelon: this was a refreshing side. but, rather unsurprising? especially if you ordered the fried chicken and waffles and watermelon. if you didnt get that dish, this would be a welcome addition to your table. the chilled watermelon was sweet and juicy, and the spices give it a nice zing. 
- maple glazed bacon donut: who doesnt love bacon? i love it, and put it on anything and i automatically like it. but, these donuts were rather dense cake style donuts. i wish they were the lighter type. after a bite i was done. too rich for me. 
- bbq pork belly: this dish, in my opinion, was the better dish to go for instead of the pork croquette. the pork belly was fatty, rich, perfectly glazed, and the pickled salad side was a great palette cleanser. 
- bloody mary: perfectly spiced. WITH BACON. what more can i say? drink your hangover away with these bad boys
- watermelon sling: so so so refreshing! on a hot summer day, you want to drink this. yes, that whiskey burned it's way back up your throat giving you that warm dragon breath effect, but the sweet refreshing watermelon made it easy to gulp down. 

pros:
- the food was so good. i loved the play between rich fried foods and vinegary sides. stick to your ribs kind of food. so, ladies, don't wear anything without stretch, your stomach needs it
- decor: wood, metal, so rustic, so chic. loved the old fashioned light bulbs. loved the huge chandelier
- service was friendly.
- called night of to make a rez on a friday night, and was able to get a table no problem
- drinks were legit with ice cubs cut to different sizes
- menu itself was really pleasing to the eye. i especially loved the way they did the bar menu. 
- corkage fee was $20. crazy cheap for on the strip. do it. though, admittedly the food on the menu deserves cold cocktails or beer. 

cons:
- service was slow...ish... when i'm in vegas i want to always have a cold dirnk in my hand. my server seemed to have missed that memo. there was a delay between my drinks. oh the horror. (i know, first world problems)
- while i enjoyed the style of the front room with it's low club chairs around small side tables, i woudlnt really want to eat anything in those seats. you end up having to hunch forward. i say if you want to eat, get a real table and ditch the bar area. cause, a bar is for drinking.

When we first arrived my mother ordered a bottle of wine. The waiter came back saying they were out of that particular bottle. So, my mom asked for a suggestion. He said he had not tried most of the wines so he didn't have a suggestion. If you are out of the wine we ordered then you should probably come back with a suggestion for something similar! 

When we ordered our dinner the waiter told us if we wanted the peach cobbler to order it early because it takes 25 minutes to make. So, we put in the order for the peach cobbler right after we ordered our meal. After the meal, my mom reminded the waiter we ordered the peach cobbler. The waiter acted like he didn't know what we were talking about. About 25 minutes after we ate the waiter came over and said the cobbler was coming right out. We waiting another 20 minutes (so a total of 45) then asked another waiter about it. Our waiter never came over to explain. A manager happened to be walking around. So, we told the manager what happened and we told him we just wanted the bill so we could leave. The manager said he would get us our bill and package our cobbler to go. About 5 minutes later the manager came out and said our ticket was lost and our cobbler wasn't ready. So he said he took the cobbler off our bill (duh!) and gave us his card. He told us to give him a call next time we were in town. So, instead of him compensating us right then and there, we have to come back for more horrible service to be compensated!? Our waiter finally came over with a $187 bill and a piss poor apology. The food was not worth the bad service.

The front of Yardbird features a very comfortable looking bar, dimly lit with communal tables and plenty of couches to relax and have a cocktail or five. When you come to eat, though, you're ushered into a quite large dining area in the back, just as comfortably decorated. We arrived at 12PM on a Saturday and were seated immediately for brunch. I have a feeling that won't be able to happen once more people learn about this place.

The menu at Yardbird is something between Tapas and Family-Style, offering large, inventive Southern dishes that can feed anywhere between 2-4 people. Our waitress suggested that we order a few and share, rather than get individual plates. So we did! We ordered the Fried Green Tomato ""BLT's"", the Pancakes, the Yardbird Benedict, and finished up with the Buttermilk Biscuits. 

The BLT's were an absolute hit. The tomatoes were perfectly fried, and the house-cured and smoked bacon melted in your mouth.

Short rib: comes with delicious delicious corn! Green beans are so good! Mashed potatoes are soft and fluffy! Short ribs are stringy and tender and flavorful. Light mild sweet BBQ taste 

Peach cobbler: this was my FAVORITE from the whole meal! FRESHLY BAKED so it was a bit of a wait but so delicious! Hot fresh lightly sweet peach baked with a crispy wafer aligned connecting it to the French vanilla ice cream scoop served in a sugar edible bowl! BOMB! 

Pros: 
-no wait during dinner prime time 
-good service! Manager came to check up on us 
-refills our water without asking
-makes conversation! Super friendly waitress and waiters! 

Cons: 
-we had a small flower vase at our table and our waitress took it away right at the beginning :(",4,2,4

It was easy to get seats for two. You may need reservations if you are in large groups. The seating was comfortable and cozy; there were several large groups around us who were having a good time.

We tried the old fashioned and the southern revival drinks; good. The old fashioned is delicious but strong, so you may want to sip slowly until the food arrives. 

The appetizer menu was good. They will put bacon \/ roe on side for vegetarians if requested. The deviled eggs were good but not special. The fried green blt was really delicious with pimento cream cheese. 

The chicken waffle watermelon plate was as advertised- moist and crispy. Served with a good hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup. We'd ordered sides of cauliflower and okra both were excellent and large portions. 

The best part of the meal was the peach cobbler. We ordered it at the start as they bake it from scratch. Best cobbler ever! I was full but could not help myself. Great presentation too.

They have a variety of items on their menu and their specialty was their fried chicken :) It was hard to decide on just one thing since everything sounded so delicious!!
We had a group of 4 and ended up ordering 3 appetizers to start: mac n cheese, fried green tomato BLT,  and house fries.  The Mac n cheese was decent, you can expect it to be pretty chunky with thick cheese compared to more of the creamier mac n cheeses.  The Fried Green tomato BLT appetizer is one of their most popular dishes! It is a fried green tomato topped with smoked pork belly and cheese :) The tastes were absolute perfect, and I've never tasted anything like it before! The fries were perfectly good as well, it came with a good side dip too.
For entrees, I had the Grilled chicken BLT while others at my table ordered the fried chicken. The grilled chicken BLT was unexpectedly tasty-it was grilled chicken, with pimento cheese, fried green tomatoes between two thick pieces of texas toast.  The texas toast gave it great flavor, the crust was crunchy while the inside was very buttery and soft :) The fried chicken plate was pretty good too, but the chicken itself was small.

The fried green tomato BLT was incredible! Crispy, crunchy, tart fried tomatoes topped with pimento cheese, large slices of pork belly and frisée. It was salty, creamy and pure bliss. We loved this dish.

The wings were some of the best we've ordered. Double fried and tossed with a perfect buffalo sauce. Served with pickled okra that added a little sour to the salty wings and paired perfectly. The wings were served with a homemade buttermilk ranch sauce and we wanted more of it because it was so good. 

The slow pulled chicken salad was a large portion, full of flavorful smoked chicken, corn, layered on top of a piece of fried cornbread and buttermilk ranch with frisée tossed in a vinaigrette. It was unique and tasty. Very filling and full of lots of wonderful flavors

The only issue we had was that the bartender wasn't attentive to us. I ordered our blt appetizer right when we initially sat down, as I knew that was one thing I wanted to order and it took over 25 minutes to come out, after our entrees. He didn't apologize or say anything it and I was pretty surprised by that. He seemed irritated in general, even with other customers so I didn't bother saying anything.

Deviled eggs - very nice texture on the white of the egg but the yoke filling was rather bland. The egg itself was of high quality that's for sure. 

Smoked brisket sandwich - flavorless. The meat was rather fatty and the bun was somewhat soggy by the time it arrived to the table. 

Crunchy Yardbird sandwich - arrived cold and rubber-like texture. I had to send this one back and the replacement at least came out hot but the quality of the chicken just wasn't there. Dark meat with a nearly flavorless breading overly deep fried. 

You should be seeing a pattern by now; flavorless food. 

Arnold Palmer to drink...supposedly this is the Arnold Palmer of champions, with lemon infused ice cubes. Well, it was a decent Arnold Palmer, if you like tons of sugar added (I don't), but the lemon infused ice cubes were nowhere to be found. 

Smoked chocolate coffee cake with coffee ice cream. Unfortunately this was the highlight of the meal, and I had no intention going in to have dessert. The coffee cake came out as a full loaf hot and fresh from the oven but only a very small scoop of ice cream to accompany it. 

Service was pretty good. Received a visit from two managers and the chef...no doubt because of the send-back of their signature sandwich. 

All in all...a big let down especially when you consider the price paid for substandard food. I dare say (if I actually were to consume fast food) that KFC or a chain BBQ place such as Lucille's offer better taste and value. This is yet another tourist trap.",9,8,6

Definitely more of a $$$ restaurant, not the $$ price tag that Yelp claims. Entrees average around $30, so that alone without apps, sides or drinks will put you in the $$$ range. 

That being said, the portions are pretty big for one person so unless you have a very large appetite, it's easy to share an entree and maybe an appetizer or side between 2 people. My group of 6 wasn't super hungry when we came so 3 of us split an entree and a side while the other 3 split an entree and 2 sides. 

The restaurant was busy! We dropped in on a weeknight around 8:30-9PM (though on a long weekend) and were told there would be a 40 min wait, but luckily a party with a reservation cancelled so we ended up getting seated earlier. I'd definitely recommend making a reservation in advance if you can. 

The inside is trendy and chic, with an open kitchen which we got to sit next to. Service is friendly and attentive. And food came out SUPER fast. I was expecting to wait 30 min. Our food was served in maybe 10-15 min, which seemed too fast, yet our food looked and tasted freshly prepared, so they must just have their kitchen really in order. 

I ended up sharing their famous Fine Fried Chicken and a side of Crispy Brussels with 2 other people, and thought this was a pretty good portion size. If we were hungrier, just another side or appetizer would probably have been enough.

* LEWELLYN'S FINE FRIED CHICKEN ($26) - 5\/5
[1\/2 bird w\/ honey hot sauce]
YUM. Came with 4 pieces of chicken - thigh, breast, wing and drumstick - so again, it was a pretty large portion of food. Easy to share between 2 people; a little awkward between 3 but you can cut the large thigh or breast into 2. The outside was deep fried to a perfect crisp without being too greasy or oily, while the inside was moist and juicy. The hot sauce was good but the better option was the bourbon maple syrup from the Chicken n' Watermelon n' Waffles that my other friends shared as their entree, or mixing the hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup. The maple syrup had just enough bourbon in it to make it interesting without being overpowering. So addicting! I'm sure the waiter wouldn't hesitate to bring you some if you asked. 

* CRISPY BRUSSELS ($10) - 5\/5
[spiced honey]
I love brussels sprouts but I'm usually hesitant to actually order them at restaurants because they tend to be overly greasy and not particularly crispy. Not these though! I loved all the crispy leaves and the touch of honey. Also good with the bourbon maple syrup ;)

Overall I was really impressed, especially since I'm not generally fond of the typically heavy, greasy Southern fare. Yardbird really elevates Southern food to another level.",3,2,3

The first event was a mixer with drinks, DJ QuestLove spinning tunes and some of their favorite dishes being passed around. There was even a red carpet and a photo booth. The second event on the following day was a pre fixe menu brunch.

The samples of food that I tried were a square of watermelon, fried chicken and biscuit sandwich with a spicy honey sauce, fried chicken piece on a waffle with maple syrup, fried green tomato with thick cut bacon on top plus greens and a vinaigrette drizzle and a few deviled eggs.

Brunch the next morning was a sampling of a fruit parfait with granola and yogurt, fried green tomato tapas with thick cut bacon and a generous amount of their chunky spicy chipotle sauce, eggs benedict with a bacon and biscuit crumble covered in eggs over easy and hollandaise sauce. Finally, a chocolate coffee cake was delivered for dessert.

The fruit parfait included a generous amount of fruit, granola and yogurt which were all tasty. The fried green tomato was nice and crispy. The bacon on top was good and so were the greens. However, the chunky chipotle sauce was overwhelming and not needed on an otherwise well executed dish. I found the eggs benedict to be spot on with that southern style coming through with the bacon and biscuit crumble. I would have liked more bacon, yum. I haven't had too many coffee cakes for dessert, but the plating looking very cool with chocolate sauce, sprig of mint and a well placed blackberry. The cake itself was marbled. It wasn't moist, but that could be how coffee cakes are? On a cake hardness scale between angel food to scone, the hardness of the coffee cake was closer to scone.

I'd go back again for brunch to see what new dishes that the chef creates. My favorite of the samples I tried on the first night was the fried chicken on waffle.",1,1,1

We were seated on a couch and armchairs which was comfortable but kind of awkward for eating. They serve everything family-style so everyone gets to share whatever the table orders. 

I went with three other people and we shared one appetizer, two sides and two entrees. To start we had the deviled eggs which were extremely flavorful with chives, cayenne and roe on top. Easily the best deviled eggs I have ever had!

After the appetizer, our first entree of chicken and waffles came it along with a side of green beans. The fried chicken was crispy and came as four different cuts of meat. They brine the chicken for 27 hours and it really makes a difference in the flavor. The cheddar waffle was thick and Belgian-sized. The green beans came in a yogurt sauce and were perfectly cooked, not too crispy or mushy. 

The roasted cauliflower came out next with Moonshine soaked raisins which was a really cool touch. 

Our final entree of shrimp and grits came out last and someone came from the kitchen to apologize for the delay because the cook messed up the order. We really didn't mind since we were busy eating all the other deliciousness and it was appreciated that they let us know about the delay. The service in the restaurant overall was impeccable. The grits were great and the shrimp was cooked to perfection.

The sandwiches are put together tall and can get messy. Just don't lose focus and don't be afraid to use a fork on the fallen bits and pieces. Plus, the bacon used is very thick cut, almost like a chunk of pork belly. Perfection. 

The watermelon is a great way to get some refreshment but with a different twist on flavors and seasoning.

Except for mom's, I've never had fried chicken this good before.  Perfectly breaded and fried.  The chicken meat is moist and bursting with flavor (even the white meat is good!)... just falls off the bone while you turn into a chicken hawk for a few minutes & devour what's in front of you.  

The meat & cheese board was excellent... could've been a couple better (more) cheese selections, but the ones served we're all very good.  Love the additions they add to theirs... mustards, jellies & a couple extra condiments.  Especially love the bread they serve it with.  Toasted, but not crunchy so it doesn't disintegrate into your lap after creating your own concoction.

The deviled eggs are spectacular, spiced watermelon is refreshing with a slight kick and the classic buttermilk biscuits are eat the crumbs off the table good (if you get the biscuits & cheese board, the biscuits are great to load up with meat & cheese too).

Many a chicky place do it sorta well, kinda well, or not well at all.  Residing in the Midwest doesn't really help the situation, as I well know that the home of incredible fried chix is hundreds of miles south and a little due east, but a boy can dream...

One family vacation last year, my sister hijacked a recipe from a James Beard alum that her husband experienced at aforementioned alum's restaurant on a business trip to Miami.  It was, without a doubt, the best fried poultry I've ever had.  

Fast forward 8 months, and we're in Vegas.  It comes to light that the poultry palace from Miami was Yardbird, and it has an outpost location in Sin City.  Reservation made.

We show up on time to a beautifully built-out and decorated restaurant space just outside the casino floor in Venetian.  Touches of the South abound and are intertwined with modern takes on decor.  Example: wood-paneled ceilings and a projector beaming cool images and phrases onto a wall.  A massive Edison light fixture (must be 400 bulbs up there!) outside an open, stainless-steel kitchen.

We lounged in comfy seats next to the hostess reception while they prepared our table, and then were shown to it.

The food menu is succinct and on-point and the drinks menu is deep and wide.  Food-to-drink page ratio is about 1:10.  You shall not go thirsty here.

Our sweet waitress charmed us into eating family style, which I am convinced is the way to go.    Four hungry boys had the Skillet Cornbread, Lewellyn's chicken, Chicken\/Watermelon\/Waffles, Virginia Ham biscuits, and the Smoked BBQ biscuits.  Between that and drinks, we couldn't fathom dessert.

Every last morsel of edible food on that table was devoured and tasty as ever.  And, it was confirmed at the scene of the crime: this is the best dang fried chicken I've ever had, and that's by a long shot.  It's extremely moist, nearly fall-off-the-bone tender, exploding with flavor, well-seasoned, and crispy without being dry and chewy.  Everything else is bland, dry, abused bird at best now.

Service was charming, prompt, attentive.  Ambiance was dimly lit and very loud (you caught that this was in VEGAS, right?), but I applaud them at doing what they could to make this a great space that takes you out of typical Vegas for an hour or two.
