Nothing really stood out for me, that it goes on the fav list. It's difficult for AYCE places to please everyone, for me it's the hamachi kama, uni, sweet amaebi and oysters. I know exactly which place serves them as AYCE items. Prices are comparable to every AYCE restaurants, sake by the bottle prices were actually inexpensive..",1,1,1

We saw online that they close at 3:00 am, which is usually the case for many sushi places in Vegas. We arrived at 2:15 am, and the sign on their door says that last call is at 2:30 am, so we still had time to order. We were seated and we ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and green tea ice cream. Two simple items that tasted fine. However, I was in the middle of my meal and at 2:45 am, the woman who seated us approached us and humbly said, ""Sorry, I don't mean to rush you, but can you hurry up so I can close the restaurant?"" I thought we had had 15 minutes left, but I guess the entire staff wanted to go home, so they decided to rush us so they could close early. I wasn't even finished eating! We saw another table leave very shortly after that, and we were the only two left, with the rest of the staff just standing there watching us, waiting for us to leave. It wasn't even 3:00 am yet, but we left at 5 'til. I guess they actually close at 2:30 am instead. I took the rest of my food to-go, and we left. Don't visit this place if you're looking for common courtesy.",2,1,0

I'm really not the kinda person that complains about service cuz I'm usually content with whatever but this place really pissed me off. Came here with another couple, I ordered at least 10 things when we first sat down. It was almost an hour until we got 2 measly pieces of nigiri while the other couple's orders kept coming in. Half of our order didn't show up so I had to re-order twice for everything. And when the order did show up it was only 2-4 pieces (to share between the two of us!!) at a time so I never really felt satisfied. One of the servers did check in on us after we complained about our order not showing up and I do understand that they were busy.. But it took us THREE hours to get everything we ordered and between the two of us we ate maybe 15-20 orders of nigiri. That should not have took three hours!!! I also ordered a bigger bottle of sake to enjoy DURING my meal, but it took so long for the food to ever come out that we only finished half the bottle. For the perfect cherry on top this wonderful evening as I walked out the door the server said we couldn't take the bottle home. I've never yelled at somebody like that before but oh man on top of all the great service tonight something really cracked in me. NEVER EVER coming back here again!",0,0,0

Took a taxi here since it was off the Strip, about 5-10 mins. 
Went on Mother's Day weekend and there was an hour long wait, not surprised.  The place is small and could be bigger but it is a really nice comfy intimate restaurant.
Sushi was really good, I personally recommend J.J, Pete's, Tiger Eye and the green tea ice cream!  Lunch was around $22 bucks, not too bad for all you can eat.
Will definitely come back during my next Vegas trip.",1,1,1

You can probably already guess that I love this place. Vegas has a sea of sushi spots, so I imagine it's hard to stand out and really impress. Somehow, Goyemon manages to do so. It's hard to explain, but I think it's just the intangibles that put Goyemon in a special place in my sushi-loving heart.

OK so the truth is that I've only been here twice. But both times were with a large group of fantastic friends. So maybe that has something to do with it. Both times were in the private room off to the side and we had reservations, so I've never had to wait for a table. And most importantly, both times, the sushi was top notch.

My favorite memory of this place was when my cousin and I decided to order every single nigiri item on their AYCE menu. Yep. We simply told the server, ""1 through 27."" Doesn't get any easier than that! They brought out our nigiri in batches of 9 pairs. It was like nigiri heaven. Probably the only negative I can even think of is that they don't have tobiko. I need my tobiko with quail egg! Oh well. Masago with quail egg works too.

Goyemon also has a good selection of non-sushi items. Did someone say pork belly? Don't mind if I do. And their dessert. Maybe I should have started the review with dessert. Hands down, Goyemon has the best selection of any AYCE in town--lychee sorbet, plum wine jelly, tempura ice cream, and much more. And you can have as much as you want! That's certifiably insane.",4,2,8

Cons: 1 hour long wait on a Tuesday at 6pm. This isn't exactly ""prime time"" and the wait for just two (2!!) people was insane. When we were sat, we were crammed so close to our neighbors we might as well have been eating together. Took a while for server to get our drink order, took a while to get drinks and refills. Service was lackluster, no personality, no smiles. Location isn't great or easy to get to. Lot's of douchey smokers out front right outside the entrance.

This place has great food, but they need to expand to a bigger location if they're so busy. There are plenty of sushi places that have great food and don't make me wait all night just to sit right next to strangers. I probably won't go back to Goyemon despite the good food which did come out very fast after ordering. I'd suggest you try this place for lunch.",0,0,0

+ I seriously left dreaming about this place and couldn't wait to return

- Long wait (but it was totally worth it)
- No sashimi

Friday night was really busy, but if you want service you just smile at the waiter and lift your eyebrows. Be patient. The service was great. You'll see some familiar faces from Sushimon. The tables are really close so I wouldn't bring someone to tell them something personal or important or whatever.

We've all been to a billion sushi restaurants. This one is really good. At the same time so are a lot of other places. I guess what I'm trying to say is come here because it's another great place to get sushi.

Pork Belly- Thick chunks of pork with delicious fat still on it grilled until there's a pleasant char then they are covered in a sauce very familiar to me. This dish reminded me of childhood bbq's. So of course I loved it and been thinking fondly of it. Try it.

Spicy Tuna Rice Cracker- Drenched in yum and eel sauce, looks like too much, but it wasn't. Still able to taste the sticky, crunchy rice. Everyone loves spicy tuna. It was real yummy and I haven't seen it on another menu. Try it.

Yellowtail collar- Comes with a standard sauce. I love collar. It's a pleasure to pick out the variety of textures of meat in it. Like meaty parts away from the bone are drier and flaky. Then there's the darker moist parts you scrape off the bone, so good. I cleaned the bones. I love most grilled fish though so take my view as you will.

I always order mackerel sashimi. On this night it was generous pieces that were nice and oily. I love mackerel so much. I was happy with it here.

We also ordered a couple rolls, but they were standard. I can't even remember which ones they were. I remember they were good though.",2,0,1

Fish quality: was above par but nothing to be wowing over.

Service: was great and our server Phil was very knowledgeable of their menu items, chef's skills and experiences.

Sushi: were inconsistent and sloppy, ratio between rice to fish was outrageous.
They ran out of Uni on early Friday night.

Rolls: were pretty good due to sauces but sauces and amount of rice were overpowering the main ingredients.

They do count the hours down, try not to go over hour limit.

Overall, ehh.... I will not come here again. There are number of better sushi places in Vegas. Do your reseach and you will find a better AYCE for your money.",1,0,1

Service was pretty fast, very nice, and the interior was pretty average for a sushi house. We got the crispy rice, ecstasy, and pastel roll. ALL WERE AMAZING. They also do half rolls which in my opinion is the best thing since sliced fish. We got the pork belly which is a must try unless you're on a strict diet. It's super fatty, melt in your mouth, all around amazing piece of marinated pork. They're known For it, so try it! Their nigiri is fresh. Fish to rice portion on point. Get the toro and the uni!

After reading countless reviews I was expecting spectacular service and even better sushi\/fish quality. I would have to say the best AYCE sushi in vegas was very underwhelming. The whole thing was so so but let me explain. 
Went here on MLK weekend on a Monday around 2pm. Wait was minimal which was unexpected due to the holiday weekend. We waited around 5 min. We sat at the bar which was great because come to find out for 21.95$ lunch there is 45min TIMED PERIOD for your lunch. Yes they time you from the time you sit down. Other things I wish I knew before sitting down
1) 45min timed period for lunch and 60min for dinner
2) Any leftover rice or sushi is charged by the a la carte price
3) ORDER 1\/2 rolls! yes you can rolls in 1\/2 vs full 8 pieces
4) Sitting at the bar was great b\/c of the 45min timed period for AYCE

To tell you the truth the quality of the sushi was ok. We had sake, ikura, tamago, scallop Nigri. An organsm roll, a crispy deep fried roll, a ultimate salmon roll and a couple other rolls. Nothing really stood out. All the rolls had too much rice in them. We also had Garlic edamame and the poke bowl. Both come highly UNRECOMMENDED because the garlic edamame was cooked and burned and super oily. Also the poke bowl was such a disappointment. The quality of the tuna in there was the quality of was i can only equate to Cardboad mushed into a cube and dyed pink. It was tasteless and you can def tell that it was previously frozen. 
I really though I was going enjoy this place b\/c of the reviews but the time limit and the quality made it highly unenjoyable. 
Probably will not be returning bc I felt forced to stuff as much sushi in my mouth as humanly possible in 45min.",5,3,1

The fact that you can order half rolls instead of full rolls as a part of the AYCE earns them four stars right off the bat.  It makes it so worth the money because you're able to try so many of the rolls...which is awesome because their rolls are so creative!  There are 28 special rolls, none of which are ""filler rolls"" like shrimp tempura and cream cheese - they're legit rolls with great combinations of fish.  (They do also have shrimp tempura rolls, baked rolls, etc.  There's also nigiri, appetizers, and dessert, for the record.)

On a Thursday evening, we waited about 15-20 minutes for a spot at the sushi bar - the service was super fast and the sushi chefs were nice.  They even have a stamp card - after 10 visits, your eleventh is free!

Although there still many items as part of the AYCE menu, items such as the kama are no longer available. The grill items and specials that were available seemed hastily thrown together because the cook was too busy chatting to other co-workers.

That brings me to the biggest change: the service! Service was terrible, especially at the sushi bar. I would order amaebi and get ebi instead. Ordering ikura resulted in masago. The sushi chefs seemed more interested in telling jokes to each other than getting orders correct. Worst of all was the waitstaff. If you sit at the sushi bar, the waitstaff doesn't seem to give a $h!t about you, instead focusing their attention on the tables. After the waitress responsible for my section left for break, I was basically on my own. Waiters and waitresses would walk by, make eye contact, and keep moving.

Shrimp tempura- nice and light, it's hard to get this wrong. 

yellowtail with jalapeños- the sauce it sits in sets it off!!!

Spider roll- it will be an unattractive challenge to try and fit the whole thing in your mouth but it's worth it!

Tiger roll- delicious. 

Green mussels- although my date was hesitant in trying due to the name... But he did anyway and ate most of the order. Says it all

Cucumber salad- definitely his portion that I tried. It's ok... Probably would be great if I liked cucumbers. Lol

AYCE limitations: No sharing (as always), and 1 hour limit- the heck?!

This was our first visit but I follow a few people on YouTube that have been to this place so I've heard good things about it. The restaurant sits at the of a very quiet strip mall, well at least at 9:00pm it was quiet. Hostess was pleasant and sat us, but when we told her that we were all probably going to do AYCE, she only gives us 2 AYCE menus so we request for more. She never came back w\/ them so we asked our server. He never came back w\/ them. So we asked the busser, finally! Someone understands that 7 people shouldn't be sharing 2 freaking menus!

Our waiter took his time taking our drink orders and even more time getting them to us. Even longer to take our orders which is a bit frustrating considering that they place an hour restriction on their AYCE! Needless to say-- their service sucked.

On to the eats-- mediocre at best. I'm sorry but if you can't get garlic tuna right-- WTF is wrong with you?! It's my fav and has got to be the easiest f-ing thing to make. First off I didn't taste any garlic, it was more of a ""lemon"" tuna. And then I ordered a cut roll, it was more rice than sushi. 

Goyemon, I understand you're a small establishment and you want a good turnover on the tables, but if your servers suck, take their time with orders and stand around talking to other staff members for the majority of their shift (as they did the night we came in) then lift the hr limit bc your price point for what we rec'd was quite upsetting.

食べたのは22ドルくらいのお昼の食べ放題。
確かにラスベガスで食べた他の寿司と比べると、大体これくらいか、他はもっと良くない場合もあります。でも、自分としては値段はラスベガス価格と言うことで考慮しないにしてももう少し味を頑張って欲しい。
ネタの鮮度はなかなか良かったと思います。今は鮮度を保って輸送する方法も確立されているでしょうからベガスという地理条件も数十年前のようには不利な点にならないのかもしれません。十分満足出来るレベルのネタを提供してくれています。
それより、まず残念なのがわさび。日本のように香りに優れ、少量で十分な辛さのあるものでなく、まるで抹茶シャーベットのようにたっぷりと皿に盛られています。しかし、これも仕方ないと諦めるにしても、最大の問題はしゃりにあります。水の分量が違うのかぱさぱさで、酢も使っていません。その点でどうしても寿司と呼べる物になりきれていない感じがあります。

旅先でどうしても寿司が食べたくなってしまったら来ても良いと思いますが、数日我慢すれば日本で食べられるというのであれば帰国まで我慢するのも手だと思います。

My husband I have been going here for a little over a year now, and have learned a couple of things after a few (we'll leave it at a few) visits.  First thing, come early or be ready to wait.  We usually come on the weekends and if you come during peak hours you could be waiting up to an hour sometimes (still worth the wait BTW).  Second, always do AYCE even if you think you're not that hungry.  The a la carte prices can get pricey and you're probably going to end up at the cost of the AYCE anyways.  Plus, be adventurous.  We love the AYCE here partly because you can try something without fear of not liking it.  Sushi house goyemon offers a loyalty card where you buy 10 AYCE and get the 11th free, so plenty of reason to come back.

The sushi at Goyemon is fresh and they are very generous.  I mostly stick with the Nigiri and the rolls which you can't go wrong with.  I'd also recommend trying the sashimi salad, rice cracker, and pork belly (mmmm pork belly!).  The desserts are a perfect ending to the meal, especially the mochi and the green tea creme brulee.

The service is just OK (thus 4 stars instead of 5).  I understand that they are busy on the weekends, but I usually find myself practically having to wave my hands in the air to get attention from our server.  A little more attention would have been much appreciated.

It's expensive, like all other sushi restaurants, and I'm skeptical of the quality of their fish for that price like I am with all other sushi restaurants, but given that it tastes so good I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. 

The only real problem I have is that given the price of the all-you-can-eat, I feel like I have to eat at least 3 rolls to break even so I always leave there feeling like I've eaten way more than I should!

It was a monday night and although almost every table was occupied, it was considered a slow night according to our server. My husband and I were immediately taken to seats at the bar where the real treat begin. Chef Hieu explained the menu to us and gave us his best recommendations. The food selection was amazing and there was a great variety of nigiri. We thoroughly enjoyed everything he served up. The quality of their fish was fresh and we topped it off with some bomb mochi dessert and sake. You can't beat their reasonable all-you-can-eat price either.

The usual assortment of Nigiri and Rolls but also a few unique items. They have deep fried rolls and seared salmon. Very tasty. Try the Pork belly or the Cajun Salmon, Cajun spice and Chili sauce that is sweet and wonderful.

The staff is very friendly, and will make you feel at home.

It is so good that you should be prepared to wait for a table. But then again, if no one is in a place, that speaks volumes.

1.  Parking - Very easy, not so crowded strip mall off Decatur between Hacienda and Trop on the west side.

2.  Ambiance - Very nice, good sushi that seem to easily seat about 15 or so.  About 9-11 tables, I really did not count.  Party room that is real comfy for about 12 people, yeah, the same 12 that can fit all in one elevator. If you are not one of them, be careful and suck it in!  I like the place and ambiance.

3.  Reservations - Only for large parties. If you go during dinner, you will probably wait. We went on a Wednesday at 7:30 for a party of 6 and it was about a 50 minute wait.

4.  Service - Pretty darn good, attitude a 5+ and knowledge was same.  If they would explain why some peeps that seemed to just show up and get seated right away , then it would go from pretty darn good to freakin amazing!

5.  Food - I am a traditionalist, so they had my favorites that were tasty like Ikura, Uni, Amai-ebi, fried ebi heads, Ikura,  They had all the wild complex rolls that many like to order now and while I don't recall all the names, they were all so very good.  They even made one that my fellow muncher specified and it turned out really great!

The people here are great, the food great, the ambiance great. You cannot go wrong.  This place is also the same as Sushi-mon owners, so be sure to have your dining card or keep the receipts for that free meal.....

Go for it!  Arigato.",3,1,2

None of us had ever been here. 

We just missed the lunch rush so the restaurant was not as busy. We ended up getting seats at the sushi bar and ordered AYCE. Good selection of different rolls and many of them could be ordered as half-rolls. They also had sides such as tempura veggies, pot stickers and small servings of poke. I tried the poke and the pot stickers. I tried a couple of their baked rolls and I usually order whatever unagi dishes sushi places have. All the rolls I had were good as well as the tempura and pot stickers. The staff was friendly and service was good.

The restaurant was maybe 3\/4ths full, so I was expecting faster service than the times I have been here when it was jam-packed full with a line out the door. Continuing, I looked over the menu (it has been redesigned), and I saw that the same favorites were in place: Braised pork belly, super white tuna, and cajun albacore. I started off the night with an order each of amaebi and uni for me and my boyfriend, and we also ordered two half rolls to start. The both of us chatted as we awaited our food, and the natto roll, amaebi, and the uni came out. I was pleased with the sweetness of amaebi and the freshness of the uni. ""So, I take it that the Calico roll is still on its way?"" After an affirmative, we placed a few more nigiri orders. For your reference, the Calico roll is not a deep fried roll: Just a few slices of fish in the middle and slices on top. Not a very time-intensive roll at all, so we were sure it will show up soon.

By the time we finished with our sushi, we continued to wait for the rest of our orders.  About ten to fifteen minutes pass, and it seems that the sushi still has not shown up, so we decided to order some braised pork belly and miso soup. That order came fast (within maybe five minutes), and we were glad to note that the portions were larger. However, one bite in, and the insides of the belly were frozen. Maybe there are some people that like their fatty meats cold, but I personally prefer it to be warm and melty. We brought this up, and after an apology they took this to the back. As a customer, you can see the sushi chefs working on their sushi, and you can see the grillmaster who does the grilled entrees and desserts. The waiter (we later learn he's the manager) and the grillmaster exchanged a few words, kept sneaking glares towards our table, and rather than getting right to cooking it, they stood there and chatted for a better part of a couple minutes. It didn't look like they wanted to fix the problem.

As this is going on, my boyfriend mentions that service seems to be slower than usual, and I cannot help but agree. I did point out to him, though, that if he would just sit at the sushi bar for once, we can get fish faster in general. Five minutes later, new pork belly arrived to the table. Blackened and charred on both sides. Well, this time they definitely made sure that it was warm on the inside. We scraped off the black charcoal and ate the belly. 

We inquire about the status of the rest of our order. Our waitress replied, ""Oh, you haven't received it yet?"" ""No, we have not received it yet."" She apologizes, we say it is fine, and we place a few more orders for their specials for the night, namely salmon pork belly nigiri. The rest of the orders filter in, including the salmon pork belly, but we had to reorder the orgasm sauce, the miso soup, and a few other nigiri because they lost the order. I contemplated over the service as I was savoring the fatty salmon belly. The rest of the orders showed around fifty minutes after we sat down.

My significant other declares that he's done, so I decide to follow suit. I note that in the course of the extended delays and mistakes, our table time has already reached the hour. They lost our orders for desserts, and I couldn't seem to reach anyone for a response. I note that the moment I place down my credit card, someone zips by quickly to pick it up. I asked for a comment card, but not having one, I wanted to speak to a manager about our experience.

She went to go see the manager, and I recognized him for helping out on the floor. He turns his back to chat with someone else for a while saw him shake his head, and decides to head over with our missing dessert orders. I thank him for bringing the dessert, though I brought up my main points, namely how service is slower than usual, and how our orders were messed up. He says a brisk ""My apologies"", and then he explains someone was out for the day and servers switched. I understood the first part. Yet, it was the same person who took our order from start to finish, so I asked if he was sure that was the reason why. To this, he retorts,  ""You see the people waiting outside at the door? Yeah, you can't expect everyone in here just to serve you.""

Serious misunderstanding on his part, and he left me to fume silently. I do not like to go to places where I don't feel welcome, and while I won't judge a place based on the behavior of one worker, I will judge it based on the behavior of a manager. A place that can't take fair input graciously will only deteriorate over time.

I hope that when I return two years from now the management has changed. There ARE better AYCE in town, for cheaper, just as fresh, and faster. I'll be writing reviews for them as well.",2,2,1

We used Google Maps which took us to the townhouses right after the restaurant. If you drive there, slow down and look for the sign for the restaurant! 

We got there at 4pm which is a great time - before the crowd gets there. The contemporary, clean, beautiful interior matched the beautiful, organized plates of sushi. I'm not sure about the service. It seemed like aunty kept asking about her order of Hamachi and our server kept replying that he would ""check on it"". Eventually, it did arrive. 

The amount of rice was the big surprise... I thought it would be a lot so that we would fill up faster. This was not the case. The fish-to-rice ratio was perfect! Also, I didn't taste any added wasabi - just add your own!  The ikura, saba, scallops (with a hint of lime), maguro, uni, unagi, & amaebi were superb!

Most of the pieces are smaller than what you'd receive in a traditional sushi place, but this is good for a number of reasons. a) it helps you be able to try more items on the menu without filling up too quickly, b) you can always order more, c) they do HALF orders!!  

It is required that you eat ""everything"".. no pile of left overs, as they put it.... so go easy at first. If they catch you leaving too much, you'll be paying a la carte. however, there was a roll my husband ordered that he didn't care for, and they gladly took it back!  Super nice, and super yummy. 

Also, not sure what other yelpers are talking about with ""lack of fresh fish"".... everything was really fresh!  Try the lemon roll! super yummy!!",0,0,1

It was overall a much better experience and actually restored some faith I have in Vegas AYCE\/buffet meals.

The atomsphere was very inviting and the service was friendly. It was only slightly after 6 but the restaurant was already at capacity. Our server was busy but service was still attentive. We had no trouble placing orders after orders and food came out really quickly. 

The sushi was good. Not the top tier out there but above average. Nigiri are authentic and perfectly sized to fit in one bite. Some of the presentation appeared rushed but still excusable. For AYCE standard I think I could consider that stellar quality. The fish quality is decent and the selection is good. Don't forget to ask your server about their daily specials. They had Japanese snapper and white clam that night and those were nice. Amaebi, hamachi, albacore and super white tuna were all quite memorable. The ikura, uni and hotate, however, were just average. The uni, even though it is limited 1 order per person, was not nearly as good as those I had at Hikari. Nothing really stood out among the appetizers and fusion rolls. The pork belly was just alright. Not good enough for a second order. Offering homemade desserts was definitely a huge plus. Love their chocolate mousse cake.

If you like AYCE and you love sushi, bookmark Goyemon for your next Vegas trip.",4,2,2

I chose to sit at the bar (which I highly recommend from now on). I chose to do the AYCE and was flabbergasted by the large selection of nigiri, rolls and special rolls they had. You can add appetizers and desserts to the AYCE as well. Sushi Chef Fredo saw that I was completely clueless about what to order so I basically turned the keys over to him. He basically ordered for me, and I have to say that this is the only way to eat sushi from now on. It was an awesome experience. I also appreciated the way Fredo made the nigiri sushi...he didn't overpower the fish with a ton of rice underneath.

Highlights:

Pork Belly - At first, i thought the soy sauce marinade was gonna overpower the pork belly and make it really salty, but when i ate, it was incredibly delicate and tender. It is similar to chashu. In addition, the pork belly comes with a side of mango salsa to top off the meat. 5\/5

Blue Fin Tuna, Toro, and Super White Tuna Nigiri - These were my top dishes for the night. The blue fin tuna was incredibly soft and tender, which makes it just melt in your mouth. It was freakin decadent. I was told that the toro is the belly of the tuna, which makes sense because it tasted fatty and tender...just the way i like it. And the super white tuna (which i've heard is escolar...not tuna) was also really good. It tasted like butterfish. 5\/5

Hurricane Roll - the best of the special rolls IMO. It had shrimp tempura and an assortment of other stuff. I think it had rho as well. And it must have been topped with some eel sauce and this other creamy white sauce. I ordered so much, I don't remember what was in it. But i do remember that it tasted balanced and flavorful, and was simply the perfect bite. 5\/5

Frying Jason - This is basically a BSCR but the filling had crab sticks and cream cheese. Pretty bomb. 4\/5

Grilled Yellowtail Collar - this was also the bomb. you can taste the smokiness from the grill and the fish was light. it felt like you were eating outside your bbq. 4\/5

I also ordered: 

baked mussels (fantastic)

dynamite (basically the topping of a BSCR in a shell)

orgasmic salad (seared ahi tuna in some greens and lime juice. a bit sour)

jala jala roll (your basic roll with spicy tuna in the filling topped with albacore, salmon, tuna, and a slice of chili pepper....pretty good)

scallop nigiri (it was good, but he put a bit too much lime juice on it)

supreme salmon roll (probably my least favorite. it was a salmon roll topped with salmon. a little overkill)

Finally after all this indulgence, i finished off my meal with some green tea ice cream. delicious. 

p.s. all the dishes i ordered can be ordered in half orders.",2,1,1

I noticed several reviews that stated they also got food poisoning right around that time so I decided I needed to write this review.  I did go in there and tell them about it.  I was told not to come back if I was concerned about the food (needless to say, I have not been back since).  They did not apologize and they apparently knew there was a problem because several other people (based on these reviews) had already alerted them that they had also gotten very sick.  I ended up at Spring Valley Hospital with a $1500 bill (thank goodness I have insurance...my co-pay was $150).  I learned at the hospital that when you get sick 36 hours later it is viral and the virus is caused by dirt rather than bad food.  For this reason, I cannot go back there.

Last time I was there, it took them 25 minutes for our 4 rolls - 2 of them were salmon hand rolls- very simple. And the place wasn't even busy yet. Luckily we ordered edamame and seaweed salad so we were ok for 25 minutes. But then- we wanted another round of those four rolls and it took over 40 minutes!! We kept asking what is going and they said there is a party of 10 people and the sushi chefs are working on their order. WE WERE THERE FIRST! And only ordered 4 rolls. We got angry and when we wanted the manager they sent us the guy who clears tables Who told us we will pay All you can eat as we started. Even thou we were really hungry still! I told him it is really unfair because we were sitting there for an hour and a half with only four rolls!

The last few times haven't been as good as before. I think they are suffering from growing pains and staff changes. I do not see my favorite sushi guys and I know one in particular does not work here anymore. While the food is still made right and the cuts were decent, it lost that personal, familiar charm and the new guys didn't make an effort to really talk. It was busy, so fair point that they may not have had the opportunity so maybe something will change again, with time.

The big thing for us was the rice has been too warm on visits of late. Last time it was affecting the fish that it was not appetizing. While I get they are busy, they should have someone making and properly cooling rice throughout. It happened twice at a busy but not line out the door rush time. The second time severely changed out love for this place. 

We will probably come during a off time again and see what happens. I still thought the fish was fresh, I like the rotating specials and the many delicious dessert options.

I was turned on to this place by one of my training partners. The rolls are all pretty good and my favorite is probably the super white tuna nigiri (pictured below) I could eat that all day. 

The only down side I can give it is the size of the restaurant. It is small and more than once I have had 45 mintue wait times. I've never actually waited 45 mins though, maybe closer to about 25-30 minutes and they get you in.  I usually attend with a party of 3-4 people.

The Tako Nigiri which is my favorite nigiri was STACKED with rice and had very thin slices of Tako on it. The masago with quail egg was sloppily put together and a mess. 
The 9-1-1 was INCREDIBLY spicy so if you order that prepare yourself for the spiciest roll I've ever had.

The garlic edamame had little to no flavor just covered in grease.

It seems to be part of the Las Vegas landscape.  I guess it is buffet mentality, most bang for the buck.  You would not think eating sushi in NY, LA or Tokyo would be a world of difference but it is.  

I would say that in my opinion of all the AYCE sushi Vegas, Goyemon is the best I've seen.  I was more impressed when they first opened.  They have since increased their hours and business ten fold.  Quality is hit or miss.  Probably would not recommend Sundays, that's when anything raw becomes questionable.  One of the key differences is the variety of product and the fact that they do use fresh tuna.  Everyone else is still stuck on frozen blocks.  Which btw is pretty disgusting.  I think I mentioned this before, but anything bright unnaturally pink or red is frozen.  Maybe you don't care what you eat.  A friend of mine recently said ""you paid $70 for sushi?  You got ripped off,  I usually only pay $25 for AYCE"".  Patted her on the head smiled and said yes you get what you pay for.  

Imagine this, of all the fresh tuna sold on the world markets, some doesn't get sold.  Just like the last bunch of produce sitting there in the grocery store.  Some of this tuna can become 3 weeks old.  It is poorly handled then poorly stored.  After this some company in Vietnam or Korea buys 10,000 pounds of this old tuna that nobody else wants for a rock bottom deal.  This tuna is already starting to rot and turn grayish brown on the outside.   But thanks to modern technology, these overseas companies invest in machine and equipment that will treat the fish with coloring and preservative.  All of a sudden it's red again, not really natural red, but good enough.  Then it is frozen, packed and shipped to the US.  Funny enough, these countries ban the sale and use at home, but the North American client is big business.  That is the tuna you eat in most AYCE sushi bars.  Enjoy!

Back to Goyemon who also owns Sushi Mon.  But for some reason the quality is different.   Don't order ala carte, they don't want that either, that's why the same shit is still served.  Technique on sushi pretty good.  

Tuna  - usually really good.  last time they were using a cut of the tuna that most people would scrape or discard.  could tell by the weird taste and texture.  1 star.  

Hamachi - always decent, but all hamachi unless wild comes the same farm raised fresh, frozen, treated with preservatives or all natural

Salmon - decent as well, though not a big fan of Atlantic salmon.  the only really healthy salmon is possibly Scottish or wild.  Seared salmon is good and gives a nice textural contrast. 
http:\/\/www.albany.edu\/ihe\/salmonstudy\/pressrelease.html

Hirame - always good

Pork Belly App - nice to see something different, tasty but the mango salsa needs some work

Katsuo - decent, but they use frozen

Amaebi - actually not bad; only one per person

Uni - only one order per person.  seemed like a lower grade or frozen?  never had this before, taste is ok, but there is a weird uniform color and texture

Unagi - same always good

Sushi rice - usually good, though the last time was kinda dry and seemed old like it was sitting around all day

Tempura - yuck don't get this, might be better in a roll or something

Tamago -  good, thanks for making it and not buying frozen

Super White Toro - bleah

Red Snapper - actually frozen tilapia

Gyoza - same pre-packaged frozen crap

Green Mussels - yes frozen NZ Green Lip Mussels, super cheap and baked with eel sauce and mayonnaise

Rolls - all good, lots of rice, you will be full after about 4 of these then so much for AYCE

This was my first visit to Sushi House Goyemon.  Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with the taste & quality of the sushi.  Ordered the  Alaskan roll, Dragon roll, seared salmon nigiri, volcano, amaebi, uni, and for dessert- green tea creme brûlée.  The Alaskan roll was a disappointment. I was hoping it would be similar to another sushi place (one that has a red mask in it's name), but it was lacking all around.  The sauce on the dragon roll was a bit overwhelming for me.  I tried the uni for the very first time & the only positive thing I can say about it is "" thank goodness it was a small serving"".  I'm glad I tried it, however, I will never try it again.

I never had to wait too long for them to clear out dirty plates or a refill on my drinks. Sushi here is deliciously. Nothing too fancy, but still enjoyable for the price.

At first, the impression was bad: The wait took FOREVER. But we took it as a sign that it must be popular and, given its small size, it sort of made sense. The 45-min wait was also exacerbated by the fact that we were all starving. But we decided to stay and wait it out, and boy am I glad we did!

The AYCE offered so many choices, we were overwhelmed with the options, especially since our stomachs were eating themselves at the time. We decided to take it slow and order some rolls and nigiri first. Some of my friends got miso soup, and I got some gyoza. After the first orders came out fairly quickly, the deliciousness of the meal overtook us and we decided to go all out. We ordered enough to feed a family of 20. 

Some notable dishes were the white tuna, cajun albacore, and seared salmon. I also love unagi\/eel and this place did not disappoint. I think one of the best things about goyemon is that you can order HALF ORDERS. What!? Don't want a full 8-piece roll? Get a half-order! No more leftover sushi to shove down at the end. I'm not sure if other sushi places did this, but when the waitress offered it to us, I knew Goyemon cared about efficiency and possibly its customers' waistline. 

The service was great. Although busy, the waitress was always around, and our waters were always refilled. We did not have to wait 40 min per order like some other sushi places. All in all, a great experience at AYCE sushi, and I can honestly say that I haven't had too many good AYCE experiences.

This is another of their brainchild. This place is an All-you-can-eat Japanese buffet restaurant. You can however, order off the menu ala-carte, but I've never seen anybody actually do that. 

First off, understand that this place DOES NOT take reservations, it is strictly a first come first serve basis.
Secondly, understand that they have very limited seating. At most 50-70 people would be a overestimate from what i could observe. 
Thirdly, understand that all your sushi and dishes are prepared on the spot for you. Basically you place your order with the waitress and the sushi chef will prepare your sushi on the spot for you. It is a small kitchen and fourthly, understand that your food might take a while to arrive at your table. 

The food here, however, is one of the best value for money sushi restaurants in town. 
Each individual sushi is probably half the size of what you would normally see outside, so take note, although the size of the sushi does not determine its quality. Every single sushi is prepared for the freshness, from the ingredients to the sushi rice, everything is of a high quality. The quality of the sushi here definitely beats those found in the international buffets at Caesars Palace or the Wynn. 

The choice of raw fish is extensive, they have all the common sushi you can find at most sushi joints in the states, from salmon, tuna, albacore, white tuna, octopus, scallops, sweet shrimps and even Uni(sea urchin). The number of special rolls is off the charts. So many different types to choose from. Even the desserts like the tempura ice cream can be found here. 
Why spend 50 dollars a person at a regular sushi joint if you are a hardcore sushi lover when you can spend half of that eating to your hearts content at this place?

Before coming here I have to confess to you, I didn't like the texture of raw fish or even the thought of eating something raw. O_O

Last January, I attended CES 2012 in Vegas. My friend and I hadn't eaten all day and we decided to head off The Strip for a late, late 3pm lunch. My friend is a crazy sashimi\/uni\/durian lover and wanted sushi. I remember my co-worker had mentioned about how much she had loved this place. I was a bit skeptical at first. Sushi in Vegas? Really? Sounds fishy to me!

AYCE lunch buffet for under $25? What a steal! The whole time we were there my friend and I only ordered nigiri! haha We really wanted to make sure we got our money's worth! It was to the point our server said, ""You know, we offer other items like specialty rolls and side dishes!"" :P After each bite of nigiri, my appreciation for raw fish greatly increased. :) All the nigiri we had ordered was very fresh and delicious! It was my first time trying other fishes besides salmon... fishes I hadn't even heard of. Tai? Hamachi? Hotate? Saba? Hirame? Unfortunately, we couldn't order the amaebi (sweet shrimp) or uni (sea urchin) because it wasn't dinner time yet :( Boooo... next time though!

Can you believe we still had room for dessert? Yes, I got 2 scoops of green tea ice cream and a scoop of lychee sorbet. All were excellent! I was a bit embarrassed to order the tempura ice cream since we'd ordered so much nigiri already and our server put our check down at the table, which was probably a sign for us to leave! haha I guess the next time I come back I'll need to order a few tempura ice creams first! :D",7,6,5

So, basically you order and they make your sushi to order.

But, due to the fact that it's all-you-can-eat their product is just not up to par with sit down joints (also, I have been very spoiled in my raw fish experiences)

I came in last night with my friend and husband. We usually come in every month but this time we will never return. 
  Normally, when your eating in a sushi place, the first thing everyone notice is the food, service, and waiting time. 

The food was horrible. I come to a sushi place to eat fish not rice. I only ate the nigiri because there wasn't much good selections on rolls. The nigiri was a disappointment. All the fish had humongous rice and the fish was not pressed down properly. Once you see the rice portion is bigger than the fish than that is an insult. 
 
So we complained about it to our server. He said he'll talk to the manager. The server came back and said I'm sorry we CAN'T do anything about it. The manager didn't have the balls to stop by our table and talk to us. The manager has seen us a few times and he knows we tip 30% or more. Back then, the manager usually greet us and takes our table. Last time he offered comp bottle of sake but this time he acted like he barely knew us. Anyhow, we ordered a few more to see if they would fix the problem but instead the rice gets bigger every time and the cut of fish just gets smaller. We are not asking for them to put extremely less rice but balance out the portion of the fish to the rice.  Over all the server\/manager sucks. Poor customer service.  

Waiting time was great. There was no line, finally. Usually, goyemon is always packed and i would wait 30 mins to an hour to be seated. Thats how much I use to love goyemon. It use to be worth the wait.   
  Food came out on time as expected. But our server was always missing. Server just clears out our table and runs away. We always have to wait or ask the attentive host to call our server. So ordering was a pain.

Our sushi and appetizers did not arrive until 40 mins after we ordered. The dining room was packed, but the wait was still unacceptable for that long of a time.

With the food, the nigiri were pretty fresh and the special rolls were good. I'm not sure if it is worth the price though simply because there is that huge wait before getting any food. Also, you have to order a lot of food at one time or the dishes will come staggered at random times. You may be full before using the all you can eat option to the fullest.

Another gripe is that there is a requirement to finish all the food that comes out or face a penalty. The amount of rice can be overwhelming and for the price, customers should have the option just to have sashimi if they want.

Last negative comment (I promise), the dessert menu is pretty lacking in options and the portions are small so order a lot of those suckers.",1,1,0

SO first we arrive and wrote our names down and waitress told us it will be around 1 wait but they will give us a call 10 mins before the table is ready. SO they called us and we told them we will be arriving the restaurant within 5 mins and waitress says OK...NO PROBLEM and we got there and told the waitress we had arrived....AND she confused us with someone else and say that ""OH I ALREADY GAVE YOUR TABLE AWAY BECAUSE YOU DID NOT PICK UP YOUR PHONE, SORRY YOU HAVE TO WAIT AGAIN"" SO we were all kind of mad...with the attitude that was given to us. We showed her our phone call log, that we were on the phone with them for 1min 16 seconds. then the waitress did not apologize, she jsut went ""OH, COME OVER HERE"" and sit us down. 

Just as we thought we can finally eat!!!!!!!!! I ordered the yellow masago (not sure what the real name is) I ate the sushi...then I felt something really pointy\/sharp was in my mouth and it kinda cut my gums in my mouth. I spit it out and realized it was some hard broken plastics. I showed the waiter and he immediately took our dishes with no explanations or whatever and not even apologie. After 10 minutes he came back and wanted to offer us a new order so I was like HELL NO...and he explained that the people in the kitchen accidently broke a plastic container and he apolgoized. 

It keeps me wonder whether the it was the container that contains the yellow masago broke or was it another container that broke becasue it does make a differences, if it was the container that contains the yellow masago that broke I could be eating un-clean food. :(

Just like everyone says the food is fresh and tasty.  Pork belly is a must try. Love the grill taste to it.  You can also order all your rolls as half orders which is a plus, so that you can try out more rolls.  Tried my first Jalapeno masago nigiri(thanks Fredo) and it was awesome.  Try one with a quail egg and one without.  I didnt get to try my usual hamachi kama, due to being sold out of that and salmon kama (collar). Im sure they are both just as great as sushi-mons.

Grilled Pork Belly-THE BEST DISH EVER! Had 3 of these. Does not taste fatty and cuts well with the mango salsa on the side. MUST ORDER

After reading reviews I knew the wait was inevitable. This place is small! Very small space. Which explains the wait time. We got there and it was about a 35 minute wait but they do grab your number and text you when your table is ready. The text even says if you need a few minutes reply back and they'll wait 2 minutes. So don't wonder too far.

Automatically when we sit down someone takes our order. They must know the wait made us extremely famished! Ordered so many rolls (as seen in my pictures). I am a half roll kinda girl. I love getting half so I have more room to try different rolls. 

Some of my favorites were:
Sunrise Roll- This roll had cajun albacore (my fav), cucumber & avocado inside and its wrapped in tuna, yellowtail, shrimp, and white fish! I mean thats an amazing combo of fish. It taste so good! 

911 roll- Seriously the spiciest roll out there hands down. When we got it I thought, wow what a simple roll but boy I was wrong. It's spicy tuna with habanero sauce. Now I've had sushi rolls with habanero sauce before and it was NOT as spicy as this roll. This had my mouth on fire.... but in a good way! 

Nigiri- Very fresh! The garlic tuna was to die for. And of course my favorite Cajun Albacore! 

Spider Roll- Very large roll of sushi wrapped in soy paper and not seaweed. Might need to bite it twice to finish. Very amazing flavors of the soft shell crab inside. BOMB! 

I honestly loved every single roll I tried. I wanted to keep eating but my stomach would't allow it. The presentation of the rolls and different colors of the fish used was beyond beautiful. I love when my food not only taste amazing BUT looks amazing. Even if I ordered half rolls of everything-- it looked just the same as if it was a full roll. 

service was great! Thanks for a great experience Goyemon! See you for dinner next time for that green tea cream bruele !",7,4,5

When you get sick of the usual buffets on the strip, Goyemon is a good spot to hit up. It's $27 for all you can eat sushi! Aside from sushi, there is also soup, appetizers, and even dessert included in the AYCE price. So I can eat as many pieces of mochi ice cream as I want?! 

The fish is relatively fresh and the best part is that they don't give a huge portion of rice, that way you can enjoy the good stuff. They offer uni and amaebi as well, but unfortunately those are limited to one order per person (2 pieces), which is understandable. 

Highlight of the night was the 911 roll. It's essentially a roll with a crazy spicy sauce. The spice was good but it killed any taste of the fish. Spicy rice is what it was. Don't try it, I warned you.

Dined here for the first time tonight with the family, and I gotta say this place trumps sushi mon as the best AYCE sushi joint in Las Vegas. And that's saying a lot, because I've been been a big fan and a regular of Sushi Mon for the past six years. However, at the end of the night, I get a stamp card (buy 10 ACYEs and get one free), and it has Sushi Mon's  E. Sahara location on it as well. I came to the conclusion that Sushi House Goyemon has the same owner?

I was impressed with the quality of the fish and the relatively small portion of rice that came with the nigiri. Many ACYE places give huge portions of rice and miniscule pieces of fish. I may be exaggerating a bit, but you know what i mean. The ploy of most of these places is to get you full quicker by giving you bigger chunks of rice. Not at Goyemon.

Some of my highlights:
-Uni nigiri (very fresh)
-Since I'm a huge fan of spicy tuna, I have to try every sushi joint's spicy tuna roll. The spicy tuna had a tarty\/sour kick to it giving it a very exotic flavor, which I thoroughly enjoyed
-Crispy Rice Roll (Fried Cali Roll with spicy tuna on top drizzled with eel sauce and spicy mayo)
- Seared tuna (perfectly seared and very fresh tuna)
- Hirame sushi (delicate, melted in my mouth)
- Green Tea Cake (creamy and not too sweet)
- Lychee ice cream (Heaven)

I deducted 0.5 stars, because we had to wait about 15-20 minutes for the rest of our sushi and rolls to come out. However, the restaurant was packed, so it was understandable. Our waitress apologized to us several times. (She was also very nice and pretty :)",0,0,0

Sushi rolls are inflated with more rice than you can imagine than the fish !!! Seems that they wanted you to be filled so you can stop requesting for more sushi.
Service was terrible!!! This place needs an overhaul of their operations and taking orders from the customer. Our sushi roll took forever to about 30 minutes which turned out that the server gave it to the other table. Once the server realized that she gave our order to the other table, she simply took it from the other table and handed it to our table, without realizing that it was already half eaten by the other table. The server has an attitude too and has to re-write the order all over again.

The AYCE deal is a ripoff. It is good for 1 hour but the order takes an average of 20 minutes to be completed and you can only order 4 at a time. Lucky enough if you get your order right.

After my epic experience at Yummy Grill, I enthusiastically accepted an offer from Taylor T. to try Goyemon, later that evening :)

Upon arrival, it was pretty packed & seemed to live up to that aspect of the reviews. Fortunately, we didn't have to wait too long. We passed the time by people watching and funny commentary. Taylor T. was adamant about trying the AYCE & obviously, being a sushi noob, I was a little iffy about the whole AYCE eat thing. But, after being made fun of by the hostess for not being sure of the AYCE & that usually it was the guy getting AYCE & not the girl. Oh really?! The gauntlet was thrown & the challenge was accepted! Take that hostess!

So, thus began the AYCE madness & the 60 minute timer began :P I started off with some gyoza & yakitori, just to ease into the whole thing. My first sushi choice was a half order of the Hurricane roll. It was pretty good & I would order it again. Taylor T. had the half order of the Taylor roll (go figure) I actually thought it was really good & enjoyed it more than my choice. Next up was an order of the mussels. They were a little chewy, but sweet & very tasty. We followed up with half orders of the 911 & 007 rolls. The 911 was a little too spicy for my liking & the 007 roll was a nice simple roll, but kind of chewy. We finished the sushi portion off with the Domingo roll. This was definitely a good choice. Basically, a sushi roll topped off with some pico de gallo. What a great combo! Finally, we had the green tea crème brulee. It had a very subtle flavor, but really creamy & delicious. I just wish it was bigger, and AYCE though ;)

I will definitely be coming back for AYCE! I enjoyed my first AYCE experience here & look forward to more visits. The staff is very nice & really helpful & accommodating with suggestions & omissions of certain items.

There is also a selection of the days special and what's fresh, so that's nice to look at.
Quality of the rolls were just OKAY, the rice on my rolls were a little...soggy?
The deep fried rolls were very tasty, and fulfilling.
I have to commend the spicy rolls they have here though! The spicy rolls, in particular one...was HOT!
Besides the spicy rolls, the dessert was a pretty good factor in making me like this place, the creme brulee was great!

I don't understand how a place with this many good reviews could miss the mark so far. 

My friend and I sat at the sushi bar. First off the sushi chef was very rude. He had a bad attitude and was not attentive at all. We had to get his attention several times though he was maybe two feet away. The chef snapped at my friend when he mentioned that we ordered amaebi instead of ebi which we were served. The chef kept saying you can't get amaebi with AYCE. We both agreed a few times that its ok we will pay for it on the side for the regular order with our AYCE. It was very annoying and frustrating. It was such an awkward meal. I guess that was it for the chef. From that point on everything we ordered was either incorrect or lacked something. I know sushi pretty well. I have been a fan since I was 9, I worked at a sushi restaurant for a long time and learned a lot about it and my friend with me is Japanese. I will say the big eye tuna is tasty! This place just really disappointed me. Not only the yelp reviews excited me but my friends have told me so many great things about Goyemon. Maybe I will have to give them another try.",2,2,2

My brother who visits Vegas at least once a year highly suggested that I venture off the The Strip and give Sushi Goyemon a try. I was very skeptical being that it was all you can eat and at such a crazy low price. But being that my husband and I love both sushi, and a deal, we decided to check it out.  We may have not hit the jackpot in the casinos, but we hit the jackpot at Goyemon!  This was by far the best all you can eat sushi joint for it's food and it's price! There was a large selection of nigiri sushi, sushi rolls, side items, and desserts, and ALL of it was included in the AYCE price! Salmon, ikura, hamachi, toro, ebi, saba, uni, shrimp tempura, salmon kama, poke, gyoza, shumai, teriyaki chicken, green tea ice cream, creme brulee....and I could go on and on and on.  It's basically a full menu that's AYCE.  Though the nigiri was small, the fish was fresh and I didn't mind it being small, so that I could try lots of different things without getting too full.  Rolls were full size, but you can order half a roll so that you don't get too full on rolls.  This is to your advantage since you will be charged if there is any leftovers.  

My favorites of the night were the lemon roll and and salmon belly.  The ikura tasted really strange though.  The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because on the night we went, the rice was inconsistent.  The first order of sushi we had, the rice was seasoned well.  The second and third round of sushi had a very strong vinegar flavor, and if there is one thing that I don't like in my sushi, is an overpowering vinegar taste.  The last round of sushi that we got, the rice was back to normal.  

Sit at the bar for a better experience.  It was so easy to order our sushi in small batches since the sushi chef was right there in front of us. If you sit at the bar, order the sushi from the sushi chefs, and the sides from your server.  

The wait for a table at 6:00 was initially 1 hour 20 minutes, but they called us after 45 minutes.  They conveniently text you a link when you put your name in, and you can see where you are on the waiting list by clicking the link.  We put our names in and drove down the street to Trader Joe's and got called while we were there.  They graciously saved our seats and we were seated as soon as we got back. 

I don't know when I will return to Vegas, but when I do, Goyemon will definitely be on my list of places to eat!",2,1,2

The salmon is a little on the tiny side, especially if you're ordering ala cart, almost $5 for 2 pieces of tiny salmon is not really that great. Aside from the portion sizes, the fish seems to be very fresh and tastes great. I took my husband here for our anniversary and we got AYCE, we made the mistake of ordering sweet shrimp.. we generally aren't shrimp lovers, but we wanted to try it since it was one of the things that the dinner menu offers.. we shared 1 order, he ate his in one bite.. mine had the tail attached so I was using my chop sticks to sort of.. cut the tail off, once I was able to get the tail off I noticed the shrimp hadn't been deveined.. total turn off. It's literally not that hard to devein an order of shrimp, it makes the restaurant look lazy and makes me question other things. If we go back, we definitely won't be ordering shrimp. Our go-to place is I Love Sushi, but we wanted a go-to AYCE sushi place, since I Love Sushi doesn't offer AYCE.

This place was pretty packed but only waited about 15 minutes. The restaurant has small tables all kind of right next to each other, so really gives you that cozy or cramped feel.

Anyways, this is what we ordered:

Sashimi Dinner- My husband ordered this and I was deeply disappointed with it even though I didn't eat it. The cuts of sashimi just looked so thin and small. I have dinned at other Japanese restaurants (I LOVE sushi and sashimi) and have ordered a sashimi dinner meal that is about equivalent with larger cuts of sashimi. This just made me think of how cheap and stingy this restaurant was being. It is a good thing that this dinner meal came with a salad (a nice portion, made with the dark green leafys) and a bowl of miso soup because anyone would be hungry after only consuming the small cuts of sashimi (this dinner meal also comes with a bowl of rice). Oh and by the way, in case you are wondering, the sashimi pieces itself tasted fine and fresh.

Goyemon Style Lasagna Specialty Roll- I thought this specialty roll would be really overly rich and cheesy from the description on the menu but decided to order it anyway because the name just kind of made me curious of what this would taste like. I am glad I ended up ordering it because it was really tasty and not too cheesy. But it was rather rich, but delicious. 

Sashimi Salad- This is a new addition to their menu that you will find on your paper placemat. The price of this dish ($7.95 prior to tax) is actually pretty reasonable for the portion. The salad itself was made with the dark green leafys, which I really liked (instead of the cheap iceberg lettuce). The cuts of fish tasted fresh. The salad dressing (requested this on the side) had a nice light taste. Overall, a good salad that was fresh and light.

Service was fairly attentive but wasn't overly impressed with our overall dining experience. Wouldn't make a special trip to come back here again.",2,0,0

This place is a true gem..and for the very first time; i experienced locals.

You know what they say.. if a place is packed with locals.. then it must be really good.

AYCE Sushi --could be a hit or miss.. but this place is for sure a real hit.

The place is Completely OFF the strip. Like..it's a $20 worth cab ride from the Trump..and a $15 worth cab ride back to the Excalibur...

So... if you have a car.. Definitely worth it to drive to this place for the cheap deal for AYCE but if you are...say two people sharing a cab.. then might as well splurge your money at the strip (not the taxi cab fare). get what am sayin?

Anyway... The fish is fresh.. all the rawness goodness is legit.

Loved the small tapas plates..

But i especially loved the hamachi and the salmon sashimi. the Salmon Belly was out of this world good as well.

Their special of the day was the Uni. Not sure i liked that.. it had an aftertaste that's not present in really good Unis i've had before...

We got our money's worth for everything.. including our cab fare.

I was in Vegas with my family plus family friends about 3 weeks ago. My dad had wanted to try this one sushi place my aunt recommended. After searching through Yelp, we decided to go Sushi House Goyemon instead of our original dinner plans because of the high rating on Yelp. 

Since we had a larger party (about 15 people), we waited a little bit over 30 min. Most of us did the AYCE which was $26.95\/person (no discounted price for children). The menu is HUGE! They had so many appetizers, salads, rolls, sashimi, and desserts to choose from on the AYCE menu. I was impressed and wish I could have tried them all. They had a lot of items that I usually only see on the regular menus that are not for AYCE. Since it was a while ago that I went, I can't remember them all... but some that popped out were grilled yellowtail collarbone, cold tofu, wakame (seaweed salad), green tea creme brulee... just to name a few. The sashimi was so fresh!! DROOOOOL! it makes me hungry just to think about it! hahaha

Although the food selection was great, the service was so so slooooooooow. Half of my party got full just from waiting for the rest of their food to come out and ended up not eating that much. It seemed like they forgot some of our food so we would ask them to check up on it. As a result, we got double of our order, which is a plus except when you don't feel like an having an excessive amount of the same thing. There were 4 servers the night I came, but only two sushi chefs for a full house??

Usually fresh Uni, but sometimes its a fail. Must try the pork belly (super fatty!!) and the spicy tuna rice cracker. Fresh fish, good selection of rolls... which I usually limit to get my fill of sushi. Finish with unlimited ice cream (my choice is always red bean and tempura ice cream) and their other desserts that are limited to one.

Downsides? Service isn't great. Can be a hit or miss. And no RSVP unless it is a party of 12 or more for the private room. Usually a wait. But for the most part, worth it. Plus it is a good location for me. If you haven't been, it is worth trying.",2,1,2

I caught my bf with his eyes rolled in the back of his head a few times. Needless to say he enjoyed the majority of this dish all by himself. 
The BBQ Beef ribs were also really flavorful and saucy- goes perfect with  the white rice... Has a Teriyaki BBQ flavor. 
The Fried California roll was pretty good. Perfectly done. Not mushy at all on the inside. 
The Japanese Lasagna roll had a nice little baked crunch under the cream cheese topping. Down to the last bite. Impressive! 
The Shoyu Ramen was different.  Should've known this one was going to be a bust after we asked the waitress what different flavor ramen bowls they have and she said ""we're not a ramen house so we only have 1 ramen bowl."" Ok cool, well then what flavor is that one? She didn't know. Anyway, Wouldn't order it again but it was worth a try. Too many indescribable flavors.

We sat at the sushi bar and had Fredo(?) as our sushi chef. Really cool guy and really friendly. He recommended things to use and everything tasted great. 
YOU MUST get the grilled cajun salmon! It only comes in a small bit size so order about two for yourself. The chocolate moose was the only desert we tried and it was amazing. Also get the grilled veggies. Whatever butter they put is really tasty!!
The server was great too. There's about three that bus the sushi bar and grab drinks and one of them takes your order that doesn't get made by the sushi chefs. Super quick service!
If you do AYCE 10 times you get the 11th free!

$21.95 for lunch for an adult, $3 for a kid under 3 yrs old. Could we get an under 12 option? Say, $15.95? From $3 to $21.95 seems like a big jump. 

Everything we ordered here was A-ok, hence the three stars. The mentaiko (Pollock eggs nigiri) on the sushi specials was the best thing we had. Scallops were good. All the nigiri was good, but not amazing. 

They don't serve uni or amaebi for lunch. Only for dinner, which is 26.95. I would think that would be worth the $5. Unfortunately, those were the two dishes I was looking forward to the most. I was pretty disappointed. 

On the bright side, I enjoyed their chicken yakitori, dragon roll, squid nigiri, and tamago. Stay away from the 9-1-1 roll. What do you have to prove? So spicy you can't taste the food afterwards.

We went on a weekday night and following Yelp advice arrived early.  Good thing too.  Even though it was a mid week dinner, the place filled to capacity and soon there were people waiting.

We were lucky and snagged a seat at the sushi bar, where many regulars sit.  The nigiri comes out quickly and you can place orders directly with the sushi chef instead of flagging their busy wait staff. 

Nigiri - very good nigiri especially for AYCE. Highlights were bonito, the super white tuna, conch, uni, and amaebi.  Cons are that you are limited to only one order per person for uni and hotate.  Still though, loved the fresh cuts, minimal rice used (ie: no filler) and great selection.  Oahu's Hakone with unlimited toro, uni, and amaebi may rank higher but this place has good nigiri.  A steal. 

Sushi rolls - a variety of baked, fried, and fresh rolls are available and you can even order half orders.  Win. 

Cooked dishes - after hearing so much about the pork belly, I admit I was disappointed by that dish and the cooked dishes here.  No agedashi tofu, no chawan mushi, and they ran out of hamachi and salmon kama.  

Appetizers - really enjoyed the seafood salad, poke tuna, and surf clam salad.  

Overall, we had a great meal at Sushi Goyemon.  At $26.95, it's an incredible value if you love nigiri.  The izakaya dishes are lacking but the desserts were great.  

Sushi House Goyemon accepts credit cards, including Amex.

My Buffet Rankings:

1) Westin at the Bund, Shanghai - $60\/person and an excellent selection of sashimi, seafood, roasted suckling pig and fresh hand tossed Chinese noodles.  
2) Hakone - all-you-can eat toro, uni, kobe beef, and amaebi, $60\/pp.  

3) Sushi House Goyemon - truly great nigiri, many great appetizers, and desserts and an unbelievable price, $26\/pp
4) Navio at The Ritz Carlton - only down a slot secondary to the astronomical price ($88\/price) but made up for with a spectacular view, top notch service and great food.
5) Bellagio, Las Vegas - congee, prime rib, shrimp\/crab",4,1,3

We got there around 8:45pm and waited about 20 min. I was skeptical about the AYCE on sushi but my friend was right, the food was very high quality and fresh. Sushi House Goyemon has a full bar and good selection of sakes.
We had so many orders of everything (see pics ) but the stand outs were the Ama Ebi, special grilled white tuna, and the grilled pork belly. Everything on the menu comes in small portions only 1 or 2 small pieces but the wait staff service was spot on even though there was no an empty seat for 5 min the entire night. There is a time limit for the AYCE and it's mostly to turn over the tables. 

Tip

Order several items a once
The portions are small but tasty so you try more
Reorder the item you really like.

The ambiance is very trendy\/hipster like with cute decor all around. The hostess told us there's a wait even though we saw a handful of empty tables that were calling our names to be seated. We had to ask the hostess a few time if she forgot about us, she replied by saying she didn't want to stack the server hence the hold in seating. 

Our server was kind enough to inform us that sushi was a bit backed up so she encouraged us to order more kitchen items. We really enjoyed the large variety of items that Goyemon provided and there was no maximum of items each person can order at a time. 

The quality of the fish was great, especially for an AYCE joint. One thing that you should remember, you can order HALF portions, which we should have done so we were able to try a larger variety of items [nigiris, rolls, tempura, kitchen, and dessert]. The only downside is, you cannot order Uni or Amaebi during lunch as part of the AYCE menu. Even for dinner, only 1 order allowed per person. 

One highlight of the meal is BEWARE!!! of the 9-1-1 roll, my friend and I thought we could conquer this Spicy Tuna look-a-like roll, infused with habanero juice [which the chefs make themselves]. The server already gave us a fair warning that it's spicy and wow...it was no joke. I thought I could eat spicy but O-M-G...my face was on fire and my tongue lost all sense of its taste, I literally soaked my tongue in my Arnold Palmer for a good 5 minutes before it went back to 75% of its normality.

Overall Satisfaction: 1

Went to Goyemon for a friends birthday last Sunday after reading so many positive reviews here on yelp.  

ATTN EVERYONE:  IF YOU ARE DINING IN A LARGE PARTY, THIS REVIEW IS INTENDED FOR YOU.

     Our party was for 22 people, and a reservation was made for 8pm.  After most of us had arrived, we waited about 30-45 minutes to be seated, because the restaurant policy states that your entire party must be present before being seated. (We were not informed of this when the reservation was made)  The policy was strictly upheld for about half an hour before our server decided to bend the policy and allow us to sit down because half of our party were waiting in the cold for the last half hour due to space restrictions in the entryway, AND we were on the verge of leaving.)  If that wasn't enough, it grew worse in a hurry.

     The server ""GIO"" was blatantly unprofessional;  no greeting, calling attention to us by shouting ""Yo"" or ""Hey"" from across the room, handing off ALL of our food to one person and instructing that person to pass it to someone else and so forth.  Every time he came to the table, he had either forgot something, made a mistake, or didn't order something for us yet.   IT TOOK 20 MINUTES TO GET THE ONLY BEER I ORDERED...

     He referred to some of us as ""dog, dude, bro"" and ""that chick over there"", repeatedly forgot to place our orders, and acted as though we were wasting HIS time.  At times we had to guess what the different rolls were, because there was little effort on his part to state what they were, he didn't even know what some of them were himself!  The drink order was also a mess, and our table grew STACKED with empty plates before he decided to do anything about it.  We were also handed the bill by a different server before we got a chance to order dessert.  WTF!?  We paid in advance anyway to be polite.  By the time we had finished paying, only half our desserts were on the table, and predictably, the rest NEVER came, so we cancelled them.  

     For an AYCE sushi spot, some of us didn't eat very much because we had few chances to order food in one hour of service, because of all the setbacks, mistakes, and lack of effort.",5,1,1
798376,x20CdK8pbxhoUD4lrHJJyQ,u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA,2,2014-06-03,"AYCE Lunch: 11:45am - 4pm $21.95 per person (time limit 45 minutes) note: uni and ama ebi not available.
AYCE Dinner: 4pm - 3am $26.95 per person (time limit 60 minutes).

We ordered 2 adult AYCE lunches. Lunch Total With a coke and Tax: $49.35 (not including tip).

Taste: 3 stars - They are only on the radar by a mere passing grade. Nothing was memorable or great. Everything was either average or not good at all. Even in the beginning of our lunch, we refused to eat one of the rolls we ordered, since it tasted like chemicals and left a foul aftertaste in our mouth. The fish to rice ratio was less than average - the fish cuts were short and thin with a dense ball of rice. In the world of AYCE, Sakana wins the match - they offer a waaaaay better fish to rice ratio, better selection, and more explosive flavors. 


The good:
1. Salmon nigiri - slim cuts of salmon, but it will do. The fish tasted sweet and fresh. 
2. Halibut nigiri - it wasn't bad, the fish tasted fresh and had a nice texture
3. Yellowtail nigiri - also a sweet and fresh tasting fish
4. Magma roll (half roll\/ 4pcs) - we enjoyed this roll. It was simple, but all of the flavors and the texture went together nicely. 
5. Miso Soup - we loved how it came out piping hot. It wasn't too salty which is a plus in my book. 
6. Lemon roll (half roll\/ 4pcs) - it was simple, light and refreshing. Be careful with the lemon slices, some of them were sliced too thick and left a overwhelmingly bitter taste. You might need to just squeeze the lemon.
7. Green tea ice cream - very creamy and had a light green tea flavor. We loved how it wasn't overly sweet. 
8. The stamp card- I love the idea, it might be the only thing that could bring me back. 

The bad: 
1. Tuna poke - only 4 small bits of tuna cubes! it was really bad. I only tasted salty soy sauce and nothing else. 
2. Baked green mussels (2 pcs) - it's just a lot of sweet mayo, nothing special 
3. Takoyaki - it's all dough! There was a tiny dot of octopus in each one. 
4. Sunshine\/Or sunrise roll? It was horrible! The sauce they used tasted like chemicals and left a foul aftertaste. We couldn't eat it. My boyfriend felt sick after he ate that roll.
5. Strawberry mochi - they used some knock off mochi brand and it tasted like fake bubblegum. It wasn't good.

Value: 3 stars - It's a little less than average. It's a lot pricier compared to Naka Sushi. The fish was fresh, but definitely thin baby cuts or not consistent. Also their AYCE menu selection is noticeably smaller than that of other places. It seems like they focus on rolls here. Their side dishes (appetizer) selection is very slim and basic compared to Naka Sushi or Sakana's selection. 

Service: 2 stars - The hostess was very cheerful and energetic. However, our waitress seemed like she was over her job and like she was dragging her feet. She seemed annoyed that we wanted to order more food. Many times she would disappear into the back and we would not see anyone on the floor for a while. On a good note, it didn't seem like we were on a timer at all for the 45 minute lunch and we didn't feel pressured. 

Would we eat here again? I doubt it. Only if we're in the immediate area and wanted a later lunch that ends at 4pm. Other than that, we preferred Naka sushi's value and selection and my personal favorite Sakana takes the crown in selection, flavor, and quality!",5,2,2

Some friends brought me here for the first time and I thought I'd never meet the AYCE $29.95 volume for the price, but I was totally wrong.  It's worth it, too. Everything on the menu is included, so you linger with friends, order as your'e ready for it and stuff yourself until you grow gills.

I've been 3 times now, twice with the original friends who brought me and then I brought my BFF from out of town, who also loved it.  

My faves: Lemon Roll (FOREVER!), Jala Jala roll and Yebinsu. I also love the Super White Tuna. And the salmon belly, when they have it.

Basically, everything is awesome. Beware the 9-1-1 roll unless you have an iron-clad palette. Your taste buds will both love and hate you. 

The service is great, the patrons friendly (and mostly japanese, which told me right away that this place was going to be good) and their matcha iced green tea will keep you up for 4 days. Drink lots, kids.

My boyfriend and I are well aware of the policy for uni and sweet shrimp (one order per person), which was what we ordered but the chefs gave us a really hard time about it and would only serve us one order. Not only that but they were hispanic chefs and immediately started bad mouthing us in spanish..... unfortunately I speak spanish as well however I'm light skinned enough to pass off as a white girl..... so I understood everything. SO for any of you who are wondering what the chef is saying while they're staring at you while you're seated in front of them at the bar, don't think they're saying sweet things about you. 

After we did not receive the order, the chefs continued to ignore us while we sat there in front of them. They continued talking and giggling while taking glances at us. The servers eventually came around to fill our drinks as we had nothing left and the server (also hispanic) asked the chef what was wrong or why we looked annoyed. The chef later replied in spanish that it was because we wanted ""more food"" so I interrupted and in spanish spoke out to them. OF course the chefs at that point turned bright red since they were unaware that I spoke spanish and was listening to them the entire time. Needless to say I was furious. 

I'm still baffled that someone can talk all this messed up stuff while you sit in front of them. 

Thanks to this I will never return.",9,2,1

got to try the mecca of AYCE sushi in Las Vegas!!!!!!
I was actually somewhat worried about being let down by Goyemon because of all the hype but wow, was I wrong.

I went with my girl and we were seated at the sushi bar as soon as we walked in. I was really happy about this because all my friends told me to expect at least an half-hour wait. We ordered miso soup, shrimp tempura, and Sashimi salad as our side dishes and browsed through the menu. Miso soup is miso soup and shrimp tempura is shrimp tempura, but the Sashimi salad was delicious! We ordered following nigiri sushi: Tuna, Garlic Tuna, Albacore, Salmon, Halibut, Seared Tuna, Hamachi (Yellowtail), Ebi(Shrimp), Unagi(Eel), and Tamago(Eggs). They were hands down the best nigiri sushi I've tasted in my life! (besides the time I had sushi in Japan) All the fish were fresh and the portion of rice to fish was perfect! I was so stuffed after all the nigiri sushi that I only got to try one of their rolls, which was Hurricane roll. Hurricane roll had shrimp tempura and spicy tuna inside, topped with eel sauce and yum sauce. It was amazingly tasty to say the least! They have extraordinary desserts as well. We ordered Green Tea Creme Brulee and Lychee Sorbet. They were both excellent! I was really impressed with everything that still to this day, I can't get over it. Ever since I've had sushi at Goyemon, I've been daydreaming about going back and stuffing my face with their sushi. 

Service was great! Sitting at the sushi bar, we had so much fun! The sushi chef in front us was constantly making jokes about how intimate me and my girl were and how I wasn't speaking loud enough when placing orders! Overall, this place is a great place to go for some great sushi and a great night!",0,0,0

I, myself, am more of a purist. I want the best of the best so I wasn't all that impressed. It was like eating at a cut rate sushi place when really you were dreaming of Nobu or Sushi Samba.

But, really, for less than $50 you can get all of the sushi you want, who can complain? 

I enjoyed the 911 roll which boasted of habanero sauce but totally failed to deliver (I can take a LOT of heat so take this with a grain of salt).  I actually had to ask for a hotter roll. The chefs tried a roll that was supposedly much hotter, but barely registered on my tasted buds. To be fair I was raised on habaneros my whole life so my perception may have been skewed. 

The tempura was delicious as were really all the rolls I ordered. It was fun to look at the vast menu, find something I found interesting, and order it. If you want to explore all aspects of sushi, this is a good place to start. 

The service is a step above perfection. You don't have to wait or ask for anything. 

This place is definitely a casual go-to spot to hang out, try good sushi and relax. Definitely recommend.",3,0,2

You don't expect good quality for AYCE.  However, the service and largely the hostess service was HORRIFIC and we were NOT the only ones saying so (based on other reviews here and hearing other customers who were waiting at the same time as us).  
There was a queue to give our name for a table and the hostess was running around answering the phone and doing everything BUT take our names.  We easily waited 5-10 min just to put our name down (and there was only 1 party ahead of us).  They also had a few empty tables that easily sat empty for a good 20-30 minutes before parties were sat at them.  Part of this is they allow parties to be seated even if the rest of their party is not there.  For a place that is so busy, they should not allow this.
I appreciate that they take your phone number down and will call you when a table is ready.  When I've seen this at other restaurants, they usually call when a table is paying so it allows you 10 minutes to get back.  It does not make sense to call after the table is cleaned and setup because then it sits empty.  Furthermore, they should not allow tables to be sat if the whole party is not there - this avoids idle time where people are not eating and the restaurant is not making money.  I saw many parties actually leave and not bother waiting as they were as frustrated as us.
IN the end, we did wait and the food was great and came fast!  Still unsure if we would come back.",0,1,0

I'm not a complainer, not hard to please, I'm very easy going, I don't think first impression is everything, I give multiple chances, and I'm so understanding. Even when I find hair in my food, I don't even complain or tell the server. Now that we got that out of the way and you know what type of consumer I am, lets continue with why I went from giving this place 5 stars to 2 stars. 

I had been going to goyemon for few years loyally since it first opened. Introduced multiple friends and family to trying there. My boyfriend and I ate here regularly, at least once a week and we always did AYCE, I did couple a la carte for lunch to go. Quality and cleanliness were over the top. Waiting up to an hour or more for dinner everytime was always worth it. The service was always so amazing. Until recently, I had a (new) server that got sassy with me one visit, didn't say anything. Went back couple more times after that and the service and food kept going down hill. Servers were not as attentive and it seems to be almost a new crew except for some that has been there awhile. One bus boy was awesome, don't know his name and the sushi chefs are cool too. Apri, the hostess is sweet. Other than those mentioned, None of the other servers have any personality. 

Last time my boyfriend and I ate here (which we almost went back for one last chance a week later but decided to go to our other favorite sushi place. More on that later) I was so disgusted by how dirty everything was and the quality of the food. The plate of wasabi and ginger had dried  up food still stuck on it (somehow, the server missed that putting wasabi and ginger on it). I scraped it off and let it go. More plates came with food, all the plates had dried up food still stuck on them. My beer glass had lip stains around the rim. I didn't say a damn thing about any of those dirty dishes. Food came, everything had smaller portions than before. All the nigiris had a tiny piece of fish on them. Amount of food from side dishes were cut in half. I get it, it's AYCE smaller the portion the more you can eat or less food you may waste. But what the restaurant started with and what people grew to love should be priority and that's the quality of the food, that went down hill. I'm so disappointed, I'd love to still go there but after all the past experiences the last few visits we won't be going back ever again. Umiya is closer and has always been our other favorite when goyemon is too busy or when we don't want to make the drive. The quality of the food is amazing. The servers actually have personality and actually acknowledge the fact that you're a regular. Way better vibe. 

So there is my first ""negative"" review. Management : whoever is running goyemon now needs to prioritize before you start losing more customers. Clean your dishes.",1,0,0

Rolls: 
- Sexy Girl (shrimp tempura roll with spicy tuna, crumbs, and eel sauce)
- Pastel (crab stick and cream cheese, topped with shrimp, avocado, and eel sauce)
- Magma (shrimp tempura roll topped with salmon, eel sauce and Sriracha)

Side Dishes:
- Pork Belly (my favorite, but only included in dinner price AYCE)
- Spicy Tuna Rice Cracker (panko-breaded rice topped with spicy tuna, eel sauce, and spicy mayo, also only included in dinner price AYCE)

Desserts:
- Tempura Ice Cream (it tastes like they use cake batter)
- Green Tea Creme Brulee (it's usually only on their board of special desserts)

The rolls are really good, and it's really convenient because one menu has pictures of all the rolls, while the other gives descriptions of them.

As for the service, they're really good! I never have to usually ask for them, as they're really attentive and come to me as much as they can to check on me.

The only downside is that the wait times can get really long. Sometimes I've had to wait over an hour. It is a pretty popular sushi place, and they don't accept reservations. Also, they don't typically seat you until you're entire party has arrived.

I know how hard it is to get a 4.5 star rating on Yelp so I was expecting much, much more from this place. I am (or was, it's been a while since I've been) a fan of Sushimon and with all the hype, I've been wanting to try this place for WAY too long. Had to work late for Valentine's Day so what better day than to try it with my gf for a midnight dinner.

Ordered the Orgasm as we sat down since it's my favorite Vegas sushi invention. And the gf wanted a cocktail. Nothing looked good on the drink menu so I ordered her the vodka midori martini. Maybe I messed it up by asking for less vodka, more midori, but the drink was a zero star. It tasted like medicine.

Wanted to do the AYCE, but found out that the things we wanted to eat wasn't included so we ordered a la carte.

The 1) Orgasm came and it was more like the Tease. Yes, the tuna was definitely some of the freshest! But the taste was just not balanced (too much citrus).  We then ordered a few other items:

2) Dynamite - Had to return because it was burnt
3) Beef Tataki - I like it fine (nice and rare) but gf thought it too salty, which I made the mistake of saving a portion for later and soaking in the ponzu soy sauce, it became too salty for me too
4) Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice Cracker - probably our favorite dish, unique!
5) Yum Yum Scallop Handroll - the mix was too dry and the taste bland
6) Nabeyaki Udon - so-so as the sweet mushrooms overtook all other flavors and made the broth a sweet, salty mess
7) Got tempted by other Yelpers' Yelp on the pork belly so I ordered it last minute, and wish I hadn't. The flavor was there but the pork belly was undercooked and served room temperature making the fatty part gelatinous.

Still hungry but decided to quit at that. The taste discerning will note that the flavors served here are primarily SWEET eel sauce on everything or the yuzu, mango salsa on everything else. 

Perhaps I may make it back here someday but I would only do so if in the mood for AYCE.  After all, one's expectation is lower for AYCE than it is for a la carte sushi. My experience was only a 2 star but if I was to rate it based on fresh ingredients alone, I would rate it much higher, but with taste considerations (of course), I'm truly surprised that Yelpers rate it this high!",3,1,2

Everyone was super friendly, the chef's clearly knew what they were doing, and did a great job keeping orders coming out with a pretty decent sized lunch crowd.  As for the food, it was great.  Nigiri was properly prepared with an excellent fish-to-rice.  Rolls were also great - we tried a bunch and didn't have one we didn't like.  One thing I really liked here was that they have some unique rolls that go beyond what you usually find at the typical AYCE place and all of the flavors meshed nicely.  I like spicey rolls and let me tell you, these folks put together some fine spicy rolls.  We also tried to apps - calamari and steamed shu mai and both were outstanding.  In particular, the shu mai seemed to be freshly prepared and did not taste or feel like it had been prepared from pre-made, frozen shu mai.

my roommate is a strict vegetarian and very picky when it comes to sushi but he has also fallen in love with the avocado and cucumber rolls. everyone i have brought here has loved it just as much as i do.

disappointing restaurants, so I thought Goyemon never fails me and came to have an earlier dinner. I was wrong, yet again.

Hmph...it was not the best idea and here are the reasons why:

1. When we got there around 7:45pm, Saturday night, the place was packed...and I mean packed as in it's super small and doesn't have much seating available, so when you include the AYCE option, I can tell why the wait here is always LONG. We waited for over 45 minutes before a table finally decided to get their bootays up and leave. Even though, the waitress was kind enough to offer the 3 of us seating at the bar, we opted to get a regular table and let the bar be available for the couples\/singles.

2. The AYCE menu is quite confusing. You can't have everything all-you-can-eat...meh?? There were certain items on there were you were only allowed one order per person. So the math did get confusing for me. I'm no bueno with numbers here people!

3. FOOD: The pork belly that everyone raved about was MEH for me. The sushi rolls were also A-OK, nothing too crazy besides the nutso 9-11 roll we ordered. That habanero sauce they used on that roll had my mouth feelin like Angelina Jolie for a good 1\/2 hour. OMG! The sashimi and fresh fish was very fresh indeed and those orders always came out the quickest. The chicken skewers were...what they were, just chicken skewers with Teriyaki sauce all ova em, again...nothing special there. The ONLY thing I really did enjoy was the AYCE option of DESSERTS! Mmmm, mmm bombalicous! I had 2 of the green tea creme brulees (which were sooooo decadent and perfect) and 1 red bean ice cream, how can you go wrong with anything that has beans in it? Yes, I'm Asian and I love my beany desserts! =P

4. SERVICE: It got kinda confusing who our server was. There were some dudes that would come out with our order but didn't take our order and then we had about 3 waiters that did take our orders back & forth. Major minus? Food came out WAY too slow-momo. I know there are only about 3 chefs working, but the place is tiny and I've been to plenty AYCE sushi spots and never had to wait about 15 min between each order. I'm ALWAYS hungry! Especially now since I'm still in precontest season for my fitness competition, so if I'm looking forward to a cheat meal, it better be top notch and the food better come out FAST. Sushi House Goyemon did NOT do this job well.

Would I come back? For the desserts? Yes. But even that's not really worth the trip there.

P.S. We had to hit up Jean Philippe Patisserie at the ARIA (since it's the only thing open super late and close to our hotel) right after we left this spot cuz my ass was still HUNGRY as EFF!",8,3,4

The fish quality was okay, but every roll and piece of nigiri had really hot rice. They were out of uni which made me really sad. Then they said that they didnt have mochi, or tempura ice cream, so me and the gf got green tea ice cream only to have green tea soup handed to us instead. From there I assumed their freezer wasnt working, but our server still assumed it would be okay to give us an almost completely melted serving of ice cream. But really put the nail in this coffin was that every sushi place lets you eat for your time limit of 60mins.. At our 45 minute mark our server, (I kid you not) hands our check right as we finished giving her our order, idk if thats a goyemon thing, or if they were trying to just kick us out.

This has been the best AYCE sushi bar so far. I find the dinner service to be slight better than lunch.  The wait time for dinner can run you at least an hour although you may get called to a table earlier. They have a ""no-sharing"" policy that they enforce between the AYCE and Ala Carte menu and you have 45 minutes for AYCE. The food is fresh and great tasting all the time I've visited. The Pork Belly, which is served only during dinner hours, basically melts in your mouth.Yum. Mochi Ice Cream is always great at the end of your meal too. I bring all first time visitors to Vegas here when ever they want AYCE sushi. Its well worth the money.",2,0,1

My only disappointment was that some items were unavailable (e.g. yellowtail collar) and presentation was messy at times. If you have a dish with only one piece of fish, I think you should make it look good. But then again, this isn't Raku...

We thought the nigiri was fine, but not the greatest quality - there was also a point when our second round of tuna and yellowtail nigiri tasted very ""fishy."" Our happiness factor went mostly to the cold tofu and other grilled specials. Also, the desserts were great and UNIQUE. Most AYCEs serve the standard mochi\/ice cream (not that it's not delicious). We enjoyed our plum wine jello and green tea crème brûlée.

The ambiance and decor were A+. The restaurant had a good vibe, chill music, and attentive service. We were happy to be served quickly; our rolls were never more than five minutes away.

If anything, Goyemon must be visited simply because it's like the prettier sister of other AYCEs.",2,1,1

I heard about this place from a few friends already and I wanted to give it a go because like I said, I am the AYCE Sushi King! I had to try it to measure it up to my favorite in the Valley. After a marathon, i left the decision of food to a good friend of mine, and I had great expectations because I believe in her taste. Now, mind you, it would all be our first time, but I was down! There's such a thing called hungry eyes and I don't mean Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing and my eyes were not satisfied let alone my royal palette ;) I start off by warming up my stomach with my usual orders of nigiri (fresh water eel, salmon, and Cajun albacore), seaweed salad, and green mussels! The preliminary order had satisfactory flavor, but I did notice that they put very little rice! I liked that part! I noticed that the friends I was with was not very happy with their service and that took a toll on my experience. 

I believe a restaurant MUST understand how to treat and serve their patrons well FIRST and then deliver with high quality food or products! However, service seemed to be at the bottom of their priorities; at least for us it was.

If my friends aren't happy, I'm not happy. And when I'm not happy, you get 2 stars! 1 for being open during lunch and 2 for having an AYCE sushi during lunch for $21.95.

The place has a very cool  decor to it.  When you ask for AYCE they bring a menu specifically for that.Nothing highlighted or marked with an  asterisk like most places do. They have a very large selection of rolls and unique appetizers.  Last but not least if your a night owl this place stays open till 3am.,1,0,2

The service is great though and you can't beat the AYCE factor.  I love the fact that even though it's AYCE, they don't make the huge rice balls to try to fill you up.  That's the only experience I've had with AYCE.  The nigiri was nice.  Fish was super fresh.  Rolls were meh.  I liked the fact that when they say AYCE, they mean everything on the menu.  So you can order appetizers, cooked food like grilled fish, grilled other things, tempura,  udon.  Ramen is only available after 11pm.  But the desserts and sides are also AYCE.  I can see why the wait time is so long.  I do like the fact that you can put your name in and they will text you and allow you time to get back.  Haven't seen that anywhere else.

Walking in, it seemed like an okay place. A little small, but my favorite sushi place is literally a hole in the wall, so you can't judge by the cover. We sat at the bar and the waitress (I think. Three different people served us sides and sodas, so I don't know) reminded us of the left-over policy and took our drink order. 

There was a TON of chefs behind the bar. The amount of chefs should have meant the food came quickly and you didn't have to wait a while to order, but it was took an average amount of time. Which is okay, I mean, but I was struck by just how many chefs they had for a Wednesday night. It was like 8 or something. 

We started off with garlic edamame, which I usually love. Here it was like half-cooked with melted garlic butter on top. By the end of it, I felt like I was drinking butter. Not the best start. 

My favorite dish is Japanese Lasagna and I was excited that they had it, so that was my first roll. It had some kind of weird scallop sauce or something and was served on foil. I literally had to pry the sushi off of the foil. I next had some kind of fried California roll that was so breaded my friend and I could barely stand to finish it. He had a Red Dragon roll that he said was really good, but his other roll was meh. 

We didn't bother to stay for dessert. It took years to get the check. When he gave them his card, a waitress immediately returned saying it didn't work. She seemed kind of offended when we both insisted he had money on it (he had literally just shown me on his bank account app) and came back ten minutes later with the receipts. 

Pretty decent pricing, but you can get better sushi someplace else for the same price. We didn't even know who our sever WAS. Not the worst sushi experience I've ever had, but I'll stick to Naked Fish's up on Durango when I'm craving sushi.",0,0,0

Lunch is 21.95 and dinner is 24.95. I asked what the difference is and it's just a small change-up of the menu with the addition of some extra sushi pieces. Lunch would satisfy me just fine any day.  However, if you want to try that green tea creme brule and that nice green cake in the main photo... you'll have to join them for dinner (Reminder: come back for dinner soon). 

The place is small and they don't take reservations. I'd say there were about a good 10-12 tables in the main dining area, and an extra 3-4 tables in their extra room in the back. So if you're planning to throw a big birthday hoopla there, make sure you and your guests come early to reserve because they won't sit you unless you are all present. The decor is simplistic but modern with their wooded ceiling framework and their fancy light structures (i think it came from Ikea).

Now finally on to the food. The appetizers aren't bad. The nigiri sushi pieces are mediocre. Too little rice, and not enough fish. If you're a salmon lover, skip the nigiri and just get a salmon handroll. It's much more worth it, I promise. If you have some rice left over on the place, order the dynamite (creamy mixture of seafood and mayo concoction) and pair it with the rice, it's actually pretty darn good and compliments each other very well! I'm not the biggest roll fan but I actually enjoy their rolls here. I love how they provide the option of getting half orders (4 pieces) of each roll so you don't have to kill yourself to finish massive amount of pieces to avoid any extra charges of anything left over. 

There's some good and bad traits, but overall I think you'll get the most bang out of your AYCE buck here.",11,5,7

I would recommend this place if your in the mood for sushi and in Vegas. This place has side dishes that are included in the AYCE, some of the dishes we had was the three grilled fish, pork belly, fried spicy fish cake.  

Its definitely something different from the strip, and more of a local place which was what we were looking for.  Tired of the buffets, and wanted to get our sushi craving.  One thing that you should keep in mind is there is a wait and your looking for at least an hr minimum, but surely worth the try.  Would recommend if its your first time like us to get a seat at the bar and get to know them, they will recommend you what you should try and what to avoid.

That, to me, is what makes Goyemon stand out above the competition.  We're not just talking miso soup or mochi ice cream either!  Delicious pork belly, yummy grilled veggies, daily sushi specials, green tea cake, black sesame creme brulee...these are some unique offerings.

Sushi here is good, and the daily specials always offer a good variety of fish to try.  All of my visits start out with me ordering one of every special, both sushi and grilled items.  The one thing that I haven't really been fond of is the rice.  I know that they get very busy, but it seems like their sushi rice is almost fresh from the rice cooker; by time the sushi gets to the table, the rice is warm and the fish feels like it's been sitting at room temperature for a while.  It's never been bad enough to ruin a meal, but it is something I notice each visit.  To be fair, other people I've dined with either don't notice it or it isn't a big deal, so it could be a personal thing.

Outside of my little rice quirk, Goyemon is a solid choice for sushi.  It has a big roll selection for your casual sushi friends, as well as a good fish selection for you nigiri folk.  Add in the appetizers and desserts to help cleanse your palate, and you have a dinner spot fit for most, if not all of your friends!",8,3,8

We had problem with this lady on 2 different occasions already. Once was on Christmas eve \/day, I called ahead of time to see if they were open, and was told they are open till 9PM.

Second time was last night, we got there early, again 5ish, SAME person: ""sorry we stop seating for today unless you have a reservation"", I replied ""I thought you guys dont' take reservations?!"", she answered ""yes, we don't, but it's our 3rd anniversary, so we open for reservations."", I asked her how would the customer know if they can or cannot book reservation, she replied with a VERY rude and unprofessional tone, ""well, if you have been to our restaurant for the last few weeks, we have been talking about it."".

I feel like the value of the price relative to how much you can eat will surpass the value of the sushi itself, but that is dependent on the person. They have a normal lunch menu as well as AYCE during lunch, but I'm not so sure about dinner. 

On my various visits, I've been satisfied with the service. My first two times I came to Goyemon when I ordered, I ordered a lot the first time and the server gave me this warning of a sort that if I don't finish the food, I have to pay extra. Personally, I don't like people telling me stuff like that just because I know I wouldn't order more than I could eat, but I understand a lot of people don't finish their food and they just want to be pre-cautious.The servers are busy usually, but I also feel like they try not to make eye contact with you or something so you don't order more or something, for obvious reasons. So when you need something, you have to raise your hand and speak up.

The food I would say is quite good. I am very satisfied with the quality of the rice and fish they serve. I personally love rolls, and so I am really satisfied with the rolls that they serve.

- Cajun Albacore
- Snow Crab
- Scallop
- Yuzu Tobiko (if it's on special)
- Ikura 

I love their rolls too but I'm more of a nigiri sushi girl ;) However, all rolls that I ate there were exceptional! Make sure to try Puffy - Yum Yum!!!

They have awesome items on the dinner special board btw. My boyfriend and I were happy to see that you can order the salmon belly as much as you want and same goes for most of the desserts on the specials. I also tried the grilled shishito pepper which was simple but delicious. Our go to rolls are usually the hurricane, the moon, the ecstasy, the jala jala, and the crispy rice roll. Try at least one of these rolls and I promise you won't be disappointed. Their nigiri is also very fresh and cut well, but I do feel like they could use less rice.

I got the green tea creme brûlée, two orders of sesame mochi, green tea mochi, two orders of tempura ice cream, lychee sherbet, and green tea ice cream.

The tempura ice cream was alright, but I wish I would have ordered like 10 sesame mochi's because it was that damn good lol.

Fish tasted like it was sitting out for hours instead of keeping it well maintained and fresh.
Main Reason, we was trying to ordering again but no server or waiter around for at least 15 mins so we didn't want to wait another dam minute for them to show up, no refills on drinks also, these guys are running a circus here. I had to get up from my own seat and ask for my check. If yelp was able to give 0 stars you guys would tottally get one. But 1 start for noting because 0 stars isn't optional here.",0,0,0

Let me elaborate. You'll never experience top-of-the-line fish quality at Goyemon. You won't have the best uni, the most delectable tuna, or the sweetest shrimp. You might have to wait for an hour or more, especially if you bring a larger group. But you'll always be able to have as much reasonable-quality fish (and other tasty things) as you please for $26.95 (or $21.95 for lunch, but that's irrelevant - more info later). You'll always impress friends and family from out of town (disclaimer: yours may not be as cool as mine). Compared to Strip buffets, you'll get superior value, more-than-sufficient variety, and zero lining up in front of heat lamps. Yes, newbies: you place orders here like you would at a normal restaurant, and they cook and prep to order.

At Goyemon, choosing dinner (starts at 4pm) is an absolute must. If you don't go for dinner, you won't get grilled pork belly, multiple types of grilled fish (cajun salmon, super white, yellowtail, even salmon kama occasionally), the crowd-pleasing spicy tuna rice cracker, or the extra desserts that often include chocolate mousse, green tea creme brulee (I actually dislike this), yuzu sorbet, and extra mochi flavors. You'll also miss the uni - generally not ""good"" but at least passable, unlike some other places - and amaebi. I tried lunch once a few months back and was surprised that they do offer nigiri specials, but I missed my dinner exclusive so much.

The rotating nigiri specials are rarely or less reliably found at other AYCE places. Salmon belly is often available. Kanpachi (amberjack) is another nice option that I can't recall seeing elsewhere. Conch (rhymes with honk) is a surprisingly good too. Occasionally on holidays or perhaps at some manager's whim, they'll have blue fin tuna or even toro available as specials. They've had a few anniversary or special items from time to time too with special pricing and expanded menu (invariably drawing huge crowds or rapidly filling time slots). These rare treats are always nice.

I'll just list some other items that I almost always order: sashimi salad, baked green mussels (it's not overly sauced), super white tuna nigiri, fresh scallop (""hotate"") nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, lychee sorbet, green tea ice cream (best texture and flavor I've had at any sushi place). Also, the moon and hurricane rolls (usually half-orders).

I congratulate and empathize with all the reviewers who have seemingly lucked into poor service. I may have had relatively slow service once or twice in the past, but it's been reliable the last few times and has left a good impression in long-term memory. If you're with a very small group, sit at the bar for likely improved sushi response times (the servers still cover appetizers\/grilled items and drinks). And in general, don't sabotage yourself by under-ordering. I'd say 7-12 items per order is a good range.

After dozens of visits over the years, Goyemon is still consistently the best AYCE sushi place that I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Others in town are close, and at least one has marginally superior fish quality, but I'll always bemoan a lack of dessert variety (if it's not one per person, which is a huge negative for those places), a lack of my favorite grilled items, a lack of a stamp card (buy 10 and get a free meal), or something else possibly nitpicky. This is the jewel of the surprisingly good AYCE sushi scene of the desert.",8,2,4

Other notable unique items:
1.  Spicy tuna on crispy sushi rice - Chewy, slightly spicy and slightly sweet.  I liked it more for the fun chewy texture but the man did not fancy it as much.  Strange, he's usually a fan of anything tuna.  
2.  Tofu cheesecake - fluffier and not as heavy as its American counterpart, but when it comes to an amazing asian style cheesecake, Raku still wins hands down for their fluffy cheesecake.

We did not try any of the specialty rolls at all, but everyone around us seemed to be enjoying them.  We tried pretty much all the nigiri menu items (tuna, albacore, seared albacore, cajun albacore, white albacore, super white tuna, red snapper, mackeral, sweet shrimp, uni, salmon, ....). Most everything seemed pretty good, but there were some that were definitely more fresh than others and some we could have skipped (shrimp).

It does expire though, so it certainly awards frequency in visits or large parties. They do not combine stamp cards, so remember to bring it!

I usually order Tuna, Yellowtail, and Salmon nigiri and hand rolls. Fortunately, they're very good here and one sushi chef in particular handles the fish very well. I like the specialty rolls like the Hurricane, Red Dragon, and Mahalo (which is just a Spam Musubi in roll form, but still so great). I usually go for ones with different fishes and possibly shrimp tempura, but no cream cheese (or I just ask for it to be omitted).

Additionally, service is good and the location is easily accessible. It can get pretty busy, but my fiancé, siblings, and I typically go at times to avoid the crowd. That works out well and we haven't had to wait long for a table!

This place is one of the more top notch sushi places that I have been to with fresh fish. I am more of a nigiri man myself which is why I speak about the freshness of the fish. It is very important to me to have fresh fish. The texture of these fish are amazing and have the taste that you expect to come from such fish such as salmon and tuna. 

The sushi rice is also of great texture. Sticks together still in your mouth like it's supposed to. I use my fingers to eat my nigiri and the residue left behind from the rice is minor which tells of great rice. 

The reason for the 4 stars is because if the quality and presentation of the nigiri. The sushi could look better. I usually like to appreciate the food before me but there doesn't seem to be anything pretty about this fish but again this is not that big of a deal.

We arrived shortly after opening last Friday (between 11:45am and noon) and were able to get a table for our group of 5. It filled up quickly after that while we were eating. Our drink orders were quickly taken and we started sizing up the AYCE menu.

Here's where I kinda take issue: Usually at AYCE sushi, the table is given a paper where we mark off the items we want with tallymarks for different rounds as we decide what we want, and then we order a second round once we've received our items from the first. Here, the waitstaff takes orders like a traditional sushi restaurant. I don't like this for 3 reasons: I ordered plain edamame and miso soup, which I like to start the meal with (both). I got these items at the very end of my meal, when I kind of didn't even want them anymore. I even had to ask our waitress where the edamame was and she just said it was on the way. We were already on the second bottle of sake.

My second problem with the waitstaff ordering method rather than the paper with the tallymarks is that there were things people wanted to share, and it was really hard to keep track of how many of each thing were wanted - the waitress implied she had a system but looking over her shoulder at her notepad, I didn't see anything that made sense. We happily ate everything, but I would be mildly annoyed if we were missing orders of nigiri or given too many of something, especially something that we only wanted a small taste of (like say, uni).

My third problem with this style of ordering is making sure we received everything and confirming what things are since I like to be adventurous. We had ordered some squid and the folks who wanted it tried what they were thinking was squid. Then something that was much more obviously the squid came out. What had they eaten earlier? The world may never know. But with a form left at the table, we could have figured that out somehow.

Ok! Back to positives. The quality of the food was fantastic. I got a shrimp head in my miso that added to the flavor and gave it such umami, I was in heaven. The fish was so fresh and there was a really nice fish to rice ratio on the nigiri (mostly what we ordered). I hate when places go crazy with the rice for AYCE so you fill up. This place made the pieces like usual so you could really enjoy the fish.

Here's the nigiri we ordered (and my comments if I ate it):
tuna (maguro): delicious and fresh
garlic tuna: tasty but the garlic sauce didn't really add too much, so I'd skip it for plain
super white tuna: OH MY GOD GET THIS IT'S PHENOMENAL
yellowtail (hamachi): another great fresh fish here, refreshing and tasty
salmon (sake): my favorite, an old standby and Goyemon did not disappoint
seared salmon: a new favorite, the searing adds a beautiful dimension and meatiness
snow crab meat: meh, it was good but I keep trying crab and keep not loving it as much as other seafoods so I should stop trying
fresh water eel: GET IN MY MOUTH so meaty and the sauce is so sweet and perfect

A couple rolls were ordered by the table - I tried a bit of the Ecstasy roll and it was good but I wasn't expecting the ""orgasm sauce"" to have a kick to it, and I'm not a fan of spicy sauce.

We also got the yellowtail collar that's not included in the AYCE and is hot and eaten with a garlicky sauce and OMG. Without the sauce it's really bland and dry but the sauce brings out a flavor profile that's orgasmic. It's umami and savory and melt in your mouth, the seafood dreams are made of. I just wanted more of it than the small flakes we could pull out with our chopsticks.

The service, besides the weird ordering and waiting forever for a couple of things, was attentive and polite, my diet coke was regularly refreshed and it was never hard to flag someone down with a question. Overall, I loved this place despite the weird timing. I will 10000% be back the next time I'm in Vegas and like every time after, I'll just make sure I request that I get my miso and edamame before any of the fish I order.",0,0,1

Otherwise, awesome gluttonous experience. I think the key is to make sure to order from the specials on the board as with most sushi bars since it's usually a choice and seasonal offering.

*****THE FOOD *****

Sweet Shrimp Nigiri - 1 order each person, it was just okay. Nothing good and bad about it. Maybe good thing about the Nigiri is that the rice is small so you don't have to eat too much rice.

Sea Urchin Nigiri - 1 order each person, the sea urchin tasted like it has been in the fridge for a very long time. Neither fresh nor sweet.

Hotate Nigiri - taste good with soy sauce but usually hotate are kinda tasteless. (And i think they added some lemon juice on it)

Yakitori - I think they didn't marinated the chicken; they just added some sauce on it.

Dynamite - Quite good :)

Baked Green Mussel - The size of the mussel is a little bit bigger than the other sushi place. The flavor is the same throu.

Grilled yellowtail - quite good (u can pick teriyaki\/ ponzu sauce)

Grilled Pork Belly - Actually I like this :) Quite good !!

Yakisoba - Nothing good or bad about it.

Green Tea creme brulee - (one order per person) I think not much sushi place has this as dessert. It was good since im a big fan of green tea brulee. Maybe it can be a little bit cooler?

""Tofu"" Cheese cake - I dun think they added tofu??? cant taste or smell any tofu.

Im not gonna comment on the roll because i think they are not good at all. :(

And they were out of Kama that night .... :(

I think im not gonna go back to this place or if i do, i wont do all you can eat. I will just have some green tea creme brulee.

I was not impressed. Lackluster would be the word I would use.
I've read the reviews. I saw the pictures. That's what brought me here. The hubby is not a sushi person so to get him to go to sushi joint is like pulling teeth. Well now it just got harder.

We went around 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon. there was a wait for a table, but we took seats at the bar. The service was lacking, to say the least. Our hostess looked like she was pissed off at the world --the place got off to a bad start from the get-go.

I ordered AYCE and the hubby had a spicy chicken bowl. The miso soup had 1 piece of seaweed in it (1 total - I didn't get any).. and it was oily and bland. The shrimp tempura I ordered was lukewarm and greasy. My husband was not a fan of spicy chicken - he said it was not spicy at all and was not very hot - temperature-wise. I ordered 6 pieces of salmon sushi and 2 hamachi - that was good but nothing that stood out. Someone mentioned this in an earlier review - the rice was quite warm for sushi. I typically do not mind it but a few pieces were actually hot and it altered the taste. I also had the tiger roll and the rock and roll - all were A-Ok.

No one took my empty plates...and they were really piling up. When we were ready for dessert it took a full 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. I get that it was crowded but I couldn't get anyone to look at me. The guy next us actually had to get up and physically go to the host stand to get his check.

I've told myself I wouldn't eat sushi elsewhere since I am a huge fan of Sushi Mon. But somehow I found myself walking into unfamiliar territory on Sunday. My first thought walking towards the door was, ""damn this place has a butt load of people waiting outside."" Translation: "" damn I have to wait a long ass time to eat."" Fortunately, I was wrong. We were greeted by a nice hostess and were seated at the bar right away. The bar is pretty small compared to SM but I loved how spacious it was as far as food space go. As I looked around, I noticed that they offered more specials, but was disappointed to find out they didn't have toro!(nigiri) But no biggie, there were other great things to choose from.

The Rundown:
Seared salmon\/tuna- I love how they put less rice and more fish on these nigiris; fish was fresh, fat, and tasty! 
Nigitoro- Honestly, not at all a big fan even though it was toro. The texture of scraped fish meat was too much for me.BUT the guy loved it. And was one of his favorites.
Shrimp shumais- i had a party in my mouth.
Gyoza- ""oh yah thats what's up,"" says the guy
EeL- I had a fiesta in my mouth.
Super white- It really was super(b)
Spicy shrimp yum yum roll- it wasn't as yum yum as it should be. It was lacking a little bit of flavor..BUT it was real spicy and THATs how it should be. 
Baked mussels- It was ok, not a big fan of it here.
Green tea creme brûlée- The guy really liked it, it was alright for me.
Tofu cheesecake- for a TOFU cheesecake, it wasn't bad at all. Good job to whoever thought of creating this.
Service- Uh I should've left more than the 21 percent because damn they're good. Hiro was real friendly and attentive. 

So why the star deduction? Actually I gave them 4.5 . Minus half a star because one: they didn't have the yellowtail collar and it's one of my favorite dishes. Two: the only hand roll that I really love (shrimp yum yum) was lacking flavor. Three: even though nigitoro is still toro, I still wasn't a big fan of it. I was really looking forward to eating toro and was a wee disappointed that they didn't have it. 
In the end, everyone was happy. Hiro(sushi chef) became our hero and once again, satisfaction kicked in. I'm also delighted to know that they don't limit the orders on the specials.

Having gone here tonight with my boyfriend's family (and still bloated from dinner), I thought this place deserved my first yelp review. Here it goes:

Restaurant and Ambience: I have been to Goyemon more than 6 times for AYCE. Each time, the restaurant is fairly busy and full. For a party of six, I had to wait about 45 minutes for a table. Bathrooms were always clean and the sword on display above the toilet is pretty cool. The menu is similar to that of SushiMon on Maryland because they have the same owner. AYCE is everything on the menu, the specials on the chalkboard, as well as the ones on the placemat. What I love about this sushi place is that you are able to do half orders of special rolls which gives you more opportunity to try different rolls without pressure of over ordering.

Sushi: My favorite special rolls are the Lemon roll, Pastel roll, and Crunchy Rice roll. Each one has a distinctive flavor characteristic to the roll, which is nice because I've been to some sushi places (great sushi) but the rolls feel heavy and complicated. In these, you taste the fish and the ingredients compliment each other. For dinner, I also order the grilled cajun salmon and pork belly. Did I mention that dessert is AYCE too? Not only mochi, but red bean or lychee sorbet, fried tempura ice cream, and specials like the chocolate mousse. They have hot green tea but it tasted more like hot barley tea, which I didn't mind because I love barley. Service was friendly and prompt tonight. Food came out reasonably fast for bulk ordering. There were some slow points.

Overall: I keep coming back to this place with occasional visits to try out other sushi restaurants. The nigiri fish are a bit smaller for my liking and tonight, it wasn't as moist as the last time I had tried them. I don't find their appetizers ""craving"" worthy although they are decent. The grilled salmon are also ordered by piece and their about the size of your thumb. It 's not comparable to the grilled slab you get from Yama sushi. I guess I just have a problem with portions, but I overall like the place enough to be a regular.

IF you want to become a regular, ASK FOR A STAMP CARD! It works for Sushi Mon too and the 11th AYCE is free. Yay free sushi!",4,2,2

Good quality fish for an AYCE and they don't pack the nigiri with big blocks of rice....but no sashimi available here.  I honestly don't know much about the rolls...since I tend to be a pure fish lover....versus the cream cheese\/avocado\/mayo\/etc mixed into the rolls. My favorite nigiri is the salmon belly, white tuna, unagi, and toro...don't forget to check out the blackboard near the cash register...it has the specials for the day!

Similar menu to Sushi Mon off Maryland Pkwy...with the exception of special dishes like the spicy tuna rice cracker and the seared pork belly....I literally will eat 2-3 orders on my own to the disgust of those around me...but I think buffets should definitely be a no judgment zone .....I will gladly admit I wear my ""elastic band pants"" for all you can eats...don't want any buttons holding me back =)

Dessert is awesome with selections of tofu cheesecake, green tea creme brulee, green tea cake, red bean\/green tea ice cream, mochi ice cream.

Only minor complaint...some items have been ""unavailable""...specifically  the lychee sorbet and the yellow tail collar which is succulent morsels of fish with ponzu suace, A MUST TRY that is if they have it....so maybe leaning towards a 4 star rating compared to the first time I went there....due to some missing items.",3,5,3

My hubby and I stopped in here last night after the movies.  We made the choice to come based on the fact we'd heard they stay open so late and seeing as it was already close to midnight, it sounded perfect.

When we arrived, we were greeted so pleasantly by the host.  There wasn't an empty table in sight as I've experienced with most AYCE sushi places, but geeez, even at midnight?!  I shouldn't have been surprised :)  We were promptly seated at the bar where I had a great view of the chefs preparing yummy sushi masterpieces.  Unfortunately (for me), I'd already eaten before the movie (and boy did I EAT!), so I didn't feel prepared for AYCE.  Their menu has a lot of variety, however, so I didn't feel left out and deprived for long.  I decided on the ahi poke salad, which was great!  My husband, of course, went with the AYCE and he was pretty impressed.  His favorite was the rainbow roll.

I've never sat at the bar of a sushi place...crazy, considering how many times I've eaten sushi.  There is something VERY pleasant about watching the rolls being prepared and interacting with the chefs (who, by the way, are so ridiculously friendly and attentive at Goyemon).

Got the AYCE here and it was spectacular. They have a ton of specialty rolls, (TWO PAGES IN FACT) with all of their descriptions on the menu AND pictures of each one on a separate, laminated menu. All the rolls looked absolutely delicious and I was lucky to try many of them. I got a perfect seat in the bar right next to the sushi chef so my food came out quickly and I was able to get everything exactly the way I want it. 

I highly recommend the ecstasy roll, the sweet shrimp unagi, and the volcano roll. They do not skimp out on the quality of the rolls even if you go with AYCE. The rolls are big and will fill you up real quickly if you do not pace yourself. There are SO many choices too, so come in being prepared to choose decisively so that you can get your food sooner.

Their desserts are also pretty bomb here as well. I talked with the chef and he told me that they have the only lychee gelato around. I ordered that and the green tea brulee. Both desserts were incredible, but I especially loved the green tea brulee. It wasn't overly sweet and I loved the green tea flavor and crispiness of the top.

Service: 
First of all, the it isn't even busy, yet the front girl is having a horrible attitude. She didn't greet me, just stood there and told me' you can sit after the bus boy clean that table'. ( the bus boy is actually the only one who is doing excellent job! Kudos to you!) The rest of the meal the girl didn't speak any words to me. When I waved to her asking for miso soup, she grunted 'mm' and walked away silently when I said thank you. Everyone's face is like today is a shitty day.  

Food: 
Horrible food. Undercooked over-sourish rice is jammed pack under warm, dry, skimpy fish. The miso soup I got was basically hot water! I have never seen such transparent miso! Super amazed! The wasabi and ginger maybe had been left outside on the counter since yesterday night. And since I'm writing this review while I'm still sitting here eating, I'm proud to tell you their rice is now even HOTTER! And most of the table left with only few rounds of order. My huge glass of water ( I usually don't finish my water but I had been needing them to wash down some very weirdly strong flavored food) has been empty for 15 min. I seriously almost cried when I bite in to one piece of octopus thing. The only edible thing I got was the mochi ice cream.

The rolls are delicious, and the option to order half-rolls is VERY helpful is you want to try a vast variety of rolls. The servers are usually attentive; however, they can seem a bit surprised if you can eat sushi like you're a human vacuum.

I also enjoyed the side dishes. My favorite is probably the pork belly. The dessert is also unlimited (surprise, surprise), and you cannot go wrong with Mochi Ice Cream or the Lychee.

This place had very high expectations and anticipation from me. Not only because of the amount of praise it generates but i is also the sister sushi-house of Sushi Mon which is located on Silverado Ranch Blvd and Maryland Parkway. However, based on what all my friends told me and all the yelp reviews, it seemed pretty decisive that Goyemon had an edge. Only for me to say HELL. NO.

I came here on a quiet Saturday afternoon with two friends who I picked up from the airport. We began with the classic yellow-tails and Volcano Roll. I understand that volcano roll can take a little while but really, 20 minutes...? Especially when there's maybe like 3\/4 occupancy in the restaurant, you would expect much quicker. I mean, don't get me wrong, the quality of the roll was amazing, but to take 20 minutes is no justification. I'm a hungry guy, when I'm in an atmosphere such as AYCE, I'm there to be in for the kill. 

Right after the Volcano Roll, I asked for the ecstasy and philadelphia roll. Note, everything I order is half rolls, not full. I like diversity over quantity. This time, it took somewhere from 10-15 minutes..... COME ON. These chefs are professional and I understand that they can be under duress but I'm SURE that this joint has been under far more pressure ever than by one single person with that being just me. How can it take nearly 40 minutes to make 3 half rolls???? I can run to the strip and back in that time. (Ok not really). Then I just ordered the sunrise and sexy girl rolls and after that, I was way too frustrated with the incompetency of the services so concluded with my mochi and green tea ice cream. And no, it's not because of the chefs. The table next to me which had one less person ordered rolls later than me and received them before me. Not to mention, they are FULL rolls. NOT HALF. If anyone can PLEASE give me a logical explanation for the terrible service, I will be happy to give you my stamp card which is at 10, making my next visit free. 

Yet, for a tab at $70, my friends and I ended up paying $10 for service. Obviously they feel the need to tip just because they feel bad. But I don't feel bad. Feeling bad is for all the hungry kids around the world. Their terrible service may be explained that they like to stall me so that my stomach can process foods faster and make me full quicker. But that's why I'm here because I'm going to fight it if I have to. They may have done this so that my stomach can process the foods faster and to make me full quicker. Nevertheless, a business tactic that I don't appreciate because they don't appreciate my business. 

Make no mistake, this review is subject to change because I do hope that they can make up for their stupidity. The food quality is the cream of the crop. But if they choose to fail me next time in serving me, I will pay the price and no tip. Then I'll never return, only to keep my commitment to Goyemon's sibling, Mon.",6,3,1

My friend and I were waiting for our appointment at a nearby salon, so popping in for a quick bite to eat seemed the best option.

To start, there wasn't a wait to sit at the bar, and we were there during the lunch hour, so that was a plus. My friend opted for a beer, while I got the 2 roll lunch special (shrimp tempura rolls). The server was friendly, and quick, we did not have to wait long for our orders.

My meal came with miso soup, a salad, and the shrimp tempura rolls that I ordered. 
For the price (less than $10), this had a great deal, as I ate enough to fill me up and still had some left over.

The food itself, was good, but not astounding as I was under the impression that it would be. Granted, I ordered a shrimp tempura roll, but I felt that the taste itself was on the bland side. Generally, whenever I've had shrimp tempura rolls at other establishments, there was more of a robust shrimp flavor. Perhaps it was a difference in seasoning used, but it just didn't hold true to the flavor that I normally expect of this roll. The miso soup was good, hot and tasted as I expected it to. My friend ate the salad, so I don't have feedback on that, but it looked appropriately seasoned.

3 stars for today's experience, the staff was friendly, but perhaps my expectations were too high, as the food itself was not as tasty as I hoped it would be.",1,0,0

First of all they have no egg rolls... Says it on the menu but they don't carry them ....however  Here is my main problem with this place... 

It's owned by SushiMon which is an absolute terrible sushi restaurant in Henderson it's so so terrible in fact they had to make a new one name it this and make an entirely new website about it to get far away from the name of sushi that sushimon messes up on ... 

The major problem I have with them is they are extremely unorganized and do not show any kind of professionalism which is why I swore I would never eat there again...

However Goyemon suckered me in and made me eat a SushiMon Product... which kind of made me mad as I was pretty darn disappointing with what was being presented and asked if they had any other restaurants in the area and that's when that bomb was dropped on me.

As far as the pictures on their website goes I'm not sure if they hired a food artist but what those pictures portray versus what you get is night and day and I would have rather eaten the food during the night... in PITCH BLACK DARKNESS so I didn't have to look at it as it had absolutely no visual appeal but it tasted ""okay"" since I was starving and had just got finished watching drifting at the motor speedway OK back on track..(hah!)... The Tuna Poke was grey and the chicken teriyaki looked like the yolk of an egg after it was boiled...it looked rather sickly ... the rolls are over-sauced with a whole bunch of stuff that doesn't allow you to taste any of the fish quality, which ... is probably a good thing... I used a lot of wasabi while partaking in their fare just in case something was sitting out too long somewhere.  

The reason why I gave this place 2 stars is simply because their lychee sorbet was phenomenal and I loved it... It was the saving grace... Other then that I was sorely disappointed to find out that this was just another SushiMon wrapped in new clothing to try to hide the garbage that their flagship created...",4,3,2

Goyeman was very good. The taste, quality and wide selection of sushi met my expectations as you fellow Yelpers have reviewed. My wife and I both got the AYCE. I got 3 specialty rolls, 2 nigiri, and 3 side dishes including ice cream tempura. The wife got 3 specialty rolls as well. 

I have eaten at a couple AYCE sushi spots in the valley but my wife had never been with me. When we go to buffets she tends to like to sample a bunch of different things and often leaves some on the plate if she didn't like it (and YES I get on her about wasting food). Anyways, Goyeman BLEW MY MIND when they charged her extra for NOT finishing her rolls. So 2 of the 8 piece rolls she ate 4 pieces of each. So in addition to the AYCE price, they charged us the 1\/2 the price of each roll. I've never seen anything like it in my life! I thought the waitress was messing with us until she pulled out a little plastic card by the menus and it outlined the same. 

I don't eat anything with cheese or mayo so I couldn't touch them. I would have eaten them and saved us the additional $10 if I could. 

When that happens they let you take the additional pieces home. We were going to run some errands when we left and it was 98° today so taking the sushi with us did us no good and it was thrown away 2 hours later.

If I find out other AYCE sushi spots in the valley do this strange charge thing, I'll come back and change my review to a 5. But I did not appreciate paying more for rolls we didn't eat. One of them, she legitimately didn't even like. So because you order it you gotta pay? I just can't wrap my head around it...

Well it was not so busy and we got seated right away. Our server was an Caucasian guy which is not a problem, the problem was that he never smiled once. Yes he did his job but a smiling face goes a long way towards customer service in making you feel good dining at the establishment. 
The asian waitstaff was much better in the fact that she smiled and actually help a conversation with me, wow can you believe that!!!!! 

Now for the food, it was good and for sushi per say how can you really screw up on certain items like Ikura (salmon eggs), massago (fish eggs), pretty standard items that you buy from the wholesalers and you don't do anything but serve it.

For the Fresh fish, well it's another story, had the poke hahahaha it was good tasting but really, 4 pieces of fish at this size 1\/4"" x 1\/4"". Now I know it's all you can eat and trying to control waste but I think it's a little too skimpy on the fish for the poke.

Over all it was good, love the fact that they do the sushi correct with the correct amount of rice and not try to fill you up with oversize rice portion.

The only issue was the seating, which is always a challenge at a small restaurant. The tables are very close and the one next to us had a family with a whiny young child who would screech loudly for no obvious reason.

My favorite thing about the AYCE menu here is the endless dessert items you can order!!! I believe they're the last ones that will let you go all out on dessert items. 

The service is mediocre as they seem to have their good and bad days. They're able to handle small and large groups without that many problems. The service has been usually great, some days it seems slow though. 

The quality is pretty good. I have no complaints. They're definitely on par with Sushi Twister which is my favorite as far as nigiri sushi goes. I don't really go for the rolls so I can't really comment on those, but based on what my friends say when they order it from time to time, they're good as well. They do not put wasabi in the nigiri that I know of. Well at least the stuff I've ordered they haven't put any of it in, which I'm happy about. No surprises waiting for me when I take a bite! 

Their appetizer menu is good, I don't really like the gyoza as it tastes like one of the ones I try to avoid at the grocery stores. I usually get edamame, miso soup, and a LOT of vegetable and shrimp tempura if I order from the appetizer menu, but I haven't been ordering those as of late.

I live in Seattle now, but since my parents still live here I still come to visit ALL the time. And each time, I'm like ""maybe I should try a new sushi place"" and I do! But then, they never quite stack up to Goyemon. 

Here's the thing, I don't think that Goyemon has the best side dishes. Maybe not even rolls. But if you're a raw fish or a nigiri lover like me --- Goyemon is the place for you. By far the freshest tasting raw fish I've had at an AYCE place.

---albacore and salmon on point. As any sushi restaurant should. So fresh. And doesn't overdo it with the rice. Omg.
---fresh scallop melts in your mouth and has a hint of lemon. Omg.
---halibut has a slightly thicker texture like squid so it has the perfect amount of chewiness while not being overwhelming. Omg.
---super white tuna is just so melty and wonderful. Not overly fishy. Perfect. Omg.

I'm like dying. Can someone just take me to this sushi restaurant already?

As for rolls I like to get:
-sunrise bc it has so much flavor to it. It's not heavy. It has a light citrus taste to it, and you can really taste all of the ingredients including the rawfish.
-Goyemon style lasagna bc I like to eat some heavy food too. I like variety and if you get a half roll of this, the melted cream cheese isn't overwhelming.

I can't believe this is the 3rd Japanese restaurant in this location in 5 years. To go from Sushi Hana to Shin to this. Goyemon has by far the best decor of the three. Sushi Hana just had these gross green painted walls and an old ass TV showing ESPN for chrissakes! 

Along with your usual suspects for nigiri and rolls...they have a ton more including daily specials. Highlights included their inhouse smoked salmon (smokiest salmon ever!), big eye tuna nigiri and ""kobe"" beef nigiri although the beef being kobe was highly suspect. No big deal. Pork belly was like the best piece of bacon ever. 

I also like how yellowtail collar (1 order per person) is on the menu. So good! Its like a super meaty fish chicken wing kinda sorta. A must.

But the reason for my review & five stars was the sushi chef my boyfriend and I had for the night named Gian. Once we were seated, he greeted us asking if we've dined with them before. After a few moments of looking at the menu, we knew what we wanted to order. 

- Ecstasy roll
- Lemon roll
- Jala Jala roll (1\/2)
- 911 roll (1\/2)
- Salmon nigiri
- Tuna nigiri
- Yellowtail nigiri
- Amaebi nigiri
- Miso soup
- Octopus poke
- Baked mussels
- Garlic edamame

During us ordering, Gian asked if we've ever tried the yellowtail w\/ ponzu & jalapeños or garlic tuna nigiri, to which we responded no. But we agreed to try because he mentioned it was his personal favorites. 

Both of his recommendations were great! It took the simplicity of the nigiri and kicked it up a notch. Between my boyfriend & I, I think I can speak for the both of us that if between those two recommendations if you pick just one to try... Go with the yellowtail w\/ ponzu & jalapeños. It's a mix of flavors that blends so well & no matter how much of it you eat, it's not an overpowering flavor. 

We've been to Goyemon a lot. There is almost always a long wait because of how busy they are and sometimes we don't get checked on as much because of the traffic, but sitting at the bar that night really made us appreciate our dinner & the chef for anticipating our needs.

We had a large group and were told it would be an hour wait (we entered around 5:30PM but were not seated until 6:30PM). The restaurant is not that big so I can understand having to wait but we ended up being seated in a side room, so I'm not sure why they didn't just open up the side room earlier.

The restaurant is clean and has dark walls\/tables. Service is okay, but it can be hard to flag down a server later so definitely place large initial orders\/ask for what you want early on. There is a one-hour time limit I believe, but don't know how strictly it is enforced.

We had a large group and some of our food orders got confused; either things didn't come or came really late\/in different waves. Not a huge issue, but just something to be aware of if you have a large group too.

The AYCE dinner price is $26.95 per person, so not totally sure it is worth it. Sure, there are a bunch of rolls, but not as many appetizer\/side\/dessert items as another AYCE sushi place I've been to in Vegas. Quality is not bad though, and you can order half-orders of rolls too.

There is definitely a large selection of sushi that you can order and other food items that you can order.  I would suggest trying to come a little bit earlier since it can get very crowded and the wait tends to be fairly long. You can put your name down and come back (or they will call you when your next on the list). They do have a time limit on the AYCE (one hour) to limit the time that you sit and increase the turnover of patrons.

Some of the better sushi pieces - yellowtail, salmon, super white tuna, albacore, and halibut. You can also get uni and sweet shrimp in the AYCE but it is also limited to one order (two pieces) per person. 

I'm also a fan of some of their appetizers - poke, seaweed salad, pork belly, and baked green mussels. 

Overall, we have started to come here for AYCE more often as long as we don't have to wait more than 30 minutes (which on occasion does occur).

It even includes AYCE dessert: Green tea ice cream, lychee sorbet (AMAZING), tempura vanilla ice cream. They also have green tea creme brulee, but they limit it to one order per person.

Service:
Wow the staff here are quick! I came with a group of 9 and they brought out everything with alarming speed. I guess it's expected because they only gave us a 1 hour time limit on the AYCE.",3,1,1

We arrived at about 6:40pm and no need to wait. I think it's because we came in January which is not peak season that we were lucky to have all we wanted and the food quality was wonderful.

sweet shrimp and uni are limited for one order per person. Very fresh! Uni is so good and just melt in my mouth! 

For nigiri, we ordered white tuna, salmon, yellowtail, blue fin, gigantic octopus. All are good!

I found that they will serve grill things faster. So I ordered many things on special menu, which are all good. Grilled Kama is must try. It's the most tender part of a fish. 

The only disappointing part is rolls. The hurricane roll is not the same as I had before in other places and please get away from it.",1,0,0

From what I know, the point in a timed AYCE restaurant is to get full before the time limit is over. We were given our food at a slow pace, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing as we were allowed time to digest the food and thus try more on the menu. Then we saw food on the specials menu and realized that it was also included in AYCE.

I am warning you from this point on that the dishes from that menu may or may not come at all. We wanted to try the items from the menu after our last round was over and thus ordered everything listed. We waited for over 30 minutes (can you believe it??) and the food still didn't come even after constant reminders to our waiter (he was new at the time but this is still a very costly mistake even for a newbie). It didn't take until our 4th reminder to the manager at the time for our food that she apologized to us saying that the chef at the time who creates the specials has left. 

This is what I don't understand. If that certain chef at the moment is the one doing the specials, shouldn't all the chefs know of how to make it. On the other hand, if it is entirely a chef special dish only, then those items should be erased from the board IMMEDIATELY. We had our hopes up, waited an extremely long time, only to be disappointed. Because of such a long wait, all the food we originally ate all digested and we were hungry once again!!

The manager told us that we are free to order as much as we want and we will not be penalized for time. However, some people have places to go to and cannot sit down at a restaurant all day and wait for food to come at such a slow pace. This is definitely not an all-you-can eat experience where you will be left full and pleased, even with quality food. Quality service is just as important.",8,6,5

Far from it, the best I've ever had was probably made in my school's dining hall - sad, I know. But when my brother and his friend decided to go to Sushi House Goyemon, I had to go.

We all decided to do the the AYCE, and from the taste of the appetizers, I was glad we did. From the Spicy Tuna Rice Cracker (rice deep-fried then topped with spicy tuna and yum yum sauce) to the Seaweed Salad to the orgasmic Pork Belly, I was in love at first course. Then, within 2.5 seconds, Katrina M. and my brother ordered nigiri in endless quantities - some of the standouts were the Garlic Tuna (an absolute favorite), Super White Tuna, Eel, and the Scallop. All of which were incredibly fresh; if it weren't for Vegas being landlocked, I could have sworn the Uni was plucked straight from the sea. As for rolls, we ordered the Lemon Roll, which was perfect in all of its citrusy lightness.

Dessert was not even the end of it! With options of Green Tea Creme Brulee (though I am not as convinced on it as my brother is), Mochi, and Green Tea Cake, my absolute favorites were the Lychee Sorbet and Tofu Cheesecake. The former is light enough that I can justify ordering two bowls. The latter combines my two favorite things in the world into one non-guilt-inducing dessert! With the tartness of the mangoes, I can't help but feel okay eating the Tofu Cheesecake - hey, at least I'm eating some fruit too!

Goyemon is certainly smart - not only is AYCE 27 dollars and worth every penny in quantity and quality, but it doesn't mess around with the nonsense of being open for lunch. Dinner only means by an hour of being open, the place is already packed, and there's a line forming. Thank goodness for such a timely brother, we always manage to arrive right after they open and miss the treachery of waiting for such deliciousness.",0,0,1

We ate at the bar, and only received at least 1 to 2 plates at a time, no more than that. We had to order the same nigiri 3 times until he finally made it after my friend looked straight into his eyes. Paid for the bill as we where soo annoyed.

Rice to fish ratio: I would say the sushi chefs here use too much rice to fish. This was extremely evident in the rolls. I felt like I was eating a roll of rice garnished with a little tiny bit of fish. It's safe to say they are trying to fill you up with rice. 

Fish quality: the quality of the fish was decent but not great. I'm a huge nigiri fan because It really enabled you to taste the quality of the fish. Not impressed. 

A good indicator of a decent sushi place is the salmon nigiri. It's such a simple piece but contains such a beautiful intricate balance. From my first bite, I knew I would rate this place no better than 3 stars. 

There was a few bright spots however. The super white tuna was excellent. They offered half rolls which enabled me to sample a bit. The sexy girl is a solid choice and the red dragon was good.",1,0,0

(see my review for the event), Eric R. bugged me to return here for dinner.  We arrived on Saturday around 7 and were seated immediately at the bar.  The AYCE is an amazing deal, as it includes the specials on the daily special board, grill items, salads, rolls, nigiri, and all sorts of other things.

Some of the new things I tried included the grilled tofu which was quite tasty and amaebi shrimp head miso soup.  The shrimp were a bit harder to eat since they were not fried, but the flavor of them in the broth was good.  The mackerel was cured wonderfully.

Since we were at the bar, we had a nice view of the crazy action here.  We were taken care of by 4 different sushi chefs, and it took me awhile to even start a conversation with Chef Jun, a real Japanese chef yay!, in front of us.

However, the biggest disappointment is the rice.  Sushi is all about the rice.  The volume of this restaurant is huge because of the crowds, and the rice is not acceptable for sushi rice.  First of all, it was HOT.  I am talking just made, no cooling\/fanning and hardly any vinegar\/seasoning.  HOT rice with ice cold fish tastes bizzaroooo.  It ruined the meal.  I noticed the first time we ate here that the nigiri slices were all out of whack.  Because of the volume, the slices are not cut with precision but with speed.  I watched the chefs cut awkward nigiri slices that barely covered the hot rice.  

Eric R. asked Chef Jun about the rice.  He said they have such a demand that they just use hot rice, and he apologized because he knows it is just like sushi faux pas 101...most sushi restaurants I have been to make rice in advance.  As someone who learned how to make the rice from a local Japanese market recently, I know that it requires 45 minutes to an hour of fanning and cooling prior to serving, and that is for my small batches (3 cups at a time).  Though there is a lot of variety and I have no complaints about the service or quality, I could never enjoy hot rice touching cold uni or cold amaebi or cold hamachi...you get the idea.",8,1,4

I was so so so excited to come here as it was to be one of my top priorities in my trip to vegas the past weekend. But..

Wow. I was so disappointed. The amaebi here was what i was looking forward to the most and it was a big let down.  When our order came out, there was 4 pieces as we each ordered one. Each of 3 of them were a piece of shrimp cut in half and put on separate rice as if to make it look like one whole nigiri. I knew this because one of them had a full shrimp on it and the comparison next to the three miniscule pieces was extremely noticeable.

Its an AYCE restaurant yet they limit certain items to one order per person only, which I do understand some items are more expensive but it really isn't AYCE if you think about it. And was precisely why it was more irritating because if I was able to get AYCE amaebi, I would've been fine with those pieces. But if we're getting only one time to order this, I expect it to be full pieces. It doesn't even have to be a fat piece of shrimp. It's just incredulous to me the fact that they shamelessly use half pieces and try to pass it off as if its meant to be.

When I asked the server about it they brought it back to the kitchen saying they would fix it. Couple minutes later they bring out the same plate and it looked exactly the same. I didn't want to make a big deal and just decided forget it. Was thinking to myself they didn't change it, when the server comes over 5 minutes later to explain that they didn't change it because it's AYCE and the pieces are set already for AYCE and that if we were to order amaebi off the AYCE menu separately, the pieces would be bigger. Which made absolutely no sense to me.

All the other food we ordered was forgettable, and also a huge decrease in size and quality. Which was not the case 2 years ago or else I wouldn't have been dying to come back. Oh yeah, and the green tea creme brulee that was supposed to have a thin layer of burnt sugar covering the entire top of the custard had about a fingernail size worth of that. So you're basically just eating custard if you order that, not creme brulee.

Before coming here, I was a fan of Yama Sushi, which is still really yummy, but now that I've been introduced to this place, I don't know...I think I might have to come here now rather than Yama.  

We arrived with a party of  6 and the hostess told us it would take about an hour and 15 minutes or so.  The place is small with a main dining area and two larger tables to the side of the restaurant for larger parties.  We ended up waiting about 50 minutes or so, which wasn't too bad!  There are a few tables with chairs outside so you can sit back and kick it.  

Now onto the food... portions of their nigiri are smaller than what I'm used to in regular sushi restaurants, however, I think it's the right portion because it's not overwhelming and it makes you want to order more.  Fish is fresh and delicious..melts in your mouth taste, which is awesome, rice on the nigiris, perfectly packed and does not fall apart when dipping into soy sauce, this alone deserves a single star.  Sushi rolls were amazing to taste and the the size of the rolls were pretty generous.  My favorite would have to be the spider roll and dragon roll.  I had to get two of the spider rolls because it was that good.  They made it fresh so the soft shell crab came out nice, warm and crunchy.  Price came out to be about $34\/person, which is not bad depending on how much you plan on grubbin'!  When we come to sushi places where it's AYCE, we always try to get the bang for our buck.  I definitely can't wait to come back here on our next trip to Vegas.  

Staff was friendly, food came out quick, prices are affordable for AYCE,  bathrooms are clean.  I really enjoyed my experience here!  

Desserts...I had the vanilla mochi and it was nothing special.  I wish they had more flavors of the mochi rather than just vanilla and strawberry.  I could really care less about the dessert though cause really it's all about the sushi here.  Yummy in my tummy!",0,0,1

He was hanging out at the computers or walking in circles the entire time!  We had to keep calling the host over and she just kept apologizing for the horrible service.

Lowkey thats a dealbreaker for me but my friends wanted to try this place.  Apparently their freezer was broken which is understandable like shit happens but then our server seemed mad from the moment we started ordering? 

Their salmon nigiri was good BUT it felt warm to me. Maybe because of the rice i dont know but i just wish the fish was colder. There was two occasions where they gave us food that we did not order, but luckily my friends were down to eat it anyways. 

They had some good rolls but nothing I tried amazed me. My favorite is the magma i think its called. I kept calling it magmar lol. I always try the salmon skin hand roll at every sushi place i go to and it was not good here. Our food was taking forever to come out.

What I like about this place is that the fish is very fresh. Can I can definitely tell with the Uni. At other places like Yama and sakana, the Uni is extremely bitter, and tastes like the ocean.  It's gross. But here, the Uni is slightly sweet, creamy and so so good. I ordered mine with a quail egg to add to the flavor. It's only one order per dinner though. Unlike other places, they don't do sashimi here. Just nigiri rolls appetizers and dessert. But the nigiri is so fresh and this place by far gives you the least amount of rice. The ratio is very balanced so you don't feel like you're just stuffing your face with rice. 

Their rolls are less saucy here because I think the quality is much better. If you're s a small party, order half rolls so you can try multiple and don't get sick of one. Sometimes there's a wait but it's worth it. Staff is friendly tend to your needs. The high notes for me were the salmon, Uni, and white tuna!",7,0,3

- IMPORTANT: the dinner menu has a slightly bigger selection, most importantly pork belly, one order of sweet shrimp (amaebi) per person, and one order of sea urchin (uni) per person.
- service can sometimes be a pain, especially if you have a large group, you will be seated in a private room on the right with two large tables and have difficulty attracting the attention of your server
- TIP: in a group, don't order too much at once or else it will definitely take longer to get your food (i.e. 20 orders of nigiri per person in a party of 6)
- nigiri: garlic tuna, salmon, cajun albacore are staples, and their uni is also great
- rolls: to each their own, but beware the 9-1-1 IS pretty spicy
- no matter how full you are or how full you think you are, you'll have space for dessert. lychee sherbet is my personal favorite
- there are a bunch of AYCE sushi restaurants in Vegas, but I always end up gravitating back to Goyemon

The restaurant is located in a simple strip mall next to a Pizza Hut and a couple of foot massage spas (Las Vegas maybe the unofficial foot spa capital in the world) but the ambiance once inside is quite surprising.

Taste is excellent, Price is reasonable and Staff were pretty much on it with orders.

They have a wide array of choices including dessert (mochi & tempura ice cream). The Sea Urchin, Sweet Shrimp Nigiri (limited to two per customer) and unlimited Shrimp Tempura were a pleasant surprise for AYCEs of this price range. 

The locals who were with us however said that you have to be here early on order to avoid long lines.

We pulled up on a Saturday night at exactly 6pm. I was like, ""No cars, shouldn't be packed."" I walked inside to find a few people waiting and I proceeded to inform the hostess, two please. She said, ""Okay maybe 30-40 minutes."" Where in the hell are all those people waiting then? I didn't really see them or their cars. In actuality, the wait ended up being about 20 minutes. I did tell her we didn't care if it was the bar or a table. Plus, it was only two of us so that probably made things easier. The restaurant itself isn't that big to begin with. Also, the tables are small and in close proximity to one another. I could've practically reached over with my chopsticks to ninja that Cajun albacore sushi off the neighbor's plate if I wanted to. There were some nice flat screens on the walls, just in time for the NBA All-Star events.

I HIGHLY recommend you arriving early. Don't show up during crunch time and expect to be seated immediately. They NO LONGER accept reservations nor do I think they care if you carry a platinum player's card from one of the many prestigious casinos on the strip. You may want to ditch the entire posse because rolling deep here will probably mean a substantial wait time unless you come super early. This restaurant closes at 3AM and opens at 11:45AM so you have plenty of time to figure out when is best to stroll in.

Once seated, you have the option to either do the regular pay for whatever you order or go all out and hit the AYCE: lunch $22, dinner $27. Personally, we were there to make it rain. Here's the thing about AYCE especially when it comes to sushi, you must have a strategy. Now, before you all say that you hide the rice (which they repeatedly discourage it here; signs placed everywhere), that is not the only tactic to rely on. First, let me be clear when I say that they do not try to play you by giving a heap of rice. The rice portion for our sushi & rolls was actually quite minimal and I give them props for it. Most AYCE sushi joints as we know will load up with this lovely carb to get us full faster. If you attack all the crazy rolls they have, you will obviously get full fast. Luckily, for you they offer half orders on 80% of their rolls so you are able to try their many numerous rolls. Our first round, we attacked the sushi off the bat. I could've sworn, we ordered up to 8-10 nigiri sushi. Might as well test the quality of the fish.

The amount of food we ordered was tremendous even though it was just the two of us. Our small table was always cluttered or packed with dishes, either empty or full. Service was quite efficient. They constantly cleared out our plates, refilled our drinks, and the food came out in a timely manner. You have about an hour to do the AYCE I believe. Don't worry, it's plenty of time. Don't feel like you need to order everything in the first blow and gulp everything down. We probably ordered 4 or 5 times total and we still were able to somehow squeeze in desert before the hour ended. Before you kill everything in front of you, bust another order so that they can start making it and it'll be in front of you sooner to save time.

As I said, we ordered way too many different items that I can't even recall much in great details. Don't forget to check their specialty menu because it may change daily. They supposedly serve some soup noodles starting at 11pm. I guess to draw in the drunkies. 

Not everything was a thumbs up but I definitely thought that most of what we ordered was pretty good and fresh. If you love pork, get the pork belly appetizer. You will probably order a few. The spider roll was great but uber heavy and if I would've known, I would've avoided it so I can eat more of other things. Plus it's listed under the ""Can't order  1\/2 only"" section. Check out the Sexy Girl roll, that was one of the tastier specialty rolls. You will notice that there are many sexual inspired names for these rolls too. The miso soup was a bit bland. You can get the tamago sushi, sweet steamed egg without the rice which was really fresh and baked to perfection. The lychee sorbet and the green tea crème brulee was just alright. I wished I ordered the tempura ice cream or the always classy, green tea ice cream too but I was about to explode at that point. There were a number of other stuff we ordered but I'll leave the whole ""wanting to order everything on their menu"" experience for when you go check them out yourselves.

I would like to add though that their seaweed salad was very refreshing. We ordered it 3x!

I don't think you will be disappointed if you ate here. It was one of the better AYCE sushi joints I've experienced. You can't expect the bomb biggity bay at these type of AYCE sushi places but Sushi House Goyemon does an overall outstanding job in every aspect of the getting the job done.

Another pleasant surprise for their all you can eat menu is that there are items available from the grill.  I have had the grilled yellowtail and pork belly and both were very tasty.

I thought the previous restaurant was ok, but Goyemon is magnificent. Everything about it is upscale and almost sophisticated without being ridiculously priced. 

The tables are a little close together and it is easy to get caught up in another groups conversation. You should go with a mid size group of 4-6 to truly get the perfect dining experience. The menu for the all you can eat is extensive. To be able to get a full tasting you will need to share and split the duties amongst everyone. Goyemon does it's part by offering many rolls in a half portion size. 

Katrina M. and I stuck mainly to the nigiri. The best were the halibut, super white tuna, scallops, and uni. I will devour four orders of halibut by myself and it was better than most places. They use less ponzu sauce on theirs which gives me the impression that there is less to hide. The super white tuna was buttery and melts in your mouth. I am pretty sure I snuck a majority of them away when no one was looking. The scallops had a squeeze of lemon that accentuated the flavors of the shellfish. The sea urchin here is delicious. They were fresh, briny, and creamy.

We had quite a few cut rolls as well. They all tasted good, but I would stick to the nigiri. The lemon roll was one that stood out above the rest. During the meal, I had wanted to order the Sushi Monster Roll. By mid meal, I was getting too full so I forgot about it. A friend ordered it while no one else was paying attention. We got it as our last roll and regretted every minute of it. One piece is the equivalent of three normal ones. The giant roll has a condense deep fried fish center wrapped in seaweed, rice, soy paper and more rice. If you have a hard time with a spider roll avoid this one. I took the challenge and stuffed the whole piece in my mouth. It was not pretty. 

Save room for dessert, because it is all superb. The tofu cheesecake is rich and dense. You would never be able to guess that it was made of soy. The green tea creme brulee and cake has a mellow taste. If they allowed for it, I would do AYCE dessert.",2,1,2

Everything we ordered was amazingly fresh and tasty.  Definitely not the cheap sh*t. Love the ton of options and the grean tea creme brulee was a nice touch to end it all.  Service was also attentive and quick.  However,  the sushi to rice ratio is not that great here, but the freshness kind of makes up for it.  Just looked at my thumb and that's about how much rice you get per sushi (I have a medium sized thumb).  The fish on top is just a small sliver.

While I liked this place a lot compared to the other 4-5 AYCE sushi places I've tried in Vegas, there's still another AYCE sushi place in Vegas I enjoy a tad bit more.

I've never been to a AYCE where it's timed and good sushi, versus a.... buffet style.  So I was very surprised when we got to order whatever we wanted off the menu, and the specials board and paid a single price for it!

You got one order of uni for the AYCE, but it was made fabulously.

You basically make back your money if you eat three rolls or so.   Easy.  On top of that, it was so good, that I went back with a colleague a couple nights after the first time I tried it.

With 2 people, seating is pretty quick usually except when it's hitting on the weekends.  This place is actually pretty packed.

Harry is awesome (one of the sushi chefs) and made us everything we wanted although I got schooled a little for trying to order uni again - oops. haha.

I would really recommend the nigri sushi, even though the rolls are great because it's super fresh.

If you're pounding sushi, I recommend staying away from fried stuff as much as you can.   This has nothing to do with Goyemon's work (spider roll is YUM) as much as it fills you up, so you can't try as many crazy things.",2,0,1

They do have the policy of having you pay for things you don't eat, so be careful about ordering too much. It makes sense though because sushi is pretty expensive.
They have a huge variety of choices, but the stand outs were definitely the white tuna and salmon sushi. However, they don't have sashimi (in the all you can eat menu) and you get full off of the rice with some of their special rolls, as they pack in the rice into some of them. 
In any case, not a bad place at all. They only let you order the uni and the sweet shrimp sushi once because it's  pretty expensive, but that's ok because their other stuff is still pretty good =).
Stay for the mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream. Both are delicious! =)",0,0,0

First off, the waitress (Kate), seemed rude and bothered just by taking our order.  Which were only 3 rolls and 2 appetizers.  It took awhile to get our order, but we did not mind.  Meanwhile, another couple behind us had gotten up and left because their orders took so long to come out.  We didn't think much about it at the time, but we should have taken it into consideration.

The inside of the rolls were fine, but the amount of rice on them were ridiculous.  They packed on so much rice it seemed each roll had the equivalent of a small bowl of rice on it.  We were starving so we finished everything then we had to flag down the waitress to place another order because it seemed she did not want us to order anymore.  Since our first order took so long we decided to get 3 more rolls.  One of the rolls was the spider roll which only came with 5 pieces (boy, were we wrong).  When the orders came out we were taken aback by the size of the spider roll.  The diameter of the roll, no kidding, was 3-4inches!! It had so much rice on it.  The other 2 rolls had quite a bit of rice also.  So much so that the group next to us kept looking at our plates and commenting on how much rice were on the rolls.  We've eaten quite a few ayce and we have never seen a spider roll that large before or the amount of rice on a regular sushi roll.  We tried to eat all of it, but there was too much rice and we had to leave several pieces, plus it was already a little past 5 o'clock.  

Next, we asked for the bill.  We did not even order dessert because we were so full from trying to finish everything.  When the waitress came she said that we had to eat the remaining pieces of sushi or we would get charged extra.  Seriously?!! Was she out of her mind?  We had already tried to burst our stomachs trying to finish the rolls that were on rice steroids.  We told her there was no possible way we could finish the several remaining pieces.  She had the nerve to say, ""why don't you just eat these 3 pieces"".  Again seriously?! That was pretty much what we had left.  We had no choice but to ask to speak to the manager.  She told us we would have to wait 10mins.  We did not want to make a scene so we waited.  After 10mins , I was starting to get really upset so a male waiter (don't think he was the manager) came and asked if he could help us.  We asked for the bill and he said that we had to finish.  We explained to him that we understood their rice policy, but if they had put a normal amount of rice on the rolls it would not have been a problem.  I'm sure when he saw the remaining pieces he was also surprised by the amount of rice, because he said we can call it even and that next time please be aware of the policy.  He had the waitress get our check and to top it off, the waitress charged us for the dinner price which is $5\/person more than lunch. She knew we ate the lunch because she gave us a slip with the lunch time on it when we first came in.  So, again, we had to flag her down to get the bill corrected.  When we finally left it was close to 5:30p.    

I hope the several pieces of sushi with too much rice was worth it to Goyemon,  because there is no way that I will ever try this place again.  This place is definitely not worth it.",2,3,1

They have a huge assortment of rolls and make all kinds of nigiri. When it comes to seafood, there's not a lot that I'm willing to eat so I appreciate their large selection of menu items to choose from. I personally love their spider hand rolls, the sexy girl roll, and yellowtail (hamachi) nigiri. They also have specials written on the chalkboard for things like salmon collar and yellowtail collar which I highly recommend. 

When Goyemon first opened, they had some really unique appetizers and amazing desserts. Over the past year or so, these specialties have almost disappeared altogether. Their dessert selection is nowhere near as good as it used to be. They used to have things like green tea creme brulee and chocolate mouse in addition to the typical sushi house selection of ice cream and mochi. I know its a little silly call out a sushi place for its dessert, but it was one of the things that was great about this place that set it apart from its competitors. 

Anyhow, back to the sushi. They are a great option for AYCE (all you can eat). If you think you'll eat more than 2 orders of rolls, then you might as well go AYCE. It includes appetizers, all the nigiri, the rolls, ice cream, and mochi. 

As Goyemon is a very popular spot, the wait time for dinner can often be well over 30 minutes. If you come with a large group or eat here often, be sure to ask for a stamp card. From experience, I know you can use the stamp card at the two Sushi Mon locations as well. If the wait at Goyemon is too long, I'd recommend calling the Sushi Mon on Sahara and checking their wait time as the menus are exactly the same, though the specials might vary.",0,1,1

I had high expectations for Goyemon and they did not disappoint.I was pleasantly surprised to find that its actually a very nice sit-down restaurant. A little classier than most hole-in-the-wall sushi joints.

NIGIRI: They served large, dense cuts of fish of the freshest quality on their nigiri sushi. Good fish\/rice ratio.

ROLLS: They do half-rolls! Take advantage of this luxury! 

SIDE DISHES: I'm addicted to the baked mussels. Unfortunately, the only reason Goyemon isn't 5 Stars is because of the poorly made mussels. Not enough sauce and not enough flavor. The mussels are usually a bit fishy as well. :( Be sure to try the salmon collar, melt-in-your-mouth pork belly, & the tuna rice cracker. 

DESSERT: Goyemon has the best dessert selection out of all the sushi joints in Las Vegas. I had the tofu cheesecake and my friend, the tempura ice cream. You know how most places put a limit on just 1 dessert? Goyemon will give you as many as your heart desires.

Not great, nothing special, but good.  We did an AYCE double sushi date last night.  First, we waited for 40 minutes for a table.  At that point, we were super lucky it was all you can eat because we were ravenous.  

All the fish was fresh and tasty.  Everything was rolled nicely.  We were very happy.  The only dissapointed was the baked green mussels.  They were terrible.

I would go back if someone suggested it, but I certtainly wouldn't wait 40 minutes again for a table.  I think there are better places in Vegas. 

We tried just about everything...hamachi, snapper, smoked salmon, uni, scallops, mussels, yakisoba, gyoza, 2  salads, miso soup, crispy pork belly, tuna rice cracker, 7 rolls including sexy girl, 911 (habenero makes it super spicy with good flavor, a nice departure from the usual jalapeno) , sunrise,  frying jason, pastel, and so on.  

The service was nice and efficient and the punch card is an extra cool touch.

One really nice surprise is the variety of desserts offered.  The tofu cheesecake was extra delicious!",3,0,1

I feel that the fish here is much more fresh and they have better nigiri. Sakana has a better fish to rice ratio compared to Goyemon but the quality of the fish at Sakana isn't as good as it used to be. I feel that they drown all their fish in sauce to cover up that it isn't as fresh.

I always stick to nigiri at ayce places since I don't really like baked rolls or rolls in general. I'm in love their salmon belly , super white tuna , eel , cajun albacore , amaebi (sweet shrimp) , and fresh scallop nigiri here. Their sashimi salad , vegetable\/shrimp tempura , and garlic edamame are really good appetizers. Other ayce places don't really make tempura right but here it's on point. My favorite definitely has to be their dessert though. I love how there's ayce ice cream mochi , green tea & red bean ice cream , tempura ice cream , yuzu sorbet and creme brulee. Dessert isn't limited to one per person which is a big plus to me since half of what I eat is dessert anyways. If they had mini honey toast then it would be perfect.

The service here is alright. I used to work at an ayce place so I understand how hectic it can be. As long as the food here is excellent then this will still be my go-to place. Always get the dinner option over lunch (since more options available for only a few dollars more).",2,0,2

The first time I went, it was on a weekday night for dinner with one other person.  We both did the AYCE and the service was fine.  The next time I went was on a Saturday night with a group of about 8 people.  So, unfortunately, this review is going to be based on my second visit.

First, we called about 3 hours in advance to see if we could make a reservation.  The person who answered told my friend that they were booked until late that night, then asked how many were in our party.  My friend told her 8 and then she said they only made reservations for parties of 10 or larger, so my friend told her 10, then she asked what time we would like our reservation.  Huh, I thought you were all booked up?

Anyway, so when the reservation time came, only 4 of us had shown up on time.  The server was getting anxious and frustrated that the entire party wasn't there (as if that was our fault?).  I understand how the server was feeling as it is a small place, but there was definitely no line of people outside the door waiting to be seated.  Had there been, I'm sure we would have been a lot more understanding.  Plus, he was expressing his frustration to us, which I thought was inappropriate.  

This is where it gets good.  We finally had our 8 show up, plus an unexpected 1 after we had given away a two-top table (reserved as part of our initial ""10-person"" reservation).  The extra person had to share a seat with someone else and was never once offered by the server to grab an extra seat!  We had plenty of room in our area to accomodate this person, but instead, someone from our party had to grab a spare chair himself.  What the heck?!

Rolls were slow, but it was busy, so that was somewhat understandable.  I just don't understand how the server was getting so frustrated when we were all doing AYCE and some of us were ordering beers... I feel like he should have been pretty happy knowing that he would be making bank off of us. 

I would probably venture to say that almost everyone in the group was disappointed with the service and some expressed that by leaving a tip that was appropriate for such service.  The sad part is, the decision to go to this sushi joint was based off of a Yelp recommendation and my previous experience with the place, but only AFTER we had called Oyshi and were told that it was packed.  We probably would have had a better experience waiting at Oyshi!  This is definitely not the level of service I would expect from the same people who own Sushi-Mon.

The waiting area is small, but there is also space outside. They have a text system for your wait time, so that's great especially because there can be a long wait. We waited about 35 minutes on a Saturday night. 

Overall food was good, comparable to other quality sushi restaurants. We were sad that they didn't have any salmon belly but the fatty tuna belly was oh so delicious!

THE MEAT:  Hubby and I have swung by this place a few times but we weren't willing to wait an hour or two for a table.  MAHALO to awesome Yelper friends with hookups to a private room!  The sake options are awesome, and for $8, you can have a 3-shot sampler of any sake on their menu.  Their appetizer, sushi\/rolls and dessert offerings also give you a wide variety with no limits.  The must trys - pork belly (lots of melt in your mouth fat that works), salmon belly nigiri, salmon collar (they cook this beautifully - I believe it is a superior part of the fish), the ecstasy roll (albacore, tuna, seaweed, masago, yum yum sauce - all the flavors and textures were lip-smacking good), and yuzu or lychee sorbet.  We were underwhelmed by a few items like Cajun albacore (the fish and execution is exceptional in Sushi Koma, which also has a much better version of the scallop dynamite dish).  But on the whole, you get a great bang for your buck with quality ingredients, good service and varied quantity.  I've tried a lot of AYCE sushi in Vegas but Goyemon still remains the undefeated champion.  

I'M STILL DIGESTING... the fact that I didn't order more salmon belly.  Darn it.

Given that they do an AYCE, perhaps I shouldn't hold them to the same standards, but if I had to summarize the quality of my food in one word, I would choose ""cheap"".

The saving grace was the maguro.  It was fresh and a decent cut, and I liked the garlic tuna which was basically a ponzu sauce. The rolls were pretty involved and had a lot of stuff in it, if you're into the complicated and overly sauced thing.

The hubby and I went on a Tuesday night and we sat at the bar. We decided on AYCE and that is definitely the way to go. Price is standard at $26.95. 

We ordered side dishes first: grilled yellow tail collar, fried calamari, grilled pork belly and baked green mussels. Baked green mussels were good but not nearly as good as Sin City Sushi. We liked everything for the most part but the grilled pork belly is something special. The pork belly was juicy, flavorful and melted in my mouth.

We mostly stuck with nigiri and everything was fresh with not too much rice. The standouts for me were the super white tuna and snow crab meat. Our chef, Mike, suggested a variety of items to try and one of them was rice, raw quail egg and masago wrapped in seaweed. It was surprisingly yummy. 

The only roll we had lived up to it's name, Ecstacy Roll. I can't even remember what was in it but it was good! I like that you can do half orders.

What bumped this review up to 5 stars for me were the desserts. The hubby had the green tea creme brulee and I had the tempura ice cream. I wasn't too thrilled with the tempura because it was spongy and not at all crunchy. I did, however, eat most of the green tea creme brulee. It had a good consistency and right amount of sweetness. I still had a little bit of a sweet tooth so I ordered the lychee sorbet. It was so yummy and was a great way to cleanse the palette. 

A huge plus was the exceptional service. The sushi chefs were friendly and were gracious enough to suggest different things to try. Our glasses were always full and empty plates were cleared right away.

Had the spicy ass 911 roll and want to order an ice cream because 2 glasses of water, 3 packets of sugar, 3 bits of a spider roll, almost licking the plate the pork belly came from didnt work?? (true story) Well order some ice cream! It's dessert time and you've already ordered an ice cream? Well order some more ice cream! Damn that lychee sorbet hit the spot but you want another? Yeah you guessed it...order MOAR ice cream!!!

And the big ass list to get me some of those 'useful' clicks from you guys

Crispy Rice Cracker Spicy Tuna thingie
 - Oh man this was awesome, Crispy rice with spicy tuna on top with some sauce i think it was yum yum sauce drizzled on top oh lord this was good

Pork Belly
 - Being Vietnamese i've been eating pork belly most of my natural life...These grilled pork bellies are something else...Too much sauce on the pork belly? Still delicious. Not enough sauce on the pork belly? Still smokey grilled taste delicious

Deep Fried Prawn Heads
- If you like prawn heads then order a batch of deep fried prawn heads they are AMAZING. If you dont likek deep fried prawn heads order a batch for someone who does like prawn heads.

Reservations highly recommended if you have a party of 10 or more (that is the minimum for reservations). 15 to 20 for the Tatami Room. Check out their daily specials board.  Plum Wine Jelly is awesome, Lychee Sorbet makes a good palette cleanser between orders of sushi.

One the main reason that this is a great AYCE sushi dinner spot in Las Vegas, is that everything on the menu is AYCE (except sashimi).  That includes the daily specials board, the hot apps and dessert selections on the placemats.  All they ask is you finish what you order and not waste food.  Sounds fair to me!

I am not going to review every single item I have tried over the last dozen visits.  But as great as this place is to dine at, the experience can totally be improved if you got with a few friends.  At least this way you can try more things on the menu before you have to throw up the white flag, wiggle your tummy and find a little more room for the desserts.

Even if you are not into raw fish as some of your buddies are, there are plenty of cooked items available for you to order. You can dine here with your foodie buddies without having to feel left out.

The staff here is great!  Even when they are slammed (pretty much anytime after 7pm) they still managed to deliver on good or better service.  Just show up early or have some patience, as the average wait here for dinner is at least an hour.

Food: 4.5\/5 The food and the selection is very good.

Flavor: 4.5\/5 Overall very very good, although some nigiri are drenched in too much ponzu sauce.

Service: 5\/5 I have never had a bad experience here.

Decor:  4.5 Pretty trendy and there are decorative samurai swords in the loo.

Parking: 4.5\/5 The parking lot is not super big, but you can usually find a parking spot when you drop in for dinner.

Price:  4\/5  Comparable to other local AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.

Value:  5\/5  Only sashimi is not available as part of AYCE.  Their available selection is crazily extensive.

I did realize I had a stamp card from my first time here, this being my second time. Too bad the card expired since it had been 1.5yrs since my first visit. One year expiration, oh wells lol.
The place is fairly small. I can imagine during the busy times there might be a long wait. A plus is that it's open very late(3am) every day, even Sunday. The wait tonight wasn't too long, 20min. I could have sworn the dining time limit posted was 90min but it's 1hr now. I could be wrong and I'm not sure how strictly they enforce it.
All-you-can-eat(AYCE) is always the way to go! $27 for dinner here. I do remember the wonderful crispy rice cracker with spicy tuna on top of it. If the rolls look similar to Sushimon, I believe it's the same owners. I'm told they also own Monta Ramen. I had the seared salmon salad. The dressing was a bit salty. My sister HAD to order the Mahalo Roll, which is basically a spam musubi in roll form. Our hawaii roots hehe. Ordered cajun albacore & seared salmon nigiri. They were pretty small even for nigiri, with paper thin slices of fish. Those actually were pretty salty to taste too. That part disappointed a little since those are two of my favorite things to eat when having sushi. Ordered a few other rolls and appetizers. I also sampled others between the 3 of us. Rest were decent aside from the salty nigiri & salad.
Service was very good. When waiting for a table, they will take your number and call you when something is available. Our waitress was very attentive, checking on us often and refilling drinks and taking empty plates away.

We all opted for the ayce lunch.  We ordered multiple rounds of sushi and dessert, and the waitresses were very attentive and sweet.  The nigiri was fresh! Our favorites were the white tuna, scallops, quail egg, salmon, hamachi, and conch! One of us also ordered the ayce dinner, so they can get their one order of sweet shrimp and uni -- it was well worth it! The uni and ebi was sweet and yummy! The rolls were good, too! However, I love the raw stuff so much more, so my review is based on that! Everything had the right amount of rice, also!

AYCE also includes appetizers! We enjoyed the salmon kama, chicken teriyaki skewers, octopus poke, sashimi salad, and tuna poke!

OMG, dessert! It ended with few rounds of green tea ice cream, red bean ice cream, lychee sorbet, and strawberry mochi! The strawberry mochi was delicious!!!

I decided on Sushi House Goyemon after reading some good reviews and it was only 10 mins. from our hotel. 

Wanted to try and get there early since from reading the reviews they get busy. We actually ended up getting there about 1:30pm. I for sure thought we would have to wait but we actually got seated right away. Guess we got lucky in Vegas. Haha There were four of us, me,  my wife and our 2 boys (11 &  13).

We all had the AYCE except my wife. I thought the price was pretty reasonable for AYCE sushi. I was quite surprised by how many choices there was. From Nigiri, to rolls, to side dishes and even dessert all included in the price. Being that it was AYCE I pretty much went all out trying a lot of different things. I read on here you can order half rolls and that's what we did. I thought that was very cool. 

The quality is pretty good. Fish tasted fresh. The pieces were kind of small, but it didn't bother me. The service was good. Our server kept coming back to see if we wanted to order more items. My youngest didn't eat as much sushi as he normally does and our sever actually said she changed his AYCE to ala carte because it would be cheaper. Thank you. Saved me money so I can gamble more Haha. 

Overall I had a great experience. I love sushi and it was great not having to worry about what ""color""  plates we're all eating. lol I would definitely come here again the next time I'm in Vegas.

When ordering the nigiri I was appalled at how inconsistent the fish was cut and the fact that the rice was horrible. They know more practice the art of making a quality product, the evidence to that is a machine that lays out the rice for them so I can slap a piece of cheap nori on it and turned into a very substandard role.

You might think I'm being somewhat of a snob or a total dick to this place, but after having worked for three years in high end Japanese cuisine and seeing what is possible and also eaten at several other aw IC e.

I wanted to try the crispy roll and that wasn't good, pass on that roll (it's just a Cali roll deep fried). But they also emphasized how they're known for their nigiri, mainly the blue fin.

My server (older Japanese lady) was thee worst, very slow and short. And then when my bf asked if they do anything for birthdays, she said no. When bf responded saying ""well I saw people post on Yelp about a free t-shirt"" she said ""not anymore, we only give one free candle."" Then, the sushi chefs had another server bring out one free mochi and a t-shirt (thanks guys).

2. The rice on the nigiri's were thick, hard as if it was pre-made and sat out on a buffet line .  So, I ate everything sashimi style as I magically made the thick rancid and hard rice disappear.... :-) 

3. Fish quality wasn't bad. I really enjoyed that they have white fish on the menu and the scallop nigiri was amazing. 

4. Pork belly! Normally, I am a pork belly fanatic. However, I feel indifferent.  The meat and fat was really good and had a sweet flavor.  I think the skin could have been crispy to have that WOW factor. 

5. Crispy rice w\/ spicy tuna was good.  I enjoyed the crispy texture and the spicy kick to the tuna.

Sitting at a table is a terrible idea too since service is so slow and the servers screw up your order all the time.  We've been frequenting Goyemon for years and it has progressively gone down hill.  I feel it's finally time to say something. 

The freshness of the food has stayed relatively consistent.  One thing I must mention, and there is probably a direct correlation to the sushi chefs, is the quality of the rolls.  They look like a 2 year old made them.  Sloppy, ingredients falling out, rolls falling apart.  I can't even pick up a roll without it falling apart.  Sometimes way too much sauce and sometimes no sauce at all.  This situation is not just a one time ""off day"".  It's been at least three times.

The wait for a table was about an hour - we got half of the ""VIP room"" near the cash register as there were 6 of us.

I think we came at a good time, the fish was incredibly delicious. The pork belly, surf clam, octopus and yellowtail were the big hits of the night. I noticed however that the fish-to-rice ratio for some nigiri was a bit smaller compared with the last time I was here.

Gluten-free note: some of their nigiri (like the albacore and the seared items) are seasoned with ponzu sauce, which is a citrus-based soy sauce. Soy sauce normally contains wheat. We asked if they could leave it off, but the server said the sushi chefs prepare them in a batch with other people's orders and thus could not (or rather, would not) prepare it without the ponzu. Bah! 3 stars for this. I wonder if we had sat at the bar that the chefs could have done something.

Their dessert offerings for dinner seem to change. I remember the last time I came here there was a plum wine jelly. This time it was just the creme brulee and chocolate mousse, along with the ice cream.",3,0,1

A.Y.C.E. is definitely awesome for dinner as they have a good variety as well as daily specials which is always a plus!! The place is pretty small & there is pretty much always a wait when it comes to dinner time... I don't know if I have ever been here & there hasn't been a wait. For LARGE parties they do have a secret dining area as well which is a bit secluded which is nice especially when you try to talk amongst everyone in your group or your group is just darn routy ahahhaha

Service is pretty quick & they show you a good time... I say props for when I came to eat w\/ friends & they we're able to take care of all 20 of us smoothly & kept the food coming to feed 16 bois & 4 girls who were starving & came to chow down! *bravo*

Besides the A.Y.C.E. they have pretty good specials as well which is nice when you are not tryna eat a whale during the day time.

SUSHI DINNER $11.95 - you can choose from Cali roll or spicy tuna roll & then it comes w\/ 7 pieces of sushi (2 tuna. white fish. yellowtail. salmon. eel. shrimp) The combinations also come w\/ house salad & miso soup.

NABE YAKI UDON $11.95 - I got this dish & it came w\/ an order of Cali roll & house salad which was freaken awesome because I was totally only expecting to get the udon itself! Way to surprise the fat kid =] but it did say it on the menu.. I just didn't read it hahahah

OCTOPUS POKI SALAD $5.95 - pretty good & simple served w\/ seaweed salad & onions w\/ a sesame oil dressing.

frying Jason - baked scallop and crabmeat with special sauce and asparagus! yes asparagus. complements the other flavors really well

seared salmon and cajun albacore sushi - seared salmon has a nice splash of lemon, and the cajun spices flavor the albacore nicely.

lychee sherbet - best lychee flavored anything I've ever tried.  best dessert item on the menu.  great texture with even bits of lychee. Got 2 orders

Green tea ice cream - also got 2 orders alongside the lychee.  Perfectly bittersweet and creamy and balanced out the mild tart of the lychee.

TIPS: 
Come for dinner to get the good AYCE menu!! Menu encompasses one order of uni per person. It's nice that not everyone at your table needs to order AYCE. 

Came early for dinner to avoid the rush. There's not many tables inside so if you get here later, you'll be waiting a while.


FOOD: 
Oh man. So much good nigiri!
-- YUMMY Nigiri: Tuna, Uni, Yellowtail, Salmon, Seared salmon, Albacore, Unagi, Fresh scallop aka hotate, Salmon roe aka masago (and we added quail egg on top!), Amaebi aka sweet shrimp (came with the tails, which was a little awkward to eat). They also have a specials menu written on chalkboard so make sure to check that out. We tried the salmon belly, which was a little too fatty for my taste.
-- Wasn't a big fan of the Super white tuna 

-- I didn't do any of the rolls, because I just wanted all that fresh nigiri! 

-- Hand rolls: Salmon skin roll was okay, not much flavor.


DESSERT: Liked the lychee sherbet. Green tea ice cream was okay, I've had (and made) better.


SERVICE:
Ugh. Service pretty much sucked here, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. It took foreeeeverrr to get any of our orders and sushi, and the waitresses didn't come to check on us so we had to wave and hunt them down to get more orders in. 
Also, the sushi chef made one of my friend's hand rolls wrong TWICE!!! The waitress tried to argue with us until we showed her there was a shrimp inside instead of scallop. I'm really not sure how you mix up scallop and fake crab \/ shrimp....

The last place I had an all AYCE experience was over 4 years ago. So fast forward to Sushi House Goyemon. I just had to trust Yelpers on this one and gave it a try. I surveyed the menu. Made to order sushi that include nigiris? Check. Grilled items? Check. Specials like unlimited aji, salmon belly, & negitoro? Check. Unlimited desserts? Check. Apparently I've been missing out on the Las Vegas AYCE sushi scene. 

So I moved here in late August and I've been back for 4 times. Once I waited for 20 minutes. All the other times we've been seated right away at the sushi bar. For $26 per person (dinner), I'm getting WAY more than my money's worth. In fact, I tend to average around $80 every time I eat here, just on nigiris, grilled items, sides, & desserts. 

Four stars for VALUE. I knocked off one star just because the cuts of fish tend to be inconsistent and service can be spotty at times, but nothing that would deter me from coming back. - I was always satisfied with the quality of fish they serve (for an AYCE) Sadly, their uni is just so-so, so don't expect high quality stuff.

Came here for AYCE dinner based on the 1k plus four star reviews from yelpers however we were dismayed overall by the lack of taste in the various regular and special rolls that we ordered.  About the only thing that was decent was the miso soup and the uni which had a sweet taste to it.

I even ordered a Hamachi hand roll but it only had Hamachi (a good amount) but there was nothing else. So where were  the veggies? Pickled Daikon - nope, slices of avocado - nope, slices of cucumber - nope.  Both of us commented on the very chewy seaweed used for the rolls and in fact at one point, I thought I was chewing a piece of saran wrap and spit it out.

Service was four stars by the servers who took our order for the miso soup and other non-sushi items but one star for the non-Asian sushi gen who was not engaging and in our opinion made some sub-standard rolls as well as lackluster nigiri which for some nigiri items should have had some sprinkled garnish on top of the fish.

I should have done more research as I learned through googling afterwards that this location and Sushi Mon in Henderson are related.

This place had just opened for lunch on that morning, but it was almost filled to capacity with people seated at every turn. The sizable interior included a large sushi bar in the back, TV, and three rows of tables that spread across the floor. We were fortunate to snag one of the last tables that came with laminated menus. It took a while to get the server to come by our table, but the food was well worth the wait.

For $21.95 per person, the menu was extensive, and included a list of nigiri, hand rolls, specialty rolls, side dishes, and desserts. Among the nigiri, my favorites were the Fresh Snow Crab, Salmon, Seared Salmon, Scallop, Yellowtail, Halibut, Red Snapper, and Salmon Eggs with a Quail Egg on top. The quality of the rice was good with nice textures, and the sushi chef did an impressive job with ponzu and yuzu sauces to add excitable dimensions to the fresh fish. On the down side, the cuts of the fish were noticeably small, sloppy, and inconsistent between pieces. We were also initially disappointed at how small these pieces were, but this has allowed us to sample a wide range of specialty rolls. 

In particular, I enjoyed the Red Dragon Roll that came with spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, fresh water eel, and eel sauce on top. The sweet eel and avocado nicely intermingled with the spicy tuna. The noticeable crunch from the cucumber also rendered both freshness and texture. 

The items to avoid were the Poke, as freshness and texture were both disappointing to say the least. Similarly, the Surf Clam Nigiri also lacked the profile to worth the calories. The Jala Jala Roll sounded good on paper--with chopped albacore, cucumber, avocado, salmon, yellowtail, and jalapenos--but it turned out dry and could use a sauce on top. The Crab Meat Handroll was also another item to avoid, as the imitation crab lacked the right sweet profile, and without a second filling, the flavor was insufficient to stand on its own.

Service was a hit or miss, and a bit rushed without taking into consideration that we were first time customers, and needed time to learn how to best orchestrate a meal that works for us. Overall, we had three rounds of sushi, and despite the shortcomings, we rolled out of the restaurant thoroughly satisfied. Interested diners can expect casual dining atmosphere, decent to good sushi, good value, but feeling a bit rushed given how busy this place can get. Good enough to warrant a strong 3-stars recommendation. We hope to return for a better experience when traveling in the area.",24,16,20

There is a late night special, the Shoyu ramen is available after 11pm.  It is tasty.  There are other special items available throughout the day as well, look at the board.

Not really big on sauced-up rolls (which they also serve). Because of Goyemon, why would I go and overspend at places like Blue Ribbon Sushi? Most of the fish that comes to Vegas is frozen, right? They also claimed one night that their uni was from Santa Barbara. One order of uni per person for AYCE is still a steal!

We order shrimp tempura and supreme salmon without fail every time we come. The tempura is usually always really crispy, but today it was kind of mushy, and it fell apart as i dipped it into the sauce. It was still ok though. The rice today was just DEPRESSING. Usually the pieces are easy to pick up and there is no strong rice vinegar taste. The rice on both the supreme salmon and dragon roll tasted so strongly of rice vinegar that it reminded me of some cheap sushi place and literally made me lose my appetite. The pieces stuck together and stuck to the plate. Not to mention that the rice was mushy and cold. It felt like i was eating sour and sweet chewy clay. 
I hope this doesnt offend anyone who works there, but i do wish for someone to take this seriously and fix the rice. 


Update 01\/24
Someone fucked up the rice AGAIN. How can i eat this when there is too much rice and whatever they mix in there. Seriously, if the rice is fucked up just make it over again and provide the quality service you NEED TO PROVIDE. This isn't worth the money when all i taste is rice vinegar.

She took our order and got our drinks quickly. We started with garlic tuna, cajun albacore,  sweet ebi, and the tamago. The garlic tuna could have used more garlic as I thought the garlic was lacking. The cajun albacore was good. Tasted like some seasoning I had in my spice cabinet but good. The sweet ebi was also good. The tamago could be alot better, seemed as though the egg had been folded over each other to make the shape instead of being prepared that way to begin with.  We then moved on and had the orion, domingo, and the tiger rolls. The orion was good the cajun albacore made that roll spicy yet very tolerable, the domigo had to be my favorite.  The salsa that it was topped with was awesome and was a different twist from what ive had in the past. The tiger was ok. Nothing to crazy.  We then had the crispy rice, lasagna, and the spider rolls.  The spider roll was good. The soy paper was soft and the crab crunchy, very good! The crispy rice and lasagna was no spot light and was very heavy rolls with mayo, eel sauce, that just made the rolls not so appealing.

The red snapper tasted a bit dry and dense as though it had been left out and everything else was just so-so...I did get to top off my underwhelming experience with their melted then refrozen freezer burn mochi.

There's usually a wait but to me, they're worth it! The only I don't like is that their stamp card now has like a two month expiration on it.

My favorite rolls-

Lemon: California roll wrapped with yellowtail, salmon and sliced lemon drizzled with ponzu

Moon: Fresh water eel, scallop yum and avocado served with eel sauce on bed of tempura crumb

Puffy: Fresh water eel, cream cheese, cucumber and avocado topped with smelt eggs & eel sauce

Moment: Shrimp tempura, scallop yum and avocado topped with smelt eggs & eel sauce

Hurricane: Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado topped with salmon tempura, smelt eggs & green onion drizzled with eel sauce spicy yum yum sauce & mayonnaise

We arrived close to 10PM and the wait was 30 minutes. Luckily, we weren't starving so we enjoyed the outside waiting area on a relatively nice night.

Once we sat down and looked at the AYCE menu, our minds were blown. There are well over 100 items available with every nagiri and specialty roll you can imagine. My favorites were the uni (so fresh, sweet, creamy, and beautiful), super white tuna (I felt like the heat of my mouth made the fish melt), sexy girl, crispy rice, and green tea creme brulee. 

The sushi places I'm used to eating at typically pour a lot of eel\/yum yum sauce on everything so I thought that the tiger roll and 911 roll were a bit dry. The 911 roll is no joke. I can stand a lot of spice and my husband could only manage one piece, so I had to polish that dish off by myself. My eyes were slightly watering by my last piece.

That is as good as it gets for me at an AYCE sushi place. I am not a die hard sushi eater, so generally, it is hard for me to get my value out of an AYCE deal, but the selection is so broad at Goyemon that even someone who sushis only a few times a year can leave with a full belly.

The highlights for me included a nicely done crispy rice with spicy tuna (almost as good as Simon), fresh and tasty roasted vegetables, yakisoba (perhaps a tad over seasoned, but it was nice to have the option), and a slam-packed super veggie roll. I never leave full from AYCE, but on this night I did! And, yes, they have some sinful pork belly on the AYCE menu. You've been warned arteries. 

I will say that I wasn't a fan of the calamari, but other were, so perhaps it is a personal taste issue. And, the green tea cake wasn't as delicious to me as mochi, but it was impressive to see the diversity of their dessert selection.

However, what was most impressive was that they handled a group of 20 with little to no hiccups and without the first sign of stress or disorganization. Checks were split without a hassle, and it was a perfect party atmosphere in the private room. I would highly recommend for a party. 

Judging by my guests' consumption of fish, the quality is good, and I even heard people saying it was probably some of the best uni they had sampled.

My party arrived around midnight on a Friday night. The restaurant was packed and on initial appearance looked to have been a great, late night dinner selection. Sadly, the entire evening went south from there.
We were a group 3 and were first in queue to be sat. The hostess had us slotted with a wait time of 20 minutes. That 20 minutes passed, and passed, and passed.. all the while the hostess was loudly talking to the table beside her about drugs and other college influences. 

The 20 minutes ended up taking over an hour, and finally when a table to seat 3 was available.. the hostess was nowhere to be seen.  The hostess reappears and looked to be doing some sort of ""paperwork"". After waiting about 5 minutes I decided to walk up to her and ask ""excuse me.. can we sit here now?"".
She continues working on whatever she is doing and spouts ""oh that's reserved for a group that's waiting"". Confused.. I look around, and SURPRISE, there are no other groups but my party.  She looked up, finally acknowledging me, and says ""oh are you the party for 'X'?"" ..... that should have been my queue to cut my losses and just leave.. I'm the fool.  Turns out she was closing out her to-go orders so that she could leave. You know we waited an hour, and you knew the table was open... I figured common sense was... common.

Let's get to the food and service. The waitress was quick to bring us drinks and take our initial order.  The food also came out in a timely fashion.  The first bite was underwhelming. The nigiri tasted like pre-made sushi. The rolls were better than the nigiri, but not by much. Every single roll broke apart causing the dreaded soy sauce rice pool.  
Do not order the seared salmon. It's definitely pre-made. It comes out cold and they put so much ponzu sauce on it that it's nearly inedible.  The 2nd and 3rd orders took far too long to process. You need to wave down your waitress and endure them telling you to wait for any and everything. I know serving is a difficult job, I was a server for many years, but she took no time to check up on us.

If you want sushi... avoid this place.. subpar sushi with terrible service. If you like to be frustrated then this is the place for you!

Ok back to the review. Sushi House Goyemon is a small sushi restaurant outside of the Vegas strip (but not too far). This is how it works, they have a la carte options but they also have their all you can eat option. If you like sushi, the all you can eat is a decent deal. It's about $27.00 for dinner and you can order as much sushi as you want. It's not just sushi. You can also order soup, salads, and even desserts are included on the menu. They do charge extra for leftovers so be mindful of what you order. 

The sushi itself is delicious. It's fresh, made to order, and comes out in a decent pace. I would recommend keeping track of what you order, especially if you're in a large party. We were in a large party and our orders got mixed up. It was an accident and they apologized but definitely something to keep in mind. 

Like I mentioned, Goyemon is small and there is a wait on weekends and holidays. So be prepared to wait. It's worth it, but definitely factor in wait time when you come to Goyamen. They also have a time limit of 1-2 hours if you decide to do the all you can eat option. 

Factoring in everything, it's still a great deal and delicious food. If you like sushi and are in Vegas, definitely stop at Goyemon.",1,1,2

I also tried their new roll pink lady which was also delicious. 

Ice cream: Which is also on the AYCE menu, I usually get green tea ice cream and tempura ice cream but I must've been in an adventurous mood because I decided to get the lychee ice cream, first off I wasn't too sure how this was going to taste. I love lychee but lychee in ice cream form idk. But I absolutely loved it, it was very tasty. Goyemons the only Sushi restaurant in Vegas that I know that serves Lychee ice cream.

This place should actually be five stars considering everything that they have to offer and the fact that every single bit of it is absolutely delicious but I gave it four mainly due to the fact that I thought it was going to be a new sushi experience when it actually wasn't. They pretty much have exactly the same menu from Sushi-Mon plus a bit more so I was kind of disappointed that it was just Sushi-Mon 2.0

That little fact shouldn't discourage you from going to eat here though. As I previously stated, the food is fantastic. From the nigiri to the specialty rolls, all the way down to the sides and dessert, this place knows how to bring their A game.

I first asked if they had eaten at Goyemon prior to our visit, which they confirmed that they had, multiple times.  So that was my first indication that this place wouldn't be too shabby.

We arrived at a modestly decorated space with a fifteen minute wait for six people at 1AM on a Friday night.  The interior has mood lighting, with a gorgeous, clean bathroom and an overall generic but pleasant decor.  

To get a good sampling of what the restaurant offered, I decided to spend the 26.95 to get the AYCE which isn't just sushi, but included all kitchen food, entrees, and dessert.  That way, if the sushi was mediocre, I could pig out on entrees and kitchen food.  

Thankfully, that was not the case as the sushi was pretty good.  I ended up eating a lot of the Americanized rolls which as a whole I generally don't care for, but every once in a while I do end up finding a roll that has a ton of goobledegook on it and enjoying it.  I for one like my sushi to be light and have a distinctly smooth taste to it.  So this place worked for me.  I had two orders of shumai (steamed\/fried), gyoza, eight half orders of sushi, 1\/2 order of ramen, and Green Tea Cake, the latter of which was my favorite part of the meal.  And yes, you read that prior part right: You can do half orders of sushi, which I loved, since this gave you the ability to a variety of sushi rather than get stuck with a roll that was so-so in your ranking.  

In terms of sushi: Sexy Girl, Cynthia, and Dragon all stood out for me.  

The only thing I really didn't care for was the service.  It started off fantastic.  Speedy, tons of refills on my iced green tea.  And then, towards the end, I was waiting and waiting and waiting to get a refill of water.  The staff was pleasant, and the food was good, very good for an AYCE.",1,0,0

I guess the more recent reviews reflect the how things are now at Goyemon.  Thinner fish on the sushi, less quality,  and as for the service it's a craps shoot.   Some waiters are slow but I can see they are trying, so when I see that, no problem.  

One of my first job was as a manager at Nobu NYC so I am a sympathetic diner who know how hard restaurant staff work.  What ruined my experience are some of the Japanese sushi men (not the Hispanic sushi guy, who was efficient and pleasant) who seem visibly annoyed and condescending when you ordered after the first round. Worst is the cuts of the fish drastically got worse.  I wish I didn't see these things (job hazard).  

Bottom line: AYCE carry their limitations.   To maximize your experience at Goyemon , sit at the tables and allow a few errors to the hard working waiters.  If you must sit at the bar, hope that you get the Japanese man with glasses or the young Hispanic man. Bon sushi!",0,0,0

There are so many good rolls (and some forgettable ones) that it's hard to dislike this place! My only warning is to make sure you don't over order. You can order half-portions for a lot of them, which is what I always do when I dine here. 

For appetizers, I especially love the tempura shrimp and fried calamari. I order more than 2-3 each because they're just so darn good. They arrive super hot temperature-wise, so be careful. I feel like they deep fry them right after you place the order.

We sat at the sushi bar and asked for all you can eat. We ordered one order of each nigiri we wanted to try and was immediately asked by the young sushi chef if we wanted two orders each. They have the policy of no leftovers or we be charged so we politely said no one order only. He said ok. After we got the orders, half of the nigiris were drenched in sauce and falling apart, one of the fish on the nigiri was also dried on the ends??

Not only does this place offer you AYCE fresh nigiri and specialty rolls, but also grilled specials such as pork belly, cajun salmon, super white tuna, chicken yakitori, etc!

This place offers high quality sushi! I'm not kidding. The salmon belly is a MUST! Along with the yellowtail and salmon. The nigiri just melts in your mouth. Our group surprised the waitress as we scarfed down each of our orders within 10 seconds and asked for more. 

The menu suggests that we only have 1 hr to order food, but it seemed like they didn't keep track of the time. However, we came right before the rush hour, so things may be different. But overall, the sushi is absolutely amazing! As for the grilled menu - I recommend the super white tuna, chicken yakitori, and the grilled pork belly. All are full of amazing flavor! 

And to top it off, the dessert is also just as spectacular. BEST GREEN TEA ICE CREAM EVER. None of that flour-y taste. It's your genuine green tea ice cream! Also, they have different specials for dessert. That night we had the Yuzu sorbet, which tastes just like Kumquat (citrus-like flavor). I also highly recommend the Lychee sorbet!!

This place really is a secret hot spot. Definitely popular among the locals. It get packed, so arrive early and preferably during non rush hours. The wait can be killer. 

Goyemon has fresh sushi and great ingredients. Before eating at Goyemon, I was not a fan of Uni (sea urchin) because of the texture and flavor. Little did I know what great uni tasted like. I'm a believer. As far as their sushi goes, I'm a fan. 

I would recommend trying their all you can eat.Know what you want, don't be afraid to try their specials of the day. It's hard to go wrong at Goyemon. I haven't had a dish that I was not fond of. Pick what you like, highly likely you'll enjoy it.

Be forewarned, their service can be a little on the slow side, but you can compensate for that by ordering a lot when they take your first order, that way you won't be like that Brian B. guy who left a stupid ass comment on this great sushi house.

That's the short version. Here's the longer version:

My sisters, fiancé and I went to try Goyemon. My fiancé and I had been there previously. We have noticed that they really get packed every time and there is a momentary wait for a table. 

We really enjoyed our two experiences there. I took a star off specifically for their service. It is hit or miss with their service. They either accidentally overservice you or underservice you or some times bring food to the wrong table or bring you the wrong item. I'm sure in the future they will have a better protocol and perhaps create SECTIONS!

However, their fish is extremely fresh, their waiters are truly friendly and the vibe matches its hype. They do not pack on tons of rice to their sushi to try and fill you up. They really seem to want you to try everything.

Their desserts, such as the green tea creme brulée, are of utmost divinity. 

They also have cooked foods such as ramen and yellowtail collar (which they run out of very fast).

There is one thing that I did not enjoy there. It's called the Screaming Orgasm. The tuna meat used in the tuna poke dish was fit for tar tar. It was a nice try to disguise leftover pieces of fish with the screaming orgasm sauce, but it was subpar for my taste.

We got yellowtail, salmon, halibut, eel, and some rolls as well. First of all, rolls usually come in 8 pieces per order but for most of them, you can request half orders. It's nice because it saves you room to try a variety rather than just a few. I also got a crunchy hand roll- but you can pretty much customize it however you want, just ask :) As for nigiri that we ordered, fish is very good quality and they give you a reasonable amount of rice. My favorite was the yellowtail, I probably had 10 pieces of that by myself if not more! Halibut was also good and that was chef's recommendation, wouldn't have gotten it other wise. They also have a good selection of sides that you can order. From calamari to gyoza to miso soup to seaweed salad and many more- you get the point. I enjoyed all the sides that I tried except maybe edamame. I liked that it's hot but it's too buttery to my liking. Moving on to desserts...omg all you can eat dessert too???? We got mochi ice cream, tempura ice cream and 3 scoops of red bean, lychee and green tea ice cream. Needless to say, we were all stuffed!!!!

I always start with nigiri. Always been my favorite although I still naturally get my speciality rolls in but am old school fish and rice. I always felt that nigiri one of the best judges of  the quality of the fish. I was impressed for sure the quality of all the fish they have is excellent! The speciality rolls tried the 9-1-1 roll had nice little kick too it and the Ecstasy roll looked good tasted alright but next time try another one. The poki was solid. It usually miss comes too poki at AYCE not all place have them. Still have too give the edge 808 poki style is more local style that I love and use too. The thing that stand out about the poki here is they use some fresh seaweed along with nicely thin shaved white onion, and nice poki sauce. Tried the grilled prok belly with mango salsa. Tasty!! The pork belly perfect hard grill sear on the outside and little of mango salsa top of it. It like pork butter goes down smooth. Majority of it nigiri not go wrong with any one I pounded the hamachi, albacore, and salmon. Loving it!

Grilled Tofu Salad (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=uTwz4uGpvFM6H8EttW-MVg). I've never had grilled tofu before, but it was interestingly good. The taste of the grilled tofu with a garlic sesame sauce was a good way to start the night. 

Grilled Pork Belly (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=1pQReeZwUFgCpzY7qJ5rfA). Was similar to Monta's pork, but in a thick slice form.

Speaking of Monta, for whatever reason the Shoyu ramen is offered after 11pm. Not sure if the tonkutsu or miso are offered as well.

Extra desserts not on the regular menu were tofu cheesecake, green tea creme brulee, and a green tea mousse cake, all were presented nicely and a nice touch for a AYCE sushi place. 

What I really enjoyed was the quality of the fish for a AYCE place. It was like they were not affected by the economy and continue to serve fish that wasn't chewy or smelled. Yay, but too bad they still use krab. 

The service was excellent was well, the server checked up on my party quite often and we did not have to wait long receive our orders. One of my friend's ordered a shrimp nigiri and a few moments later the server came back asking if he wanted to try deep fried shrimp heads as well, with no cost of course since its AYCE. They actually want you to enjoy your meal haha.

Another plus is that I don't have to drive all the way to Maryland Pwky to get some quality AYCE anymore. If you feel the same way then.. *high five*.",7,0,2

Their fish is one the most freshest I have seen so far in any AYCE sushi places. Their service is attentive but a couple smiles here and there would've made my dining a bit more comfortable. This might be because I was sitting at the bar and the sushi chefs seemed a bit intimidating with their daunting indifferent facial expressions. It actually seemed like they didn't want to work there at all loooool. However, their sushi was good so I'm okay :P my favorites here were the fresh scallop sushi and the roll called Orion.

Started out with a cold sake flight & the unfiltered was my favorite. Not sure of the names but they were the bottom 3 choices on menu. Service was attentive and water\/tea was refilled regularly. 

With a group of 16 the amount of food consumed during our 2.5 hour feast was almost unfathomable. Only a few true Man vs Food future contestants in training failed to hit THE WALL of ""not another bite""

First I will list all of the dishes I recall ( keeping in mind that several were ordered 2 & 3 times!) Edamame, gyoza, miso soup, seaweed salad, Octopus Poke, grilled corn, Uni, pork belly, salmon belly, conch, hamachi with jalapeño, a roe nigri, spicy roll with crunchy bits, hurricane roll, rainbow roll, caterpillar roll, crispy shrimp heads, hamachi, spider hand rolls, mochi, lychee sorbet, green tea ice cream, green tea creme brûlée, green tea cake, chocolate mousse. And I'm sure I'm forgetting some. 

My favorites were: Octopus Poke, hamachi w jalapeño, salmon belly, hurricane roll & strawberry mochi. To say I left stuffed would be an understatement & I tried less than 1\/3 of the offerings and am sure I missed some. 

The fish was delicious and melt in your mouth tender. The only nit picky item I have is that toward the end, rice was warm, but I was full by then. 

I will definitely be back, not sure if I'll do it next month as this kind of eating should be left to a rare treat, but if you're going to go for it, Goyemon will not disappoint.",6,2,3

There is SO much to choose from, like 50 special rolls, like 50 regular rolls, appetizers, sides, deserts. It's crazy! It was perfect for trying everything bc they are small portions and u can get half rolls. Everything was REALLY good, the waitress and cooks were great. I sat right at the sushi bar so I could watch everything. I honestly have nothing bad to say. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is bc of the appearance. It's very small, not well decorated, and there's no bar. At first glance, if I wasn't pretty much stuck without a car I would've left. But I'm glad I didn't. I'll be back and will bring my boyfriend.

(After all, this location once housed Sushi Hana and SHIN Yakitori.)

Open only for dinner from 5:00 pm to 3:00 am, we made it our mission to be waiting when the doors open.  We weren't the only ones on a Sunday night to think of this, but were definitely glad we did.

Beyond the standard sushi rolls and sushi, what makes Sushi House Goyemon a star higher than others?  These were noteworthy in my book:

* Specials board: Oh my goodness!  This is what got me!  They had off the standard menu fish like bonito, kampachi, sardines, and yuzu tobiko that were included in AYCE.  That was definitely a highlight in my book!  Loving the yuzu tobiko!

* Pork Belly - Yes, everyone talks about it and it's good stuff.  We love pork belly - we have marinated cooked pork belly sitting in our freezer ready to throw into the rice cooker at a moment's notice.  We love pork belly.  Sure, the portion is a meager two pieces at a time, but it's AYCE, so order up more!

* Shoyu Ramen is included in AYCE after 11 pm.  Sure, we missed this, but it got the Husband all excited with the possibility of it.  (Why someone would want to fill their belly with ramen and soup during an AYCE sushi fest is beyond me.)

* Dessert included, as in ALL the desserts are included!  I've been to other AYCE sushi joints that may or may not included AYCE ice cream, but they not only have a few ice cream flavors, but four different desserts to choose from.  Uh, score a point there!  We tried them all - Green Tea Cake, Chocolate Mousse, Plum Wine Jelly, and Green Tea Creme Brulee.

* Hot or Iced Green Tea is included.

So, what's with all the mixed reviews?  The major problem here is service.  I read over the recent reviews and took note of the declining service and definitely can attest to what the other yelpers are complaining about.  We were lucky that Chizuru was our primary waitress because she is stellar.  And the rest of the staff, that's the problem.  From the moment we walked in and said party of four and one highchair, the hostess\/waitress totally forgot to bring a highchair.  Other staff people were just not attentive, as I was often seen waving my arms around to get their attention.  Waiters who refill your beverages should really put your glass back in front of you, not at the other end of the table and watch you struggle to reach across to get it.  There are just some people who are just really good at restaurant service and others that could use some improvement

Nonetheless, we've been gone so long from the AYCE world that we are happy to go back.  Yeah, we'll be back this week!

4.5 stars.

They offer a frequent eater card, which is always nice.  Looks like they are related to Sushi Mon and Monta Ramen as well.  Good to know!

They also take reservations for their party room from 10-20 people.  Last seating for AYCE is 2:00 am!",13,4,6

But I came today and was surprised to be seated right away. I guess other people must agree that the quality has really dropped like crazy, because I don't ever remember being seated right away. The rice just tasted like mushy overcooked white rice. I seriously doubt they did any seasoning of the rice.

All I wanted was an answer of ""the wait could be X min to Y hours""...but the hostess on the phone gave me a long run around...alittle annoyed.

Upon arriving, it's located in a strip mall about 1.5 miles away from the strip. They have a time limit of 1 hour, which is plenty to get full in one sitting, and have selected pieces, the sweet shrimp and uni, to 1 order (2 pcs per person). After ordering, our food took quite some time to come out, about 25 min or so...seemed to take forever. we didn't go overboard with order the 1st round because they said if you have left overs or leave the rice, the restaurant will charge you a la carte price. So 2nd round we went overboard ha....ordered what we really liked from 1st round. Top contenders are:

Super White Tuna (Pure awesome...must try as I've never had it and it was fresh and just umami delicious!!!)

Albacore

Halibut

Had a great time, didn't feel like we were rushed, good choices for sake and beer, but didn't get to try the tempura ice cream as they were out...I believe the AYCE is around $25-26 for dinner.

Tips: ask about fresh fish of the day
- you can order from the specials board as part of your all you can eat
- you can so 1\/2 orders of the cut rolls (most of them) good option, since you are required to eat everything you order or you are charged
The only less than perfect thing was the tempura shrimp inside the rolls was luke warm and didn't seem fresh fried, but reheated in the little oven
(Order the side of shrimp tempura instead which came fresh out of the Fryer and was heavenly!)

The PORK BELLY.  This was real good.
Nigiri sushi.

The sushi rice was not made well.
The rolls sucked.  
If you are a rolls person, then you might try a different place as I found the rolls to be so-so.

Why come here?  For the pork belly, nigiri sushi and to stuff your face since it's AYCE.

The server took a while to get our water and orders which was okay since we took a bit to get settled and seated. 

Let's start out by saying. Customer service really makes or breaks a place no matter how good the food it. 

My first impression of our server was that she did not want to serve us. She did not offer a smile. She was very monotone and moved about sluggishly. We had children with us (ages 5 and 3). We asked our server how much it would be for our 5 year old she said it would be the SAME AS THE ADULT for AYCE (What the heck!) and our 3 year old was going to be charged $3 for AYCE. Luckily there were lunch bentos that my 5r could have. Fortunately, my 3r loves tamago, so he definitely ate his share.

If you are at an all you can eat restaurant where you have to place orders and they have a maximum time limit (45 minutes here) your orders better come out quick and your servers should be quick. 

Miss attitude was slow and her body language was so negative that we began asking other staff members to help us with our orders. 

The food was excellent, my compliments to the chef. I really enjoyed the hamachi and wished that I could try their uni (dinner only). 

Halfway through lunch my 3r had to use the restroom, so I took him to the women's rr. It was clean enough. I always like to leave a comment about rr in any establishment I am reviewing on Yelp. Dirty and cluttered restrooms are a pet peeve of mine. 

Overall, I'll probably try to come back to sample their uni but I won't be back with my kids since they can't eat the Adult price worth of AYCE food. Oh and my tip to management, hire people who want to help people. If you're in the people business, you need to be a people person. Just being honest! 

Oh and if you're the type of server to stereotype your guests or customers that you are serving, then you stereotyped the wrong family. We tip good for good service and better for excellent service.",3,2,1

We ordered a lot! I mean everything at once. The nigiri was very fresh. The sake and white tuna were the best. The uni and sweet shrimp (only allowed one per order) were very good too.  It was hard that you have to eat all of the rice. I would recommend not get any of the rolls. None of the four that we ordered were that good. The 911 roll was good but very very spicy. The spider roll was not authentic at all. 

All the side orders are very yummy. The shrimp tempura, spicy chicken teriaky, seaweed salad, etc.

Of course I would take her to Goyemon. Now, it's our ""every other week"" spot for AYCE sushi.

The first time I ate here, it instantly became my all-time favorite sushi restaurant. After having tried another place, that place came pretty close, but to this day, Goyemon still holds the spot for #1 sushi place.

Super white tuna=like butter in my mouth. I can finish 10 orders of this and still not be full. Gotta try the dynamite, it's the best in town. More staples are shrimp tempura, calamari, baked green mussels. For nigiri, other than super white tuna, yellowtail, garlic tuna, salmon, sweet shrimp, unagi, and cajun albacore. The gf likes rolls, and always gets the Japanese Lasagna and the OID. I like the pastel myself. I don't like rolls that much anymore. They make me full a lot quicker and I want to make my AYCE experience worth it every time. I honestly haven't had a roll here that I didn't like. Dessert: You gotta save some room for some green tea creme brulee. Sometimes, they have vanilla creme brulee and chocolate mousse too and I just go all out and order that trio. Now this is the only sushi place in town I know of that has this high a caliber in desserts, and that my friends, is the second reason why it is my fave sushi joint. You already know the first (clue: it's like butter in my mouth).

I would say they are the best chefs there and they're the most hospitable. It had been a few months between visits and they totally remembered me. 

This place is ALWAYS busy. So get in early or put your name down and get ready to hunker down. 

It's all worth the wait - they have on their AYCE : Pork belly, Amaebi, Toro, and about 3 - 4 other rotating fish. The staff here is pretty good, some better than others. They also have fresh grated wasabi here too, it's worth the burn. 

The rolls are ok, but as for me fish and rice only, leave the sauce at the bar.

The nori\/seaweed that they use here is SO flavorful and really adds to the sushi.  This is the only sushi restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas that used seasoned nori.

What's amazing about this all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant is that they don't force you to eat like 10 pieces of sushi per roll.  You can order half-orders, which is really convenient, especially on your first time!  Additionally, instead of charging you per piece you do not eat, you have a time limit.  We were not bothered by the time limit, as we were already full.  In fact, the server never even mentioned the time limit.

I ordered Garlic Tuna, Teriyaki Chicken Roll, Mahalo Roll (i.e. Spam roll), Crispy Rice, Spider Roll, Tamago, and a Rice Cracker, which was a special.  For sides, I ordered the fried gyoza, sesame chicken, seaweed salad, tuna poke, and a sashimi salad.  For dessert, I ordered three different flavors of mochi ice cream (no limits for the dessert like most AYCE sushi places either!).

The Garlic Tuna was amazingly fresh!  The sauce was a bit too lemony for my taste, but the fish was delicious!  I love crispy rice rolls, and it did not disappoint here!  I have to say that Spider was probably my favorite roll.  The soy paper was a nice touch and I loved the mix of deep fried soft shell crab and fresh crab meet.  I am a sucker for non-fish rolls also, so I would definitely recommend the Teriyaki Chicken and Mahalo Roll as well.

The sides were hit-or-miss.  The tuna poke and sashimi salad were not fresh at all.  The tuna poke was extremely disappointing and lacked flavor.  This was surprising considering how impressive the garlic tuna roll was.  The sesame chicken was also disappointing as it tasted undercooked and did not seem to have any sauce or seasoning on it (not even sesame seeds!).  The dessert, of course, was delicious.

The service was weird because our servers switched in the middle of our meal.  Thus, someone dropped the ball on our side dishes and we basically had to reorder it, but it did come out very quickly after we mentioned it to our new server.  The rolls came out pretty quickly (with a few exceptions), but at times it was hard to flag down our server.  Overall, both of our servers were friendly though. 

I would definitely return to Goyemon, as it was one of the better sushi restaurants that I have been to in Las Vegas.  I am not quite convinced it is the best one in Las Vegas just yet though...",1,1,1

The raw fish (nigiri sushi) was bad, I think they gassed the fish with carbon monoxide to look red, but bad texture.  Raw fish on nigiri sushi pieces were cut small like they were trying to save money.  Although service at Goyemon has always been poor, it makes it worst when the food was terrible.

For $25 a pop, you are granted unlimited amounts of sushi including their specials of the day.  in other words, AYCE!

I won't hit every single item I consumed but some of the key ones that I enjoyed personally were:

+ Salmon Belly: If this is listed on their Special of the Day menu, do not hesitate to order this! Smooth and Yummy!

+ Tempura Shrimp: I know what you're saying, how can this be good? The tempura was light and crispy.  Shrimp tasted as if it was just taken out of the water and cooked to perfection.

+ Tempura Ice Cream: pretty good, light tempura shell and soft ice cream.

Do not feel overwhelmed as you can spend a couple of hours digging into every single Nigiri item.  Their AYCE also included Appetizers (all), Dessert, and Special Rolls.  

I recommend sitting at the counter so you can socialize with their Sushi Chef who will charm and enlighten you with his culinary life and knowledge of the sushi world.  Plus, you can place your order on the fly.

The AYCE pricing is that of an average sushi restaurant ($21.95 Lunch; 26.85 Dinner) if you're into nigiri this is the spot for you. The freshness of the fish served here is much better than other sushi places here in Vegas.  I also like that most of the special rolls on the AYCE menu can be made in half orders, that way you can try out different rolls without filling your stomach. 

One con would be the wait times. Expect to wait more than 30-45 minutes if you have a group of 3 or more and don't want to sit at the bar. Busy dinner times and the wait time could go up to an hour or 2. Luckily they can take your phone number down and you can get a text when your table is ready. One thing I wish they could do is take phone reservations because not many people would like to go there just to put in a reservation and have to wait a long time. But then again this place is very popular and has good sushi so it's worth the wait.

I was hoping they'd take a 12 person reservation ahead of time for my birthday because I really wanted to enjoy some tasty sushi with friends. That didn't happen because we tried to call in and since they don't take any reservations through the phone there were no exceptions. Many times we had to go to another spot because we didn't want to wait an hour and a half and my group and I would leave disappointed. 

So just be prepared when going here. If you're looking to have a quick meal with a group of people, plan ahead and maybe have someone put a name down that way your whole party doesn't have to wait.

Not sure if you can make reservations, but we didn't. Our party of 3 was quoted a wait time of 20 mins which I felt wasn't too bad for a holiday weekend. They take down your cell # and text you a link where you can check your place on the wait list. When it's almost your turn, they'll text you again and you can respond whether or not you'll be taking your spot -- great feature IMO so you can leave the restaurant and wander around (though there's not much to walk around in the plaza). If you choose to leave, at least you can text them back to let them know you won't be coming back for your table so it doesn't clog up the line for others.

We ordered more appetizers and nigiri than rolls, but everything we ordered was delivered quickly and tasted fresh! Rice to fish ratio was fairly small and although they state a time limit, it was never enforced. Service was great - our server came back multiple times to check up on us, take more orders, and refill our water\/hot tea (complimentary). They do half rolls here in case you can't finish a full one and there is no limit on desserts! Order the lychee sorbet - it's yum!

We frequent Goyemon's sister restaurant Sushi Mon as it's closer to our house, but we'll be coming back to Goyemon from now on for AYCE since the fish is more fresh and service is more attentive and friendlier!

Also, make sure to get a stamp card! You get 1 stamp for every AYCE purchased and a free AYCE after 10 stamps. Make sure you don't lose your card as they do not combine cards & cards expire after 1 year. This card is valid at Sushi Mon as well.

I really liked how they even noted the sushi that didn't have raw fish. So considerate.

The best thing is that they don't overload on the rice if you do get sushi. I think other places load up on rice to make you full faster but this place went light on the rice and heavy on the good stuff.

My favorites of the sushi nigiri was the salmon (which tasted immaculate to us), seared salmon, unagi, super white tuna, garlic tuna, and uni. For the specialty rolls the dragon, sexy girl, and maguma. The extra stuff from the menu we tried were the ahi poki, fried calamari, yakitori, and mochi ice cream.

I then asked for a beer while we waited...over 30 minutes at this point. I thought there was no way I'd be charged for this beer, but I was wrong. All in all, we were sat after about 35 minutes and lots of confusion. No apology for the situation and no gestures to make up for it. The food was good. The service was okay. No one knew what was going on. Our drink orders were taken by one server, then 5 min later a different server asked to take our drink orders again. I'll never go back to this place again. There's better sushi restaurants with better service and employees with common sense all over this city. Who needs this place?",1,1,1

This place definitely the exception to that. Easily the best AYCE I have had in Vegas.

The quality of their fish is really good being that we are nowhere near an ocean or decent body of water. Also inexpensive for the price. 

I usually judge a place on the quality of their nigiri not the rolls. The salmon belly is my favorite! Also they have great scallops. Also AYCE includes  grilled fish which is awesome. Grilled super white tuna is easily my second favorite. 

The lack of 5 stars is due to the rush on getting you served and out. It gets so bad that I have been asked what I want to order before I had sat all the way down, then again 30 seconds later and again 30 seconds after that (I wish I was kidding). But otherwise the service has been great.",2,1,1

The pork belly is a must-try. I am a big dessert fanatic and had 4-5 lychee sorbets by myself and 2 green tea creme brûlées.

The place is small so we had to be divided into two separate tables. So the concept of this place is $26.95 a person for an all you can eat sushi buffet. You don't actually get up and walk around and pick up your food. You're seated and you order through your waiter. Whatever you order you must finish. If there is anything left on your plate they will charge you for it. Luckily, for the nigiri they don't add Alot of rice so you won't get full too fast. we quickly ordered and wrote everything down on the paper menu so we could keep track of everything we ordered. 

For the uni (sea urchin) you only get one order per person, along with the amaebi (sweet shrimp). Ask for the shrimp head as well!! It's Delish!! You won't regret it!! 
The porkbelly was just okay. It was a little too sweet and fatty for my liking. But it tasted a little over cooked. 
The baked mussels are super good! One order comes with two small mussels. 
Super white tuna, yum yum scallop w\/ a quail egg, salmon, salmon collar, hamachi w\/ jalepenos, and Cajun tuna nigiri are all Yummy! The fish was so fresh and perfect portion. Each order comes with two pieces. I suggest you start with a little and order as you go. The food comes out farely quickly so no need to rush everything at once. 
The sushi rolls are huge!! When I say huge, I mean humongous!! 

Desserts are so good! The strawberry mochi was good! The green tea ice cream mixed with the lychee sorbet is to die for!! You won't regret ordering that! The fried Ice cream was really good too! I wasn't a big fan of the green tea creme brûlée though.

good place for AYCE. I don't feel pressured when i eat AYCE here.
sushi rice is small, and speed is fair. However tables are small and they are very close to each other. I would not recommend for private dinner. There isn't a personal or private space in between tables even though it is a full-restaurant. The restroom was very clean and unique\/pretty. 

Sometimes I had to wait but not a long wait. Tried few other dishes other than AYCE and it was pretty good. 

For the fast, not the top 10 but overall, very casual but pleasing place to go. 

fishes are good but I personally didn't feel freshness to it. (very soft texture for raw fish)

However, note that the wait is usually quite long, especially for large parties. If you do have a large party, you'll likely be seated in the private room on the side. This sometimes causes service to be rather slow due to difficulties getting a servers attention from this area. Also, if you do have a large party, I would recommend not ordering too much food at a time, as it can cause some delays in getting the food. Maybe even ordering some appetizers when you first get seated would be a good idea.

Aside from their main menu, they have some menu items on their paper place mats that you may miss out on if you're not careful. One the side menu, I would definitely recommend would be the Pork Belly (only on the dinner menu though). It is amazing. That is all. As far as nigiri and rolls, just pick what you think you'd like.

I have never had AYCE sushi before - was hesitant because in my head it just is pre-made, sketchy, gas station sushi waiting to be ordered (or buffet style that's been there?). God, am I glad I was wrong!

Craving sushi on a Thursday at 9pm. Decided to give goyemon a try. Had no problem parking and we were sat for a party of two immediately. Now, I had to browse the menu hard. 

Pro-tip, get familiar with the menu before you go. Not that we were ""pressured"".. but the last minute on the spot ordering had a splotch of chaos. 

Waters and Sapporo was quickly served with ginger and wasabi for our selections. No complaints on time. 

Started off with the classics. Salmon, Tuna, Yellowtail. And a 1\/2 philly roll. My only complaint was the amount of masago\/roe on the roll. My mistake for not requesting it without, but I felt bad scraping it off. 

Pro-tip: Always do the half - don't overcommit and waste food.

Amazingly fast and really fresh tasting. 

Roomie got Uni (said it was good, I'm not about that life) and Miso soup. Shrimp Ebi. 

And the 9-1-1 roll. When they say it's spicy, I mean my Asian roommate was breaking a sweat. 

Mackerel, Halibut, Snapper nigiri. All awesome. 

Then the specials board. Damn I hate I didn't see this first. Roasted shishito for the roomie. Miso salmon for me. 

And. SALMON BELLY AND TORO nigiri. Kill me now. The $27 for AYCE is what I would have paid for my orders worth of that and one roll. And the toro. Amazing. Cuts. Of. Toro. 

Also did veggie tempura and shrimp tempura. Tried the green tea ice cream (yummy).. lychee sorbet (so-so, I can't get on the lychee craze).. and the tempura ice cream (dessert show stealer).  

For two adults, AYCE, and a total of three beers, we dropped less than $100 on dinner. Which was an amazing dinner. Used to go to naked fish a lot, but would leave hungry and broke. Goyemon will be the sushi spot now.",0,0,0

This is being said by someone who avoids AYCE (unless it's KBBQ) like the plague!!!!

The menu is very creative and tempting and there are things included with the price that you would never expect at a sushi AYCE like desserts and ramen!!!!

The price is just above $25 which seems like a lot but pretty much everything is covered by that money - including your drinks!!!!

Sit at the bar!!!! The sushi chef and his accomplices are pretty cool and not shy at all as they will suggest you eat what is good. This is actually a good idea since there is actually a time limit. Funny, a couple of times they gave us random items with our permission and we thoroughly enjoyed them. Needless to say I am an extremely picky eater and I hate avocado. We just told them to hold the avocado and they didn't make a mistake once! I liked everything I ate pretty much!!!! I enjoyed the J.J., Tiger, Rock n' Roll and Sexy Girl rolls the most. The Dynamite which is one of my BF's favorites is really good here! The desserts are to die for here!!!!

Service is pretty good. Few mistakes if any and the servers didn't ever have to be reminded about what we ordered! Give them credit, people order a lot of food here!

The interior of the restaurant is pretty nice looking! 

This place attracts nice people apparently. I chatted with some guys at the bar and some other guy while I was waiting to use the bathroom. This says a lot about the food and ambience!!!! Of course they started the conversation in both cases. I'm usually quiet but the people here are soooo cool I broke out of my shell a bit!

This is definitely not a place for sushi snobs and I LIKE IT like that!!!! All the fish tasted fresh and was always very well complemented by the other things the chef put into the rolls. 

There is only one drawback here, all that being said. You will most likely have to wait at least half an hour most of the time. That's how popular this place is!!!!

There is ample parking as this restaurant is in a newer good sized strip mall.

Lucky for me, Minh D knew about this awesome place that is located off the strip and is moderate priced       ($26.95 for AYCE) and open till 3:00am. Parking wasnt bad and we were warmly welcomed and seated at a table right away.
Hungry and not knowing what to order first (I love sushi and could probally eat my weight in it). Minh said he was getting the AYCE which was unlimited sushi that had to be consumed in 60minutes with no left over rice on the plates, if there was any traces of sushi or rice left overs they would charge you A La Carte prices. You can not share with other non AYCE people at your table, however you can share if anyone at your table is partaking in the AYCE challenge which is a good thing and highly recommended!! So after really thinking about it i decided to challenge myself and do it!! Heck you only live once, gotta try different things!!

In no order and from what i can remember before the sushi coma totally took over:

Grilled Tofu Salad-Grilled Tofu and spring mix served with a garlic sesame dressing.

Tryed some of Minh's Grilled Pork Belly-Grilled pork belly served with mango salsa

Half roll- Philadelphia Roll-Salmon,Cream Cheese,Avocado,Cucumber topped with smelt eggs

Half roll-California Roll

Five piece Roll (no half boo)- Spider Roll-Deep fried soft shell crab meat,cucumber,avocado with eel sauce and wrapped in soybean paper

Half roll- Chicken teriyaki roll (Do not order, sadly the chicken was so dry it almost gaged me)

Between all those rolls and eating some of Minh's i started to realize that i could not finish all of this. Taking a rest and also walking around the food just wasnt wanting to settle. Sadly i had to tap out half way through the challenge. This little cupcake has had her fill of sushi for the next month and a half!! I was looking forward to saving room for dessert which they had Green Tea Creme Brulee (my favorite).  Untill next time we are in town, i think i will come better prepared for such a challenge!!",8,6,7

Quality was great and food came out in a timely manner. Soda and water refills were handled quickly which is a huge thing for my husband. I like the large selection of rolls WITHOUT crab salad. I don't like mayo so this is a huge plus and hard to find at most sushi places. For dessert we had fried ice cream and chocolate mousse. I wish I had ordered two of each because my husband doesn't usually like dessert and he ate most of them! Being so late I was ready to head home so decided not to order more. 

Only dislike is the seating. It's such a small space and you sit soooo close to people, feels like you are almost joining them\/vice versa. This time we sat in a corner so we had a little bit more privacy than when we have sat with people on all sides.

Every time I have been here, it has been for lunch, so I can't promise the same experience for dinner (although it sounds like everyone enjoys the evenings as well). I have also only gotten the AYCE (all-you-can-eat) experience so if you are ordering a la carte.... what's wrong with you?!?!?

:o)

But seriously, there are so many options and for an AYCE place, this is probably the best one I have been to in America (and that's saying a lot!). You can order half and full rolls, I recommend starting with a number of half-rolls so you can experience more of the options.

The flavors themselves are balanced and each roll is it's own unique experience.

In addition to the rolls, you can also enjoy a selection of grilled items. I loved the tofu!

I striked up a conversation with our waitress in Japanese and she explained to me that their tamago was made using a family recipe. She even gave me the option of just getting the tamago without rice. (Which I did and it was amazing!)

there beef teriyaki was slightly better than that if you consider that it was hot... other than that not much. the meat was really tough and tasted more like shoe leather than beef.

Unfortunately, our other option had an hour long wait and after some quick thinking, we decided to gamble and see if Goyemon might have a shorter wait...

Not only did they have a shorter wait (about 20 minutes on a Friday night), we also had a great time! The manager Arpi (Arpee?) and our waitress DJ HOOKED IT UP all night. Fantastic recommendations (super white tuna has changed my LIFE) and very attentive service. We usually frequent a self-serve sushi place up the street (which we're now embarrassed to admit), but we've seen the light in terms of making Goyemon our new go to spot. Incredibly fresh fish despite being an AYCE and a ton of awesome options that are rarely seen at other AYCE (uni, toro, salmon belly).

As such, it became somewhat of a moral imperative that the wife and I get our fill of sushi while in town.  After a little Yelp research and based on the recommendations of trusted local Yelpers, we ventured off-Strip for lunch at Sushi House Goyemon on a Tuesday.  We arrived around noon, the dining room was a little over half full, but all of the seats at the bar were open.  We sat at the bar and the adventure began.

With almost 1500 reviews, there isn't much more that I can add to the discussion.  You either like sushi or you don't.  The concept of AYCE sushi made to order appeals to you or it doesn't.  One more opinion likely isn't going to sway your dining decision.  Goyemon's AYCE sushi for lunch ($21.95) and dinner ($26.95) seemed a buck or two less expensive than its peer competitors.  Although the lunch didn't offer items like uni, which I love, I was fine with not having it as an option for lunch.  Their Daily Special nigiri selections were outstanding and more than made up for any items excluded from on the lunch menu.  The special salmon belly was mindblowing with its fatty, almost butter like flavor and the special Mentaiko (a marinated fish roe) was something that I'd never seen offered before even at high-end places like Nobu and Morimoto.  It was great trying something completely new.  Service was fast and friendly as our orders came out at a steady rate.  The most important thing about any sushi joint is the freshness of its seafood.  Goyemon had amazingly fresh seafood.  No strange or fishy smells, only that of the ocean.  The quality and freshness of the seafood was on par with high-end places, but at a fraction of the price.  It certainly beat anything we could find in Dayton.  I truly understand why Sushi House Goyemon is a favorite among locals.  If you love sushi, I highly recommend this place for lunch, but I also imagine it's great for dinner, too, which is something I'm sure we'll try the next time the wife and I are in town.",4,3,3

The service more times than not is quick and efficient.  There is one waitress there that I'm not very fond of, but most of the other servers bust their ass on a daily basis.  Food is churned out a consistent rate, but don't be afraid to be on top of the servers...there have been a few times when our order was misplaced by the chefs.  

The wait times during peaks hours are LONG.  Expect on Friday and Saturday night to be waiting up to 1.5 hours for a seat and they absolutely do not take reservations.  However, the wait is very much worth the experience.  I'd recommend heading over to PT's a block down and grabbing a beer while you wait for them to call and tell you that your table is ready.  They're pretty flexible and understanding that it may take you five minutes to get back to the restaurant to get to your seats.  In addition, I would highly recommend going here for dinner, than going during lunch.  The service and food has always been better in the evening than during the day.

The overwhelmingly majority of the time the fish is as fresh as it gets in Vegas (there was a good two visits in a months time during the past year and a half that my partner and I have been going their where the freshness was questionable.  However, it was temporary.  The next time we visited the quality was excellent.).  They will often have some very beautiful cuts of tuna that are just to die for.

I find it quite impressive for an AYCE restaurant to be serving this quality of meat.  The range of items you can an order on the AYCE menu is insane, but I love the variety.  I would recommend the following if you're going to be doing all you can eat for the first time:

Nigiri:
- Yellowtail
- Garlic tuna
- Super White Tuna (melts in your mouth...so good!  My absolute favorite!)
- Cajun tuna or cajun albacore (cajun tuna is a special and they run out quick, but I find cajun albacore to be a great substitute).
- Red snapper

Grill:
- Steamed edamame (I find the the garlic edamame to be far too greasy, stick with the steamed!)
- Pork belly
- Super white (it's a special)
- Yellowtail

Rolls:
- Magma
- Sexy girl (the cucumbers pair so well with this roll)
- Crispy rice 
- Yebeisu
- Salmon skin

Dessert:

- Red bean ice cream!  
- I'm not a big green tea fan, but everyone tells me that their green tea creme brulee is excellent.

If you just want to try a bunch of different rolls, than you can order half a roll for the large majority of the items.  Trust me for the tempura and especially the baked items...you may want too!

We were seated in about 40 minutes on a Friday night. The hostess had told us an hour and took our number, I was very pleasantly surprised at the convenience of the online system in which you can see where you are in line. Every restaurant in the world should have this system. We were seventh in line, then fifth, and then a text ""Are you coming? If so press 2"" etc. 

The rolls here are sub par. They aren't bad. They aren't good. Nothing I ordered really ""popped"". They were good, but they didn't leave me flabbergasted and fascinated like Yama Sushi's 'No Name' roll or Kaya Sushi's 'Cinderella' or 'XXX3' roll does. While eating a roll all I could think was ""I need to order more nigiri."" Why? Their Sushi Nigiri is by far the best in town that I have had. 

Salmon Belly, Salmon Collar, even plain ole' happy Tuna and Yellowtail were all phenomenal. Melt in your mouth. Oh lord the unagi made me want to order all of it they had in the building. The rice was perfectly made, even a Japanese chef would cry at its delicious chewy and sticky quality I imagine. Their sushi rice is the best I've had in Las Vegas. If you come here, come as a fan of nigir. If you come here as a fan of rolls and rolls only you are going to be disappointed. 

My girlfriend is one of those people , she gives this place a strong 2 1\/2 stars.

The service was HORRIBLE! The WORST service I have ever had at a sushi place. All the tables near us had their orders mixed up or the order never came. A huge waste of time when they have an hour time limit for AYCE. The presentation of the sushi was also horrible.

Back home in Nashville, all you can eat never includes the entire menu. This place includes appetizers, basic and specialty rolls, nigiri,  and desserts! And you can order 1\/2 rolls on most so that you can try as many things as possible. And the food is as good as it would be if you were just ordering al la cart. Not lesser quality because it's AYCE.

The restaurant is clean and classy. It was busy but we went early and avoided a long wait. We were the only non-Asians eating there, so we knew that was a good sign! The selection of rolls is amazing. And even though there is an hour time limit, the service is fast and you can order as much as you'd like at any time. They charge you for what you can't finish, but since all 4 of us had the AYCE, you can share amongst the table which is cool and nothing was left behind. Oh, and the tempura ice cream was great!

With the AYCE being only $24.95 a person, it was a great deal for the amount of food we ate and tried. I think we ate over $85 worth per couple.

We enjoy the rolls, apps and deserts. 

But the service is so horrendous I'm afraid we wont be going back. There is always a long wait (reservations are only allowed for LARGE parties), the hostess always messes up( shes given our spot away at least 3 times in the year and a half we've been going the Goyemon), the wait staff is just all over the place and often ignores you.  They have had a problem with the service pretty much since they opened, but we keep trying to give them a chance. The wait times of 1-2 hours is ridiculous and often it will cause us to leave. 

We've eaten here many many times and often bring friends who visit from out of town. My bf drives a taxi and has brought tourists to Goyemon many, many times when asked about the best sushi in town.

Then, we tried to use our stamp card which was for a free AYCE that was expired by mere days and were refused. The point of the stamp card is that you get 9 AYCE stamps in one year and you get one free, obviously you need to obtain these in a year so its worth while for the restaurant. All of our stamps were from the same year, it just ""expired"" and they wouldn't honor it.

A member of the Mon restaurant group (which also includes Monta and Sushi-Mon), this spot is generally regarded as their best effort and highest quality. 

Unfortunately, by the time I finally made a trip here, I was underwhelmed. Maybe my familiarity with their Sushi-Mon location on Sahara is to blame- their menus are virtually identical, with Goyemon offering additional items at dinner and some more unique specials. The quality of fish was good, but having a friendly relationship with a Sushi Mon chef garnered me the same product at their sister store. I really didn't see the upside to coming here instead.

Service during my recent visit was frustrating- server did not come around very often, food was came out slow and sporadic, and rice was falling apart on all rolls and nigiri. Not what I expect given the reputation that precedes this joint. They were busy, but not overwhelmed. 

I will say that the menu of rolls is extensive and their pricing is very fair ($22\/lunch, $27\/dinner). It's also nice that their last dinner seating is at 2AM. Better to visit for dinner than lunch, for increased menu options. But frankly I just found it good, not great.

TLDR
Standby items: superwhite tuna, garlic tuna, mackerel, and halibut nigiri; Lemon, Moon, Hurricane and Ecstasy rolls. They were out of uni my last visit, appreciate that this was on signage as you entered. Don't bother with the tuna poke, miso soup, or mochi dessert.",15,3,4

Or not.

Owned by the same people who own Monta and Sushi-Mon, this is another addition to their Japanese cuisine monopoly. As such, the resemblance to either restaurant is no surprise. In fact, just like Sushi-Mon they offer a small selection of special fish options for the day. When we arrived the only option they had available was their in-house smoked salmon, which was alright. 

The highlights: 
* Braised Pork belly. Pork belly is gelatinous, fatty and delicious by itself, but given the right TLC and it's a porky palate pleaser. This is no different, but it's best eaten in small doses. The portion size is meager so that takes care of that. Flavors and textures are great on this one. 
* Raw scallop nigiri. Not the ""scallop dynamite"" smothered in mayo, this is real, tender scallop. It's delicious and rare to find in an AYCE place! 
* Uni was fresh, not murky tasting. 

Lowlights:
* Baked green mussels. Blah! Bluefin's are better.
* Orgasm Salad. I'd take a hundred screaming O's over this any day. Boo. Weird medley of assorted fish-chunks doused in a puddle of ginger-sesame dressing and a few wilted greens doesn't bring orgasm to mind at all- unless you mean that wet spot in the bed nobody wants to sleep on... 
* Masago & Quail egg- I'd asked for Ikura but the chef assured me it was usually made with masago. Didn't float my boat OR sink my submarine. 


The interior is nice, with lots of warm wooden tones throughout and low-hanging lamps.

The service could be spotty. There was confusion over who was actually taking our appetizer\/drink orders and a lot of shouting back and forth from the sushi bar to the servers. 

I'd rate this a 3 and a half star place. The food isn't awful and the service wasn't consistently bad, it just didn't blow me out of the water. I was tempted to go for a 4 star, but I figured rounding down will help counter the ebulliently high prior ratings.

I chose the 3 hand roll combo ($8.95) which is ice cream cone shaped. The cone is made out of seaweed though. I had the spicy shrimp yum roll, scallop yum roll and the crab stick roll. I was happy with two out of the three rolls. The crab stick roll is made up of a fake crab stick with rice in a seaweed cone. It tasted too plain for me. The special also came with soup and salad. The dressing for the salad was a little strong tasting but still good. We ended the meal with dessert. I had the lychee ice cream which was really delicious! My husband had the fried ice cream.

The second time I came here to have lunch by myself. I was trying to kill time before meeting up with coworkers for happy hour. I thought if I ate really slow I can kill two hours but I was wrong.

I love their menu.  You don't usually find sashimi salad, tuna rice cracker, orgasm salad, grilled pork belly, cold tofu, green tea creme bulee, tofu cheese cake, kobe beef (special) in the other all you can eat places.  I've also heard good things about the pork nuggets dish and the teriyaki dishes.

Thumbs up for the decent size cut and small rice portion.   I prefer Nigiri to sushi.  My favorites are salmon roe, white tuna, salmon, yellow tale, red snapper.  I'm not a uni person but my friends who eat uni said it was good.  

Good service.  I didn't like the service at all on my first visit but on the last two visits we had great service.  It's not a big place so sometimes there's a wait and I'm not sure if they take reservation.

This is definitely our new favorite all you can eat place.  I hope Goyemon keeps it up!",3,0,1

We were seated immediately at the bar at lunchtime on a weekday.  Our drink orders and appetizer orders were taken immediately, and as soon as the sushi chef in front of us had a breather, we placed our sushi orders.  We ate a lot of food, but these were the highlights:

Sushi:
White Tuna sushi
Albacore sushi
Freshwater Eel sushi

Appetizers:
Fried Calamari
Fried Soft Shell Crab
Tuna Poke
Octopus Poke
Dynamite

Dessert:
Tempura fried ice cream
Lychee sorbet

The appetizers that came from the kitchen are all sized very small, which is great because you can taste them and if you like them, order more.  

The only downside was that they don't offer Uni at lunchtime, and at dinnertime they limit you to one order per person : (.  But the fact that they include desserts with their AYCE is pretty great!  

For about $50 for 2 people, this was a great deal, and really hit the spot when we were craving sushi!",5,5,5

Green tea ice cream

Too much rice in their sushi

When my party got here, they said it would be about a 30-45 minute wait. A bit long, but expected on a Saturday night. It's nice that they have two tables outside for parties waiting rather than standing. 

When you walk inside, the place is very cozy, but not overly crowded. I also noticed the menu was very similar to Sushi-Mon. The service was very fast and we hardly had to wait for our food to come out. That was a definite plus. When you're here, you gotta get the baked mussels, salmon belly, and pork belly. 

My only issue was that my green tea ice cream and vanilla mochi ice cream was pretty melted by the time it got to me. Other than that, Goyemon is a pretty good place to grab AYCE. I'll definitely be coming back here again especially since they offer stamp cards!",0,0,0

Even after reading the good reviews about this place, I still wasn't interested in coming here since I already had a favorite sushi spot! However, we had family in town a few weeks ago who asked us to bring them here, so I finally got to see what it was all about. So many reviews here already, so I'll try to keep mine short and sweet. 

A few things I would like to point out.....
First, we got lucky with the wait time. They told us we would be waiting about 40 minutes. But because a big party left, it opened up like 3 tables and we only waited about 20 minutes. I thought it was kind of cool that they text you a link that shows your place in line and how long you have waited so far to keep track of your time.

Second, we unfortunately got a table that was close to the entrance door. It was so crowded and people were waiting inside the narrow entrance way (as if this place isn't tiny enough). I got annoyed because it felt like the whole time, strangers were watching me eat. Sorry, but it sucks when you cant enjoy your meal because people keep looking over your shoulder!

Lastly, I'm sorry, but the sushi just wasn't that great. I ordered a few rolls, but nothing stood out or gave me a reason to come back again. They may have sounded fancy on the menu, but the taste was disappointing. However, I will say this. Their rice to meat\/fish\/veggies\/what have you is great. They don't pack on the rice or are not stingy with the other ingredients, which some sushi places definitely do. 

Anyway, glad I finally tried it, but no thank you. I don't mind paying more for sushi that I can definitely enjoy elsewhere!",5,3,4

Well, this place in West Las Vegas hits it out of the park, on the first try. Really though, I do not see how any place in this catagory OR price range (Dinner, all you can eat, is $26.95) can offer such a diverse selecton of FRESH food, period. EVERYTHING here was very high quality, and stood up to the most expensive and the freshest selections I have had at so many, many other ""high end"" sushi restaurants. The Latino guy behind the sushi bar did not stop smiling and offering me tidbits and Ohhh Sooo Good morsels of anything and everything --""Hey Sir, how you doing here, I have a small piece of Yellowtail Belly, wanna try some?, and 'Hey, you like Pork Belly too?'.... it was non stop like that. Perfect Yellowtail, a nice dollop of Uni (only one order per person on the AYCE Menu, and I thought that was fair), Salmon Belly, Escarole (White Tuna, oh yeah they got 'em), FRESH Albacore.... I looked up a few times and met the eyes of the aforementioned Latino guy, and got more smiles, and more offers, until I started tugging on my belt and lamenting my recent small weight loss was just that, lost -- but wait, there's more! The small deserts are to die for. Whoever heard of Green Tea Brulee...?? Not me till now, and I had 2, thank you very much. :) The Chocolate Mousse, and the Lemon Sorbet were a tiny touch from God himself, really I mean it.

We added both salads,  The Orgasm salad, seared tuna on top of mixed green and shredded diakon with  a spicy sauce, and the Hashimi salad, tuna, salmon, albacore, and crab meat layered on spring mix and shredded daikon with a dressing.  I enjoyed them both, my husband didn't.

First off, lemme say, I love that they allow you to order half rolls on the AYCE menu.  This means we can order a large variety of rolls and if we don't like the roll there's not much of it to choke down LOL

Don't expect sashimi or the best sushi in the world though.  You pay for what you get.  
Their fish is fresh and they don't stuff their nigiri with rice.  It's a good proportion.  
My favorite at Goyemon is the Super White Tuna - melts in your mouth *O*.

Therefore, this was also the first restaurant I considered to go back in January. However, I was a bit concerned about people's comment about the bad service here. Finally, I went to Sushi Yama in January and was very satisfied with Sushi Yama. 

This week I am in town again. Really want to give this place a try because of the good review about food quality. Also I am planning to go on Friday lunch and did not expect this place would become too busy, and hopefully I won't encounter the service issue that other patrons mentioned. 

Unfortunately, I end up have all these first hand experience with a cocky waitress. I called in advance and ask them if there is one hour limit for lunch time. The host told me that I can eat there for 1.5 hour. I think it is quite reasonable because we don't like to be rushed. When we were seated, I saw the Uni and sweet shrimp are not included in the lunch. I was not very happy about it because if you look at the menu online, it was a bit misleading. Then I saw the 45 minutes limit on the menu and I tried to clarify with the waitress. I told the waitress that we just called the host and she said we can eat here for 1.5 hours. The waitress insisted that 45 minutes is the limit stated on the menu and it has always been the rule. Well, I just spoke to the host 10 minutes ago and now I am getting the total different information. Then, this WONDERFUL waitress said the time limit is 45 minutes, it is up to you if you want to eat here or not. I don't trade off being respected and welcomed no matter how the food quality is. It really upset me. Later on, she added on if they are not busy, they don't really enforce the time limit strictly. So I figured out that was why the host said 1.5 hours when I called the restaurant. 

It would just be a lot easier that if the waitress explained they don't enforce this strictly instead of telling me it's up to me to stay or go. I think she maybe too exhausted and she feels better if she doesn't need to serve that many customers.

The fish is incredibly fresh and well cut. The fatty pieces are handled expertly and melt in your mouth. Pieces like fresh scallop (hotate) which are mishandled most places are fantastic here.

There are a couple of pieces limited to one order per person which are really quite nice. The uni is great which is a rare find for an AYCE place.

It's pretty awesome that desserts and hot food are included as well.We got one of each dessert and split them all. The green tea ice cream was particularly tasty.

As for an all you can eat sushi restaurant, it's definitely 5 star.  Price is cheap compared to what I'm used to in my hometown, and quality is surprisingly greater than just about any ayce sushi places I've been to, which I can't comprehend because Vegas is surrounded by a desert, whereas I live next door to the ocean.
I've been coming here or Sushi Mon at least once every visit I've had to Vegas since December of 2015.
I pretty much always stick to the nigiri and eat at the counter in front of the sushi chef. They usually have a limit of 1 order of amaebi, uni, and toro during dinner per person. There is a time limit but either they don't strictly enforce it, or I just eat really quick.
Have not been too disappointed with most of the nigiri. Portions of sushi rice is pretty small, so that's a plus. Just keep ordering more!
Servers check up on you pretty frequently, and you can order appetizers with them. 
I normally get the takoyaki, tempura and steamed shumai. Nothing special about them, but it's something I like to snack on while I'm there. The Hamachi kama isn't bad either.

Each has its strengths and weakness and Goyemon is no different. The wait time on a busy night (usually every night) can be up to 45 minutes, but we got lucky and got seated right away on a Sunday evening. They state there's an hour limit (which seems ridiculous) for the AYCE portion of the menu, but I'm not sure how strictly that is enforced. 

Starting off with the nigiri, there's only two items that you are limited in ordering: the uni and the sweet shrimp. The uni was fresh and some of the best I've had in Vegas. My other favorites were the halibut (but variable, our second order was mediocre), fresh scallops, and salmon belly. You may also order the shrimp heads (deep fried) by request. This portion of the menu was definitely the best. 

Moving on, everything else was mediocre or subpar. The octopus and tuna poke was terrible. There was way too much seaweed and not enough flavor. The pork belly was actually decent and flavorful. The rolls were not very memorable, but they weren't bad either. The dessert was by far the most disappointing. The tempura ice cream was frozen solid and caked in soggy tempura batter. The red bean ice cream my friend ordered was completely melted, more soupy than an actual ice cream. However, I did enjoy the lychee sherbert and the black sesame mochi.

Being a sushi addict in Vancouver, where sushi is readily available, cheap or pricey and good, my eyes were still popping with food lust as I perused all the creative flavour combinations on their menu.  The provocative names didn't hurt either, lol!  The Rock n' Roll roll with spicy shrimp and tempura crumbs was a real standout for me!  The Ecstasy was also an unusual roll as it had seaweed salad on top with smelt eggs in the tangy ponzu-ish ""orgasm"" sauce.  The other rolls were more subtle in their flavours and were nicely assembled, but I prefer the bold and spicy!  The mussels had a too sweet\/tangy mayo sauce and the shumai had too much filler and not enough fish.

For dessert, the lychee sorbet was AWESOME, real chunks of lychee swirled into the sorbet.  The strawberry ice cream mochi was also super-yummy.

After a fail attempt at Cesar's buffet during my last Vegas trip (Oct. 2013) me and a party of 13 didn't want to stand in that ridiculous hour wait line so one of our friends who was with us and a resident of Las Vegas suggested we go to Sushi Goyemon since it's all you can eat sushi and he said the sushi was just as good as Honolulu's sushi...so of course we couldn't refuse.


We got there around 8pm and there was about an hour wait as well but we just walked a few stores down, bought some beer and waited outside by our car until we got called in. We were then seated in their private room. We all got the all you can eat buffet for $27 but with tax it came out to little over $31. 

Don't bother filling you tummy with the rolls because that makes you full instantly because we ordered about 2 and yes they were good but they were so filling. I loved all of the nigi sushi...sad that they only allow 2 pieces for the uni (sea urchin), amaebi (sweet shrimp) and the GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE (which is not on the menu). Their hamachi, ikura, ahi, salmon, unagi, scallops, albacore etc is all fine cuts and really freshly delicious! I also enjoyed their baked mussels, fried fish heads, asparagus, tomato salad. I think everything on their menu was great and I was so stuffed walking out...Now I know where to go for good buffet sushi whenever I visit Vegas.

Non-sushi wise, I also like pretty much everything that comes off their grill.  The cajun salmon is just delicious, excellently spiced with just a little bit of kick from the pepper.  You can't go wrong with the pork belly either, it's just a rich piece of meat with really good and smooth flavors.  It usually has a great mouth feel to it as well.  And finally, the super white tuna, it's just delicious, little sweet, but very well balanced.

Now for the chili-heads out there, this place can hook you up if you want some heat.

Well, that would indeed be a great offer IF the sushi was great, or even good. Sadly, that is not the case.

The core of sushi is making good sushi rice. The rice here is quite similar to the rice you would find in a sushi roll bought from a grocery store. It's clammy, almost transparent, and almost brick-like in consistency. Simply put; it is awful. It kills all the rolls, and all the nigiri pieces. It's everywhere.

The rolls we did try were bland at best. The fish was 'meh'. I even ordered a 'sashimi salad', but it had 3-4 small pieces of tuna, and one GIANT ball of mayo-veggie mix, the thing they stuff inside California rolls. Clearly meant to fill you up for the all-you-can eat offer, it was almost disgusting to eat. 

The best thing we had was the pork belly, which was delicious, and thus one star coming your way.

One thing: the air 'freshener' they use in the restrooms smells worse than the restrooms. Once in a while we would get a whiff of it and the first time I thought someone had farted. Seriously, disgusting.

Over the years, I have posted positive things about Sushi House Goyemon! We have eaten here MANY MANY MANY times - have recommended Goyemon as the best of Vegas to MANY MANY MANY people. However, they don't care anymore.  We went in for lunch and several times they tried pushing us into dinner prices ... then the sushi started to come - extremely small pieces of fish with very large amounts of rice. The rolls looked sloppy and drenched in sauce. I asked the waitress and she said our chef was new - OK, maybe he shouldn't be preparing food yet ... so be it, then more slop arrived - I called over a ""manager"" to show him. He said they do not have a General Manager, there was no boss and there was no way to contact anyone anymore with all their locations. However, he said he would try to locate a number for me to follow-up with.  I went to the bathroom and was even more bothered - the bathroom has gratify in it that was there a year ago (with profanity in Spanish). I asked this ""manager"" about it and he said the management don't follow-up on anything (if your bathroom is not clean, then you have to wonder about the kitchen). He said he would have someone contact me, but my best bet would be to write a review and they would see it. Well, we have posted good Yelp reviews in the past ... sure, I could tell of my true recent experiences.  Not receiving the phone call that I was promised, I commented on an ad that popped up on my timeline (FB). I said ""when was this picture taken, it was not recently based on my experience"". Someone commented and asked if this was correct - so I posted a picture of our food. Sushi House Goyemon removed the picture and comment AND blocked me. Blocked me?

My go-to AYCE sushi place! Is it the best? Well, that's subjective. If you're looking for a solid AYCE for the quality and price, this is it. Disclaimer: Keep in mind that all-you-can-eat quality sushi cannot compare to the super fresh level of excellence of SOME, real, authentic sushi places. I wouldn't compare this Kabuto or other ala carte, higher-quality joints. This is strictly based in comparison to other AYCE places.

AMBIANCE: Decor is clean, intimate, but without the creepy silent vibes or weird football jerseys on the wall. Low mood lighting, laid-back, and doesn't feel too casual. You don't need to be too dressy either.

SEATING: Try getting a seat at the bar! Intimidated on how to order? Make eye contact with the sushi chef facing you even he looks busy, then say what you'd like! 

Service is definitely hit-or-miss once in a while. This place is popular on the weekends especially during dinnertime. Last time I was here, it was still quite busy on a weekday dinner rush hour. Always expect a wait! A party of 5+ can be very difficult to seat! I believe they don't take reservations over the phone, but I heard this changed according to some other diners. If you're just dining with one other person, it's a lot quicker, especially if you say you don't care if you're seated at a table or the bar.

FOOD: I've been here countless times (enough to fill 5 of their stamps cards and a few paycheck's worth!), and the fish has always tasted fresh, crisp. Fish portion is generous. They don't try to load you up on rice unless you're ordering mostly rolls. Love the questionable super white tuna. The ubiquitous, americanized rolls are usually on-point, large, and presented beautifully. My fave is the moon roll!

Try ordering half-orders in case you end up disliking a particular roll. This way, you can sample many types of rolls. Too often do I see the people next to me saying they are not eating their rolls because they had too much of it or didn't prefer it. They end up not knowing you can order half! Ex: say ""half dragon"" or ""half"" whatever.

It varies on who your chef is when it comes to execution. A few times, my roll or nigiri has come out looking like a beauty school drop-out :C sometimes, consistency is an issue when it comes to presentation.

VERDICT: Although Goyemon is hyped up, it's really because they try to bring better quality fish to the masses of the AYCE crowd. Service can suffer when it's packed. Last time I was here, our server totally forgot about us sitting in the corner of the bar! When he saw my drink was completely empty, he tried to make it up to us by diligently coming back and checking on us since then.

Fun for a date-night spot or a small get-together. A solid experience and hands-down one of my favorite AYCE sushi spots.",4,2,3

I am sad to hear the two Sushimon's are not related ( only because of my stamp card at Sushimon on Sahara and I wish I could use it at here or Sushimon Maryland). Sahara Sushimon has really gone downhill so we tried Goyemon. We sat at the sushi bar. The sushi chef was very friendly and attentive. I noticed when sitting at the bar at any other AYCE sushi (specifically Hikari- you need to scream your order and get his attention). Here-he asked us what we wanted very often and I did not even have to try to get his attention. It was really amazing service. The green tea creme brulee stands out to me and the spicy tuna on crispy rice. I love how you get a small amount of rice with nigiri. Everything tasted fresh and came out very fast. 

My biggest disappointments: sashimi salad-I am a big sashimi salad fan and their sashimi is truly disgusting. I think it has ponzu on it (gag). I could barely eat it. That being said the best sashimi salad I have ever had in Vegas is at I Love Sushi. Now that has homemade dressing on top. 

Cold grilled tofu salad-that dressing is gross. I could not finish the salad.

The staff were trying to wait for the table between them to get up so they could seat a party of 6, even though there was another table for them opening up shortly, so my party could have been eating sushi sooner.  But whatever, I won't hold that against them.

The AYCE sushi was awesome, as all the other reviewers already covered.  The toro was just out of this world, and so was the sweet shrimp.  Everything else was pretty well above average, except for the salmon, which was nice and big but just wasn't as delicious as a few other spots I've been to around town.   Oh yes, the hamachi was great as well.  Kept ordering ""one more order"" at the end of the meal.

Had a couple 1\/2 rolls that were ok.  I'd much rather eat nigiri.  Also tried a few of the unusual (for AYCE at least) items like the crispy rice with spicy tuna and the grilled pork belly.  Again, everything was delicious.

Also was offered a punch card when I paid, which I wasn't sure if they'd have or not.  Kind of rubbing it in my face, because I had a fully stamped card from Sushi Hana, the place that used to be in the space Goyemon is in, and then they shut down.  OK, let's try this again.  8 meals to go!",8,3,5

I expect previously frozen, gassed fish at any AYCE place but not color added fish.   Unless I missed a new trend in genetic engineering, there is no such thing as bright fuchsia colored tuna or brilliant orange salmon.  What's worse is many items (tuna, hamachi, salmon, shrimp) have a dry, rubbery texture as if it was previously frozen and thawed using tap water.

The rice is seasoned well but is so compacted, it's the densest sushi I've ever had.

Decent creativity but by the end of the meal, I never wanted to hear ""yum yum sauce"" again.  This mayo based concoction is slathered on almost everything.  Cloying and fatty, even hot tea can't cut its mouth grip.

Service was OK, I mean I did get a menu, water, food, and the check but with every additional order, I felt less like a welcome guest and more like a theif hacking away at the profit.

It was busy but there were open seats at the bar for immediate seating.  When you sit there, the waitress will handle sides and drinks.  All you have to do it tell the sushi chef's what you'd like. It was pretty great!  They were so quick on our orders and just fun watching them. 

I ordered half rolls of the Baked 428, Pete's, Sexy Girl and Frying Jason. The 428 is baked with grilled chicken spread with yum yum sauce, cream cheese, eel sauce and spicy sauce.  Love Love Love this!  I would have been happy with just ordering this.  Can't stop there! Pete's is deep fried sushi with white fish, crab, cream cheese, avocado and eel sauce.  The light texture enveloping this masterpiece from being deep fried made me fall in love with this roll.   Sexy Girl was filled with shrimp tempura, crab and cucumber.  It was then topped with tempura crumb and a spicy garlic sauce which made it totally SEXY! Frying Jason is a baked roll filled with crab, cream cheese, asparagus and avocado topped with spicy yum yum sauce.  Yum Yum indeed!!  I absolutely loved everything I ordered.

Since moving to Vegas 7 months ago, my husband and I have filled up not one, not two but THREE punch cards here. We brought my parents and one of our friends here when they visited from IL, on two separate occasions, and were met with rave reviews each time. Goyemon really has the BEST AYCE sushi anywhere, ever!

Sure, we have experienced one or two service hiccups in the past. Yes, they refuse to put wasabi on the nigiri. Yeah, if you come at the wrong time, you will have to wait, FOREVER. But though I tend to be a harsh critic, I can't give them anything less than 5 stars because the food is always SO delicious and I promise you it is worth the wait. Their selection is also huuuge and they always have a variety of specials (we always get really excited when we see salmon belly on the menu), and I have never had fish here that was anything less than fresh and delicious!

If your sushi tooth can only be satisfied by mound after mound of tasty, tasty fish, Goyemon is the place to be. This is one instance where the quality of the fish does not suffer in an AYCE setting. And if you're not a fish fan, you won't go hungry, either! There are tons of side\/appetizer items to choose from, including some unbelievably tasty pork belly, and if you come after 11pm, you can have a bowl of hot, delicious ramen. YAY Goyemon.

We sat in the little room to the side for groups, which is usually a death sentence for good service, especially when your group isn't huge (we were a group of 5).  However, the waitress was really good about coming out to check on us often, and refill our waters, etc.

They have a lunch and dinner AYCE deal, for $21.95 & $26.95.  There are about 50 menu options for each item, ranging from  nigiri, normal rolls, and special baked rolls.  It's really nice because anything on the regular menu you can get in the AYCE option (including the $12-13 specialty rolls).  When they bring out your orders, they bring out half an order instead of a full order, so that you can try more options.

Not having prepared my stomach for AYCE, I ordered the Sashimi dinner, which is 12 pieces of sashimi w\/ soup & salad.  Another in our group got the SS dinner, and the chicken katsu curry.  All were delicious!  The portions are generous, and all of the fish is really fresh.

One of the great things about this sushi place is you most likely won't waste of food. Why? Because if you order something and don't eat it by the end of the meal, they will charge you for what you don't eat. This is smart business, and makes customers only order what they can eat.

We ordered, and we ate a lot between the four of us. We basically had everything on the menu. Tip: be careful when ordering. I believe I ordered four of one thing and I thought I would get four pieces, but each thing had three pieces so I ended up with twelve pieces of sushi.

Everything we ordered was made fresh for us, and I think they started taking their time getting us later orders because we may have been relatively eating too much. The sushi was more than fresh enough considering you're in the middle of a desert.

And when it came time for desserts, which is also included in the meal, we shared some mochi ice cream and matcha green tea ice cream.

- They must have shrimp tempura, which they had but it was pretty basic and wasn't as crispy or meaty as I would have preferred.  I also would mind it being a little different seasoning wise.  Also I might have been spoiled by the last AYCE place I've been to which offered golden crispy prawns. 

- They must have uni, which they had, nothing bad about it.  I loved the uni.  It was fresh looking and very tasty and come with a quail's egg different but perfect. I must have more of this next time.

- They must have poke, which they had in tako or ahi, tasty but it was just OK.  It was more of a salad as there were a lot more seaweed and other ingredients then tako or ahi.  Little too.

- Specialty rolls and dishes.  They have the pork belly which is tasty but I would've liked it with more meat or just cooked longer, firmer and crunchier too.  For special rolls I've tried the pixie roll and sexy girl roll, really liked them both. I'll try to do more specialty rolls next time since I only tried 2 and since I'm thinking I'm going to love those rolls the better. 

- They must have oysters, preferably grilled but I'll do battered and fried which is what they had. It was good or OK but still loved to have the grilled ones. 

Based on my list it was just OK for me a 3.

Away from my list, they have conch nigiri which seemed cool but I found it not so good since it the first time having conch, it rubbery and tasteless.  They have baked green mussels which I liked. They have AYCE desserts which I loved, most places only offer 1 dessert with AYCE. Here I had the lychee sorbet, green tea creme brulee, and mango mousse shot. They were out of the tempera ice cream which was a bummer since that was the only dessert I really wanted.

For service they did an excellent job.  It was a UYE and we did not have to wait for a table to be setup, only for the yelps to show up.  We had half of the VIP room, shared with some other loud party but it was all good since they left half way through our dinner. We stayed 3 hours and was not bothered ""Hey you gotta leave"". They also were cool with separating the checks for each of us.

Goyemon is very good.  They have items that stood out like the pork belly and the uni with quail egg nigiri but there were also some misses.  It was also my first time here so I will have to give them a 3.5 or 4 for now with the possibility of improving after my next visit, hopefully again with my yelp posse or if that doesn't happen I'll just have to try everything on the menu.",2,0,1

Spicy Tuna Fire Cracker - 5 orders of this.

Amber Jack  sushi - This piece of fish tasted so fresh and flavorful.  Good recommendation from the waiter.

Seating: Fortunately when I did eat here, I was seated right away. I went on a Sunday around 1pm; it was busy but luckily there was a table for two that had just opened. I foresee the wait time definitely being an issue in the future because even just 20 minutes into being seated there was a good 10 people waiting for a table. The place is smaller than most sushi restaurants I've gone to so that doesn't help. 

Service: pretty good. I saw a lot of reviewers saying that the waiters aren't attentive but I had no issue at all with it. My water was refilled more than a couple times and the food was brought out in a timely manner (about 15-20 minutes for sushi and 5 for the soup and salad).  It was pretty busy at this time but I imagine that if it was even more busy, service wouldn't be as quick. 

Food: my sister and I did not have the AYCE and believe me, it is STILL WORTH IT. The lunch specials are really a highlight of the menu; if you aren't hungry enough for AYCE or you don't feel like spending the $22 it's a great option. The rolls available on the lunch menu aren't the most intricate in flavors but for a basic roll it's a win. We had spicy tuna and shrimp tempura rolls; spice level was on par with other sushi bars I've been to and serving size was a little better than average. Lunch specials also include miso soup and salad! A total win for a complete lunch without breaking the bank. 

Would absolutely return and plan on it in the very near future!",0,0,0

Take my advice and take a look at the pics on Yelp before you go so you have an idea of the first few things you'd like to try.  I didn't and went into panic mode when it came time to ordering.

They required reservations to be made, by request, from a site, that was posted through their facebook (www.mongroupevent.com). Reservations was first come, first serve. The reservation request form was simple to fill out, name, contact info, number of people, times wanted. I was surprised by this because I got no e-mail confirmation or anything. I had called a few days prior, and the girl who picked up a phone, said she had a list on a paper she found, under correct time and # of people, but had no info if it was confirmed. 2 days ago, (monday, i wanted wednesday), is when i received a confirmation text. 

Upon arrival, our reservation was for 7:30. We arrived around 7pm. I had went in to ask to double-check my reservation. Was all good so went outside to sit and wait. There was another yelper there, Chris V., who had an reservation for 7pm, who was still waiting. Doriee and I were like, okay, they are a little backed up. No worries. She glanced into the restaurant to look at the blackboard, where they usually had their specials written. Toro was no where to be found on the menu. I mean sure, it was not on the original ""promised"" special items on their site (blue fin tuna, wagyu beef, foie gras), but day before, many have said they had AYCE toro. That got us really excited prior to arrival. By 7:35, i had went inside and asked to see the estimated time on wait before we get a table. She glanced around the dining area and she said there is a table whos paying, and will be leaving soon. Ok ! ... wait a minute ... Chris' reservation is 7pm.... so i went outside and waited. Less than a few minutes late, my name was called. UHHHH !!!??? OK THATS WEIRD.... Later we saw they were seated AFTER us. That's bad on their part. They've been waiting here since before we arrived too.... Just because i went in to ask, i got table faster? 

SO ANYWAY.....

When our waitress came up to us to take our drink order, we had asked what was avail today and if toro was AYCE today. NOPE. Toro is limit 1 per person. Same for the Foie Gras nigiri. Wagyu beef, sea urchin, and blue fin tuna is AYCE. DANG IT ! sad. SAD!. SUPER SAD ! IMO thats a bad management on their part. Why allow AYCE one day, and be super limited the next? In my opinion, to manage better, to allow maybe like, 5 orders per person. That way, each who wants, gets a fair amount, and not be SUPER limited, but not be free to order. Bad call on their part. Also, as they had posted on their FB on 2nd day, items are avail until they run out? Uhm, there's a reason why you had a reservation to begin with. To limit the amount of people you have these two days. Not only did you have AYCE one day and not the other, you allowed walk-in's as well. Though it may have been ""Said"" that its a 1 hour limit on eating time but it is NOT enforced. People sit around and socialize after the end of their meal. No good ! Control and manage better ! 

With that, already a bad start. Doriee and my friend are already upset but we decided to stay and eat, since we were there already. 

Ordered 3 toro, 3 amaebi, 3 foie gras, 5 blue fin, 5 yellow tail, salmon, 3 kobe beef, and a half of a 9-1-1 roll to start. 

Blue Fin Tuna, was fresh. Each fish piece was actually cut fairly thick. 

Wagyu Beef Nigiri. First 3 orders. VERY thin and ""broken"" cuts of meat. Like it ripped open because they sliced too thin. Meat was not tender, as what a high quality meat should be. The ""carrot?"" topping was a bit weird. Ponzu? sauce used made it weird as well. Was not a good combination at all. poorly executed. 

Foie Gras Nigiri - topped with, i believe, fried onions?, seared foie gras, and probably an unagi (or similar) sauce? That was weird too. the sauce used covered the taste of the foie gras. You can really taste the foie gras if you ate a straight up piece, untouched with anything but, in combination with the fried onions, sauce, and rice. flavors gone. poor executed as well, in my opinion. 

Toro Nigiri (fatty tuna) - the most sought after order. considering we were limited to ONE order per person on the SECOND night of their event, we tried our best to ""Savor"" the pieces. With my experience with toro, it is supposed to be naturally sweet, super fatty and tender, little to no chewing needed. This toro, thinly cut. not as tender and soft. Some chewy bits as well. SAD ! 

Amaebi Nigiri (Sweet shrimp) - this wasnt bad. granted neither of the people i went wanted to eat it, so i ate all 3 orders. Size of the amaebi was actually fairly large. larger than normal actually. nice and sweet, and gives a nice ""bite"" texture. fresh. 

Uni Nigiri (Sea Urchin) - considering their no limit on sea urchin, i had high hopes for this as well. Considering their fast usage, i was expecting fresh and sweet. Nope. little to no sweet taste. okay freshness. 

Overall experience, meh. Had high hopes for this event, looked forward to it, but was quite the disappoint.",1,0,1

So, a group of my friends came here for dinner on a Thursday night.  We all signed up for the AYCE dinner special, which was a little less than $30.  My friends mostly ordered the Special Rolls, but I stuck with Nigiri.  I really enjoyed Goyemon's Garlic Tuna along with the Sweet Shrimp (too bad it's only one order per person).  I still got to try some of the special rolls that my friends ordered, and they too hit the spot.

Honestly, I wasn't impressed the first time I tried their AYCE.  I intentionally did not write a review thinking that I should try them some other time. Or, maybe I went there on one of my  ""bad taste buds"" days.  By trying them the second time, I was giving them and myself the proverbial ""benefit of the doubt"".  I was actually intrigued and surprised to see some of the high praises and Hallelujah reviews about Goyemon.  Having lived in Japan (I was stationed in Iwakuni, Japan and travelled around the country) for two years, I've had the once in a lifetime experience to actually taste what the cuisine, both regional and national, is really like.  It may not make me an expert on sushi-ya, but I can claim some kind of leverage over the regular sushi and self proclaimed Japanese food lovers outside the Land of the Rising Sun.  

I returned to Goyemon at the behest of a friend.  We were initially going to Sushi Mon, then changed his mind to Oyshi, then finally decided on Goyemon last minute.  I was OK with it.  I thought my second trip would give me more reason to form and write down my opinion(s).  So here it is.

- just like the first time I came, there was a long line, or scattered groups of people, waiting to be seated.  The parking was somewhat limited.  It was lunch time on a Tuesday.  Always a good sign, you might think.  

- After an hour, we were finally sat down right by the front door where people were standing up and gathered, waiting to be seated as well.  We had to take the table otherwise we would've waited longer.  

- We both opted for the AYCE lunch.  There were only two ladies working the tables and 2 guys behind the sushi counter, an older Asian guy and a younger Latino guy . It took a good 15 minutes before the lady came and asked for our drinks, and get our orders.

- Drinks came, followed by our orders.  They came incomplete, and few wrong ones.  It didnt matter to us.  We're both hungry so we didn't care since we knew we could re-order the next time she got closer to our table. Wrong. She didn't get near our table until after half an hour because she was busy taking and delivering orders somewhere else.  I was worried our 2 hour limit would expire way before we could get our third and fourth round of orders.  

- the nigiris came and was surprised and disappointed with the shari.  Making sushi rice is an art in itself.  I remember watching the itamaes in Japan manually fanning and painstakingly and delicately mixing the steamed rice with seasoned vinegar.  What I had in Goyemon on both occasions were their version of ""broken rice"".  The rice weren't sticky and they would break down as soon as it hit  the wasabied soy sauce.  The rice literally disintegrated.  I was so close to asking for a spoon since the chopsticks were useless .  (FYI:  In Japan, chopsticks are never used when eating sushi.  They use fingers.)  

- Their wasabi was obviously made into paste from powdered green colored horseradish. It had neither bite nor kick.  Normally, they would clear up your sinuses and bring you to tears for a second or two.  Their's was just light green, grainy and dry   Their gari (pickled ginger) didn't spend enough time bathing in its pickling brine.  It was bland!  The fish  that were served to us were haphazardly cut and unevenly sliced.  Where's the ""aijou""?

- The tempuras, rolls (handwrapped and deep fried), baked and fried appetizers were decent.  The miso soup that I ordered at the very beginning came in towards the end of our meal and was meh, as in really, MEH! It was all broth. I didn't see any diced tofu or wakame seaweed in my soup.  Their poke salad was not really poke (go to Island Sushi, folks!). 

- I finished my meal with an order of green tea ice cream.  Ordinary.   It is safe to say that I've tried and tasted all the items on their AYCE menu in my two visits.  My friend looked at me, and said:  ""Sorry"".  He knew I did not enjoy the meal.  And he read me like an open book!

For the price we paid, I personally think we were robbed but then again its the standard going price for AYCE in the valley.  There's just something fishy (no pun intended) about going to a sushi place not owned, run and staffed by non Japanese, and recognizing that most of the non-white customers on both days I was there were Koreans.  I am not hating. Just saying.

I also observed (while its taking them forever to deliver our orders) that most of the customers were ordering and pigging out mostly on fried entrees and rolls, and not on nigiris.  That's when I hypothesized that the 5 star reviews I've seen and perused on YELP must have been based on the fried entrees, rolls and desserts.  Makes perfectly sense now ;)

The wait is long because the restaurant is very small.
I think the capacity of seats were only 60 people, if I saw it correctly.  But being small allows the staff to be more attentive, which was great!

The wait was around 90 minutes, but it was worth the wait.  Also, they have an awesome system that allows you to track your standing.

It's different from other AYCE buffets.  The servers still come and take your order and all you have to do is stuff your faces lol.  

The quality of food is awesome.
Everything on their menu was fresh and enjoyable.
Some of the ones that we enjoyed the most were the fresh salmon nigiris, shrimp tempera, eel, 911, and something ruby roll.  Make sure you get the half(4pieces) orders so you can try as many as you can.

Being SoCal natives, Goyemon would be one of our priorities when visiting our favorite Vegas food spots. We remembered Goyemon for their fresh appetizers, awesome desserts, and their amazing nigiri. 

A favorite of ours was the grilled pork belly, it would come fresh from the grill with a pleasant crunch on the outside with your first bite but would melt in your mouth from then on. The sushi was the main reason we wanted to come back. From fresh and balanced yellowtail and uni, to their consistent fatty salmon and tuna. Their sushi was unbelievable for an all you can eat location!

It's been about a year since we came to this place and coming back made us miss the Goyemon that once was. The appetizers and desserts came lukewarm, barely any fish came with the rice, and the quality just dropped. Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love sushi rice and I wouldn't have had a problem if it was made properly. Over cooked sushi rice with too much water, with a less than desirable seasonings that sushi rice needs to have its character. The increase of business and customers may have taken it's toll on one of Vegas' greats. The fish was good, just not enough of it with orders, and if the rice is bad then what the hell can you do about the sushi! Goyemon you were a great friend and we had a great run, but it's time to move on. 

Here's an extra star for old times sake. Good luck Goyemon.",2,0,1

First there is the quality of the Fish. Exceptionally Fresh. They give you a generous portion of fish, and just a little rice, so if you have come here to enjoy fish, they won't try and spoil the experience by filling you up on Rice.

My wife, who favors cooked food, has said that the ""cooked food"" here is better than her two previous places, and has no arguement about making this our number one place to go. 

Sitting at the Sushi Bar is an enjoyable experience. The Chefs will interact, and will try to give anticipate what you will like, always making good reccomendations. When I tell them ""Chef's choice"" for my next call, it's something I have never tried, and I am not disappointed. 

The help and servers; always making the rounds and anticipating your needs. Even sitting at the table in a crowded place, I never had to ""send up a signal flare"" to track down a server. Food service was prompt, and orders were always right. 

It is priced at about the going rate in town, $26.95, and I think it's a very good value. 

A minor thing; All the help are English Speaking, and it is a good balanced mix of both men and women. Sounds like a minor point, but this helps assure your order will be right, and that a gir wasn't just hired for her looks, and thus may be flirting with a group of guys, while you wait for service. 

Why not a Five Star? Because if you go after 5 pm, you will have a wait, usually 30 minutes. It's nice that they are busy, because you want to see them continually succeed, but it's kind of a bummer waiting that long to sit down. 

As of this date, this is my new home for Sushi.  To my friend, Clint, you're not jumping on a band wagon, just being smart, and your review is justified.",3,2,2

I mean, sometimes I'm just plain hungry and grab a platter of sushi from Trader Joes but I know what I'm getting for the price I'm paying. Now, this being Vegas and it being an AYCE place, I wasn't expecting superb and super fresh stuff. I was pretty sure I would've been better off ordering rolls but I had been watching an old Japanese drama of mine that focuses on nigiri so it's what I was craving. Anyhow, my impressions were...

[--- Pros ---]
- Pretty nice to have a sushi place only a short walk from my place
- Pretty good price for AYCE (We went for lunch)
- LOVE that the AYCE isn't limited to sushi but includes appetizers & desserts.
- Baked mussels were pretty awesome.
- Lychee sorbet with little lychee bits. Yep, my mouth went to there.
- Miso wasn't overly salty which sadly so many places get wrong.
- Tamagoyaki was a bit on the sweet side, which I love as I consider it to be my 'dessert' sushi. =)
- Enjoyed the seared sake\/salmon enough.
- Food came pretty quick and servers were generally attentive.
- Definitely ordered enough to justify the $22.

[---Cons---]
- Nigiri serving size. Now, as it is AYCE, I can kinda let this go as I'm sure they're just trying to make sure people are\/can finish what they order, especially when it comes to the sushi but the nigiri were pretty itty bitty. Again, I probably should've gone with rolls over nigiri. 
- But even the appetizers came in pair servings. The baked mussels I can forgive but tempura? Gyoza? Eh...can throw me 3-4 pieces at least, especially for the actual size of them.
- No inarizushi? =\/ Isn't that a standard for a sushi place? And it's tofu pouches so it's not overly expensive to make so I don't know why they don't have it...
- Also, futomaki is a 'special' 5 piece only roll? I would think it's more of a standard than a California roll, which is under 'Regular'. Sadly, by the time I noticed it, I was already pretty full. Oh well, next time.
- Teriyaki sauce on unagi? Tsk tsk... Unagi = unaju

All in all, it's decent place to fill your belly on the cheap but I wouldn't recommend it for their nigiri unless its the tamagoyaki, then go wild! Definitely order some appetizers along with your sushi to get your monies worth in more protein than rice. Again, the mussels were delish. And save room for dessert. When I go back, definitely gonna try out the rolls... I figure that it's at least a step up from the sushi that's served at the buffets that's just sitting out there for who knows how long.",3,1,1

I have wasted so much money eating at Roku in Caesars and paying double the price for ok sushi.

Tip, it's worth sitting at the bar and talking to the sushi chefs.  They offered us some pretty incredible stuff that they didn't have on the menu like Salmon belly.  Also, save a little room for dessert.  Loved their green tea cream brulee.   Will definitely go back when I visit Vegas next.",3,0,2

You're going there to shovel food down your pipe like a caveman and you will and it will be delicious, but that might be the only flaw.  For $28 you won't get your socks blown off but, it's not top of the line quality but damn good enough and it's WAAAAAAAY worth the price.  Go and enjoy.

great AYCE sushi place not too far from where I live

used to frequent Sushi Factory, one of the first AYCE places in town, but sadly they closed :-(

in any case, have tried a few other sushi places, have found this one to be one of the better choices in the area

usually pretty busy, never been there without having to wait...boo

their selection is pretty good, fish is fresh, haven't really had any bad meals to date
I usually try to sit at sushi bar unless with more than a couple friends, as you can usually get some good choices\/tips from sushi chefs working that day

I usually stick to nigiri, so not a whole lot to explain other that the fish is usually fresh, and the ratio to rice pretty good too....make sure to check out board for specials!

love that they have salmon collar too! I do order a few of the cooked items, such as that, maybe some of the grilled specials, and oh yeah, pork belly, YUM!

I like their tuna on crispy rice too, although that's not nigiri

among the negatives, sometimes kind of busy, servers seemed overwhelmed at times
would pass on the ramen....actually not sure why I even ordered that here, saw someone else order it, he was a big dude, so figured he must know whats good......WRONG! wasn't much better than top ramen from college days! you're not here for that anyways!

I can't remember everything I ate that night but we went through majority of the menu and the specials board and I was not disappointed at all. A few memorable standouts were the Yellowtail, Snapper, and Mackerel which found themselves repeated in every order. And of course the ever popular Pork Belly was very nice. I arrived too late and there was no more Hamachi Kama but just looking at that picture has me feenin to go back for it. There fish was of great quality. It was all so fresh tasting and there was no abuse of sauce. The sushi rice I could eat on its own. To me the rice is just as, if not a little more, important than what is on top and this place has nice rice. There was a nice attention to detail in the sushi which is not something I see at most AYCE places and even some regular sushi restaurants. Close your eyes, put your finger anywhere on the menu and anything you land on will be good.",1,1,1

let me start with the restaurant itself: impeccable. beautifully decorated with dim-ish lighting. the whole restaurant itself is not very big. it is very clean and comfortable, the private bathrooms (one for men, one for women) is big and clean as well. then our waitress was excellent. she refilled our waters before we could even finish the cup. she always took down our large orders of food with a smile and gave us recommendations. and the food came out fast and fresh!!!!

we tried the specials on the board, which were short rib nigiri (just okay), conch nigiri (excellent), amber jack nigiri (one of the night's faves), and the star of the night: THE SALMON BELLY, or basically thick slabs of fatty salmon (!!!!!!). I LOVE SALMON.  we ate tons and tons of nigiri, from scallops to crab, to salmon, of course, to ebi, to sweet shrimp, to uni. we sprinkled our nigiri craze with some great sides. the grilled calamari, shrimp tempura, seaweed salad, cajun salmon, pork belly, baked mussels, and mochi ice creams were amazing. the orgasm salad, super white tuna, lychee sorbet, green tea creme brulee were so-so. next time i come back, i want to try some of their rolls! can't wait!!!!",2,1,1

The nigiri is what I would go for. The tuna here isn't the best. (Especially after eating  the Toro sushi at Angotei, but I didn't expect much from it since it is ayce). Salmon is really good though. I would avoid the Seared Tuna nigiri at all cost. I expected them to sear it on the spot, but I received the fish cold and hard. Nothing compared to Tokyo Table seared garlic tuna. 

This deal includes desserts as well. The green tea creme brulee is alright. The flavoring just doesn't seem right. I prefer a regular creme brulee over this one. However, the mochi is good, but how could you go wrong with that? Green tea and red bean ice cream are good as expected.",0,0,0

But it was so packed when we got there around 9pm, and we waited about 10 minutes to get a table. Not that 10 minutes is bad, but I don't think the sushi bar even started clearing out until well after 11 pm. 

The beers are pretty cheaply priced as well, at $3.50 per small bottle, and $5 for the large. They also have beers on tap that starts at $3.50 a pint. 

My cousin and I mostly stuck to the nigiris because we feel that is the way to best get your moneys worth in an AYCE setting. Let me just say that the BEST thing we ate that night was definitely the sea urchin, as it was fresh, clean, and tasted like the deep ocean. The second best thing we ate that night was the super white tuna, which just has some kind of indescribably amazing mouthfeel to it. The third best thing was definitely the yellowtail collar, which everyone raved about on here. It was tender, juicy, tasty, and simple tasting. The kind of thing that doesn't need a sauce to add flavor. We also got the pork belly, which was good, but I think I'm spoiled at home when we grill pork belly and I didn't think it was as good as we get it at home. But if you don't get to enjoy pork belly in similar fashion, by all means it's still delicious. 

My younger cousin definitely had it all out with everything fried on the menu. Calamari squid (which was super tender and not chewy at all), shrimp tempura, a bunch of shrimp tempura rolls, etc. She seemed to enjoy all the of them, and especially loved the lychee sorbet she got for dessert.

We also got some cut rolls, my favorite of them being the Lemon roll (california roll wrapped in tuna and lemon slices). I don't know what it is about the flavor of lemon on fresh fish, but I guess I'm just a sucker for fresh citrus or something. We also got one of the soft-shell crab rolls (I forget which one), and it was huge and pretty tasty. Nothing as extraordinary as the other fresh fish stuff, but still pretty good. 

For the desserts, definitely get green tea creme brulee. It's a lot more custard that you would think. The tofu cheesecake was also delicious, but I think having the creme brulee first kind of overshadowed the cheesecake. 

The only trouble I really had with the whole experience is that we ordered so much and so fast (we were really hungry) that when the food started coming out we had no idea what we had left because no one kept track and the food was coming out in random order and time. Some came out right away, others came out at least 30 minutes after we ordered. The sushi bar was constantly bustling, and is actually really small for the amount of orders they probably receive. Next time, I'm definitely implementing a way to keep track of our orders, because I think we didn't get a 911 roll or something. Not that it mattered seeing as we were extremely satisfied and had the AYCE. But it's still something to keep in mind because you order everything verbally to the waiter, and ours didn't seem to have everything organized lol. That was okay, because he still made sure that all of our food was coming out--to the best of our memory, at least.",1,0,1

My party and I were able to wait outside until our table was ready. Although there are tables set outside of the restaurant, drinks can not be served while waiting which would have been nice!

We used to live about 10 minutes away from Goyemon, and we used to go about once every couple of weeks for either lunch ($21.95\/person) or dinner ($26.95\/dinner). There are some advantages to going for dinner - 1) they serve salmon belly nigiri, which is way better than getting regular salmon nigiri, 2) you can get 1 order of uni (sea urchin) and 1 order of amaebi (sweet shrimp), 3) you can order ramen after 11. Other than these three things, you can pretty much order everything else, including the AYCE dessert, during lunch.

Our typical order when we go for dinner includes the following items: 
1) nigiri - salmon belly, hamachi (yellowtail), saba (mackerel), super white tuna, uni (sea urchin), amaebi (sweet shrimp), snow crab meat, unagi (fresh water eel), and ikura (salmon roe)
2) rolls - Sexy Girl, Hurricane, Sushi Mon Style Lasagna
3) side dishes - steamed gyoza, yakitori, shrimp and vegetable tempura, sashimi salad, miso soup, baked green mussels, udon, ramen (after 11pm)
4) grilled dishes - grilled pork belly, grilled super white tuna, grilled cajun salmon
5) dessert - lychee sorbet, green ice cream, strawberry mochi, green tea creme brûlée

That order listed above might sound like a lot, but trust me, it's worth it. And you have to try these items. There is a reason why we kept coming back week after week, and why this is the first place we want to go eat when we visit Las Vegas. It's also why this is one of the easiest 5-star ratings I can give on Yelp. The only complaint I have about this place is that the wait can be very, very long. The restaurant is not all that big, and if you have a group bigger than 4, it can take 1-2 hours to get seated. They have a couple other restaurants owned by the same group - the other 2 restaurants are called Sushi Mon... both are just as good, and soon to be reviewed by me as well.

As far as nigiri their best includes their Cajun albacore, Cajun tuna (special only), super white tuna, unagi, and garlic tuna.  Best grill items: pork belly, super white tuna and yellow tail.  Best rolls:  sexy girl, frying Jason, OID, caterpillar, pastel are the ones that come off the top of my head.  Oh and I really like their red bean ice cream for dessert.

Service is usually pretty prompt.  They have a few waitresses that I don't see too often anymore (I'm assuming for good reasons) that will let our food die in the window and take forever to take our next order.  Like I said, it doesn't seem to be much of an issue anymore. 

On busy evenings expect a party of two to have a one hour wait.  There are no reservations allowed.  My advice - give them your number and grab a beer at PT's that is up the block.  You have ten minutes to get back to the restaurant and claim your spot once you receive a text.

They have a wide selection of rolls as well. They will do half rolls if you ask and are willing to tweek a roll to your preference.

A good selection of appetizers and side orders are also included in the AYCE if you want to eat other stuff that isn't sushi. I always make sure to get plenty orders of pork belly and baked mussels. They also have ice cream and other desserts that you can get under the AYCE if you actually have room when you are done eating.

The service has never been great but the extensive menu and reasonable prices kept me coming back. Unfortunately the last time I was here the service was just unacceptable. 

There is a time limit while dining here. One hour if I remember correctly. I understand the time limit thing but on the night I was there, my friend, her husband, baby and I were having dinner when my friend's brother called. We invited him to join us. He arrived 25 minutes into our meal. We all had ordered ayce and informed the server that he would be too. She told us that he was not allowed to join our table because we only had 35 minutes left. We asked to speak to the manager. The so-called manager came over and told my friend's brother he was not allowed to join us. He was rude and unapologetic.  We tried to explain to him that we had 35 minutes left. I understand if our hour was almost up but it wasn't. We asked if he could sit at another table in the restaurant and our server said yes. We didn't get a chance to ask the ""manager"" because he rudely walked away while we were talking to him. We really didn't understand why he could have sat at another table but was not allowed to join ours. If the ""manager"" had taken 2 minutes to explain it to us rather than just tell us no and walk away we might have felt better about spending our money there. 

There are numerous ayce sushi restaurants in Vegas. Spend your money where it's appreciated!",3,1,0

We came here a few weeks ago and the service left much to be desired. After waiting 30 minutes for a server to take our drink orders at the bar, we finally got our food and it tasted average. Nothing to write home about. 

Tonight, we got sat after a short wait (8pm), and once again waited 10-15 minutes for a waiter to come greet us. My girlfriend got the beef udon which comes with a California roll. With her being allergic to artificial crab, we asked them to remove the crab. The waitress informed us that this would result in a $2.50 charge. What??? Last time I checked, a what would be a cucumber roll costs less than a California roll, and especially the fact that a guest is allergic dictates that reasonable accommodations be made. Our waitress made a big fuss and finally I told her to grab the manager. She went and grabbed another server, who told us that there were no exceptions and they had to charge us more because they would have to use an extra strip of cucumber in lieu of the crab. Once again, what kind of drugs do you have to be high on to think that it makes sense to charge someone $2.50+$3.75 for a cucumber roll compared to a $4.25 California roll?? 

At this point he told me that this was by order of the chef so I asked to speak to him, and he told me that the chef was too busy and he can't pull him off the floor. Instead, he grabbed a business card and wanted me to email the owner. Last time I checked, when a guest is allergic you don't punish them and certainly don't insult them by refusing to amend the situation and defuse it professionally. Needless to say, we got up and went next door to sushi 21, which although smaller, has much better service. I'm glad that I put in a 15 nigiri order and they were already halfway done when when we left haha.

Ps. I've been a server for 8 years at 5 different restaurants and have never dealt with such a derelict managerial staff. It's beyond me how they still stay in business.",4,0,0

Skip the skinny jeans and put on that billowy dress with the stretchy belt because we're having half the ocean's worth of fish for dinner tonight, kiddies!

I'm Seafood's worst enemy and I take no prisoners at Goyemon!  Goyemon is my ultimate favorite place to go for sushi and it's crazy for me to even say that!  I've taken my brother and friends here and they all go crazy for this place.  Nothing in Arizona can compare.  With uni, sweet shrimp, salmon belly, blue fin tuna, unagi, conch, aji mackerel, garlic tuna, and black tobiko being on their menu, how can I not love this place?  There's so many more amazing bites and everything is fresh [Remember:  fresh salmon should smell like cantaloupe!]!  Even with the all-you-can-eat, they don't try to rip you off by offering more rice and less goodies like a lot of other places do.  It just proves how great their work ethics are.  Don't forgot to check out their ever-changing daily specials.

Goyemon is a trendy little place and it's nicely decorated.  The wait time can be pretty crazy and they're always busy.  The wait staff is pretty on point here as long as you're nice and polite.  Loud annoying people generally are given much worse service as we've seen first hand with the annoying drunken jerks next to us.  But in the city where clubrats and lushes prevail, I can see how they're just over it.  Stay on The Strip, fiends! Let me just have Goyemon all to myself.

I will never come back to this place because of the customer service. I arrived with 3 friends, and my 2 kids (teenager & toddler). Checked in at 6:00pm and there was only one couple ahead of us, and was told there was a 45 min wait. We decided we would wait. My girlfriend's and I have our monthly get together and decided on this place. By 7:00pm we saw more than 10 groups of people in parties of 2-4 being seated ahead of us. We figured because we had 5 people we had to wait longer. However, we noticed that tables that could have been put together for us was not being used, and eventually people with 4 or less people were being seated. We were very hungry and decided to stay because we waited this long already. By 7:10pm I asked how much longer, and the hostess informed me that they were waiting for the family of 5 to leave, and they were trying to get them out. So....they have only 1 table reserved for parties of 5 or more? Really!!!? Clearly, the family of 5 who had been dining upon our arrival was not leaving. So we continued to wait in the tiny waiting area between the front door and the hostess station. BY 7:20pm the hostess came up to us and said she had to work her magic, and began to open a door  leading to a more private dining area meant for large groups!! This whole time that we were waiting to be seated no one in the restaurant (staff or management) thought of opening this magic door?!! They made us wait over an hour to make the executive decision? I get it if there is a long wait, and people are seated in order of arrival or if staff has to wait for 2 tables to become available (which clearly was available while we waited), but to make us wait that long to decide to seat us, and we felt like our order of arrival was not a factor.

So we were just happy to finally be able to sit and eat (especially the 2 kiddos who waited patiently). Now the customer service...the ladies that took our order seemed rushed to get us out of there. They appeared to be bothered every time they came to take our order and deliver food. Maybe they were all having a bad day or whatever, but the rudeness was from everyone was really unnecessary. No attention at all to waters or tea needing to be filled.  Can you please ask me if I am done before you take my half eaten bowl of sashimi salad away? I am sorry to say that I probably won't return. We should have just stuck to our regular AYCE sushi place on Flamingo & Durango.

The quality of fish was what you'd expect for ayce, although there was a huge difference between our orders of hamachi nigiri.  First order was of high quality--nice white, fatty slices with little blood line.  So good I wanted more, but the secound round was rather poor quality--fish was breaking apart like venetian blinds, little fat content and had a large amount of the dark red bloodline. MEH.  I must say their uni and amaebi were both very fresh though. The pork is tasty--simmered for a while till it's melt-in-your-mouth, similar texture to the pork you'd find in a good ramen place.  The spicy tuna on crispy rice was good if you like yaki-onigiri, if you don't then don't get this since it is more rice than fish.  Special rolls we ordered were nothing special, dessert was nice with the green tea creme brulee & green tea ice cream.  Our server was nice, but not very attentive--we had to wait 15 minutes after our first order to put in the 2nd, even with me constantly trying to make eye contact with her.  Are you trained this way to make us full faster????

First off, Freds, the amazing sushi chef that took such great care of us when we'd go in for lunch, it no longer working for Goyemon.  We enjoyed having Freds make us surprise rolls as we devoured nigiri, and he was a GREAT conversationalist. I have yet to experience the same type of friendly customer service from the other chefs that work during the lunch hour. 

More importantly is the waitress service. The first time they forgot our edemame it wasn't a huge deal because, like I said in my original review, that's just more room for more fish. But this last time, I actually DID want to munch on some edemame as we waited for our food. What reasonable excuse is there for it to take over 20 minutes to get some damn edemame at a sushi joint? None. 

Drinks were slow to get refilled, plates were slow to be bussed. I understand that the space behind the sushi bar is limited and so it's difficult to have more then 2 sushi chefs working, which can sometimes result in the sushi coming out slow. The management at Goyemon really needs to either hire more wait staff, or better train the ones they do have, because a great sushi eating experience should not be soured by slow and inefficient waitresses. 

Goyemon, I still like you but if you keep this up, I am going to have to find a new spot to fill my urges for raw fish. :(",3,2,1

I was in the mood for AYCE and was in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd try it again. $26.95 for AYCE with a nice sized menu. 

I got a few orders of Nigiri: cajun albacore, garlic tuna, seared tuna, and super white tuna. All were cut nicely and tasted fresh. I got a few orders of baked mussels and a tuna poki salad. Both of which were great.

Probably my favorite thing about Goyemon is they allow AYCE patrons to order half rolls, score! I ordered a half ecstasy, a half pastel and a half calico along with a pixie roll. 

The pixie roll was my least favorite, it was wrapped in soy paper and the seaweed paper, but the seaweed was too chewy, I had trouble breaking it up. It wasn't like that on the other rolls however. 

My favorite was the ecstasy roll, I ended up ordering another half of that. Then of course tempura ice cream for dessert.

I should note that I wasn't alone, so don't go thinking I put all that away on my own :)

My first experience here, despite the 30 minute wait for a table, was pleasant enough to earn a return trip... And that's where the fairy tale ends. 

This time the wait was 1 hour and the service was extremely slow.  Like walking-on-your-hands-through-a-tarpit slow. Not sure if it was due to the fact they only hand two servers waiting on the entire place, and also playing hostess... Or the fact the sushi chefs seemed to lumber behind the bar with the urgency of a toddler on his way to the dentist. 

Either way, it took 30 minutes for our first order to reach the table... And 35 more minutes for the second. Keep in mind each order was just 8 pieces of nigiri.  Looking around the restaurant was flat out depressing, every table experiencing the same level of disappointment, and starvation. We waited for our last order, a salmon skin hand roll for 40 minutes before giving up and vacating our table to make room for their next victim.

We were craving sushi, and with so many good AYCE places in town we decided on one of our favorites, Sushi House Goyemon on Decatur.  Yes, we knew better and still we arrived at 7 PM.  After a wait of about 1.5 hours (I swear, it's worth it to satisfy your AYCE sushi craving) we were seated.  The guys took a picture of the specials board and then simply decided they wanted one of everything (not including dessert).  I perused the on-line menu earlier that day (the anticipation was killing me) and decided I would focus on trying various rolls besides having a few of my favorites.

Let me start by sharing with you that I was especially happy with the AYCE in that you can order 1\/2 a roll (four pieces).  Who needs more justification than that?

I started with Sexy Girl:  a harmony of shrimp tempura, crab meat & cucumber with a generous kiss of spicy tuna and scallop yum yum on top, then sprinkled with tempura crumbs, a spicy garlic and spicy eel sauce.  I was very happy with the ratio of fish to rice.  My very scientific measurement is if I can put one whole piece in my mouth.  Too much rice and there is no way I can; just the right amount and it fits like a glove.  Slightly warm and sooo good!   I'll sheepishly admit I ordered a 2nd 1\/2 roll as my last item of the evening.

I quickly ordered my favorite nigiri, hamachi (yellow tail).  It was so fresh and delicate and just beautiful.  Mmmm...  I ordered the garlic tuna as well, which I enjoyed but truthfully like the garlic sauce a bit more at some other places.

The pork belly with mango salsa is a must have when we go - it never disappoints!  Succulent and juicy on the inside, charred on the outside pairs perfectly with the sweet mango salsa.

Time for a palate cleanser!  No Name roll was perfect - Spicy tuna and asparagus that still has a nice bit are blanketed by the delicate flavors of yellow tail.  This roll is served cold and is bland compared to others.  The fish sing in this composition, and it was really quite refreshing.

My husband and I shared a bowl of octopus poki (good, just not one of my favorites) and I snagged a piece of his unagi (eel) as well as a piece of someone's Red Dragon (spicy tuna, cucumber, & avocado with eel and eel sauce on top).

I really wanted to try dessert, I really did.  But I couldn't.  My belly was very happy and very full.",1,0,3

My boyfriend had to finish so much rolls I ordered during our all you can eat venture - he kinda hated me after that.

My 2nd coming to Goyemon was a SECOND COMING aka HEAVEN. Came again a few weeks ago for dinner and with a group of 7 friends. In all you can eat, a BIG group is your best friend so you can sample (SAMPS) many rolls without having to finish them all between 2 ppl (look at my previous paragraph). 

I let my friends order this time and they ordered correct. My favorite rolls were the Sexy Girl and ALLLLLLLLLLLLL the specials. 
Tuna on crispy rice was amazing. I love the texture change with the soft sweet tuna and crispy rice. 
But, my favorite had to be the PORK BELLY. That was fall off your chopstick tender and the sauce\/marinate was so goooooooooooooooooood =) I'd take my regular rolls and dip it on the pork belly plate to mop up the leftover sauce. 
We had to have ordered 20+ orders of the pork belly --- I LOVE that their AYCE also includes these\/all their specials.

I seen 6 seats at the bar opened so I asked the seater lady if we could sit at the bar . She had to go ask the chefs if it was ok to sit at the bar ??? The chef said ""no because it will be too busy for them""  .. Wtf ? That pissed me off .

Why on earth would you have your servers and sushi chefs clock out in the middle of serving someone ? We had to flag a different server down to help us out . Annoying .

A handful of the items we ordered were included in the AYCE menu.  You get 60 minutes to eat your share of sushi.  Oh yeah!  It's possible and then some.  It's a pity we weren't hungry last night but it gives me something to look forward to when I go to Las Vegas again.

As far as our food, we ordered the following:

Grilled Pork Belly - 2 orders
Amaebi
Uni Sushi
Sushi & Sashimi for 2
Moon Roll
Screaming Orgasm
Yellowtail Collar
Green Tea Creme Brûlée
Tempura Ice Cream

Everything was good with maybe the exception of the tuna from the Sushi & Sashimi for 2.  Otherwise, everything was excellent!  I highly recommend the Screaming Orgasm, Pork Belly, and Amaebi, all of which are included in the AYCE.  Truly a great sushi find in Las Vegas, and one that's open late till 3am.",4,3,3

I'm from LA and we have a lot of ayce places but the ayce sushi here is good! I was surprised because I can't think of where their fish comes from haha anyway, jokes aside...their fish tastes pretty good and I love their special daily fish menu. Most ayce places do not serve premium fish but their daily specials have fish like toro, salmon belly, red masago, etc.. they even have yuzu sherbet (like a mix of fruits) and lots of diff flavors of sherbet to choose from with unlimited orders! Who doesn't want more than just one green tea ice cream at the end of their meal :) that's a PLUS PLUS! The only thing I didn't like was the rice to fish ratio. The rice overpowers the fish and in the rolls, it feels like you're eating a mouthful of rice and tiny amounts of fish. I understand that sushi places just want to fill you up with rice but it's seriously overdoing it and much too obvious. The servers are nice but it's hard to get anyone who isn't your original server to help you out. They aren't the type that comes to your table and ask if you need anything else.",0,2,1

I did like how you could order off the new item menu and it was included in the AYCE price.  They are pretty strict with kids eating any of your food here if they are not paying, which is understandable, but kind of hard to explain to your 4 year old when they want a bit of your roll and you just can't justify spending $26 for them to eat it.  It would be nice if they had maybe a reduced rate for kids.",1,1,1

I think the regular nigiri has too much rice, though I'm comparing to crazy joints such as Asahi sushi and AYCE sushi back in Cali. I don't have much experience with AYCE in Vegas yet, but I do think that Goyemon's quality and unique combos make it one of the top in the area. Definitely a go-to joint, at least to try once!

* If you don't want to wait at least an hour you should during their off hours (i.e. lunch or dinner times).  This place isn't very big, just be warned.
* They are open late with the last seating at 2AM (yes that's 2 in the morning)
* If you have a small group or even just want to try something new, don't be afraid to order half rolls (if you like that type of sushi)
* Most of the sushi is all you can eat with the exception of the uni (sea urchin) and the sweet shrimp
* Small groups (3 or less) opt for the sushi bar because it maybe first available (i.e. you get seated faster and you get your sushi faster)
* Look at the chalkboard near the sushi bar, this has specials and in-season items not found on the menu

I tried so many of the rolls I don't remember which ones I had, but I remembered I liked them all.  My mom loves the white tuna here.

Screw them. I went there since at least 2006. This is theirs too but I always thought the sushi was better at the original location. We went on Saturday at 3:30 and waited about 30-40 min. The staff is efficient as the other place.
The fish was fresh. And they have pork bellies here. The rice is not as sticky though and it falls apart often.

Is it me or are they putting more and more Yuzu sauce in things? I am not a big fan of it because I think it masks the flavor of the fish. Overall I can't complain but it's nothing to gloat about. This place is probably in my top 5. The edamame is a little saltier than I like. The salmon eggs and quail egg is placed side by side here. Usually I like it on top. I'd rather eat at Sushimon but it's a matter of principle. You get crap service and there's no one to complain to. They are so busy making money with their 4 locations that they can probably care less about one customer even if this one has been patronizing them for years.

The AYCE sushi was great quality, there is a ton of variety on the menu, and you can also place half orders so that you don't fill up too much on just one thing. We went three times in one week! Twice for lunch and once for dinner. Sushi is super expensive where we are from in Bermuda, so we were beyond excited to pay less than $30 for AYCE (we definitely don't have that option at home!). They don't do sashimi but they do pretty well everything else. It is quite a small restaurant and was packed every single time we went, there was also a line waiting. That's when you know it's worth the wait. The last time we went for lunch, we went right when it opened so we didn't have to wait to be seated, but it did not take long before the place was full. I spoke to some guys who were from Vegas who said they eat there all the time. I can't list my favorite roll because there were too many choices, just try everything!

I would also like to add that the grilled menus are also part of the all you can eat menu.  That part was not clearly written on the menu.  Keep in mind that the grilled items are good, but tiny, only coming in one or two pieces.  They limit the amount certain premium fish you are allowed to order, such as uni.  

Our server was really anal about making sure we ate all the rice from the sashimi.  We wanted to order more because we knew it would take time for the items to come out from the kitchen.  But before she took down our order, she noticed we still had some pieces we had not finished yet.  She decided she would take on the roll of the Rice Police and yell at us to finish our food.

AYCE sushi dinner for $27 is a steal especially when you're in vegas!  The sushi chefs are friendly, quick with your order, and use quality fish.  The only thing that I don't like about this place is that seating is very limited and expect to wait before you get a chance to sit down.  We came in on a Monday night and still had to wait about 10 minutes. 

I definitely recommend getting 1\/2 orders of all the rolls so you can try more without getting too full too quickly.  Since it is AYCE, it's your chance to try some of the more expensive items on the menu.  Just see what sounds good to you and order!  Some of my favorites were the pork belly, seared tuna, sexy girl roll and the rainbow roll.  I also tried the uni (sea urchin) since it's also apart of the AYCE menu and too expensive to order for me normally.  It's very interesting.... creamy and reminds you of the ocean. 

Lastly, be careful of what and how much you order... if there are leftovers you will be charged the retail price of each item.",2,1,1

I was on hold for 15 minutes and she didn't bother to check if i'm still on the line or not..so I hung up after that and called back again..probably 25 times..just to check and see if she put back the receiver phone or how long she'll put me on hold if I didn't hung up..so, i keep calling.

I told him what happened and how horrible their customer service is that they should do something about it.

PRO TIP FOR FATTIES LIKE US: if you order a crap ton of sushi like my family does then sit at the table and not the sushi bar. Sitting at the sushi bar means you order direct from the sushi chef which can be awkward if you place multiple big orders. We sit at the table and place our order from the server which is less awkward. 

The only downside is the wait is crazy long on weekends. They also ran out of uni one evening (included in the dinner price) and wouldn't compensate for this in some way whether through an extra order of sweet shrimp or anything.

If you download their waitlist app you can check how many parties are before you. They call or text parties when their table is ready so most parties wait in their car. Don't be fooled by the empty front desk: there are usually dozens of parties before you.",1,1,1

Usually its worth it for Salmon Belly but if you're starving this might be the place to go. 

After our 40 min wait we were seated at a table for 6 even though we had 7 people. Tight fit! We were immediately greeted and asked our orders. We all just placed one large order and waited for them to have it out. It took them 10-20 mins for them to have it ready, It all came in small waived but that worked out for our group and table size. As soon as we were done with one plate another would come. They also kept checking if we wanted to order more so that it would be ordered to keep consistent.

They were busy and couldn't really keep up with our refills but they did a decent job. We ordered a lot of sushi, but unfortunately they ran out of the main reason why we were even there... Salmon Belly... *sigh* We did however get to order a lot of desert so that was nice. Personally the price was good for all the food that we ordered, but I wasn't too impressed. The wait time itself wasn't the best, and the size of fish slices on our Nigiri wasn't the best either. I don't have a problem coming back here because the taste of the sushi was good, just wish they had bigger portions. I mean it is all you can eat so can't expect huge pieces.",0,0,0

My boyfriend and I decided to try this place after seeing very good reviews and pictures about the quality of the sushi here. For AYCE sushi I would expect shitty quality for sushi but nah I was wrong. Their menu was so extensive for all you can eat! And the crazy thing about it is its $25 per person! So you have to come very hungry to eat the all you can eat. 

Service was decent. We didn't really need a server since we sat at the sushi bar but the sushi chef was okay. He was very attentive and helpful about choosing the sushi. Plus sitting at the sushi bar for all you can eat is a good thing because you get more attention and you get your food right away.

It seems to me that this place doesn't care to TRY anymore ever since business has bloom.  And that's a shame because they shouldn't be so jaded with all these other competition in the valley.

Truthfully I can't remember any of the roll names BUT I can tell you that they were all so yummy--they would have to be if I feel they are replacing other well known AYCE places in the #1 spot. 

One thing that I did not enjoy at all was one of the shrimp nigiri. It was the only one that you're allowed to get only one order of: sweet shrimp. The texture was very gelatinous and the flavor made me want to puke as I felt i was consuming someone's phlegm. Gross. Thinking about it makes me want to gag.

- Ecstasy Roll (Oh. My. Godddddd.)

- Green Tea Ice Cream
- GREAT Hot, Freshly Brewed Tea
- You pretty much can't go wrong with about anything on the menu

If you are worried about the freshness of an all you can eat sushi bar- just to put your mind at ease, these guys get anywhere from 1-2 shipments of fresh fish DAILY. Flown in. Yeah. 

I'm from California, and, no joke, we make sure to rent a car when we fly into Vegas just because we want to drive out to this place during our stay so often that it is cheaper than getting a cab. Yeahhhh, it's that good. Haha!! 

I could go into a long spiel about how unbelievable this place is, and how wonderful and accommodating the entire staff is, but when it gets down to it, this place offers you amazing, fresh food at an insanely reasonable price. That's all you need to know really. I come here every, single trip to Vegas, and is often the reason we even plan trips to Vegas.

Sushi House Goyemon offers $21.95 45-minute AYCE for lunch (11:45 AM to 4 PM) and $26.95 60-minute AYCE for dinner (4 PM to 3 AM - last order @ 2:30 AM). Sea urchin (aka uni), sweet shrimp, and pork belly are only available for dinner. I will say that 45-minute is enough time to try whatever rolls or appetizers you want to order on the menu. 

Our group came here 15 minutes before opening time and there was already a small crowd  eagerly waiting to get in. Luckily there were enough tables & seats to accommodate every customers. We placed lots of various sushi & appetizer orders and the staff only got 80% of our orders correctly. It was a minor hiccup because we just ordered for our missing items again. Oh one good thing to mention - I really enjoyed my complimentary hot tea.
 
*** $21.95 45-Minute AYCE Lunch ***

Nigiri (white tuna, seared tuna): Pretty fresh fishes, but the ratio among rice, vinegar, and fish were not very balanced.

Eel hand roll : Generous portion with lots of eel. One of the items I would definitely recommend.

Scallops: Not bad, but too much vinegar.

Spicy tuna roll: It can get VERY spicy if you ask for fully loaded spicy level. Ignoring the spicy level, it was a very solid spicy tuna roll.

Steamed Shumai: Meh ... would not order this again.

Lychee Sorbet: Tasted a bit chewy and icy ... could be worse, but didn't blow my mind.

***

A solid 3.5-star for me, but I will round up to 4-star due to somewhat decent fish quality. Overall this is a good quality AYCE sushi place with lots of missing orders.

The inside is actually quite nicely decorated in a simple yet well-appointed Japanese style.

We ordered the All You Can Eat Lunch for $26.95\/ pp. You really can't go wrong here. Order from the whole menu and the only restriction is the time limit of 45 minutes.

Been to this place a few times that I've already got through a couple stamp cards with friends and family.  The last visit was probably late last year with group of friends.  That was the last time I fully enjoyed this place. It used to be my favorite sushi spot in Vegas.

AYCE is the way to go when dining at Goyemon. Tried the seared salmon salad and it was delicious but a little too much dressing for my taste.  Specialty rolls galore. I'd have to say my favorite is the Sexy Girl.  Salmon skin hand roll was blah, no flavor but the right amount of gobo.  It's nice because they do do half rolls. I took my bff from Boston here yesterday and sat next to a couple who ordered many times but all half rolls. Smart couple. 

I LOVE their spicy tuna rice cracker but unfortunately it's only on their dinner menu.  Pork belly is hit or miss for me there (also only on the dinner menu). I love it when it's super tender but have had orders when it's more on the chewy or burnt side. Bff and I ordered nigiri which I don't normally order.  We did enjoy the garlic tuna, super white was OK, she enjoyed the cajun albacore. I was sad that my green tea ice cream which I always look forward to was half melted by the time I got it and BFF didn't expect her tempura ice cream to be soggy as opposed to the crunchy outside she expected :(

The reason I didn't give a 5 star rating as I would've last year is that the service went downhill. I remember staff being more attentive with filling my water and more friendly upon entering the restaurant.  Might be a while before I make another visit...",1,0,1

It's pretty standard for AYCE sushi, with the prices and selection.  But what makes these guys different than every other place I've tried in town is the grilled fish menu on the AYCE.  

These little bites of grilled fishes are some of the best food I have ever had.  It is just as fresh as their nigiri, but marinated and sauced up, and a nice cooked flavor.  Definitely try the pork belly and the cajun salmon....but even the grilled tofu is good, and I don't usually like tofu.

Service is hit or miss...sometimes they are really busy, and you will receive orders over 20min later, so make sure you remember what you ordered during each round...they don't really forget, just takes a while to the table on certain days.  Other days, the service is pretty good, so again, hit or miss.

Also, they have an extended dessert menu on the AYCE, which includes a chocolate mousse, a definite must have if you come visit.

Lots of parking in the strip mall.  At around 6 most of the tables were taken but the sushi bar had space for us.  Tried a couple of rolls and ordered a few appetizers at first.  Noticed that the hand rolls had proportionally more rice than the larger rolls and that the larger rolls had proportionally more rice than the nigiri so ended up only ordering nigiri after that.

Highlights: maguro ahi, white tuna, and (best of all) unagi eel nigiri.  The shrimp tempura was a good side but the pork belly was too fatty and the fried shumai tasted like the frozen stuff.  Tried the vanilla creme (pretty good) and ice cream tempura (never again) but by then was so full we should have left already.

After several years, Sushi House Goyemon still has it! All-you-can-eat sushi is its own category. I would typically rather pay more for less sushi of a better quality than AYCE, but a few times each year I inevitably end up in an AYCE joint. Goyemon has been the standard for a while now. Recently I ate at a couple other AYCE spots due to convenience and exploration, only to come back to Goyemon with my love when I had AYCE Sushi-loving family in town.

Goyemon's selection of options, quality of product, and freshness of sushi items make them the best in Vegas. Unfortunately, the word has been out for years now and they are very popular. We came in on a weekday at 2pm in the afternoon and experienced a 45 minute wait for a table of 8. The service can also be hit or miss. We started off with attentive service and several rounds of food. The longer we stayed the more active we had to become in order to place the orders we wanted.

I love that Goyemon has a specials board that usually has some premium items on it for sushi as well as for grilled items. In fact, they have one of the largest selections of non-sushi appetizers and small plates for AYCE. If you are a fan of Uni and Ami Ebi, both items can be ordered on the dinner menu, which they will serve at non-dinner hours as long as you are willing to pay dinner pricing. 

Whenever I've been in we have always ordered aggressively--starting with a lot and continuing to place orders early on. I have only ever encountered the issue of finishing all the food. I have friends that have complained about difficulties in ordering food or how long it takes for some items to make it out. I can see how this might be an issue, but I also think it can be easily avoided. They have a one hour time-limit, and if they are busy enough to enforce that one-hour limit they will usually asked for your last order with around 15 minutes left. Again, be proactive, keep a general sense of the time and order anything else you might want with about 20 minutes left. They will let you stay a reasonable amount of time to finish your food if you do this and the final orders are brought just before or even after the one hour mark. If you're reactive in life things won't go as well for you...not just in AYCE sushi, but in everything you do...after all, everywhere you go, there you are. I can certainly understand if you would prefer a less hectic, more relaxed setting to enjoy your AYCE sushi, but just know that the sushi won't be as good.

All-you-can-eat is admittedly not my thing. There is no where else I would rather go for AYCE, so is Goyemon deserving of 5 stars?...I don't know...for me I'd rather spend my money at other sushi spots in town that I consider 5 star places.",21,14,19

I think the main difference is that you can't order sweet shrimp or uni for lunch unless you want to pay the dinner price.

It was so easy for us to get our money's worth here, and the quality was great for AYCE sushi!  They have a huge menu filled with nigiri, specialty rolls, appetizers, and dessert.  One caveat, you have to finish EVERYTHING or else they'll charge you a la carte prices.  Do not leave the rice behind.

The nigiri we ordered:
-  Super white tuna (ono) x6 - my favorite!  We ordered 6 orders of this.  
-  Salmon x3 - it was ok; kind of mushy.
-  Seared salmon x1 - good sear, brought out the flavors\/oils of the salmon.
-  Albacore x1 - good
-  Yellowtail x3 - very fresh.
-  Unagi x3 - good

The rolls we ordered (the great thing is - you can order HALF orders so you can try more varieties!!) - they were also really generous with the raw fish they put in the rolls:
-  Moon roll x1 - if you like unagi, get this.
-  Lemon roll x2 - our favorite!!  if you like yellowtail and salmon with a citrus ponzu sauce, get this.
-  Supreme salmon roll x1 - if you like salmon on salmon, get this
-  Dragon roll x1 - if you like unagi, get this.
-  Volcano roll x2 - if you like baked scallops and mayo, get this
-  Moment roll x1 - if you like crunchy rolls, get this
-  Chubby roll x1 - if you like shrimp tempura, avocado, and salmon with a slight kick wrapped in a gargantuan roll, get this.

Sides:
-  Vegetable tempura - came with 5 pcs - I got carrot, sweet potato, onion, asparagus, and green bean.
-  Miso soup - watered down.

We didn't have room for dessert, but they had red bean ice cream, green tea ice cream, tempura ice cream, and ice cream mochis on the menu when we came.

I just feel that with an imposed time limit for AYCE you really don't want to worry about being able to get the chef's attention since the wait to get your roll is still pretty solid once you do place the order, unless it is nigiri. I liked the scallop rolls Jessie had and 911 and Athena were solid. I think the rolls and the names are pretty much identical to Sushi-Mon who only had slightly higher rating from me due to better\/faster service.",5,3,4

Thankfully on a Thursday night at 6pm my wife and I were able to be seated quickly without a wait! 

The price for the AYCE sushi menu is $26 per person(a great price!) honestly, I was incredibly surprised by how amazing the meal was! Every piece of sushi was delicious and not packed full of rice like many other AYCE places are(there is a rule that you have to eat all of the rice. If you don't you're charged extra, but this wasn't a problem at all for us, again due to the small amount of right included with every piece of sushi). 

I especially loved the scallops and yellow tail sushi, and the pork belly was to die for! This is the best AYCE sushi restaurant I've ever been too, even better than many other non-AYCE sushi restaurants I know of. Check this place out, you won't be disappointed!!!",3,0,2

And it's out here, in the desert. LOL

My boyfriend and I tend to stay away from specialty rolls because they typically taste the same and they just take up room in our belly real estate.

The things that impressed me here was:
- The freshness of the sushi, even out here in the desert.
- The fact that it's an AYCE place but the sushi chefs still make the perfectly proportioned nigiri. They don't try to stuff you with rice so that you get full faster. They keep the integrity of the sushi and keep the proportions the same throughout the meal.
- Some people say service slowed down as the meal went on, but we didn't feel that at all. The service was great throughout the meal.
- The actual food-- as described in the following.
- They have stamp cards! Even though we're not local, we asked for one because we come out to Vegas a lot.

We had tons of nigiri.
The salmon was good, but the salmon belly was fatty and delicious. We loved the yellowtail. The tuna was good, but wasn't our favorite. The albacore was good, nothing special. White tuna was good too. The scallops and the kanpachi weren't bad, but we're not huge fans of those to begin with.
You HAVE to look at the blackboard. They list the specials for the day. I was sad because they didn't have the blue fin tuna or the toro (fatty tuna). But they had the salmon belly and the kanpachi.
We also had the sweet shrimp and uni, which are part of the regular menu, but the portions are limited. 1 serving per person (which consists of two pieces per person).

The braised pork belly was ON POINT. It was fatty, flavorful, and delicious.

Also, the dessert was awesome. I had the green tea creme brulee which was amazing. I love creme brulees to start with! We also had a vanilla mochi ice cream. It's probably store-bought, but I loved the flavor of the vanilla bean. I was extremely satisfied. Next time I'll try the lychee sorbet.

This isn't to say that there weren't bad parts about the experience:
- The miso soup was bland.
- The baked mussels were slightly bland. They weren't BAD, but I probably wouldn't order them again.
- The chicken yakitori... it's just chicken doused in teriyaki sauce. Not impressed.
- THE WAIT: We got there and there seemed to be just one group in front of us, but it took 45 minutes for us to sit down. It's such a small venue, you have to expect a wait.

Even with the ""cons,"" I still love the food here. I'll be back here for sure, it's on my ""MUST GO"" list along with the Oyster Bar.",2,0,1

Having said that, ayce gives you the opportunity to try new things that you wouldn't try if ordering from the menu a la carte, so get the all you can eat once, try it all, the good, the bad, the ugly, pick the winners and next time you go back you'll impress your girlfriend by ordering only the best, and if she's not impressed by your sushi expertise, don't worry you can always get you a new girlfriend......there's plenty of fish in the sea.

Sushi - fish pieces are pretty big, but there is also a fair amount of rice. When doing AYCE the rice can be a pain. Fish is good quality and very tasty. Favorites include eel, super white, and cajun albacore.

Rolls - they have a way with sauces! They do a good job of mixing flavors and textures.  Great selection and good variety. Favorites include lasagna, lisa lisa, and pastel.

Apps - good selection of apps and they all are on AYCE menu. 

Dessert - nice selection of mochi and other special deserts. I cant get enough of their strawberry mochi and green tea ice cream. Also, as a bonus, dessert is all you can eat too!

*Thumbs down*
There will likely be a wait during peak hours, so make sure you're not dying of frickin' starvation. If you know what's up, don't fill up on fried stuff, just load up on as much fish and sushi as possible. It's AYCE sushi, so don't compare it to a regular, high quality sushi spot.",3,2,2

I'm a big fan of AYCE Sushi, whereas my friends are more into individual rolls at really nice Sushi places-almost Sushi snobs. Now I love individual rolls as much as the next guy, it's just I can't afford to always pay for 2 or 3 individual rolls, knowing that the bargain hunter in me wants to take an establishment for all it's worth when AYCE is involved. I love being able to sit for a long time, and take my sweet ass time ordering Sushi and the sides to my hearts content. 

I would totally eat here for lunch, except I only have 45 minutes for lunch, and I like to take my time eating sushi, nigiri,sashimi and Side dishes. So I save Goyemon for times with my friends who like to chow down too. And Yes, AYCE places do have a tendency to have slightly lower quality per roll, but-knowing that you just ate about $100 of sushi for a mere $26.95(dinner) or $21.95 lunch- brings a smile to my face every time! I'm happy eating grocery store sushi, so I'm not picky...and Yes I do know what amazing sushi tastes like.

I do love there open seven days a week, I do love the courteous and prompt server girls that barely speak any english, and I do love the fact that there is almost nothing on the menu that is off limits, some piece do however have a limit of 1, or 1 per order. 

I like to go in with a totally empty stomach, which can be bad at times if you don't like to wait. Usually the wait at Goyemon is about 15-25 minutes depending on what night of the week. One drawback is that it's a pretty small sushi place as far as sushi places go, and the bigger the group the longer the wait due to the limited though intimate space. Take note that if you waster food, they WILL charge you for excess waste-which is pretty standard in most places.

Another thing you can do is order the next round as you get an order placed in front of you. I like to do a sampler of a little bit of everything, but some of my best friends go straight for the jugular skipping any roll with rice and ordering Nigiri & Sashimi (Unagi, Salmon, Tuna, and Urchin) plate after plate after plate. My personal favorites are the Volcano Roll (baked YUM!) The Dragon Roll, and Salmon Roe.

One of the things I did notice is that if you order the most expensive stuff on the menu over and over, it comes out very quickly at first, and as each order goes in, they take more and more time to get it out to you.

But, seeing how there's no time limit...you've got time to spare! ;) Also, if it's your first time there, sometimes you'll space off and not realize a roll is 8 pieces, so if you want to try everything, ask for a 1\/2 roll (4 pcs) so you can pick two rolls at a time.

On top of it all, you get a cool little atmosphere, great for hanging with friends, and nice hustle and bustle by the staff, and round it all out with dessert (I love the Red Bean Ice Cream!) and leave a fat & happy Buddha belly!

I love bringing people here! Be sure to check out the awesome sword in glass in the wall in the men's bathroom!

Cheers!

Let's face it.... the fish is just better and fresher in Cali or on the east coast..... 

HOWEVER, and here comes a HUGE 'however', one thing I can say for sure is that Goyemon is by far the best sushi place in all of Las Vegas. I've tried the places up and down Las Vegas Blvd., the local spots in the Chinatown area, and I've even tried several places that non-Asians say are so amazing in Henderson.... GOYEMON IS THE NUMBER ONE SUSHI HOUSE, trust me on this. Well don't trust only me, trust the other 256 reviews that say something similar ;). 

I wouldn't go with any other option than their generous all-you-can-eat specials, $27 per person for dinner, and this includes almost everything your sushi-loving heart desires. All sushi, specialty rolls, appetizers, salads, items from the daily specials board, samplings from the grill, vegetables, dessert, etc., etc., etc.!! The variety they offer is unbeatable, and the quality of the food is fantastic for the buck. 

We've already been here a few times and we can NOT go without the salmon and unagi sushi, some shumai, the 9-1-1 roll (beware! it's hot even for a spice freak like me!), grilled calamari, pork belly, yellowtail from the grill, cajun salmon, grilled asparagus and mushrooms, garlic tuna sushi, and much more on top of that. I can honestly say their samplings of the pork belly may be some of the best I've ever had. Same goes for their mushrooms and grilled calamari. 

$4.95 COCKTAILS!! I enjoy my AYCE meal with a SAKETINI for just under $5. Not common to be having a martini of all gin and sake for that low of a price! 

mmMmmmMMMmm desserts. Just when you think you've had enough, don't leave without trying the green tea cake and the green tea creme brulee. They are simply fantastic. 

The service is hit or miss. It's always at least decent, but sometimes it can be great because the server is willing to work with you and be more attentive to your needs. For example, last night, our server was friendly, informative, and lenient (he was not trying to force-feed our last 2 pieces of food because of the 'rules' of all-you-can-eat, though we did end up finishing them anyway), and although we were there for the last hour, he was patient and took our orders over and over again without hesitation. Even the food runner was able to take a few orders here and there. We never felt for a second that we waited too long, were being rushed, or that they were casually stalling (some AYCE sushi places definitely stall when approaching your table for reordering). 

*** Expect to wait! I would avoid going during peak business hours. Go for early or late dinner, or even late-night because they are open until 3am and last order for AYCE is at 2am everyday! This place is quite the commodity and people will be waiting 1+ hour(s) to be seated whether you go on a weekday or weekend.

Don't forget to receive your special card that they stamp for every AYCE meal so you can eventually enjoy it all over again for FREE! My boyfriend and I already can't wait for that day to come :)",3,1,1

The major issue is the service. All the servers have extreme attitude and would just throw the food on the table and walk away, not even explaining what it was. That was if the food even showed up at all. Orders apparently went missing even though we were here for lunch and it was slow. The guys behind the sushi bar were on their phones... shouldn't take 20 mins to get two orders of Nigiri. AYCE is 45 mins so make sure you order everything the moment you get here since it takes the full 45 to even receive anything.

The fish quality here is pretty good. I would say that it is on par with some of the best AYCE sushi spots back in SoCal, if not better. The ratio between fish & rice was perfect. It was not too much fish or not too much rice. The rolls were a bit disappointing though. The presentation was not quite as good as I expected and the taste was whatever. I would recommend ordering from the starters (miso soup, seaweed salad, etc), nigiri, or hand rolls. 

The service was pretty good. I read some reviews before heading here and was expecting the worst service known to man, but it was the exact opposite. There was a bus boy continuously running around clearing our table and filling our waters. We had 2 separate waiters constantly checking on us and putting in our orders. Our orders were coming out only a few minutes after we placed them (consistently). 

My girlfriend pointed out a sign that mentioned that they were out of ""Uni until further notice due to bad season",1,1,1

The basics that me & my hubby usually get at sushi places (tuna poke, seaweed salad, miso, etc) were very good if not BETTER than their equivalents at the other 5 or so sushi places we've tried here in Vegas. We ate at the bar and our sushi chef (I think his name was Juan, a young Hispanic man) was very attentive, polite and intelligent.  He was taking multiple orders from multiple customers at once and getting them all out quickly and accurately.  Plus, he told us something we've never hear at a sushi place before: that we could add or subtract whatever we want from the rolls on the AYCE menu and he would make them to order.  How awesome is that!
And I loved that this place had many rolls with ingredients you don't see every day at the other places in town.  And all the new ones we tried were very tasty.  Oh, and there were some unique items on the dessert menu too which were also delicious!
The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is that the servers were kind of slow.

Dinner 4pm-3am $26.95 AYCE!!!! 
Best deal in town

This place is the BOMB!!! I will come back here every time I come to Las Vegas because it is literally the best AYCE sushi place in the city, and just off the strip. You usually have to wait a while for a table, but if you're eating at the bar, you can go right in if there's seats open. 

I recommend not ordering too much off the menu right when you sit down. You have to finish everything or they will charge you ala carte prices, so you should order from the sushi chef as you go. You can order half-rolls so that you can try more types of specialty rolls without filling up so fast, and you can even order 1 rather than 2 nigiri at a time. 

Don't get the spicy tuna roll because it's just a plain roll with nothing else in it. The pork belly was just o-kay...it wasn't super special and it's just too greasy. The tempura ice cream is not that great either--the tempura batter isn't crispy, just bready. Next time I'll just get 1 or 2 mochi ice cream, because the green tea ice cream that I had wasn't a strong green tea flavor, more on the bland side. 

The $5 sake I got was such a generous amount, I kind of regretted ordering it since it made me feel full too fast. I should have gotten the smaller size. 

But all-in-all, despite my ordering blunders, I really REALLY enjoyed this place. Go for the unagi, amaebi, hotate, and ikura. Super duper fresh, generous, and artfully done. 

Mostly locals come here, so the party next to us asked how we heard about it. They were regulars. It's a small place, so go early if you have a larger party, or sit at the bar if you're on a hot date. It's worth every minute and every penny!!!",6,1,1

The reason for the 3-4 stars is due to consistency. If you come at a bad time\/day then it's a 3 star, but if you come on a good day its more like 4-5 star. But true to Vegas, it's a gamble... you never know what you're going to get. But to increase your odds of getting a better experience, coming at dinner during a busier day (Friday-Sunday) actually gets a better experience because you'll get better food even though you'll have to wait longer.

The food here is great if you come on a good day but if it's not, then it's just ok. The just ok is still on par with other AYCE sushi places, but the great days are above and beyond better. The must orders with AYCE are an order of amaebi and uni (only one order per person) and the pork belly. The amaebi is good but nothing special (but you HAVE to order it since you're limited to one anyways) and the uni is actually pretty good for an all AYCE sushi place. The pork belly is AMAZING though on those great days- it's just melt in your mouth delicious. I would do the AYCE sushi just to eat all the pork belly if it wasn't going to kill me!!! LOL

We don't order rolls with AYCE anymore, meaning we only get the nigeri for the sushi portion and some side dishes. I think the nigeri is a good size with the proper amount of rice. We usually order some salmon, super white tuna, albacore, yellowtail, and fresh scallop. Of those, I think the super white tuna and fresh scallop are consistently good, the others are sometimes good and at other times a little fishy (no pun intended). If you're lucky and you come on one of those great days, they'll have Toro on the specials board and OMG the toro is SOOOO good and worth it. You HAVE to order the toro if it's available! As for the side dishes, we usually just order the tempura shrimp and miso soups along with a bunch of orders of the pork belly.

Lastly, the great thing about Goyemon is that it comes with dessert! I really enjoy the Yuzu or ginger ice cream, or the creme brulee if they have it available on their specials. Otherwise the mochi ice cream is good too. If you're in the mood to go to an AYCE sushi place, I would recommend coming to Goyemon- particularly on those busier days if you don't mind the wait!",0,0,0

The freshness of their fish offering was acceptable and better than most other ayce places but lacked personality. I know this isn't Kabuto, but please make it more interesting than fish on inconsistently seasoned warm rice. After several orders of nigiri, we ordered a tuna roll to see how they would approach that. It was stuffed FULL of tuna with sesame seeds on it and the quality of the fish was pretty good. I enjoyed the skip jack nigiri most but that was taken off the chalkboard after only one order. Of everything we had, that was the best but really left me missing the uni as that was the entire reason we wanted sushi. An order of pork belly with a really decadent sauce ended our dinner course.

Although their menu is very extensive and broad with variety, I believe I have selected my fair share of must have items after about a dozen visits.  

Ecstasy roll is always what I order first. Tuna based roll with a topping of seaweed salad and roe finished in a light creamy sauce. Truly fulfilled the expectation of a food high. 

Salmon skin hand roll is simple but just done so right and deliciously.  

Pork belly is absolutely craveable. Seriously amazing product and execution on the grill. Comes perfectly glistening in a slightly sweet and savory sauce with a refreshing acidic mango salsa to tame that rich, meaty, umami unctuousness. 

All of the deserts are excellent. My favorites being the chocolate mousse, mochi ice cream, and especially the Yuzu sherbet. Its the perfect citrusy, light palate cleanser to end your meal after eating all the fatty fresh fish you can handle. 

Service is really a hit or miss, as well as the wait times, which, at some visits have been disappointing enough to effect the whole meal feel vibe, and having sushi kaya as another frequent option\/alternative.",2,0,0

Nowhere on their door or policies does it say ""last seating for all you can eat is at 2 a.m. and all of your party has to be here in order to do ayce."" Erving is the worst manager and is not accommodating at all. I was sitting at the table before 2 a.m. and he waited until 2 a.m. to greet me so that I couldn't get the option to do ayce. Then he continued to tell me that I couldn't have ayce bc my friend wasn't sitting with me at the table by 2 a.m. Soooo I asked if I could do it since I was there on time and my friend was gonna do ala carte. He tried to say that I wasn't here on time when I had proof that I was lol. Pathetic.

What's the point of being open until 3 a.m. if you pretty much stop service at 2 a.m.? So worthless. I would go anywhere else if there were more sushi places open late. Starve yourself and wait until the next day when a better sushi restaurant is open haha. Don't waste your time here.

Already the place was packed and we were told that the wait was an hour. So we were given the option to sit at the bar. I thought it was better way for we got superb service in getting our rolls because the chefs were literally right in front of us.

We opted for the AYCE ($21.95) lunch option which was from 11:45 am to 6 pm. According to the menu, you had 45 minutes to alotted time to do the AYCE which didnt make sense because we were there for at least an hour.

What is good to mention is that most of the rolls you can get you have the option of getting a half (4 pieces) or full (8 pieces) roll. I strongly recommend that you get the half rolls so that you have more chances of trying more rolls. Some rolls are only available as a full (refer to menu for they clearly state which ones are not available for half orders). 

As for what I ordered. Man, I will only tell the names but not describe them because this review would go on forever! That's what's good about doing the ayce option because you can try just about everything!

What I got for starters were the Garlic Edamame, Fried Calamari, Ahi Poke, and Shrimp Tempura. Then, we got half orders of the Taylor Roll, Sexy Girl, and Frying Jason, Then full rolls only for the Spider Roll and Pixie Roll. We also tried one order (2 pieces) of the Seared Ahi. Lastly, we finished it up with 2 pieces of Strawberry Mochi.

Originally, we wanted a table so we can all hang out much more comfortably while we ate, but after sitting at the bar, I think we got our orders much faster for the chefs actually hand you your order instead of your server grabbing it and bringing it out to your table. If you are at the bar, the servers are mainly there to get your drinks, appetizers, and dessert. 

Overall, I think that this will be the measuring stick to other sushi places that I will be trying out. The only negative thing that might deserve a mention is the wait time. But after eating here, I can understand why it can be a long wait for they serve good stuff  and the overall size of the place is not that big. Shout outs to Bethany E and her hubby Mike for inviting us to lunch! You guys are awesome!

We arrived around 6pm and there's a line already, the wait will be 30 mins & i left my number for them.  I received a text from Goyeman immediately and we can check how many people ahead of us by noshlist.com, very convenience! 

We got seated at the sushi bar area, that is the best seats if u have a small party.  We ordered sushi from the sushi chef and appetizers from the server.  Our server was very attentive and patient to explain the menu to us, the chef was great too, he kept feeding us (lol) and made sure we got all our orders.  

Quality of the sushi is superb! Fish is fresh, sushi had the right portion of fish and rice, and chefs did great jobs on the presentation as well.  Salmon kama was very juicy and not dry at all.  Grill calamari, shitaki mushroom, gyoza, tofu were delicious as well! 

Sadly we can only order 1 sweet shrimp & 1 uni suchi per person, because they are really goooood... And if u want soft shell crab, it has to come with a roll, cant order just by itself.  No oyster on the menu either.  

Green tea creme brulee was good but hubby preferred the coconut mochi.",1,0,1

My husband is a fan of this place & comes here every time he is in Vegas. We came to Vegas for a family trip so of course we came here to eat. I don't know if they switched owners or what's going on, but service was absolutely horrible today. 

It took over an hour for our FIRST round of orders to come out. We complained twice about how slowly they're bringing out our food and both times, no apology.

We put in our second order, but after 20 minutes of putting in our second order, no food. We ended up just leaving without eating our second round of sushi because it was taking too long. 

We wasted 1.5 hours here.

Cons 
- Emptied dishes never be picked up on table even the table is covered with emptied dishes.
- Staffs are unfriendly and completely ignore the customers. They walk away even they see you waving your hands for request.
- Foods take more than 20mins even the business goes slow.
- Mochi ice creams take 40mins to arrive including the time we request for the desserts twice.

Pros
- The dishes are served in a very decent good portion.

Lastly, I personally do not refer this buffet restaurant to any of my friends. I own a customer service - oriented business in north Cali. I seriously concern about their quality of business if I'm the boss of this place when I know my staffs are ruining the reputation of the business.

With all the hype around Goyemon, I decided to try it out with a few friends that were in town. We threw down on many sushi rolls that night. 

Restaurant is small, good for parties of 2-4 people but it seems that when big groups come in they have trouble managing. Service was a bit slow, but it was to be expected, as it was a full house.

Sushi is good, but that's about all you can say to describe it. Very generic menu that you see at most AYCE places up and down Spring Mountain. Not complaining, but nothing that is really a WOW factor. We ordered about 10 different rolls in all. The waitress stared at me in disbelief, like I'm some sort of human garbage disposal. She's not wrong.

We ordered mostly nigiri - garlic tuna, salmon, salmon roe, whitie tuna, tamago. The staff went above and beyond our expectations as they caught the fish and prepared them all on the spot! They even milked the salmon for the eggs. They took time to grow, harvest,  skin, and slice the ginger to perfection, which is also why it took 30 minutes to get a small side of ginger. FYI, I did some research and did you know that ginger takes 8-10 months to grow! We got it in 30 minutes! AMAZING!

The staff was so great that they saved the best for last. After we got our dessert and the check, they brought out the unagi. They already took away our chopsticks and plates, so we had to eat our unagi with our dessert spoons. It's a bit unconventional, but very creative.

We expected a normal, 1 hour dinner. But instead, they took the extra time to make sure we received the full blown 8-course meal style, 5-star, dining experience for 2 hours. We were impressed with their unforgettable service!",3,19,0

I was torn between 3 to 4 stars but in the end it was just mediocre. I went in thinking it wasn't going to stack up at all next to my beloved local sushi spot. I was pleasantly surprised at times and at other times I wanted to be teleported back to my sushi spot. 
 
There were 6 of us who ordered the AYCE option. The stand outs were the super white  tuna sashimi and the garlic tuna sashimi. 
The spicy tuna on crispy rice was good however our spot does it better and brings the heat with the addition of a jalapeño slice. Speaking of heat, the 911 roll was talked up to be incredibly spicy. It had some heat but I've had spicier and this was their only spicy roll which was a bit disappointing. The other rolls left me wanting more, more flavor, more combinations, and better presentation. They all tasted very plain to me. 
Clicks heels three times ::: I want to go home, I want to go home, I want to go home.

The garlic edamame tasted like it was sautéed in olive oil and garlic, it too left something to be desired. 

The options of deserts were a nice ending to the meal. I typically don't do desert at our local spot but it was part of the AYCE so why not. The chocolate mousse and green tea creme brûlée were both good. However not outstanding. 

For everything I ate spending only $30 before tip was a good deal. Sometimes you do have to spend more to get more.",3,0,2

I walked in on a Thursday night and the place was packed. Luckily, one lone spot at the sushi bar was calling out to me. 

Everything I tried was good (except for the uni... but I'm just not a fan of it).

Grilled pork belly - Amazing! One of the best pork belly dishes I've ever had... succulent, juicy, tender, crispy edge, perfect amount of fat... It comes with a mango salsa, but it doesn't need it at all. Eating the pork by itself is the way to go.

Uni - I'm not a fan, but wanted to give it another shot since I've only had it a handful of times previously. After trying it here, I still don't like it. It was too salty and texture is not the least bit appealing.

Tuna nigiri - fresh, bright, silky texture, not too much rice.

Moon roll - eel, scallop, tempura flakes. Excellent roll, the eel took a backseat to the distinct flavor of the scallop. And, they didn't over-sauce the roll allowing the flavors of the main ingredients to shine.

Orgasm salad - Didn't quite live up to it's name, but still delicious. Nice bit of heat with the spicy chili sauce.

Spicy tuna crispy rice - Loved the crispy rice and the tuna was excellent. Each piece is big and it comes three to an order.

Hamachi nigiri - Wonderfully fresh, generous cuts of fish. The slices of fish were so big I couldn't even see the rice it was sitting on.

Tofu cheesecake - made in house, this dessert was incredibly rich and creamy.

The service and experience at the sushi bar was great. Chef Fredo took time to talk to everyone and explain the menu even though he, and the other chefs, were slammed. This is one off the strip sushi spot not to be missed.",2,1,1

The last time we went, the server messed up the order as well. We ordered a full Sexy girl roll and half a moon roll. They came out with half a sexy girl roll and half of a random roll.

I was recommended by a friend to try this place a few months back and I liked it.

It's the only thing that actually made me want to return again.

So tonight I called in to see if they had the jellyfish nigiri special and they said they did. The price for dinner is $27 for the ayce which I consider pretty steep but I figured I'm only in Vegas twice a year so to have the jellyfish nigiri again I would splurge a little. Drove 20 min. to get there and luckily we got seated right away. To my disappointment I didn't see the special and asked the waitress where it was but they said didn't have it and it was probably a mistake. I can understand that since people make mistakes. Already hungry I figured since we were already there maybe we would just stay anyway. I asked the waitress if she could give us 1 more serving of the uni or amoebi to make it up to us which I think is a really small act but they couldn't even do that.

I can't agree that this is the best AYCE sushi place in the valley, however its certainly top three.  Goyeman boasts a variety on the menu that almost no other AYCE can, with the star of the menu being the braised pork belly.  This is a charcoaly, unctuous, porky explosion of delcious!!  It may be one of the best pork belly presentations I've ever had, and it's included in the menu!  

I thought that a lot of the rolls had way too much rice in them, especially the 5 piece rolls (soft shell crab)  Nothing really stood out to me, and while the quality was fine, I wasn't blown away.  

For how crazy this place gets, the service is very good.  The sushi chefs must be some of the fastest in town.  There is a 60 minute time limit on dinner, which I can understand but I don't like.  Don't order too much off the big menu, you'll get charged for leftover food, even rice.

On to the food.....this is one of the best AYCE places in Vegas in my opinion. Between the appetizers, unique rolls and numerous desserts, there is something for everyone. The quality is great and you can even order sashimi which is not always the case for AYCE. I highly recommend the grilled pork belly. It just melts in your mouth. Yum yum yum! Every roll I had was delicious and fresh. Also they let you order more than one dessert which not all AYCE places do.

I came here with some local friends late night while in vegas.
It seemed like a good idea for AYCE but the quality still felt like AYCE, the only other places I been which was Yama in vegas and Keanyama in Fremont that their all you can eat still tasted like a traditional sushi.

There was a bunch of locals that got off work and drunk people here, the wait time was over 30 minutes and there was only one person in front of us.

The staff was pretty rude, when we asked for more water or utensiles, they didnt have any expressions or any saing just brought it over, no thank you, or how is the food, can I get you anything else, Also We made eye contact quite a few times but they ignored us.( people I was with were all sober locals) so I dont see why the service was so bad.

We had the talked about pork belly which was good, Should have ate way more of that than the sushi.

I would go back if yama isnt open.

We hadn't been here for a while (since JJanga opened) so we decided to give it a go... 

The following things caused my dinner to be a 1 star experience:

-HOT restaurant... I think the AC might be broken so they had floor fans throughout the restaurant but that didn't really help. It was quite stuffy. 
-SLOW service... The servers were so slow and the food from the kitchen came out at a snail pace. Miso soups and salads were ordered at the beginning of the meal and didn't come out till mid way through. Plus we had to flag down the servers for water refills.  
-RUDE sushi chef... We usually love sitting at the bar but our sushi chef, Denis, was not friendly and never acknowledged us. He never answered when we would place an order... He either really didn't want to be there or he can't speak EngRish? 
-QUALITY went downhill... The fish was average at best. They were out of uni, quail egg and yuzu sorbet. The sweet shrimp smelled fishy and nothing was amazing.

We dined in for dinner, with a party of 12 adults and an infant. There are no reservations, so we had to get there and hope for the best. At 5:30, the restaurant was 90% full. That being said, we only wait for 20 mins to get seated as a full party. Awesome. I didn't have any expectations of this place, except that I hoped for $30\/ head it would be decent. They completely surpassed my expectations. Sushi is one of my favorite things to eat, but living the midwest I am limited in the places that have good quality fish, I am usually paying $25 for 2 great rolls at a legit place. So to pay $25 for all you can eat (affectionately dubbed ACYE), I was pretty much in Heaven.

We mainly stuck with Nigiri, and only did a few rolls and apps. I think we ate 15 orders of 2pc Nigiri each!!! The selection of fish is outstanding, and they will even let you order some of the more expensive cuts (toro etc) at least 1 times per person. I consider that pretty generous. Their ""signature"" sauce here was a garlic ponzu, and while it was mighty tasty on the first few orders, it got old really fast. You can ask for the fish and the rice plain for any of the nigiri, which we started doing after a couple of orders. The fish are a nice cut, and thick too. They aren't skimping on you here. They also have hand roll, maki, and baked rolls but we wanted to keep it simple that day.

They even have a Cajun albacore tuna. INCREDIBLE. Like most albacore, it just melts in your mouth. Yum yum yummy.

I also like that you can customize your roll. I trade spicy tuna for regular tuna in the Orion Roll.

The sushi chefs are a bit hit and miss. By this, I mean their personalities. They all make great sushi. Some just have a flat personality, while others actually engage in conversation and make the dining experience at the bar a lot more fun.

All in all, It's a great spot for sushi. I come twice a week!",0,0,0

Yes, the line can be long and painful, but trust me, it's worth it!  Sashimi, nigiri, robata, and sushi rolls all made to order w\/ a great selection of apps and salad to choose from as well.  Food is tasty and the fishes are always the color it should be, they do not serve you stuff that has been sitting out for days.  There is a limit on certain more expensive nigiri items (uni, fresh scallop, amaebi) each person is allowed, but with the great selections Goyemon offers, you will hardly notice the limitation.  Even if you're not a sushi lover, there's still plenty of cooked food options you can choose from so definitely do not be discouraged by this place.  Miso black cod and pork belly are 2 dishes worth trying, along with all their yummy grilled vegetables.  Come after 11pm and you can even indulge in their AYCE ramen from their sister restaurant, Monta.  

Be sure to save room for dessert though as they have a great selection to choose from!  They usually rotate their offerings by season, but their green tea creme brulee, green tea cake, and mochi ice cream are almost always available year round.    

Service can be hit or miss, but put your name down and have them call you when your table is ready.  If you are renting a car, it's best that you drive here, write down your name, and venture to the other strip malls near by.  If not, taking a cab from the strip is still worth it.  Just be sure you don't come here when you are already starving and hangry, come w\/ a light stomach and be prepared to wait at least 30 mins.

Happy eating!",3,1,1

We were very disappointed in the organization of ""first come first serve"" which is not entirely true considering one guest came in and said they had a reservation and the wait was half the time for a table. I was there 15 mins before the rest of my group and although there was an open table I was told I had to wait for everyone to get there. Even when everyone did arrive, we still waited to be seat though our table was sitting open in front of us. The hostess said she didn't want to overwhelm the kitchen but I thought still you could seat is and have the waitress take our drink order? We finally were seated after 10 mins. I have never be forced to stand in the way of the door with my table open right in front of me for 25 mins. The food was great but service was not. We were all worried about getting our order in before the hour window of eating because our waitress barely came to our table. At the end of the meal, we waited ten mins for someone to come take our payment and ended up walking up to the hostess stand to do it ourselves. Very disappointed in first impressions this place made. Make sure you make a reservation since it works sometimes and not others. How is that even fair?",1,0,1

The fish was fresh and that's important as not all AYCE places serve the freshest fish. This is one of the very few gems that do but before you come here, be prepared to put your name on the list with your phone number so they can text you when your table is ready! It's pretty awesome. 

The wait. Up to 2 hours if they're busy but I tell you what.. It's totally worth it. You can pretty much order anything and everything from the several menus plopped on the table. There's quite a few selections so look through them carefully. From appetizers to side dishes to the nigiri, rolls and desserts. It really is a true all encompassing AYCE experience where everything can be ordered. I did notice that the uni and amaebi nigiri can only be ordered once.

My favorite thing of all was actually not the sushi (that's not to say the sushi wasn't good) but the pork belly appetizer which was incredibly fattening, moist and insanely well flavored. If you like Salmon, the Salmon belly is available and sampled both the standard and the belly. If you like fatty and tasty fish, I wholeheartedly recommend the belly. It's got so much flavor! The uni was fresh and quite tasty.

Service was good and efficient. Being that it was me and my brother's first time there, we were kindly informed about the whole process. Our waiter was patient and answered all our questions and we had a few! By the end of the night, we were so full, we still opted for desserts. So yeah, try to pace yourself. Don't just order everything at once. Order in waves!

We came here during EDC week and this place was packed and with good reason. Service is good and so is the food. For $27 per person for dinner, this place is hard to beat and I look forward to coming here whenever I make Vegas my next stop.",4,0,3

Other than that if you got a big appetite and looking to satisfy your craving for Japanese sushi then this is the place to go! Everything here is really good. If you're into the Nigiri sushi, you have to definitely order the SUPER white tuna, Cajun albacore, seared salmon, sea urchin....ahhh whatever just order everything!!!!

Hieu concocted a pickled wasabi and suggested that I only use it on ""fatty"" fish, but I didn't listen and used it on EVERYTHING and even took my friends' pickled wasabi (sorry, not sorry). I loved all the specials that day from the Aji, Blue Fin, Aori Ika, Toro (1 order per person), SALMON BELLY and so much more!!! I dont think I can ever eat normal salmon ever again... Hieu even created some amazing off the menu\/specials for us... then he put it on the menu 10 seconds later so we had the VIP experience for 10sec (better than nothing)...

Bad customer service will overrule good food, and the sushi is just ok. My husband and I just visited there with our 1 year old twins. We needed highchairs and we were told they only have a total of two highchairs. One was taken already, and honestly we should have taken the other just to have at least one. They were going to seat us at too small of a table. Can you parents out there imagine a one year old on your lap at a tiny table for two eating sushi of all things? No thanks. So we decided to wait, but we were told that table will be available to us if we changed our minds.  Two mintues into waiting, the other highchair was taken and so was the table we were offered. They didn't bother to ask if we were sure we didn't want it. 

My husband finally decided we should just sit down and get our orders in because we had already been waiting 35 minutes, with no end in sight. So there we are with 1 year olds in each of our laps.

Basically, my group of 7, devoured every sushi plate that was set before us. For $27, I've had arguably the best sushi I've ever had and it was AYCE!

The venue is pretty small and space fills up really quickly so I recommend getting here pretty early. They do have a 1 hour eating maximum but like I said, if you're devouring sushi like us, 1 hour is plenty or else this place will run out of fish. 

The menu has all kinds of nigri, salmon, tuna, yellow tail, they also have rolls but we didn't really touch those. Additionally, they have seared sushi as well such as the cajun salmon. Furthermore, the pork belly just melts in your mouth. Moreover, the appetizers like miso soup, garlic edamame, and sea weed salad are great side dishes to much on while you're waiting for your orders to come. 

The dessert here is amazing! I rarely, order 2nd servings of desserts but this place made me order 3rd helpings! This place has arguably the best green tea ice cream I've ever had. It was rich, smooth, and did not have that cheap flour taste that other places have. Furthermore, the Yozu sorbet was delicious. I think it was the greatest ice cream dessert I've ever had and I crave for it all the time!

I honestly, felt bad for our waitress as my group became a hungry pack of piranhas. Have you ever seen a pack of Piranhas devour a fish? I would love to add a youtube video here but I rather not give people an upset stomach...  My group has been to most of the popular sushi places in Vegas, Yama, and Koma, and Goyemon is heads above the crowd. 

Hands down the best AYCE sushi. Once you come to this place, no other ayce sushi place can ever compare.

We got seated quickly since there was only 2 of us, and I wanted to minus a star since the service was so slow to get started, and sometimes in between, but their friendly staff made me change my mind though, and also they weren't strict on their ""hour rule.""

The spicy tuna on crispy rice is soooo good!  It's a newer menu item, and I hope it stays permanently!  Oh and if you like spicy, then the 911 roll is SPICY!  My mouth was on fire!  I won't make that mistake again, lol.  Other than that you can't go wrong with the Nigiris, the fish tasted fresh and they the amount of rice they use is appropriate.   Be careful on the amounts you order, they will charge you if you have leftovers.  They were nice to the table next to me, and charged them for only about half the leftovers, but that doesn't mean that will be the same for everyone.
As the desserts go, I was bummed that they were out of strawberry mochi ice cream, which is my favorite flavor!  However,  they had a tofu cheesecake, yes TOFU, it tastes like cheesecake, but slightly lighter\/airy.

This place was the bomb.com! (not trademarked)

My fiance and I stayed at a timeshare directly next to a small shopping center off of Decatur Blvd.  Normally we would go towards the strip to eat at one of the many great places to eat, but we decided to eat nearby on Wednesday evening.  What a great choice that was.  Well, on to the food!

We walked in and were greeted immediately.  Smiles all around and were seated right away.  The hostess asked if we had been there before and we responded no, but we might be returning again in the future.  We sat down and were asked if we planned to order from the ""A la carte"" menu or just going to have the highly recommended ""All you can eat"" menu.  $26.95 for all you can eat?  Sure!  Why not?  We were pleasantly surprised to find out that it wasn't your typical pre-made rolls or crappy appetizers to choose from ... In fact, it was the whole freaking menu!  Everything we had wanted and more!  For $26.95?  Not too shabby!  Now, I am not typically a heavy eater, but when I am on vacation in Las Vegas, I am going to EAT!  

We started by ordering some Salmon and Tuna sushi.  4 Pieces for each of us.  Had some calamari and some edamame to go with it.  The sushi pieces were pretty fresh considering we were in a desert.  The edemame, well it's edemame, you can't really screw it up right?  The calamari was pretty good, nothing to write home about, but I would (will) order it again.  Then we moved onto the rolls and ordered a salmon roll and a specialized roll that I requested.  They didn't have anything on the menu that had Avocado, Mango, and Tuna.  I wanted all of these things together and can normally find a roll with those contents in Orange County at just about any Sushi place.  They conjured it up for me with some mango salsa they had, sliced Avocado, and some good tuna.  The rolls were good in size and pretty flavorful.  This was the point where normally I would think about calling it a night ... but tonight was ALL YOU CAN EAT!  

We moved on to the crazy good stuff.  Grilled pork belly with mango salsa?  Insanely good!  I normally stay away from pork, but the waiter insisted I tried it ... thank you Odin!  (The waiter was named Odin by the way)  And with the pork we had an order of the grilled veggies.  The veggies were amazing.  I don't know how much butter or what type of seasoning they added to these vegetables, but they were so good we immediately ordered another order.  It consisted of asparagus, mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes.  Just for good measure I ordered a few more pieces of sushi just to fill me to the brim.

Last but not least we ordered the desserts.  We had a green tea creme brulee (which was divine) and some green tea ice cream.  The desserts ended the meal perfectly.  All and all we probably ate about $80 worth of food for about $54.  

I have to give a special shout out to Odin.  We had some complications with ordering drinks in the beginning and he was very accommodating and gave some great recommendations.  I left him a huge (well deserved) tip.  Next time we go back to Vegas, we will absolutely have to stop at Goyemon!

The food is great, and the All You Can Eat dinner deal amazing for 26.95. It includes most of the regular menu items, like the yummy pork belly appetizer, and every roll on the menu, of which there are like 100 different kinds.  Plus, the service was fantastic, friendly and fast. 

The pork belly appetizer was juicy and yummy...probably our favorite thing.  I would  recommend ordering it off the regular menu because you get 5 large super juicy pieces that for whatever reason were a bit better than the smaller pieces given on the AYCE version that the hub had. (I ordered off regular menu)

We also liked the spicy tuna on crispy rice, and the shrimp tempura.  Dude loved the mussels so much he ordered an encore, and we both liked the rolls.  We tried the Pixie roll (wrapped in colored soy paper...festive), the Volcano roll, the Sushi Max (tuna w shrimp), and the Sexy Girl roll, which was our fav and had everything but the kitchen sink, but had the cleanest flavor profile, rather than a mish mash with sauce.

This is a peeve of mine about sushi rolls everywhere, so it's not a criticism of Goyemon. Rolls are Americanized, sporting lots of stuff that doesn't belong in sushi (cream cheese, yuck) that they all start to taste the same, covered in the same homogenous sauce, or as Goyemon unfortunately called theirs, 'Orgasm Sauce', Please stop calling it that.",0,0,0

Hands down, best ayce sushi I've ever been to! 45 min ordering limit (which is plenty imo) but they remind you with a last call. They have the freshest garlic ahi tuna nigiri that is a must try. About the same price as all other ayce sushi but waaaay better quality. Desserts included! Service can be a bit spotty but the sushi is so good you won't be disappointed. 

**Full story**:
How have I not written a review for this place yet?! I guess all the partying in vegas makes me forget about the great food I eat afterwards...lol. 
Anyway, I've frequented this place every time I've come to vegas after I turned 21 and it is the best ayce sushi restaurant I've ever dined at and I've definitely visited my fair share! 

I love that this place isn't overly packed even on holiday weekends; I've been here during EDC weekend and memorial day weekend. It's definitely a hidden gem just a few minutes off the strip. 

The ordering system is a little different here than most other ayce sushi restaurants. Instead of giving you 3 rounds to order, they give you a 45 min limit. So you don't get a little sheet of paper that you check off, you just keep ordering from the waiters until your time is up. Your time starts when you order your first item. I haven't had a problem with this being not enough time especially since they give you a last call. However, I haven't been here when it's super packed so I can foresee that possibly being a problem for some people but haven't experienced it myself. 

J casually ordered the garlic ahi tuna along with the rest of our rolls and sushi not knowing that it was going to be probably the best tuna both of us have ever tasted. The tuna was so fresh it was literally ruby red and glistening as it came out. I have never seen a more appealing cut of sushi. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/sushi-house-goyemon-las-vegas?select=q8fozGYfWJbBHNHrfUgAsg#UnDx5-6zuPhFOyzBufRpSw The slightly tangy sauce that dressed the tuna was perfect and didn't require any soy sauce! We ended up ordering about 10 more orders of the tuna alone LOL. 

The appetizers are pretty standard and the rolls are good too. If you read closely, you can find the rolls that are in smaller portions, about 4 pieces, which is great because you can try a bit of everything without getting too full. I'd definitely recommend coming here with a larger group so you can sample everything but even with only 2 people you can still try a variety of things.

The price is about $25 total for lunch and if you upgrade to dinner price during lunch, you can order uni and sweet shrimp as well! I'm not a fan of either so I'm content coming here and paying less for lunch :) 

Anyway, definitely check this place out and TRY THE GARLIC AHI TUNA. I dream about that stuff man.",5,2,2

The Skinny: Although we didn't partake of their AYCE, their a la carte items and bento were below par. FYI - if you do not have their AYCE, the menu and pricing can be confusing (2.5) Service: messed up bill which my hubby had to actually grab a menu and show the waitress that she was wrong (2), Value: given the experience here, I wouldn't come back.(2).

I was enthused to see a highly rated sushi place. So I nagged the hubby to come try this place out. When we arrived. we weren't hungry enough to try their AYCE option. Instead we ordered their deluxe bento (with a side salad and miso soup), katsu curry and a side order of the grilled pork belly.

FYI - if you order a la carte, the prices are all on the actual fold-out menu NOT what's on the AYCE sheet or the supplement page on the placemat. Make sure you check your bill because we were charged for the more expensive price for pork belly (ie, supplement for the AYCE add- on) instead of the a la carte price. The waitress asked the chef instead of checking the menu and didn't believe us. My hubby had to ask for the menu to show her the difference. 

The deluxe bento suffered from many problems but let's just start off with the baby upchuck masquerading as some sort of misguided egg salad they put in the top right hand corner. (see pic: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q&select=pNoiIE--ccKc0V8o2PwRgw) Or perhaps the completely anemic ""teriyaki chicken"" which didn't even have grill marks on them. The fried salmon and tempura were both soggy. We had to ask for tempura sauce. Sashimi - the fish was cut into thick chunks but isn't cut in the proper matter allowing the fish to melt in your mouth. For what it's worth, the California maki was okay. 

There was little to no katsu with the katsu curry.  (FYI - the cutlet in the photo represents about 40% of the entire cutlet which is rather small for $8 see pic: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=tl0GrsOs4ViWjApsgaBvog ). The curry itself was overly thick and bland due to the addition of perhaps too much potatoes.

Finally, the grilled pork belly. While the texture of the pork belly was nice, the flavour of the pork was overly smoky for our tastes. The addition of the rather oddly sour tasting mango salsa was a deteriment to the dish. Certainly not something we would order again and we found it expensive for the price.

Overall given our experience with a la carte, we probably won't be stopping by for AYCE. But certainly check your bill if you do decide to do the a la carte tasting.",8,4,5

Great price, nice decor, delicious food.

Decor:
Not too tight but definitely not a big restaurant. All the little Japanese touches you would expect like a samurai sword in the restroom. (Sarcasm).

Service:
Fast and friendly service, every time we ordered things came out within 5 minutes. Drinks included in AYCE. We arrived early on a Friday night around 5 so there was no wait but when we left there was a line for bigger parties. 

Food:
They have daily specials that switch throughout the night which is great. We got to try out the Salmon belly which was not on the menu. The Uni and Sweet Shrimp although only one order per person on the AYCE menu us delicious. The best sushi for me on that is not one per person was the Snow Crab Meat, very sweet and delicious.

Price:
The quality and freshness of ingredients backs up the 26.95 per person at night.

Look at the photos on Yelp and try more! Delicious!",1,0,0

Orgasm salad - seared chunks of tuna on a bed baby mixed greens in a creamy yet not too sweet sauce. OMG heavenly!
Grilled Tofu Salad - Cubes of firm tofu nicely charred. Not bad.
Poke salad - standard
Toro - Limited to 1 - A little chewy but not bad
Big Eye Tuna - Melted in my mouth, a must try if available
Super White Tuna - Can't go wrong with ono! Heavenly
Sweet Shrimp - Slimey! Pass

Udon - I wanted Ramen but it's not available till after 11pm, standard noodles in a broth. Good thing to eat if you are hung over.
Green Tea Cake - A little dry for my taste
Green Tea Creme Brulee - Standard processed 

Service was good.

Usually we'd stuff ourselves more, but we had a white party to attend to and eating ayce sushi and trying to fit in a tight white dress isn't cute lol.

For the price, it's about $1-$2 more than Hikari but the last few timves Ive been to Hikari have been disappointed and rather much go here even if they have only nigiri.

Then when we moved away, Goyemon opened so whenever I visited Vegas, I always had to go to Goyemon. It was amazing. It was probably my favorite AYCE sushi place in Vegas. 

The sushi was yummy, they always have some type of specials on the board, and they have other things on the menu for non-sushi eaters. So if you were to come with a huge group of people, you can get a mix of things. 

One of my FAVORITE items from Goyemon has to be the salmon belly! It is delicious, fatty, and never a disappointment whenever I get it. So why, in heaven's name, did I give it 3 stars? Well ... let me tell you a story.

Goyemon had their 3rd Anniversary Customer Appreciation event and it was supposed to last 2 days. They had a list of special items for those days, which included blue fin and toro. With that, they offered the ability for you to make reservations. My friends and I decided to make a reservation for the 2nd day of the event since the 1st day of the event didn't work out with our schedules. 

The excitement built up even more after we found out that on the first day of the event, they did AYCE toro and AYCE uni! OMG! Like, I can't even WAIT. 

So when we went in for our reservation, my excitement turns a little bit sour. Why? Well, we had our reservation for 7:30 pm. We get there a little bit early but we have to wait for a table. I'm sorry .. I thought I had a reservation. So what we find out is .. they are still accepting walk ins and because they're typically a walk in restaurant, they don't quite grasp the reservation concept down that well. We actually didn't get seated until maybe at 8 PM.

And then they tell us that there is no AYCE toro tonight, only AYCE uni and waygu beef. Well, gee, thanks. What's the point of having a reservation then? Why would you give AYCE toro one night and not the other night? I wanted to flip multiple tables but since we waited for the table, sat down, and were ready to order, we just stayed. 

So my experience from that is just really really sour. So I learned to just walk in on the days they have yummy specials. That way, I won't be missing out REGARDLESS of what they say. 

So Goyemon gets an average from me. I still like them and will continue to go to them for AYCE sushi. Service can be slow sometimes though and the servers will look at you funny when you order 20 orders of one thing. 

Oh and LOVE their yuzu sorbet (:",8,4,4

We arrived early, at about 530-545 pm and the restaurant was already full.  With only a short wait, we took two seats at the sushi bar, which proved to be a blessing.  It was so much easier to give our orders directly to the sushi chefs and instantaneously receive our sushi.  At a table, you're at the mercy of the waitresses, who are harder to come by. 

Do yourself a favor, don't waste time on the rolls.  Not even one.  I don't care how interesting that fried\/eel sauced concoction sounds.  They are huge, heavy and a waste of stomach space. We had the Cynthia roll and a Soft Shell Crab roll of some kind and while you can get 1\/2 rolls (4-5 pieces) they are clunky monsters, bigger than the size of your mouth and glopped with mayo and eel sauce. 

Instead, focus on the sushi.  There are two-order limits on just two kinds of sushi - the amebi (sweet shrimp) and the uni (sea urchin) so make sure you order those to the max.  The uni was great - fresh and creamy and extremely flavorful.  We also really enjoyed the yellowtail and the salmon belly and liked the halibut, aji, and unagi.  With the amebi, request that the heads be fried, because they come to you in a miso soup, which is a nice contrast to all the cold foods you are eating. 

Goyemon isn't just about sushi though.  They have a pretty decent hot foods menu to provide some variety to the meal.  The pork belly was tiny in portion and not super tender.  The grilled vegetables are nicely grilled.  They even have udon and a ramen which is only available if you're there late at night.  

Make sure to save room for dessert.   Though they have things like green tea icecream or fried icecream, they readily admit those things are store-bought.  They take greater pride in their housemade green tea brulee, which has a sweet, subtle, jiggly matcha pudding with a paper thin brulee on top.  Another delicious dessert is the lychee sorbet, which is store-bought, but really aromatic and a nice palate cleanser.

What I really like about this place is that they don't overstuff you with rice like I feel like most places do. I am going to mention what I can remember because I feel like the food just kept coming. 

Scallop: You have to try the raw scallop. It was SOO perfect, it just melted in your mouth. 

Uni: I tried Uni for the first time here and that was AMAZING! Sadly you are limited to 2 pieces of Uni per person.  

Fried spicy tuna: I forgot what this is called, but its spicy tuna on rice fried to perfection. It is one of the appetizers. So tasty! It is fried just slightly to add a little crunch to your bite.
 
Salmon Belly: This was a special that day which was very yummy! So moist and melted in your mouth! 

Tuna Jaw: It was baked I think? It was veryyyyy tasty! This was a special of the day.

Sashimi Salad: yummy!! Nice portion of greens and raw fish on top.

Seaweed salad: can never go wrong with seaweed salad :]

Edamame: There is an option between garlic and regular. I didn't really like the garlic soysauce one. Go for the regular!

Octopus: Not that great, it was chewy, but isn't it always??...

And on to desserts! There were so many choices from green tea ice cream, red bean ice cream, sherbert, green tea creme brule, vanilla ice cream, green tea mochi, tempura ice cream. I think I am missing a few, but there were so many options!! 

The green tea ice cream and creme brule were both yummy!! Others said the green tea mochi was good too! The tempura ice cream was just plain vanilla with a thick batter. The batter was too thick and not really tempura fried.. so I wouldn't get that again.

Cucumber salad

Dessert:
Black sesame mochi

In a word:  WOW.
Really excellent quality fish.  The super white and scallop just MELTED in your mouth!  The wasabi crawfish was nice, with a great punch to the sinuses.  The Mentaiko was surprisingly awesome.   A little spicy, and really really good.

The only thing I had any issue with at all was that the deep fried shrimp heads were just a touch on the greasy side, and I couldn't see the eyes.  ;)  Other than that, I was extremely pleased.

Service was top notch.  Polite, and timely, with only a minor delay getting dessert, but that's because they were absolutely packed, when they hadn't been 30 minutes prior.  

I will absolutely be back here again.",6,4,5

I don't know man, it must've been a bad night. IT MUST HAVE! It's hard to imagine why on a Friday night such a highly acclaimed venue would have any bad nights, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm down for a second shot at this place, but my first overall experience was very, very mediocre.

The rice to fish ratio was just ugh...bad. No bueno. Yelling mercy. By the fourth sushi, there was nothing I could taste except for rice. The rice itself is so thin, almost like jasmine rice. What is this, Chinese food?? If the rice was at least a bit fuller in texture I wouldn't complain. I can also tell the rice is packed differently. It sits there like a small clump, and its hard to break down when you're chewing it. It's very laborious and completely takes away the experience from the fish. No, I don't hide my rice. I eat them as a whole with the fish. Last night I really wish I didn't. Now that I think about it, I think I did leave a few rice clumps here and there under the dish. Hmm, I never had this problem at Xtreme Sushi...

The service was nothing exceptional. Our waitress barely made any eye contact with our table and was slow to take our orders. It wasn't too bad, but I expected at least to be on par with other venues. I mean, the place was not even full and the waitress was hard to find like a rare pokemon (Pikachu in Viridian Forest, anyone?). I never had this issue at Xtreme Sushi...

The fish is OK. I have to say the yellowtail is my favorite. I'm so glad the yellowtail did not disappoint. The shrimp on the other hand, was not that good. Everything else was mediocre. I decide to give it one last shot and order uni (sea urchin). I really like to gauge the quality of the restaurant by eating sea urchin. Sea urchin spoils quicker than other fish, so it's really easy to spot bad sea urchin by the dull color and the foul smell. Would Goyemon pass the sea urchin fish test? Hmm...The anticipation. Man it's killing me. I wave down a waitress and put in the order...GULP!

Well I wouldn't know until next time because they were out. What?!? Are you kidding me...Although Xtreme Sushi has a limit of 1 order per person, I would rather eat ONE uni than none at all.

So that pretty much sums up my whole night. Will my return at Goyemon be a better experience? Movie sequels are rarely ever better than the first one, unless Goyemon is like the Terminator; mediocre first, EPIC the second. Hmm, we'll see...

*Hint hint, and Xtreme Sushi on Southern Highlands is still the best.* ;)",4,4,1

We have visited this place at least 5 times now. Usually for dinner. 

To start the food is good. Fish is not fishy at all. Most Ayce places don't have good quality fish but this place stands out. Their pork belly is pretty amazing as well.  Now of course this place isn't better than a la carte places like soho and other places that you might find on the strip. But if you are looking for ayce this is the place to go. 

Trust me it's not perfect nigiri pieces are smaller like cut in half per order, also their rice is a little hard for me. But still we come here because the taste is pretty good. They also have a lot of good hot food options. Like their baked mussels is a must as well as the garlic edamame. 

So why the 3 stars?? Ok so usually when we go here we do have to flag down a server to order more food, not sure if they do that on purpose so we don't order more?? And the food does come out slow. But today was just the worst. We got food before we got our waters ! And then the server forgot the hot tea so I had to be the annoying person and have my hand up to get her attention. We saw several of our dishes go to the table next to us. And then when we asked about it she said it's on the way. We got our second round of orders before we got our missing shumai and edamame ( first order). My bf seriously loves their  garlic edamame so he was getting a little hAngry  and annoyed with the server. When we got the edamame it was regular edamame and not garlic,  so now we are just mad. I ordered 4 orders of yellowtail nigiri and one toro. We got at our table one yellowtail and one tuna. I figured she just messed up the order but turns out it was someone else's order. Then I saw them run our 4 orders of salmon belly to the table next to us again! ( seems to be the theme of the day). We over heard tables on both side of us complaining that they were missing orders. So it wasn't just us imagining things. The lady from the other table orders ice cream before me. They gave me her order of ice cream by mistake. Every time we ordered food there was some sort of mix up even down to the dessert. 

We spent a lot time waiting. Waiting to get our drinks. Waiting to order. Waiting for our food. Waiting for refills. The only thing we didn't wait for was the check.

While it ain't Sugarfish (LA), its pretty damn good and the service is killer. In fact, I might go so far as to say that its the best AYCE joint in the world and the fact that its located in Vegas only adds to the magic.  

For $26.95 you can get some of the best sushi available in good ole Las Vegas, plus unlimited appetizers, daily specials and wait for it...DESSERT!  Trust me you won't want to skip dessert because they have an amazing green tea creme brulee and s super sweet selection of mochi ice cream.

Once we finally got our waters in, we ordered some AYCE appetizers and nigiri. I've never waited so long for any nigiri ever!

Basically, the entire meal, the service was terrible. On to the food review:

The rice on the nigiri was very small (YES!), so we thought we could eat more! But. The rice was so hard and chunky that it was barely edible. The fish was good and most of the rolls that we had tried were good. The appetizers were all good. Notice, that nothing was great. Well, just one thing - I have to agree that the pork belly literally saved this trip. It was so tender and delicious. Other than that, I have to go with yelp's two star saying, ""Meh. I've experienced better.""

Yes, I did come in hungry, and yes, I did leave full. But it just wasn't a great experience for me. With so many fantastic AYCE sushi places in Vegas, businesses really do need to step up their entire game. I think Goyemon maybe have fallen complacent in their ratings.",2,0,0

I met my friend Jessie here for lunch on 1\/21\/16 around 12:30. It was busy, but not packed like it usually around lunch time. It did take us a while for us to receive our food though. This was mildly annoying because I only had an hour for lunch, but in that time I was able to try a decent amount of items:

garlic edamame
super white tuna
scallops
garlic tuna
lemon roll
lasagna roll
domingo roll

The garlic edamame is really good. It doesn't have diced garlic, but rather a subtle garlic flavoring on top of all the beans. The super white tuna was melt in my mouth delicious, and is always one of my favorite nigiri items. I also got to try the scallops and the garlic tuna that Jessie had, both were very good. 

The rolls were next. I already love the domingo\/lasagna rolls so I knew what to expect and they were delicious. But the lemon roll is definitely a new favorite! It is just a california roll with lemon on top but it's so light and refreshing. I ordered 2 of these but we only got 1 due to time constraints.

It's surprising how small this place is for AYCE.  We arrived around 5:30pm, expecting to have to wait at least an hour for my party of eight.  The wait was as expected, but what killed me was that we were placed in this little ""secret"" room off to the side - a room that had been closed off and EMPTY since I first arrived!  Um, why weren't we just seated here to begin with instead of having to wait?

As we prepared to sit, two friends called to let us know they'd be joining as well.  I let the hostess know, apologized for the change, and said that we totally didn't mind squeezing in together.  The table had plenty of space, and all we needed was two chairs and place settings.  That's when our main waitress started to get snippy.  She was short when answering questions and had an air of attitude about her to a point where my friends and I found ourselves staring at each other in awkward silence on more than one occasion.  Thanks for a lovely meal (yes, you can sense the sarcasm).

Lastly, I didn't learn until after we had left that Sushi House offers a loyalty program - one stamp for every visit, and ten stamps to earn on free AYCE meal.  They probably didn't even offer me one on purpose, since I'd have earned my free meal during that visit.  Shady.

Every non-nigiri item came out first -- the appetizers and regular rolls. We sat for quite a while waiting for even just one of our nigiri orders. Sadly, the long wait wasn't rewarded at the end.

Halibut nigiri... stringy and chewy. Had to spit out part of it because I really couldn't swallow it.

Scallop...lots of lemon juice. Did not seem fresh.

Cajun albacore...completely doused in sauce.

1\/3 of the nigiri fish were smaller than before, which made it seem like there was too much rice given.

At least the snow crab meat is still good, so we loaded up on multiple orders of that. Seeing that this may be my last trip to Goyemon (will likely go back to Sushimon), I also ordered my usual 2 orders of green tea ice cream and 2 orders of lychee sherbet, while getting the tempura ice cream just for kicks (the tempura batter gets to you at the second quarter piece you eat).

too bad their service outweighs their food. 

went with a party of three, two of us wanted to order AYCE and the other wanted just a combo dinner. i asked if we order everything we want first or if we ordered one roll, finish it, and then they'll bring us another roll. the lady very rudely asked ""if we've ever been to an AYCE before"" which we have..and which is also why i asked what their rule was. we began to order one roll plus an appetizer each and she said that we MUST finish everything, including the rice and if not, they will charge us a la carte price, even if we didn't like the taste of it. this was new to me. all of the AYCE sushi places i've been to, if i didn't like the roll, they would happily take it away and let me order again. Anyway, it's not about the rule i'm complaining about but her god damn attitude and tone of voice. even the surrounding tables talked about her crappy attitude so i know we weren't thinking this in our heads...

then because of AYCE rule and the one hour limit, we decided to just order off the menu.we got the sush dinner for two, one fancy smancy role and an appetizer.  somewhere along the way, another meal got added to our table. when we questioned it, she said someone ordered a combo first time around then when she came back to take the rest of our orders, she assumed we still wanted the first order. assumed?!!? if you weren't sure, why didn't you ask? she was so unapologetic about it and basically said ""even if you don't eat it, you're still getting charge for it.""

As a special thanks to Fredo who made these two visits not just satiating, but thoroughly entertaining for my local and visiting friends alike.

this place has the freshest and most delicious sushi of any AYCE place I've ever seen. the Uni, the blue fin, the Amaebi...all to die for. As for the special creations made at the bar (PS: SIT AT THE BAR IF YOU CAN)... the creativity and variety of the dishes are a wonderful change of pace from places that just fill their special rolls with sweet mayo and cruchies and call them ""unique"". The baked mussels were also amazing. better than the fried oysters (we ended up ordering the mussels 3 more times).

And the seared pork belly app, also on the AYCE menu, was sinfully good. I tried to stop ordering it, but I gave up trying to stop after my third. 

also, if you like something different with your amaebi, instead of the fried heads, try them in the spicy miso broth instead.

Looks like your regular strip mall local Vegas AYCE Sushi joint. Nothing really stands out. Seems like a favorite local hangout. 

The one thing I like about this place are the daily specials. IMHO it he  Goyemon daily specials that set it apart form other AYCE sushi places. Goyemon has specials that are unique or unusual...a type of fish or delicacy you never heard off. Some of the specials are limited to one order, while the others are part of the AYCE experience. 

No complaints at all about the food. The waiter did bring us wrong items...stuff we did not order, but no complaints really, we were game...totally willing to give it a shot. While the food was good, the service was a bit spotty. When it got busy, they started forgetting some of our orders, brought out doubles of stuff we already ate and also stuff we did not order.

When I walked in, I had a bad feeling when I saw two latino looking sushi chefs at the tsukeba.  Not that I have anything against non-japanese itamae, but from my fairly vast experience....it's not a good sign in general and boy was I right.  

Since I'm Japanese, I don't order any rolls.  I always go with straight nigiri, none of those yum yum sauce, fancy rolls bulshit and here are what's wrong with their ""sushi"".

1)  It was ugly.  Cuts of fish were uneven, too small, and were just very asymmetrical and poorly balanced with rice.  When you have two pieces and they look so different, there is a significant lack in their sense of aesthetics, and more importantly, utter luck of skill.

2)  Sushi rice was horrendous.  To make things worse, there were 2 sushi ""chefs"" and they seem to be using very inconsistent sushi rice.  One was soft and overly sticky, and the other was dry and hard.  Neither of them had proper vinegar flavor, and was too bland to be called ""sushi rice"".  They obviously have no idea or skill to make proper sushi rice, which is just as, if not MORE important than the fish that goes on it.  

3)  Utter lack of nigiri skill.  Sushi rice was too hard.  You had to chew it.  That is what happens to amateurs and newbies who do not have the proper skills to maintain shape of nigiri while having enough air within it so that if falls apart in the mouth.

4)  The wasabi issue- I was embarrassed for them.  My first order of nigiris had no wasabi.  So I asked the waitress (non-japanese) that I need to have wasabi in the sushi.  She comes back 2 minutes later that ""most people"" don't want wasabi so the ""chefs"" cannot put wasabi in the nigiri.  Let me repeat ""THE CHEFS CANNOT PUT WASABI IN THE NIGIRI""

Let me make this straight.  In Japan, the sushi chefs will occasionally make UPON REQUEST nigiris WITHOUT wasabi for little children, I mean like kindergarden aged kids. Never do they even consider NOT putting wasabi for adults.  So I tell this non Japanese waitress that I don't care what ""most people"" want.  I want wasabi in the nigiri so that I don't have to peel the fish off of rice and have to put it on there, and it is the PROPER way to make a nigiri.  So she goes back and talks with this ""chefs"" and they finally comply with my ""request"" to make a proper nigiri WITH wasabi.  

It's very unfortunate that whoever the Japanese sushi chef is there allows these ""sushi chefs"" to let these joke of a sushi out to customers under their roof.  I asked the waitress if there are any Japanese chefs at lunch time and she says that it depends on their schedule, sometimes yes, sometimes not.  Well if a real chefs can't be there to properly supervise these jokers then they might as well close down the restaurant instead of allowing these atrocious nigiri's out to the customers who may have the palate and knowledge of what a real sushi should be like.  

The management should be embarrassed with what went on today.  If people think that this kind of atrocity is sushi, then I am truly saddened.  There are better restaurants with real japanese sushi chefs in this town who serve decent AYCE sushi.  But if people have numb enough palates to keep going here then so be it.",12,9,9

I personally go to any AYCE sushi for the nigiri. They give you decent portions of fish on top of a small bed of rice. If you go for dinner, you HAVE to get the salmon belly... It literally melts in your mouth! The salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and the Cajun Albacore are some of my favorite nigiri that are my go to's. My mouth waters just thinking about it!

For appetizers or sides, I always get the miso soup, seaweed salad, and the tuna poke. It makes the AYCE meal complete. 

You can order rolls or half rolls too, and there is a large selection you can choose from. They're delicious, but for AYCE sushi I would rather get full off of the nigiri.

Grilled salmon collar, gyoza, shrimp tempura, baked mussels, and teriyaki chicken are a few of the other small dishes for those who might not like raw fish or sushi. Although if you didn't like sushi, I'm not quite sure why you'd be dining at an AYCE sushi restaurant...

A mochi is the best way to end the meal. There's other delectable deserts to choose from as well, ranging from green tea ice cream to lychee sorbet.

Goyemon does everything right.  Firstly, they have a vast selection of rolls, the creativity is certainly there.  Additionally, the service is good, the servers were attentive and made sure everyone in my party had their drinks filled at all times.  

As far as sheer quality is concerned, I feel that Sushi Mon has the edge.  I hate to make this a comparative review because I'm sure that Goyemon has worked feverishly to create its own image, however, I feel that it's just something I can't help only because I always feel the need to rank restaurants.  It gives me a better sense of where to go, especially if I'm on time constraints.

I will give Goyemon the edge on their pricing, which is two dollars less than Sushi Mon's.  Goyemon charges $26,95 for AYCE sushi, which isn't bad in relation to what is charged elsewhere in the city.  Goyemon also allows unlimited dessert orders, which is exciting, especially once you taste the Fried Ice Cream Tempura.  I have no shame in saying I enjoyed three separate orders.

WHEN: 5pm-3am (dinner & late dinnertime!)

WHY: Have you ever posted ""best sushi in LV"" topics on Yelp Talk? If so, no need to ask anymore, because this is it!! THE BEST ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI JOINT IN TOWN! WITHOUT A DOUBT!

WHAT: Firstly, we got to test out the new party room! There were 20 of us sushi-eaters ready to devour and take advantage of that AYCE sushi menu! The servers were all dolls! They were extremely helpful (knowing how hectic a large party can be) and us paying separately did not scare them at all. They were well-prepared! COOL points for the staff that night!

So, on to the food! I would just like to state the fact that each dish was made with such perfection! From the many attractive flavors, to the presentation!

SOME THINGS I TRIED:

Orgasm salad: Something a little bit different! The sauce blend had a little tang and zest to it, which actually made the salad.

Pastel roll: shrimp and crab wrapped inside soy paper, shrimp and avocado on top, slightly drizzled with spicy yum & eel sauce on top!

911 roll: To all of you spice-aholics, you need to try this one! I personally thought that I would be able to take some HEAT, but I had to LEAVE THE KITCHEN for this one! After several drinks of water and patiently waiting it out, the spice stuck to my tongue! So, the tip for this roll: BEWARE, AND PROCEED WITH CAUTION! haha

I LOVE BAKED ROLLS! So, I love the fact that they have a handful of great ones!
O.I.D. roll: shrimp & asparagus wrapped in salmon & baked with yumyum sauce! Oh whatt?!!
Baked 428: I had to try this one just because it said baked chicken inside the roll! I have never tried a chicken roll =)
Goyemon lasagna roll: I love japanese lasagna rolls, so I always try it in every sushi spot. & this won my heart over! My absolute favorite lasagna roll of all time!

DESSERT! Oh how I love the end of beautiful beginnings solely due to dessert! So... there are a couple of desserts you may choose from on the ayce menu, (tempura, mochi, etc) meaning you can get as much as you'd like?! There is a separate dessert menu you can choose from as well, where you are only allowed to pick one on there! And on this beautiful menu lay ""GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE,"" which happened to be my pick! =D It was completely marvelous!

Lastly, I would like to give a shoutout to my fellow yelper, Nelson Q., for introducing me to such greatness! You got me hooked, my friend! So hooked that I will be back there next week!

Not only did I leave unhappy, I was so embarrassed how I hyped this place up to my friends. They weren't impressed either. It looks I won't be coming back here for a while. I hope they step up their game. Sigh. I guess I'm back to looking for a new AYCE sushi bar when I'm in Vegas.

The only good thing about this place is that the dessert (mochi ice cream) is AYCE.",4,2,0

Im actually upset my bf insisted on paying because I would've stiffed the waiter (and the whole crew if it's split) and I'm a server, it was that bad!

AYCE sushi place in the middle of the desert. Was in Vegas for the weekend for work and decided to pop in here to satisfy my sushi craving.

Upon entering the small restaurant, I realized the the sushi chefs behind the counter were MEXICAN!.

Omg, I thought, do I eat here or do I dare risk the long waits of other ayce buffet lines on the strip? With the nearly full house crowd close to 10pm at night, I figured it can't be THAT BAD!


To my surprise it was quite good!

Ok not sushi sho good in Berkeley, but the fish was very fresh and they had a great selection, including the ""black board"" specials. The black board specials has the more exotic cuts of fish, toro, black caviar roe, kama, and a bunch that evades my brain at the moment, but something that you would pay $8-9 for nigiri for at any bay area sushi place. Black board specials are the way to go! IT also changes as the night progresses, sometimes they run out of stuff'; only to be replaced by other things.

AYCE is basically off a menu, and you order whatever you want.

There's a great selection of hot foods and salads, along with tons of nigiri and rolls.
I don't do JIVE ass rolls like Nobu K, so I went for all nigiri.

There is a uni limit of 2 pieces per person but that didnt bother me as there were plenty of other great fishes including toro, and all your standard nigiri cuts of fish.

Yes the fish was cut a bit uneven and some of the rice fell apart before it made it to my mouth. but for $25 you cant beat it!

Everything from the cucumber salad to fried tempura shrimp to the black board special cuts of fish were delicious including the desserts. 

We sat at the sushi counter and were served by the sushi chef, whom were all mexican for the exception of one -japo chef who seemed to  be the head chef.

Good service by the servers and the counter chefs. 

I was very surprised at the quality of each item we ate and wish we had one of these in the bay area! I would definetely go back when I am in vegas next time.",0,0,1

After reading the Yelp reviews, we expected a wait, but the night and time we went, there was no wait.  On the menu, it says that you have 60 minutes to eat.  You must eat everything you order and not leave a pile of rice or they will charge you per item.

I like the fact that they use YAMASA soy sauce!!!

For $26.95, you can get just about everything you want on the menu.  The items I liked the best were the yellowtail sushi, shrimp tempura, uni (only one order per person), crab meat sushi, and yellowtail collar.  The fish is fresh and cut Japanese style (smaller portions).

The only item I didn't like that much was the salmon sushi, so I only got one order of that.  The nigiri toro wasn't what I was expecting either.

Some of the other rolls looked good, but are big, so I didn't want to fill up on one roll.  The one roll I would have liked to try was the Spider roll.

For dessert, I had the green tea creme brulee which was pretty good.

The service is good.  There was only a few times when a server wasn't close by or when we had to wait to order something when we wanted.

Yup, I certainly can be.

You see, there are some very, very real consequences associated with actually arriving at the outer limits of one's ayce threshold. 

One of mine is having to be rolled out of one of these places.
The other is trying to waddle around as my stomach goes into hyper drive and desperately breaks down mass quantities of proteins, starched, sugars, etc. 

And yet . . . there are times and places when it's totally acceptable to find yours truly in these awkward predicaments. 

And guess what?  Sushi House Goyemon happens to be one of them places.
Surprise!
Well, you shouldn't be and could actually be kinda insulted I used such a cliche.
Anyways.

Now, did I find the 60 minute time limit somewhat perplexing?
Yup but I was up for the challenge.  And for what they're charging, I consider it a fair compromise.

Did I make the mistake of ordering way too much shrimp tempura instead of purely focusing on all things sushi?
Yes, I regrettable did, but it is one I will not so foolishly make the next time.

But the real question is, how was the sushi?
All things being considered, not half bad.
And the food overall was fairly tasty for an ayce.

The serving size of the nigiri often had me wondering if I had inadvertently ordered from the amuse bouche section of the menu, but the thing is these morsel size portions works.  You get enough of a taste to decide if you want more, and if you don't, you're not stuck with a slab of something you don't want.

Unfortunately, none of the sushi was super standout, but in Goyemon's defense, after so many servings (and sake) my taste buds become less acute and I can't really distinguish the good from the really good.  That being said I would recommend not ordering half size specialty rolls and ask if they could make them into specialty hand rolls instead.  I'm really a fan of hand rolls since there seems to be a better balance of seaweed, rice, and fish when it's rolled up like an ice cream cone.

And if you still have any room (and even if you don't), try the dessert.
For the love of ayce, try the dessert.  Well worth it.",44,29,40

Poki salad - Fresh tuna and addicting tangy dressing.

Grilled tofu salad - The grilled tofu had a perfect seasoned taste.

Grilled pork belly - 2 slices of tender melt in your mouth pork belly.

Albacore - Above average albacore nigiri.

Cajun Albacore - This is my favorite nigiri here. Super flavorful.

Super white tuna - Excellent but not as good as Hikari's.

Spider roll - Very well executed here. Wrapped with soy paper.

Pixie roll - It's like a spider roll with more stuff. Also excellent.

O.I.D. roll - Baked roll with salmon and asparagus. Not bad.

I've been to so many all-you-can-eat sushi places and tons of Japanese restaurants in my lifetime that I feel confident saying that Goyemon has one of the best sushi's in the States.  This would probably be a whole different story if I've been to Japan, but that has yet been crossed off my bucket list.  In the meantime, this place is my #1 spot.

So why do I love this place?  Although Goyemon currently has 4 stars according to Yelp, I feel that it depicts this place so wrongly.  It should receive 5 1\/2 stars. That's how great it is.  Being Asian and all, I have come to love rice.  White, brown, sticky, broken...I LOVE rice, just ask the boyfriend.  When it comes to sushi, the way the rice is prepared makes all the difference in the world.  Trust me, I know.  If the rice is too sticky, you'll be sitting there all day chewing on sticky rice.  If there's too much rice vinegar then the sushi rice just falls apart once chopsticks come in contact with it.  This place does it right.  They ""cut"" the rice in such a way that it's one with the sashimi\/raw fish.  The portion between the fish itself as well as the sushi rice is perfect.  Some places either put so much more rice hoping it'd fill you up faster, but that just takes away all the trust a customer has in the restaurant as well as the sushi chef.  

Bomb dynamite.  A lot of sushi places are starting to add rice at the bottom of these delectable appetizers, but it's really taking away the taste of this delicious dish.  Goyemon thankfully doesn't do that. 

Mussels.  Can't go to a sushi restaurant without getting mussels... 

If they ever provide this option as a part of the all-you-can-eat-deal, then I say get it.  This is the salmon belly.  What's great about it is, is that it's very much like salmon, it just melts so much more in your mouth.  You've got to try it if you can. 

 And the one fish I can never cheat on, white tuna.  My absolute favorite. 

Generally at all-you-can-eat places I leave a little room for dessert.  Goyemon's lychee sorbet dessert is one of a kind (to me).  It's not your regular sorbet, a little bit more on the sticky side as if you were chewing on mochi, but not as chewy as mochi.  That may not make any sense, but in a way it melts nicely in your mouth, sort of like soft, snow that is just falling down. 

If you plan to eat there, make sure to head there early in the day right before they open.  It's a little slow at first, but it quickly gets busy 15-30 minutes later.  It's so packed, people are just waiting out the door.  What's even more interesting is that the location isn't even that great.  It's a little off the strip (15 minutes away), but I love that about it.  It attracts locals and very few tourists go out there so you aren't bombarded by tourists even though you may considered as one. 

Already missin' you....

It was my second visit here and he insisted this place is his close second favorite location for AYCE sushi in vegas. The last time we were both here was last year.

It was around 4 so we just missed the lunch rush and were happy we didn't have to wait too long for seats plus salmon belly was on special, yummmm.

What we liked:
Miso soup: the bf said this was one of the best part of the meal, and it was the first thing he had. I'll take his word for it.

Spider roll: wrapped in soy paper. Great texture and crunch from the crab which was perfectly fried and the filling was nice and balanced. Wasn't overly saucy either. 

Salmon belly: ordered it once and it wasn't a really good cut. Then ordered again later and it was perfect. Great big fatty slices of salmon belly that I made sure to savor.
----
The meh:
Udon soup: bf ordered this as the ending to his meal. it was really just the noodles, broth and green onions, which was written in the menu but I kind of wish some veggies or meat was in there.. 

Super white tuna: I LOVE super white tuna but the one here was not succulent and melt-in-your mouth as I know it to be. There was no sauce whatsoever. Or maybe I missed it lol.. just okay.

Yellowtail: very small cut of fish! But still managed to taste a little above average. Was better than the salmon we first got for sure..
----
What we didn't like:
Pork belly: great presentation and meat looked appetizing as in had great char and color. Sadly the flavor really was not there and both slices had large flab of fat right down the middle that was just too unedible. I love pork belly and fat but after eating one slice and forcing the fat down, I couldn't do with getting the other fat glob down.

Sashimi salad: I did not know the crab mayo stuffing from a typical cali roll would be considered ""crab meat"" or sashimi for that matter. Yep, they layered this right atop the cubed sashimi pieces and there was a fairly good amount of it more than the actual sashimi. Still ate the whole thing cause had to.. 

Takoyaki: does not come dressed with sauce, mayo, aonori, green onions or furikake that should be on top. The two fried balls come with just the sauce on the side to dip. The inside was very mushy and had on or two tid bits of octopus. At least the outside was crunchy and there were some octopus inside..

mochi ice cream: we got red bean and strawberry. The menu only said they had vanilla and strawberry so I picked strawberry. Bf got red bean and I was like ""they have red bean???"". Table next to ours ordered a green tea one and again I was ""???"" But I stuck to my choice. They came out like flat disks lmao. And the mochi had some ice crystals and was not very elastic and chewy. As the ending to my meal, totally disappointed and would probably have gotten better mochi aisu from a grocery store but hey, it's ayce.
---
Server was nice and checked up on us regularly. But service of food did take some time from time to time. Only once did the runner mistakenly bring one of our orders to the table next to ours but realized and brought it to us. They missed my one order of mackerel and I didn't bother to try to reorder it. And instead of getting the cucumber salad, they brought us seaweed salad which was still okay and we didn't bother to get it corrected either.

Overall, we left kind of unsatisfied. The cuts of sushi were pretty small and thin compared to other earlier pics on yelp. Maybe it's hit or miss or based on the chef behind the counter? Quality wasn't that great either. Bf  agreed it wasn't how he used to like it. I honestly don't think I will be back..",0,0,0

Their AYCE menu is pretty extensive which includes a lot of variety. Like most places they say you have a one hour time limit but the waiter was always around if we wanted to order more and believe me we ordered enough to feed a family of four and it was only two of us. 

First thing on the menu that caught my eye was pork belly. I know most of my reviews mention pork but c'mon ""ALL YOU CAN EAT PORK BELLY"" I was like a kid in a candy store. The pork is braised to perfect tenderness and lightly grilled for that chard flavor. Another thing that was unique was their Spicy Tuna Fire Cracker. The crunchy texture of the rice and soft spicy tuna tantalizes your taste buds. I tend to order most of the Nigiri sushi and the quality of their fish and seafood is tops! 

The only thing I would say was ""so so"" was their deserts with the exception of their lychee sorbet. But its OK by this time I was comatose from all that sushi goodness.

And even throughout the meal, it was difficult to find someone to order extra, and when a friend wanted to order more, the waiter actually said, with attitude, ""really? You want to order more? But you have more food coming."" It's AYCE for a reason, and if he wanted to order more and satisfy the glutton in him, he could.

We gave up on picking up the rice and left them on plate. Some fell half way onto table. Guess what they decided to charge us for a la carte when we can't finish their horrible rice.

I was guided here by the folks from Monta noodle House. 

First and foremost let me just say this place will now be one of my favorite spots for sushi,  I can say that each piece was pure balance of flavor & taste. All of their varied great dishes and add-ons were prepared with good flavor, even their personal sashimi salad was well made and was a great opening dish. 

The extra white tuna was phenomenal, and it melted in my mouth all the rolls we had were well balanced and made with the greatest attention, I complimented all of the dishes with a small tasting of 3 of their best sakes which helped all the flavors unfold in my palette. I recommend eating at the sushi-bar since you get a chance to interact with the sushi chefs and get everything at your will.

What I Recommend
- ALL THE DESSERTS! Seriously, we ordered 1 of everything. Sooo good!
- Sashimi Salad
- Supreme Salmon Roll
- Tiger Roll
- J.J. Roll
- Salmon Sushi

I highly recommend the Lychee Sorbet!! It was refreshing and had lychee bits in it! They go a little heavy handed on the crab meat sometimes on the Sashimi Salad but it was really good overall! I love salmon so Supreme Salmon was my kind of roll! The J.J. Roll is heavy but soooo worth it.

We exited as rolly polly balls probably since it felt like we needed someone to roll us out of the joint.  

Probably one of the best $30 investments I made for all you can eat sushi. No arguments there. 

Wait time can be horrendous and it seems to get packed super fast. Luckily enough for our group of 5, we had no wait! 

There seems to be a limit on certain things you can order. The expensive ones like the ebi\/shrimp and uni (I believe) all falls under this cap. Ebi was delish, don't forget to try. And to say I'm not usually an ebi getter!

Unagi for days (was a bit boney), but the flavor was there, and the spicy ahi\/tuna hand rolls (note, it being spicy, I needed a couple of water refills), and raw fish up the ying yang. We ate anything and everything,  including fried shrimp heads (do not fear the shrimp heads, they're actually not that bad even though you're eating a face).

So though I'm raving why only 4 stars? Because I'm a major dessert fan, the tempura\/fried ice cream and green tea ice cream did not do it for me. The ice cream in the tempura batter really didn't taste like vanilla ice cream, it kind of had the consistency of sherbert. Also, the tempura batter was soggy and not crunchy like when you think of typical fried ice cream. The green tea ice cream came to us half melted,  resulting in a puddle of frothy melted ice cream. That made me sad.

My main interest was in the saba and the uni.  A sign greeted me at the door that said that they were out of uni.  Poo.  Anyways, my impression of the menu was that Goyemon relied heavily on the deep fryer, cream cheese, and yum yum sauce (along with the amusingly named ""orgasm sauce"").  I'm a nigiri\/sashimi type of girl myself, but I can still appreciate this stuff.  Still, this was a bit much.  On the plus side, they were really nice about making subs.  Like I wanted the Alaskan, but with real crab.  Done!  And the servers were so fast with the order, which was important when you only have 45 min to indulge (though I doubt they time it).  

Good sushi has to have good rice.  Here, the grains don't melt together.  It's like the individual grain is a little too al dente.  The rice improved later in the evening, but still wasn't great.  Also the knife work wasn't on point.  I'm not talking about against the grain of the flesh or whatever...like the sushi was cut all crooked at times.  And someone at the bar was overzealous with the lemon.  My hotate and escolar nigiris had quite a pucker factor.  

As far as my favorites...def the saba.  I always order saba b\/c aside from not having to worry about food dye, mercury, or pcb, it's mad good.  It's got a very strong flavor though, so if you do eat tuna, salmon, etc, you might want to save the saba til the end of the meal.  The grilled squid was great, too.  It comes in thick cuts like fat fries.  They also offer it in tempura form.  O, and if you're feeling like there's too much rice (they really don't overuse rice here), save the rice from your sushi and order the dynamite.  Yummy!

This is not your standard ACYE sushi affair.  You don't walk up to a station.  There are no lines.  Food does not sit out under a heat lamp.  Rather, you order what you desire from the menu at the comfort of your seat.

The menu here is extensive and consists of your standard sushi, sashimi, and rolls.  However, they also include a variety of appetizers, grilled items, specials, desserts, and more.  You may come here thinking that you'll get your value here only based on volume and how much you can consume.  Don't be fooled, their food here is delicious.  You'll get your value from quality as well.

Some of my favorites from the menu are;
-  Sashimi Salad
-  Seaweed Salad
-  Super White Tuna Sushi
-  Salmon Sushi
-  Cajun Albacore Sushi
-  Sunrise Roll
-  Dragon Roll
-  Sexy Girl Roll
-  Volcano Roll
-  Mochi Ice Cream

The atmosphere here is like any other typical casual Japanese restaurant.  Then again, you don't go to AYCE for the atmosphere.  Just be cautious of the long lines and wait when you arrive.  They don't accept reservations so expect a wait during peak times. 

The price for dinner is $27 which seems fair amongst the competition in Vegas.  But given the amount I usually eat when I come here, I guarantee they're losing money.  It's one of the few places you can go in Vegas and leave a winner.

No one was paying attention to us anymore we tried to order more because we we were not done eating yet but no one was really paying attention to us. It took them another 20 min just to bring out Green tea ice cream. Which in reality how long does it really take to get the green tea ice cream  unless they actually make it themselves.

We had come to goyemon a long time ago when I was super hungry and opted out while everyone gorged themselves, but this time I was armed with intense hunger.  I like that the nigiri  are not so inundated with rice that they overwhelm the fish.  The garlic tuna was super fresh and had an awesome light sauce which I believe was elevated with some yuzu.  The ikura was freaking awesome, fresh and perfect seasoned which is hard to find.  I also loved some baked green muscles the sauce was so yummy and not bland like some places, and the muscles were not to big.  I prefer smaller sized because the bigger ones can get a bit chewy.  I like that you can order half rolls and that they have more unique desserts like chocolate mousse and green tea creme brule.  The green tea creme brule could have used more of a firm sugar top is was more speckled that a layer of crunchyness.  The chocolate mousse was the perfect size for how rich it was.

Very fresh and not overcooked. The miso salmon was also a daily grill special that was pretty tasty. Yuzu sorbet was tasty as was the ice cream.

Service was weird because it doesnt seem like they have set tables and I ordered with like 4 different people, 2 of them who were pleasant and had a positive vibe, and 2 of them that seemed a bit anti social and just wanted to do the bare minimum. 

Also they have no uni until further notice due to bad weather or some random shit. Which makes no sense as every other sushi joint in Vegas has uni.. sounds like they are just being stingy and know they dont make good profit off it so they stopped ordering it even though its on the permanent menu. Minus one star due to mediocre service and lack of uni which is my favorite nigiri. Also craftsmanship of the nigiri could use some work.

Unlike many other AYCE, you are not constantly hounded by the waitress to place an order.  In fact, they are very courteous and check on you just enough so that you are always able to order but not rushed in any way.  

I can't remember specifically what we ordered, but it was a lot of nigiri and rolls and everything was simply amazing.  The pork belly appetizer was also very very good.  My only complaint is that it was a tiny serving so we had to keep ordering more.  You can order the rolls in half orders so that you can try more stuff off the menu.  The ONLY thing I did not particularly like was the calamari tempura.  It was like rubbery fish sticks in tempura batter. YUCK.

Andre is an amazing sushi chef.   Friendly, fast, and fills you up with great food. 

The menu is overwhelming in the most positive way.  I'm not a fan of salmon, so on any rolls I wanted with salmon, he switched it for any fish of my choice. 

This place is open til 3a, and the mood here is fun and festive. 

For people that often complain of fish sizing in ratio to rice, this is your place - good cuts of fish with small amounts of rice.  

service is awesome here too.  Wait list?  No problem.  They text you and you have 5-10 minutes to get back, where your table is ready.  

I cannot compliment this place enough.  They must have 25 options of nigiri and 50 different rolls.

My friend from Vegas strongly recommended forme to try this place before heading back to LA. We came in at around 5pm (group of 5) on a Monday night and the wait was around 20 minutes (not too bad compared to the other reviews). The restaurant was pretty small, but the service was relatively quick and accommodating. There's an hour limit on AYCE dinner. We went on an order rampage immediately, focusing mostly on the nigiri. The rice:fish ratio was a bit off for me (too much rice) but it wasn't too overwhelming.

Onto the fish. I personally ordered a sashimi salad, which was delicious and refreshing. For the nigiri, I tried the tuna, salmon belly (GREAT), octopus, uni (limit 1 order\/person), sweet shrimp (GOOD; limit 1 order\/person), yellowtail (YES), super white tuna, snow crab hand roll (too much rice), scallops and unagi (always my favorite). The fish was fresh and I felt like I definitely got my money's worth (turned out to be around $32\/person). There were a lot of special rolls that looked great as well. My friends liked the rainbow roll, but not the spider roll. They also enjoyed the salmon, salmon belly, uni, sweet shrimp, sashimi salad, edamame (garlic buttered) and miso group. Goyemon offers a bunch of dessert, ranging from green tea or red bean ice cream to vanilla or strawberry mochi. I thought it was nothing special, but was pleasantly surprised by the numerous options.

there's a lot of reviews and i pretty much tried everything but there were a couple of standouts that i definitely got more of. clam nigiri and scallop nigiri- so so delicious. perfect chewy texture, not fishy as all, seasoned just slightly. so perfect. our waitress also recommended the black lobiko, which was a special nigiri that day. i was kind of terrified from the description - black roe - but it turned out to be delicious, even though i don't normally like roe. it was less fishy and greasy than normal roe. they also had some little side things like sauced up mussels and poke, which were also delicious.

we gave into temptation and got the udon, but it's not worth the belly space. my friend also got a bunch of rolls and they were all pretty good, but i usually don't like the rolls so i'm not a good judge.

our waitress was really awesome, always took our next order promptly, and answered all our questions. the only weird thing to me was that the nigiri came as a set of two. i asked if i could just have one at the end since i was so full, but apparently that was not allowed. they are smaller pieces, but two still seemed extreme haha. anyway, go here. you will be sad if you don't.",2,0,1

However, I was back in town for a few days, and decided to go and have some sushi. I knew that I had to wait for a bit since I always had to wait whenever I come to goyemon. Waiting wasn't a big deal, but this FAT UGLY HOSTESS NAMED LESILIE out of nowhere had some attitude issues acting like she owns the restaurant or something. I mean, damn almost walked out of the restaurant because of her attitude. Waiting an hour was bad enough but a hostess who doesn't even know how to seat people in right order is messed up. Tried to say something but manager was not there at that time, I complained about her anyways. And they better train her or do something. Overall food was ok like always.",0,0,0

My friends left the decision making up to me on where to eat and I think after this experience, they wont anymore. 

The customer service is mainly the reason to why I rated Sushi House of Goyemon low. You can also see from some fellow yelpers about their similar experience. For us, we were hardly waited on. They seemed very annoyed to our requests and questions about what they have on the menu. It's also funny how the server told us straight off the bat we have 45 minutes to order with all you can eat. To top it off, they gave us our checks and it literally took more than 30 minutes to take our payment. No lie we could of easily walked out of the restaurant without paying and they would have not even noticed. I had to walk up to one of the workers near the cooking station to tell her if they would like our money. Sounds funny. But Smh. 

As for the food, it was good. I was bummed that the miso soup wasn't even hot, especially with this crazy cold weather! However, I did like the crispy spicy tuna roll, hurricane roll, and the tempura ice cream. That is all.",7,1,2

I have been to most AYCE Sushi places in the Las Vegas Valley and by far this place is my favorite to go to. This place offers daily specials, fantastic alcohol options and probably the freshest Nigiri I have had at any AYCE restaurant. They also offer things that most places do not such as Snow Crab Meat, Occasional Salmon and Yellowtail belly and Toro. Their appetizers list is also unmatched.

Whenever I come I prefer the Sushi bar and for good reason. These Sushi Chefs are among the nicest and most accommodating I have ever had the pleasure of being served by. The servers and the chefs play a big part of why i am a return customer. Always thanks to Andre and his brother. Every time I have come, Timmy has always been a fantastic server and has even taken the time to get to know us and ask us how our days were.

Most of the time this place is packed because of how popular this place is but every time, the wait was always worth it for me. As for service I find it to be slow at times but sometimes they are understaffed but I can always see them giving effort to tend to everyone. If you do plan to come here with a big party please come earlier than expected because you will be waiting a little bit. For a place as good as it is, this is somewhat expected.

My only gripe with this place is actually very weird. Most Japanese restaurants I go to I like to sit at the Sushi bar and get to know the chefs. I love the interaction that as a customer I can know the people making my food and someone to talk to while i eat. I was very sad to hear that the Chefs here are unable to share a beer or alcohol with their customers. They work very hard and I honestly believe that sometimes they deserved a small break and from a consistent customer I feel it would be just them accepting a small token of my appreciation to all their efforts to keep me and other customers happy. I really hope one day I am able to drink with my favorite Chefs in the City.",0,0,0

Great staff and pretty great sushi. Some sushi pieces seem a bit thin but worth the price. Make sure you know what to eat in a hour, that is the amount of time they allow you to have from 4pm on for dinner.

For lunch it's 45 mins. The spicy tuna is no joke here, extremely hot, so much that having a half roll was good enough for me, my mouth was getting raw, yes that spicy.

I regularly visit this sushi house every week to every other week. To get an interactive lunch or dinner, sit at the Sushi bar with Gian, Andre, or Hieu. They will make your sushi experience that much better. 

Fish: 9\/10. Freshness, quality, size, everything there. The only reason I give it a 9 is because sometimes they run out of Blue Fin Tuna (1 order anyways) and it's not Uni season (which isn't their fault) but still upsetting. 

Appetizers: ?\/10. Only thing I order is Shrimp Tempura and Baked Green Mussels. I guess those two are 10\/10 so appetizers from my experience is 10\/10.
 
Service: 11\/10. I love those 3. They make my experience at Goyemon so much better. I can enjoy my sushi while enjoying my time there. The servers are always attentive to when my plates stack up and my water never reaches the bottom. 

Only downside is that wait can be super long sometimes. Also, when it becomes really busy, the service might slow down. But what do you honestly expect? 4-5 Sushi Chefs service nearly 80 people that eat like pigs. It's going to be slow sometimes, just know that the sushi will make up for it.",0,0,0

We sat near the sushi bar and started browsing through the menu. We all opted for the AYCE and they had a good selection of specials written on a chalkboard. We ordered hot tea, the pixie roll, ecstasy, sea urchin (for me), and among other things.  Everything tasted fresh and yummyful. Lastly, we had room for desserts and I ate most of that chocolate mousse. And there was the green tea creme brulee and mango mousse cake. It had real chunks of mango!

We walked in at about 5pm on a Thursday afternoon. The restaurant was fairly full but we only had to wait a few minutes for them to clear off our table (party of four). Arriving at an ""in-between"" time (late lunch, early dinner) turned out to be a good idea, because towards the end of our meal about an hour later the place was packed and there was a line. 

The AYCE price was $26.95 per person for dinner (lunch price is only $21.95. Guess who's coming back for lunch soon?) The AYCE includes everything on the menu besides drinks. Appetizers, miso soup, grilled items, salads. Even dessert! Unlimited dessert! What. A. Deal. I seriously spent most of my time looking at the menu while I ate, trying to decide what I was going to order next. 

My advice would be to order as many things as you want at once, because it does get busy and food takes a little while to come out. There's an hour limit on dinner, so you want to spend more time eating than waiting. Keep in mind, though, that they will charge for leftovers including rice, so only order what you can eat. 


We tried a few rolls. I liked the one called Sexy Girl. Nigiri is delicious...get the ahi and the unagi because both are spectacular. Also, please be sure to try the pork belly off the ""grill"" portion of the menu, because it just melts in your mouth. Faaaaaabulous, dahhling. Like everyone says, the rice to fish ratio is great and you can get the 8 piece rolls in half orders so that you can try more things before you tap out. Everything tastes fresh and is well-flavored.

Other things we tried were the calamari, takoyaki, sashimi salad, tempura, crab roll, shumai (fried and steamed) and the rice cracker, not to mention practically all of the different nigiri on the menu. 

For dessert we had the azuki ice cream, green tea ice cream (mochi and regular), strawberry mochi ice cream, yuzu sorbet (my first time having this. It's a citrus sorbet and it is very light and refreshing), and the tempura ice cream. Tempura wasn't quite crispy on that one but it was still good. 

Bottom line: Get the AYCE and make sure everyone on your table has it so that you can all share.  It is so worth your money. The wait staff is attentive and the atmosphere is casual, and you will definitely enjoy yourself whether you are a sushi snob or a fusion fan. It's quality sushi to your heart's content.

Didn't think I'd ever give an AYCE Sushi place 5 stars till now. 

The sushi here was really fresh.  I was really pleased with the salmon belly, yellowtail, big eye tuna, super white tuna, mackeral,sweet shrimp, and much more.  The fish to rice ratio was spot on and it just tasted of a better grade compared to all the other AYCE's.

In addition to the nigiri, we got the grilled pork belly (think we got 6-7 orders total between 3 of us), grilled vegetables, spicy tuna on crips rice, and much more.

Definitely order the specials off the chalk board - some of them have limits of 1 per person.  No toro the day we went.  Also, go after 11pm to get Shoyu Ramen.  It is the same as Monta.  

The atmosphere is probably the nicest of any AYCE.  As stated, they are in the Monta Ramen family, so I am hopeful the sushi quality and consistency will remain.

ALL YOU CAN EAT! The best all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant I've ever been to. 

Whenever my boyfriend and I come to Vegas, we plan our trip around this restaurant.. No joke. We pass up on the crowded night clubs and overrated day clubs for Sushi Goyemon..

FAVORITES:
White tuna: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=hup6W3ATSaMlaX5K6JhZfw#L4uXfHD3OqS0_LX-wO1A-w

Orgasm salad: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=h6wE-PUEMRAURVAcnkCHhw&userid=rMRSt0r8q0AvpUllXgrH2w
They don't have this anymore :(.

Sweet shrimp: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=XoZl0rGj_ltolxQqReT4iw&userid=rMRSt0r8q0AvpUllXgrH2w
Limit 1 order per person.. SO GOOD.

PASS on these items:
Uni: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=mBQT2vgNoD4Z6CjVxVfHdQ&userid=rMRSt0r8q0AvpUllXgrH2w
Not the freshest.. Tastes worse than uni from Mitsuwa. Limit 1 order per person.

Poke salad: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=TyHAbow61kagjlaHSCIcpA&userid=rMRSt0r8q0AvpUllXgrH2w

Umm, I do not agree at all. Turns out this restaurant is the sister to Sushi-Mon, I was kinda surprised whether my standards have changed over the years or the quality has gone down since my last visit to Sushi Mon. 

To start, nigiri did not good.. Some fish was not fresh n rice is packed loose. I know I should've given more attention to rolls since they look artistically pretty that i dun wanna eat it. but these rolls have all the same ingredients to me. That's why I opt for nigiri and taste the freshness of the food. But there are some props abt this place. at least salmon and unlimited halibut made me very happy. I also like the half order option where u can order just 4pieces instead of 8. 

It's surprisingly busy during lunch in a Tuesday. Only 2 waitress and 1 bus boy. It's quite hectic for an AYCE place to place order by telling the waitress instead of customer writing on an order sheet.

Too bad that can't be said about the rest of the staff. They just seemed bothered, and as someone who also works in the industry it takes a LOT to get me to write a review. First things first, the roaches. No more than ten min of sitting at the sushi bar, a rather large roach runs across right where we are eating. I had to smash it with my napkin. When we told the waiter his response was a lackluster ""oh where'd it go?"" And that was it, I never even got another napkin. We stuck around, I'm no stranger to Vegas and one of its many inhabitants are roaches. So I get that sometimes they get inside. It was when we were almost done that we saw another roach, this time a little baby one. That was it, baby roaches mean many more somewhere else. Told the hostess and I was offered a stamp card?!

The hostess intervened and said that they can't ask anyone to move.  Whatever, we left.  So I came back today with a large group.  Tons of open tables but none together.

I don't think it's even close.  According to our very nice and helpful sushi chef, this is owned by the same folks who own Monta Ramen.  And Monta Ramen is delicious.  In fact, you can order the same ramen after 11 pm.  Either a la carte or as part of the all you can eat deal.  Not sure I'd fill up on Ramen when getting AYCE but it's nice to have options.  

Pork belly - Wow.  Just absolutely deliciously fatty, crispy, and delicious.  The edges just have that beautiful crispiness you get from cooking it just right.  The rest just melts in your mouth.
Spicy tuna on a ""cracker"" - pretty awesome.  It was like toasted rice topped with spicy tuna and their sauce.  Delicious.
Grilled veggies - 2 small tomatoes slightly charred and perfectly tangy and delicious.  Nice mushroom, asparagus, and sweet potato slices.  I'm on a low carb thing now and, had I not broken my diet by eating some sushi rolls, I probably would have eaten 4 of the veggie plates and 4 of the pork belly plates.
Sushi rolls - don't remember all I had.  Spicy tuna was good.  California was just ok but better than you'll get at other AYCE places.  Yellowtail was good.
Green Tea creme brulee - not too sweet and delicious.  Custard was nice and soft.  Sugar on top crispy and caramelized beautifully.

We went in on a Wednesday (April 22nd) with a group of 7. Waited 50 minutes but was quoted 60 so that was great to get in a little bit sooner. We typically come in large groups for celebrations and usually have 2-4 kids under the age of 4. Each parent gets a share plate which is typically $3 as a small child will not eat enough to cover an all you can eat plate. Last night they told us they no longer did share plates unless they were under 3 and we had to pay full price ($26.95) for the children or buy a la carte for them. That was a big disappointment as we've been coming here for over a year without any issues. 

Once we figured out what the kids were going to eat, the service was incredibly slow. The baked rolls tasted burnt, half of our things didn't get delivered to our table, we had to ask multiple times for items and drink orders were wrong. 

All in all it was a disappointment. This was our favorite sushi spot. We will most likely choose a new place to go to that will accommodate children better. A child is not going to eat $26.95 worth of sushi.",1,0,1

They don't toot their horn about being one of the more popular AYCE sushi restaurants but they do have an organized system once they start to run a wait, and will even take down your cell phone number to call you if it gets so long you decide not to wait in the restaurant itself. 

I usually try to venture out and try at least one different item I'm there, either on their placemat, printed, or chalkboard menus, but usually the process goes like this because in the end, I'm more than pretty dependable: 

1. Appetizer.
2. Nigiri sushi.
3. Some type of 1\/2 roll.

now, keep in mind you can order HALF ORDERS on everything. we didn't know until later and made the mistake of ordering whole rolls and was stuffed by the time we finished our fifth. it makes it more worth it if you are able to try many different rolls because they're all really good!

I WAS coming here twice a week for about a month.

PROS: 
Open late with a last call at 2 am.  Super plus seeing how my boyfriend doesn't get out of work until 1 on the weekends and my work schedule is just all over the place.

Reasonable prices for the quality of food.  I like that they have an AYCE option even though we always ordered a la carte.

My one peeve:

After ALL the times I had frequented this place in such a short period of time....my boyfriend heads in with his family for dinner.  It was a party of 5 and 4 of them ordered AYCE... my boyfriend ordered a sashimi platter because he wasn't in an AYCE mood.  The server watched him like a hawk.... the ENTIRE night.

Long story short, my bf is a bit of snob when it comes to service so now.... he won't go back in there.

Sad face for me.

Aside from that....

Sesame chicken (karaage) is pretty good.

I couldn't go because I had to work.  My husband said the food was good but service was very slow because they were understaffed.  They charged $3.00 for my 1.5 yo son to share with my husband which was perfectly fine with them. Since hearing about this place and reading all the reviews on Yelp, I really wanted to try it.  It took me 'til tonight to try Goyemon because I was pregnant and wanted to avoid raw fish.  I was super excited when my husband and I decided to eat at Goyemon tonight because I have been dying to have some yummy nigiri since having my daughter.  We were seated promptly by a friendly host and shortly after our waiter came to ask what we wanted to drink then everything went downhill... *sigh*

Our waiter asked if we were doing the AYCE and I quickly said yes.  I asked if my son, who is now close to 3 yo, can share with us. The waiter said no and if we shared with him then we would be charged the full dinner price of $26.99!  He handed me a regular menu and suggested we order something off of it. I was not happy but my son needed to eat so I ordered the Niku Udon ($9.95) and cold tofu ($2.50).  My son finished the 3 pieces of cold tofu and ate about five spoonful of the udon.  I have been to other AYCE sushi places that didn't charge for small children and allowed them to share with their parents. Oh, and other AYCE sushi places had better service than what we got here at Goyemon.  Our waiter wasn't friendly at all.  He forgot to bring water for my husband though I asked for water for everyone.  No one ever came by to refill our water. We constantly had to flag someone to ask for water.  Our waiter never once stopped by to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything else.  We had to flag him down and ask to order more food.

The garlic tuna, super white tuna, uni and surf clam tasted good and looked fresh but the salmon wasn't fresh at all.  It looked like it had been sitting out for awhile.  The conch nigiri tasted like orange peel... yuck!  The sashimi salad was nothing special and the dressing was actually very salty.  Their pork belly, although very fatty, was very flavorful.  We ordered several half rolls which didn't impress me at all and sadly I don't even remember the names of the rolls because it was just that underwhelming.

After eating some so-so sushi, I was really looking forward to the dessert given the good reviews from fellow Yelpers.  My husband and I ordered the mango mousse, chocolate mousse, tempura ice cream and green tea brulee. Both the mango and chocolate mousse were good.  The green tea brulee was so-so... nothing spectacular.  The tempura ice cream was a big disappointment.  It wasn't freshly made and the tempura was cold and soggy.  My son, seeing all the dessert, wanted some too.  Given Goyemon's no sharing policy with children, I couldn't give him any but by this point I was so fed up with the bad service. It's not like our waiter even cared about us or would even noticed if my son was sharing with me, so I fed him some dessert.

My husband and I have agreed that we will not be visiting Sushi House Goyemon again.  We prefer Sushi Koma (Flamingo and Durango) and Sushi Tachi (Simmon and Centennial Pwky).",1,1,1

Be mindful of what you order so you don't end up with a lot of leftovers; they'll most likely charge you extra for wasting food. You can order 1\/2 a roll so you can still enjoy different sushi rolls without getting too full to try everything else or end up wasting food.

We were not greeted by a friendly hostess, and the server was not friendly either. She took our initial order and never came back until I had to ask if we could order more food. This is an AYCE sushi house! Or isn't it? When she took our second round of orders it was like we were disgusting her and it wasn't much. She did not even refill our water cups or drinks. Soon after we finished our first round of food, the hostess asked if we were all done? Really?
We were sitting there looking around and never saw this place with so many open tables. Maybe people caught on faster than we did. Service has gone severely downhill. Warning to the owner, there's a lot of competition out there.
We sure miss Gio. We walked in, he knew our beverages and always came to say hello. He made everyone feel welcome and the place had a happy aura. Not anymore.
We got into our car, drove off and we all sadly said, I don't care to come back anymore. Sad. I hope you can repair the great reputation you once had.  
Sincerely,
A new loyal customer to Soho Japanese restaurant on Jones\/Warm Springs.",0,2,0

The service was the slowest service I had in any ayce sushi restaurant. The portions were very small, half the size of other sushi place. Nothing special with the options. Worst sushi place.",1,0,0

The service was slacking & portion size of the fish was so tiny compared to others we've tried. It was just an ok experience rather than a good one. Not so much of the hype & not worth the wait at midnight on a Wednesday.,0,0,0

Very fulfilling specially when craving for a great sushi. We took a bar seat. Service was okay could be better. Overall, it was a good first time dining here! Oh and the bunny sparking sake was so good. I can't wait to come back..",0,0,0

Service was great again.  Learned we can ask for the head of our sweet shrimp deep fried so we could nibble on it too.  Everything was fresh again.  Love the uni (so fresh) and lucked out since my companion wouldn't try it - no problem - more for me!  Everything else was great, just like my first visit.  Really enjoyed the green tea cake - not too sweet so it was the perfect end to the meal that left my tummy too full.",0,0,0

Our drink orders were taken right away but we had to wait a bit to order our food. No biggie, I expected it.  

My husband and I ordered AYCE while the kids had a la carte dishes. Now, the sushi was great, the only gripe I had was my kid's chicken yakitori had to be sent back a few times before it was deemed edible, meaning it was raw and noticeably so.  

So if you order anything from the grill be sure to check it before eating otherwise your stomach will be paying for it later.",0,0,0
