That is not a compliment for anyone who does not know the area.  On the surface it is not that bad, but then you start seeing things.  Maintenance is clearly not a priority.  Also the elevators are horrible.  They shimmy and shake all the time.

The rooms are kind of OK.  I did have an issue getting a consistent temperature in the shower.  The rooms, hallways and elevators are in need of some updating.

If you are on a tight budget this will do in a pinch.  It is not for me, but it has its place.",5,1,2

Aria, Circus Circus, Luxor, MGM Grand, Monte Carlo, Signature, Four Seasons, Bellagio, Excalibur, Mandalay Bay, Mirage, New York New York, Vdara, and the Mandarin. 13 if you count THE Hotel (really part of Mandalay) separately, like they sometimes do. Then 14 if you count CityCenter, and 15 for CityCenter Residences (timeshares) but then back to 14 because I think they don't own the Mandarin anymore. 

Anyway, a huge corporation, owning half the Strip or more. Their M-Life frequent spender card is good at all the proporties to build freebee points. 

5 of their properties are linked together on the south end of the Strip, and 3 are prominent: Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay Bay. These 3 are connected by a free tram system between them. There are also connective walkways between the three.  

Where Excalibue is more of a family place, and Mandalay Bay is a higher end, more sophsticated place, the Luxor can be described as a place for the youth set. They have exhibits like The Human Body on the mezzanine, and the sophmoric comedy of Carrot Top. 

The nightclub, lacking creative naming capabilities, or seeking a particular Westchester district of Los Angeles crowd, is called LAX. 

And in the casino, they play loud club music all over, so it is hard to hear the numbers called on the Craps table. And most of your fellow players are noobs on the gaming tables, not knowing the rules or the bets.

The rooms are average hotel rooms. The most unusual thing is of course the Pyramid Shape, the huge light beam shining into the dark nigth from the top of it, and the diagonally moving elevators. It is a clever idea, until you get inside one drunk and try to stand upright as it moves sort of sideways. 

The Egyption  themed decor great outside with the Sphinx and Obelisk, but indoors it is drab, like being inside a dustry tomb in some places (like the buffet room). The pool has a huge waterfall contraption in the middle, but you can't use it for a slide, just a small waterfall. 

So if this is your first time to Vegas, and if you are in the 21-29 age group, this isn't a bad choice. They offer cheap deals on rooms, and I got a special show rate of about $60, and in the past got internet deals under $100 a night even on a weekend. But no bath, only a shower in the Pyramid rooms. You are probably better off room wise, in the separate tower.",9,8,7

Sadly, it is showing its age and even worse, the current owners seem to be picking away at the Egyptian theme and mixing in more ""hip"" things, like the LAX nightclub. It doesn't work. Grafting more modern things onto the Egyptian architecture looks totally cheesy and desperate. As for the room, the AC was rattling and wheezing like an old smoker on a binge. We also had a broken hairdryer but it was promptly replaced. Our room was fine, otherwise. The pool was great, we bought the day pass into the private area, which was worth it--as the big pool was filled with drunken douchebags and their guid-ettes. All the cool little shops in the Bazaar are closed--there used to be some nice ones. Now there are just some tatty little souvenir kiosks. Next time, I will stay elsewhere.

PS 1998 called and wants its wired internet back. Why are we charged a ""resort fee"" that includes WIRED internet? Who uses that anymore?",1,2,1

While the outside of this place is cool and mysterious with the beam of white light shooting towards the heavens and the sphinx out front looking stoic and wise, the inside seemed a bit.. I don't know.. kind of lackluster. Kind of a let down from what you see on the outside to walk in and there be just a bunch of empty space. 
But, we gambled here for about an hour, had a couple of drinks at the bar, and we did enjoy our time here. There are Egytian themed accents all throughout the casino and surrounding attractions, however, I think they could have done A LOT more with all that space. Maybe add more casino space or more hotel rooms? I don't know, but it seemed like all that open air space above the casino ceiling would just be a waste of energy. 
All in all, from a visitors point of view, Luxor is a cool place to gawk at from the outside, and good spot to gamble at for about an hour, but based on the reviews I've seen, not the best decision for an actual hotel stay.",0,0,0

The price was amazing especially for a suite and at check in they gave you a booklet with tons of coupons for shows drinks and food.
The hotel had so much to do along with the casino. There were 4 different shows located in the Luxor. Which was great because while my hubby was playing in the casino I went to the Titanic & bodies exhibitions since I wasn't 21. 
The Luxor was also conveniently connected to the Excalibur and the Mandalay Bay shops.

That is, If you just want a room.  The Casino floor is kind of up to date.  But the pool was all cement and cheap towels and lawn chairs - kind of just thrown together.  Kind of messy compared to hotels that cost only $20 more.  I don't need a TV, but the room has a mere 21"" tube television set.  In this age???  And the internet is a yellow cable you drag across the room.  Very plain bedding.  Not much of a singles scene on this side of the strip, if that's what you're looking for.  Neat to stay in a Pyramid though.  But I'm a pool guy, so I prefer Venetian, Mirage, Wynn during the summer months.  I'd stay again at Luxor in the winter, when pools are closed.  I found myself comfortable despite the drawbacks. UPDATE APRIL 2012 - stayed here again (changed from 3 to 4 star), the TVs are updated.  Nice mix of people.

THE GOOD: the bed in the room was comfy (it was a king), the sheets were clean and the pillows were soft. The area in the front entrance was nice looking with the statues and water. The food court was great and we enjoyed the Bodies and Titanic exhibits which I defiantly recommend! The folks at the mLife counter were super helpful!

THE BAD: everything else! The timeshare creepers who kept stopping us EVERYTIME we walked by even without me making eye contact. Just stop! We were charged a daily fee for ""extra amenities"" which was to include in-room internet and the use of the pool (which I didn't even use. Why charge me for something that I don't use?!?!). The internet part sucked considering I needed wifi for my iphone so all weekend it was hard to pick up a decent signal. Also there was no coffee pot or mini fridge which can be found in you average Marriott hotel nowadays, but for a luxury hotel on the strip... I guess those were not considered basic needs which caused us to eat at their food court and spend even more money.

THE UGLY: the elevator was horrible. It was very rickety and caused my husband and I to topple into other people while in there. The back door of our hotel bathroom was covered with dark finger smudges and a few red smears of goodness knows what. I had to wipe the door down before I felt clean enough to use it. Our room towels were really grungy and needed to be replaced. My husband forgot a comb so we called the front desk and they directed us to their 24\/7 store where we HAD to buy one at $5. Seriously?!?! Most hotels would give you a little free complimentary one if you forgot yours.

Overall I will not be returning. I would rather stay at a Motel 6! Don't waste your money!!",1,0,0

Last August my four girlfriends and I went on an extravagant and very memorable Vegas trip.  Our 5 day. 4 night trip was through this fantastic package deal which included day and night activities and accommodations at the Palazzo (a newer and fabulous hotel that is connected to the Venetian and I would highly recommend).  

Unfortunately, two of my girlfriends had procrastinated on booking their flights to Vegas until a few weeks before and with all of the popular airlines prices having skyrocketed, they found themselves drawn to the seemingly good deals of the underwhelming Stockton Airport's lone airline ""Allegiant"" which offers sporadic flights to Vegas for roughly $50 in planes the size of crop dusters.  The catch- they would have to stay an extra night in Vegas to catch a flight out.  In a further attempt to save money, the two lovable procrastinators decided to find a cheap hotel to rest their hungover heads in for their extra night in Vegas.....in comes the Luxor.  

My little procrastinators were pretty proud of themselves for figuring out how to save their pennies right up until the point that my non-procrastinator friend and I walked them into the Lobby and helped them settle into their evening at the hotel before thankfully taking our plane home.  The Luxor reminds me of of cheap vodka- take Svedka for example.  Sure, from the outside it looks just as good as all the other vodkas.  It's in a glass bottled (not plastic!), it seems to have it's own character and vibe going on, it's clear ...but once you open the bottle and experience what's inside you realize it's just crap and you feel like a total creep for buying into it.  That, my friends, is the  experience of staying at the Luxor.  

Once inside, you feel like you're on a ride at Disneyland as the Luxor is something of a cross between ""Mr. Toad's Wild Adventure"" and ""The Tower of Terror"".  Almost everyone staying at the Luxor is really foreign or just really trashy.  The entire decor is plastic, artificial, or falling apart.  Between the pom trees and the giant plaster of paris Sphinx in the center of the lobby, it's almost like the haggard hotel is pathetically begging you to believe, ""No this is not a shit hotel, You're in EGYPTTTTT"". 

But on to the best part....on the way up to the elevator, the elevator attendant (were I use the word creepy to describe him, it wouldn't be fitting enough.  Let's just say if he had been missing an arm and been a ghost, I would have believed it), clad in a faded, teal bellhop suit asked us which floor.  When we replied ""35"", he replied dryly, ""we've had a lot of jumpers from that floor"".  Aghast, we asked him how many people have jumped and he said, ""7 so far this summer"".  When the elevator doors opened and we saw the accommodations, we realized why.  

Not only are the rooms a shabby disgrace, (my girlfriend later confessed to me that she slept with her sweats with her hood over her head and her socks tucked into the bottom of her pants), but the pyramid shape of the building makes walking down the hall extremely dangerous as the overlook from your floor to the lobby is only about waist-high and after a night of drinking could be difficult NOT to tip over off of.  I began to wonder if those jumpers had actually meant to jump, or had simply toppled over the wall.  

In the end, my non-Luxor patron friend and I joyfully skipped off to grab our flight leaving our poor procrastinator friends to think about their folly.  We were gracious enough however to leave our laughter and ""told you so's"" until they got home.  No need to kick someone when they're down.  The moral of the story- stay away from the Luxor",9,19,3

This time around, I had friends in town and this was their temporary home for the week. We met up in the casino and decided to just stay here to mingle and play games. First of all, it was extremely warm and smoky in certain spots..as if the ventilation wasn't operating properly. Cocktail waitresses are few and far between. The (one) in our area was downright rude. She ignored us multiple times, even after our dealer tried calling her over. I'd rather pay and get a drink with a decent pour. I went up to the lounge in the center of the casino for a break from the tables.. I stood at the bar at least ten minutes..finally after the bartender walked by me five times he decided to help me. My first two drink choices, they were out of the ingredients. Nothing crazy that I made up, I'm trying to order from their drink menu.. He wouldn't let me open a tab, I paid for my one drink and sat over on the couches. Good luck getting service over there.. What's with this place? Some of the worst service ever! Does Luxor not care about their employees and then they take it out on customers by neglect? I don't know. But in this town, there are plenty other places to spend money. It's also disappointing that you can't get a bite to eat at midnight. After drinking for a few hours, people like to snack to soak up the booze! We'd like some other option than McDonalds in the food court.

Call again... Behind on his way.. 30 pass.. Nothing call..should be there soon.. Midnight comes  we lost are relaxing movie night.. At that point I call and cancelled.... How long for somone to come up and put the words on TV??. So I decided to go down and express my concerns of  12\/28\/15 at approx 11 am. with the front desk.. I asked again I need to have someone go up to my room and get captions going.. I told him this is my second request and I told him that I believe ada law requires there be closed captions for deaf.. Employee had the nerve to tell  me that has nothing to do with Ada. This is on Monday morning.. I said said I beg to differ.. Again he said.. No captions had nothing to do with Ada.. At that point I told him can you just get someone up.. I not going to argue about ada laws.. I am a code enforcement officer for city in ca.. I know the laws.. Didn't say that but was shocked at his response.. He said my Manger is there want to talk to him.. I said sure.. He apologized about not responding the night before and was just expressing my anger and advising manager that I was upset. We can't get full accommodation of room cause my girlfriend is deaf and she needs the captions.. He said I will put a rush of  it.. Told him do you understand.. Said that the decoder may not be working and he couldn't tell me why captions went working till tech went up. I expressed do you see we can't even relax and enjoy our TV.. She is completely deaf..sign language. This is putting a burden on us wanting to relax on out room.. He then snarkly said do you want me to send a tech up or not.. I said yes I do.. Never during our conversation did I say I didn't.. So he asked.. How long will you be gone.. Give me a window.. I said well I can't enjoy my room so well go and eat.. Look around and come back.. So I go back up to my room.. We leave a little later  than expected.. Tech guy comes up.. Who was very nice and polite, but couldn't even work the TV.. Couldn't find the captions.. I'm like this is your tech.. I had to show him.. So he says no.. No captions.. Cable company they are using box not working with captions.. Told him well need to provide something.. He said it's the cable company fault.. Once again.. I enforce codes.. It is the hotels responsebity not the cable company.. Enforcement would be after the hotel.. Not cable company..

However; we had a big problem our a\/c didn't work in our room and were used to sleeping with A\/c it was the roughest weekend ever! The rates were unbelievable but we needed somewhere to stay for the funeral. I don't think I could go back to Luxor in the future.

The location is great - connecting hotels, especially the Mandalay, made our stay at the Luxor worthwhile. However, the Luxor was not very impressive. Irritating harassment throughout the day by people trying to suck you into buying shows, dinners, etc... Even trying to con you into helping you check in, but directing you to their ""desk""! 

I've read several comments and seen pictures posted by other yelpers regarding the wear on furniture, the ""old"" smell, water damage in bathrooms--my room was the same.  Our first morning we found a red plastic shot cup peeking from under the AC.  The next morning we found an orange ping pong ball just under one of the beds.  I mention the colors for a reason--how were these items left behind by house cleaning? Yes, I have to agree, the beds are comfy and I liked the roominess.

The front desk registration staff--no common courtesies. During checkin I mentioned it was our 25th anniversary and I wanted to ensure our room would be satisfactory -- no acknowledgement--most people would say ""congratulations"". 

Would I stay at the Luxor again? Maybe -- depending on supply and demand. That's why I chose the Luxor this time around.",0,0,0

If you want a fridge, you have to pay for it. If you want a coffee maker, tough, because you have to have a suite room. Good thing I brought a cooler. 

Their housekeeping people who answer the phone are jerks. I asked for towels, twice, and after 40 minutes they told us to ""go look for the maid"". Really? That's not our job and that's what the $87 resort fee for the weekend is supposed to cover, right? 

Also couldn't use my free buffet credit for 2 because I wouldn't put down a credit card. Why would I give my card when the room is paid in full and the breakfast credits are free? Doesn't make sense to me. We were able to go to the buffet on Saturday and pay with our debit card there. They didn't need a room number like the front desk said they would. Why couldn't we have coupons to go to the buffet? (Note, Jeff, their manager, said he will refund us for the buffet and this has yet to happen).

The staff here couldn't give a crap about the people who stay here. I'd ask for a refund if I knew I could get one. Thankfully this is the last Frozen Fury so I don't have to come out here and stay in these crappy Vegas hotels who don't give a damn about their guests being happy. 

$170 a night ...what a complete waste of money. Super disappointed.

Update: got my car back upon checkout with a huge crack in the windshield. Really hoping Valet comes through and helps me fix this damage that happened as a result of us parking there!

Update 2: I changed my rating of this place from from a 2 star to a 1 star. I just got an email from their claims department for my cracked windshield, and they are claiming that my crack is from ""extreme temperature changes"". 1. There were NO extreme temperature changes. 2. The crack is over 12 inches long. Most pressure cracks are usually less than a dollar bill in size, 3. They provided me ZERO proof of this. 4. They were supposed to send me contact 72 hours from the day I reported it, and they did not email me until over 4 days later.

In case you didn't know, Luxor, Excalibur, and Mandalay Bay are all MGM properties, and Mandalay Bay is the only thing they got mostly right. My stay at Luxor began around 4:00 PM Monday and after hauling our bags through the casino corridors, we arrived at a frenzied check-in line. Of course, it was an optical illusion; the line was mostly groups of families checking in at once, so it went pretty fast.

We took the Wonka-vator to the 12th floor of the pyramid, found our room, and unpacked. The room was clean, included the necessary soaps, lotions, and towels, and had a working AC. Unfortunately, the alarm clock was 20 minutes slow. For shame, Luxor!

I had great cell reception with Verizon in this hotel.

A major problem upon venturing outside the room... timeshare recruiters. These people look like casino security, but if they're not wearing a utility belt, avoid them! These people will catcall you over and ask where you're from, etc. Then all of a sudden, you're at a recruitment desk getting the scripted pitch.

Here's a hint: give them two thumbs-up and they'll leave you alone. (It tells them you've heard it already.) Honestly, just say, ""No thank you,"" and WALK if they don't let up. Yes, it's rude, but Luxor is beyond rude in the first place.

Monday I dined at the Backstage Deli which is somewhere in the southwest corner of the casino. Cobb salad: EXCELLENT.

Tuesday I purchased an all-day buffet wristband which works at Luxor ""MORE"" and Excalibur buffets. I can't say either buffet is better, but I wasn't disappointed by either.

The biggest annoyance was the early pool closing at 8:00 PM. I don't gamble, I'm white, I don't go in the sun. I want to enjoy the pool at night. What the hell? Oh, and your housekeeping\/roomservers need to be more observant because someone's leftover dishes were in my hallway for most of the day. That's sloppy.

Trust me, Luxor. I'm used to RUDE customers, but the customer service part of your hotel needs improvement. Do away with the timeshare recruiters, expand pool hours, and improve your housekeeping. I, a customer, ACTUALLY may return for next year's lodging....",3,2,1

There is also an issue with way finding.

The Luxor doesn't really suck. But it is not necessarily the most luxor-i-ous hotel on the strip either. 
___________________________________
Here are a couple of the problems that we experienced on a recent trip:

*Thin walls. I really felt sorry for the guests situated in the adjoining  room. Don't come a knockin' if the bed is a rocking (j\/k). Seriously  you could hear  everything that went down in  the hallways and in the next room.

*Small Rooms (So much for ordering the 12 strippers). Hmm. Maybe...On second thought...

*Dirty Rooms. I may be durrttty, but my room shouldn't be dirty.

*Front Desk. I know that it's March Madness (hahaha to all you fools rocking the Indiana gear [1st round loss !!!). But 45 minute check-in?

*Confusing layout. I can see my tomb being placed here. 

*Why'd you get rid of the Japanese sushi place? That was one of the few highlights on a previous trip. 

*2 words: Carrot Top

A week with four of us and no amenities in the room was brutal. All of that is what it is. THE REAL PROBLEM WAS WITH VALET. I understand some hotels are now charging for parking, however the kinks in this hotel need some adjusting. It is 13$ per day and it is due and payable each day. They will not bill it to your room nor can you pay at the end. After complaining he was given 2 food coupons. 3rd day in and hubby has a 100$ bill and they said they cant make change. Needless to say he was not happy. ""You are a casino and cannot make change??"" is what he said. After talking with manager he was given change.

My husband had paid very well all week to have our car parked out front and it sat 20 feet away! If we had the other remote we would have remote started it ourself. We were appalled. Hubby and our friend went to talk to management in hotel and were greeted by a very rude lady who could have cared less. We spent around 200$ that week on valet parking up front as well as tips. But pay to get your car out of valet upon checkout was absurd. We will NEVER stay at an MGM property again. Hotels in Las Vegas are a dime a dozen. There are many other choices with FREE PARKING.

Picked this hotel because we were seeing shows both there (Criss Angel Mindfreak) and next door at Mandalay Bay (Michael Jackson ONE). These hotels attach via walkway so choice to stay here was made out of convenience. Here's our experience, positives and negatives:

Positives: Friendly, helpful staff. Casino not overly crowded and smoke\/smell is less overwhelming than in other casinos visited. Minimal external noise at night in halls if you have the heater\/cooler unit on (drowns out the nonstop music from the main floor, which is otherwise faint if you don't have the unit running). 

Negatives: bathroom door paint peeling\/missing in spots, bubbling. Long hair on toilet seat upon arrival. Dirt, mold, residue along bottom of shower on the outside. No coffee maker, microwave, small fridge in room (you have to go downstairs to Starbucks or order room service for coffee in the morning if you like to have it before going anywhere for breakfast). No complimentary bottle of water, shower caps, q-tips, little things provided even in ""cheap hotels"" other than shampoo, lotion, soap. ""View of the strip"" room as told to us at checkin = view of a parking lot and freeway. View of rusted pipe and grime above the bathroom sink. No thermostat - you either want the room hot or cold, there is no middle. Bathroom fan not working. Missing drawer knobs.

Other negative: Checkout is 11am. If you ask about a late checkout like we did, you will be told that checkout at noon costs additional $15, checkout at 1pm is additional $25, etc. And, you can't checkout over the phone if you do this, you have to come down and wait in the lines that are often LONG, LONG, LONG. Makes no sense since the additional charge goes right to your credit card on the reservation anyway. We skipped the late checkout since we wanted to simply call the front desk, follow the telephonic checkout prompts and go. 

I will not return to Luxor. Staff aside, it doesn't present well. I would go back to Paris, Bellagio, and New York New York where I've had wonderful stays (lovely rooms, ordinary and\/or upgraded amenities, great staff). Eager to add Wynn and Aria to my list - they're next!",0,0,0

The room was large, clean and comfortable, on the 18th floor and with a very, very comfortable bed (Grand Tower Room). The bathroom was large, with a large, deep bath tub and large roomy shower and of all things, a phone.  

Luxor's location at the south end of the strip (in between Excalibur and Mandalay Bay) wasn't a problem for me.  I never took a cab.  I either walked or used the terrific transit system.  There's a 24 hr bus pass for $8, the SDX and Deuce bus lines have a stop right across street, and between the two routes, any location on the Strip was right outside the bus doors. 

The only downside to this location is that for some reason, there was no microwave or refrigerator or  even a coffee maker in the room.  Even at a discounted rate that seems to be cheap move.  Additionally, the waste baskets were quite small, only two of them in the room and no receptacles for recycling available either. 

While my issues are valid, and I did not use any of the hotel amenities (pool, spa. salon, etc) and did not play any of the casino games so I can't speak to this but I'd come back to this hotel again.",0,0,0

Check in was easy, the next morning our shower was clogged.  I had to call maintenance 3 times within an hour to get anyone to come up.  Was not helpful at all.  

Also the hotel is not close to the main strip, up a few blocks would have been better.  The buffet was bad, seemed like old food.  The shrimp has a weird smell, the selection was good but the flavor wasn't there.  The Subway up the street was better.

We valeted the car several times, took awhile each time to get the car.  Once one of the drivers left pistachios and shells in the car.  

I will not stay here again, there are better hotels for just a little more on the strip or even off the strip for a cheap cab fare would be better than the Luxor.",0,0,0

A few of my friends even said they would think a hotel making millions and millions of dollars each year would put forth some effort into renovating their rooms.

I think this review fits in with most of the rest and I felt very 'meh' about Luxor.  We paid about $80 a night for a Monday-Thursday stay which is pretty awesome considering that you usually can't find a room for under $100 on the strip.  But you definitely get what you pay for...  Very, very standard (and in need of renovation) rooms- which again, is more than okay with me because you're only in the room for a few hours between bars\/casino's and the pool.  The food choices are okay, the More buffet wasn't bad for the price.  The real standout was the Pyramid Cafe, you must try the waffles or pancakes (Red Velvet pancakes?!  If you have time, check out the Titanic and Bodies exhibits, both are very cool.  The guys at the bell desk are extremely helpful too, they'll store your bags before or after check-in with no charge.  One extra side note for the ""pro's""- the guest services rep who checked us in, let us have our room 3 hours early with no charge which we really did appreciate.

Everything else about this place just lost me...  I understand the pyramid thing is pretty cool and gimmicky but after a while it gets annoying.  The floor plan of the place is very odd, the elevators are stuck deep on the corners of the place and you find yourself constantly going up and down stairs and escalators to anywhere or do anything.  One thing that made me really dislike this place though, were the ""vultures"" constantly on the floor trying to get my girlfriend and I to come talk to them about their newest condo ownership opportunity and give them money so they can comp us something later...  This happened more times than I can count.  I guess overall, even though we stayed there we never really felt welcome.  It's possible my previous visit set too high of a standard for a Vegas hotel...  During our next trips out to Vegas we'll be willing to spend a little more on a hotel for newer rooms and hopefully a better floor plan with no crazy salespeople.",3,0,0

However, if you're planning to stay here, do not come in expecting a 5 star resort like Venetian or wynn.    This is a budget to mid range hotel, so adjust your expectations accordingly. 

Pros:  cool architecture, fun casino, nicely renovated rooms in the pyramid (rooms are called the Cleo rooms), very clean common areas, cheap room rates (depending on timing); very friendly staff; room was clean; wifi worked well

Cons:  rooms have very thin walls (could hear neighbors flushing toilets, coughing, etc); $32 resort fee is ridiculous, particularly in winter when the pool is closed; lots of kids; not in the center of the action (this is also an applicable complaint to mandalay bay and Excalibur); food at the buffet was inedible and probably the worst I've had on the strip (the staff was very friendly though)

The place is on the south side of the strip and close to Mandalay Bay, Excalibur and New York, NY so it'd the perfect place to start a walk up and down the strip.

My only beef was that the room was a bit on the disgusting side and they put us in a room on the end of the hallway in one of the towers. This wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that the sun was shining on the the other side of the wall our bed was on and heating up to close to 100 degrees.

Wife & I had a business conference in Las Vegas, decided to also spend a few days at one of our favorite natural earth wonders, Zion National Park, about 3 hours from Vegas. 

The hotel in the tiny Zion Park town of Springdale honored our reservation for a king-bed room, which included a fridge, coffee\/tea\/hotpot, a full room service menu, an ample complimentary breakfast each morning, and full wi-fi. There's about 15 brand-name and mom-&-pop hotels in the little town outside the park, and all of them offer the same.

After 3 days in Zion, checked into the Luxor, a name raising expectations of something ""deluxe,"" on the ultra-modern, high-end-deluxe-hotels Las Vegas Strip. Not so much...

Oversold, can't give us the king room we reserved, gotta take queen instead. OK. Fridge in room? Nah. Coffee\/tea\/hotpot? Nope. Comp breakfast? Whadya think this is, the Ritz? 

How 'bout in-room Wi-Fi, gotta have Wi-Fi? 

Er, nope. We've got a long Ethernet cable for hardwire connection, but that's useless for our iPads. Wait...what century is this? A marquee hotel on the ultra-modern Las Vegas Strip, with every kind of digital & neon connection available - hell, even the Luxor pyramid lights up in sequence at night - and no Wi-Fi in the rooms?! ""Well we have Wi-Fi in the public areas, down at the casinos & restaurants."" Ahh, there's the tip off...

As confirmed by my wife and several other Vegas-savvy people (I'm a little slow about corporate manipulation,) the reason they don't have any of these basic in-room amenities is because THEY DONT WANT YOU TO STAY IN YOUR ROOM. Not even for a half-hour, enjoying a hot teas while researching tonight's restaurant on the Web. They want you downstairs, gambling and buying your coffee or tea at one of the 6 Starbucks. Pure corporate manipulation put before comfort first.

There have been close to 2000 reviews over many years for this place, and they can never raise above 2-1\/2 stars. You get the distinct impression they've done nothing to spruce up the place or invest in better pay for their employees or basic amenities for the rooms.

I've stayed here at the Luxor a few times and have always had a positive experience. 

First off I'd like to say that I've never paid full price for a room, meaning I've never booked my rooms through the actual Luxor website. I used trivago.com and have always saved a ton on room prices. I however haven't been back here since most of the casinos started charging for parking. 

Booking has always been a breeze and check-in even easier. I've only ever had to show my conformation email, my ID and my credit\/debit card and and I get my room keys. One time they didn't have the room available that I had booked and they gave me a free upgrade!! Yay to free anything. 

My room has always been clean and organized. Never had any complaints with people in the rooms beside me nor ever had a problem with smoke smell in my room. I know some hotels, even when you ask for a smoke free room, it still smells like smoke! 

My only complaint would be the people that are always bugging you to see shows. Honestly it's so annoying and I purposely try and avoid them. If I wanted to see a show, I'd ask you for tickets. Overall though, great experience and will come back again for sure.",7,5,6

The rooms are old and cheap and poorly maintained.  The whole place reeks of cigarette smoke since the ventilation system can't handle the cloud coming from the casino - not that the smoking ban in the rest of the place is actually enforced...

The management also allows a group of time share scammers to operate at all the major foot traffic intersections pretending to be ticket agents for the shows at the resort.  Be prepared to get harassed by these shysters on a constant basis.

Hopefully, Luxor is on he list of casinos to meet the wrecking ball in the near future.  It was unique and interesting once upon a time, now it's just another overpriced, under quality, facility set up to scam every penny out of those dumb enough to stay there.",2,0,0

I paid around $35\/night to stay here and it was way beyond anything I've ever stayed at for that price.  I loved the open atrium and the general feel of the hotel's decor.  It was nicer than, say, Circus Circus or Excalibur, but it wasn't so nice that you felt out of place in jeans and a t-shirt.  

My check-in was quick, and they let me in about 5 hours earlier than the proper check-in time, which was much appreciated after a very early flight.  They didn't give me too much trouble when I refused to pay for the in-room phone that I wouldn't be using, and the room itself was clean and comfortable.

The buffet at Luxor was very middle of the road, but it was convenient, especially for breakfast.  The shops in between Luxor and Mandalay  Bay (they're connected) were also handy for picking up some additional clothing after soaking up way too much smoke.

When we checked in there was a dirty towel and used soap on the sink, although it did get better for the other two days.  The resort fee is a joke.  It includes internet which is by ethernet cable, and a short one at that.  Now I could see wired internet at a hotel by the Pentagon where most of the guests are prohibited from using wireless, but come on there is no good reason for it in Las Vegas.

You can see this pyramid as you are flying into Vegas.  We could not wait to go and check it out.  One morning we drove over as we got to the parking lot we spotted a huge van and in the front window was hundreds of smudge hanging from the ceiling and you could see it from the front window.  My sister and I jotted out of the car, walked up where we met a hippie from California.  She lives in the van and travels around selling her fresh hand picked leaves.

Wow the smell was intense, we talked to her for quite some time and bought some fresh smudge.  I was a bit worried going through airport security that they might arrest me because it was so fresh and still moist it smelled just like marijuana. After speaking with her she told us spiritual people flock to Luxor.

When you walk in the architecture of the pyramid is beautiful with statues, waterfalls, very peaceful.  My sister and I felt a warm sensation as we admired every detail.  It just felt like a very spiritual place to be.  They guy's trying to sell time share were annoying.  Hard core pushy sales guy's.  Oh they offer some great shows.  And there are some awesome shops.

Sent two emails to that address and never received a response.

My husband and I stayed in your hotel on 9\/8 & 9\/9. I am compelled to write to you as I couldn't be more displeased with the quality of your product.  From the moment we stepped foot inside the property, there was a distinct & offensive smell like some type of bad air freshener bomb had exploded & no one ever bothered to air it out.  This odor permeated everything & I later realized that I could even smell it when we exited taxis in front of the building.

Walking to our room (#7008 for your reference) felt like we were walking down a dark, dirty alley, where visible trash, dust & dirt on the other side of the hallway barrier was obviously never cleaned up.

We reserved a ""Pyramid Deluxe King"" room. There was nothing ""deluxe"" about this room, which had no safe, was missing hardware in the bathroom - and when my husband tried to hang his travel toiletry bag from the the towel rack, the rack fell off the wall. A dirty ironing board and rusty iron were apparently your idea of amenities.  Additionally, the window leaked during a rain storm & soaked the belongings we had placed by the window.

I have stayed in many Las Vegas hotels over the years and have never been so disappointed and frankly, disgusted by the low quality of the Luxor accommodations.  To add insult to injury, I was apparently allergic to that horrible odor & spent the entire 2nd day of the trip sneezing uncontrollably & unable to breathe because my sinuses were blocked.

Pros
1. Line at check-in was very long, but it was only minutes before we were handed our keys.
2. Rooms\/bathrooms are good. They're not outstanding, but it's better than your usual roach-coach motel.
2. Luxor has decent exhibits like the Titanic and Bodies exhibits.
3. Restaurants on the bottom floor for those in need of a quick snack while you're hanging in your room
4. Nice friendly staff
5. Couldn't hear the people next to me.
6. Cheap prices

Cons:
1. You need to go to a certain sliding elevator to go to your room. Makes it annoying when you're on one side of the casino, and you have to walk to the opposite side to take the elevators going to your room. If you take the wrong one, then you'll just have to get off and start all over

Despite low teaser rates, the astronomically high resort fee ($29 and change all-in) means a minimum $70 room night. And MGM devalued the stays here and Excalibur by doing away with the coupon booklets, which contained a nifty $20 coupon that I always used for dinner at the Excalibur Steakhouse or for a couple of top-shelf cocktails at Luxor's High-Limit Bar. So Luxor's cheap-stay aspect is a fading memory, but the disappointments didn't stop there.

MLife charged my credit card at booking for this stay (I showed the charge to the front desk clerk upon arrival), but the hotel had no record of my reservation. If I hadn't arrived so late (about 11pm, off a flight from Seattle), I might have gone elsewhere, but without car and in desperate need of sleep, I paid a walk-up rate, and now have to waste time contacting MGM for a refund. 

Hyatt Diamond members are entitled to published MLife Platinum benefits, but this partnership has been poorly executed from inception, at least on MGM's part. Getting published benefits is like pulling stubborn weeds, and I don't like being patronized in response to my requests for room upgrades and late checkout. Yet this happens every time I masochistically return. On this most recent visit, the snippy young clerk took some obvious pleasure from sneering that ""you're getting a double-upgrade from what you paid!"" (Meaning a late-night walkup rate for one of hundreds of rooms still for sale near midnight!)

My purported ""double upgrade"" to a suite with a soaking tub was in fact a king room with a couch (Whoo! Living large!) and a standard bathtub, not a whirlpool tub. The room smelled fainlty mildewy, the furniture was scratched up, the carpet worn (in two spots so badly that patches had been cut and crudely sewn in -- Frankenstein's sutures). I was too tired to exert the energy to get reassigned, too tired to point out that an upgrade is a published benefit, not something that needs to be grovelled for.

In the morning and early afternoon, I was actually on the clock for work. My 4pm checkout was granted without any pushback, but despite the quiet place to work all day, the WiFi went out on my floor about 1pm. Calls to the front desk and to the third-party vendor were a frustrating time-suck, and the service was not restored during the rest of my stay. 

And, as always, Luxor housekeeping staff interrupted -- twice, at 1:15pm and 2pm!! -- despite my hanging out my ""do not disturb"" sign. (""We're getting our Lux on!"" -- NOT!) I happened to be cat-napping and I seriously resented the intrusion. Is it just phenomenal ignorance or poor training on Housekeeping's part? I've been similarly interrupted on my last FOUR Luxor stays. I've called management to point out the futility of desiring to be undisturbed at their property. Each time, the manager I spoke with agreed that it was inappropriate, but it's just ... part of the Luxor DNA. Expect to be awakened during your early-afternoon nap. Or ""nap,"" if it's that kind of Vegas trip.

Look, the hotel has its draws -- the equilibrium-challenge elevators in the pyramid, the mostly smoke-free sports book, the proximity to Mandalay Bay. But now that the value proposition is gone, it'll be tough to overlook the shoddy condition of the rooms, the resort fee completely out of proportion to benefits received, and the mystifying lack of transparency regarding MLife platinum benefits.",4,0,0

The hotel is clean but it certainly needs some upgrading. The brass especially. Easy access to the neighboring hotels and a seemingly long walk to the monorail. I love Egyptian history and mythology so I was in love with the architecture and design of the hotel. We booked 8 nights in the Pyramid and I found the room to be nice and clean. The toilets in the Pyramid do not flush properly due to the shape of the pyramid and the water efficient design. ""Aim For The Hole"" The toilet paper stays stranded at the top of the bowl and it takes 6 flushes to erode Turd Island enough to get it gone. It's not very water efficient when you need a poo stick and a lifetime of flushing. Anywho, on the second night it rained. I came back to our room at midnight to find two significant leaks in the ceiling. I called the front desk, she comped us $50 to the buffet or the Lux Café, and sent maintenance. The maintenance guy was great, talked to me about the toilet problem and had a peek at the leak. He told me I could live with it until it stopped raining, or I could ask to switch rooms because he knew they weren't at capacity. Obviously, I'm switching rooms. So I called the front desk again, waited on hold for 15 minutes then was told I couldn't switch rooms until after 12pm tomorrow because they're 100% full. Sooooo I have to listen to a double drip all night long? Totally not impressed. The casino floor and the hotel floor were essentially empty, there's no way they were at capacity. We switched rooms to the tower the next morning and were told it'd be a 30-60 minute wait for a bellman. So we just took all our luggage down to the front desk ourselves. The lady at the desk was nice and I ensured she comped our resort fee for the day on top of the $50 credit. The tower rooms were great, clean, large, flushing toilets and no leaks. There was a door connecting the room beside us and I could hear the crazy drunk women like they were standing beside my bed at 3am ""Ronnnnniiieee are you pooping?!?!"" OMG

I ordered a bathmat for our room at 10pm, thinking it might take an hour or so to arrive. At 2 am there was a loud knock on the door, waking us both up. A bathmat delivery at TWO AM? Four hours after I requested it? Sweet Jesus. 

Don't fall for the people milling about the hotel floor asking you if you're staying there. They look like hotel staff but they're MGM staff trying to sell you on a timeshare. We bought into it and got out of it right before the bus left. After that, we spent the next week telling them we already signed up so they'd look all disappointed and leave us alone. 

Vegas is not a place for people with sensitivities to scents. The cigarette smoke in the casinos is bad enough but the scent the hotels pump into every available air intake is too much. It was overpowering the second we walked into the Luxor and I was grateful to leave it behind. 

Everything in the hotel is expensive - Starbucks charges at least 80 cents more than the Starbucks in the Mandalay. Breakfast at the  food court was running us almost $30. The city is designed to separate you from your money and they do a damn fine job of it. If I ever go back to Vegas, I will choose a different hotel.",0,0,0

The rooms are certainly dated and it shows its age but the service was very good.  The restaurant, Rice and Co. was top notch.

I would have enjoyed the spa but it was closed for renovations.  One can use the Excalibur spa next door in the interim for a nominal fee.

2. Room was filthy and while you are walking to your room you can see all the trash people throw over the ledge, which there is a ton of in this place.
3. Booked on the phone, did the mobile checkin and requested upgrage. Upgrade was that of a 70's motel room with run-down furniture, popcorn ceiling and NO USB PORTS!!
4. When returning from lunch the door frame of the room literlly fell apart and on me. Was told they couldn't move my room and I was expected to stay in a room where the door wouldn't close or lock. Once I told them they are out of their minds, Security had the audacity to ask me what my problem was...are you kidding me???

There is no wifi, no coffee maker in the room and the whole place is dark and confusing. The buffet was full of sad, soggy and greasy food. Their entertainment options are poor. The towels are stiff and stained and the bed linens are flimsy.

Their arcade is a lot of fun. Hahaha, yes, I still go to Las Vegas for their arcades. Their little mummification museum is pretty interesting. I forget if it is required to pay for the little recorded handset for the museum walk through, but if it isn't, I recommend you not buying it - unless you're reeeeeaally interested in the stuff. I was satisfied enough simply looking at the exhibits.

They have an IMAX theater as well. Pretty cool.

The only thing I hated was how the rooms are shaped. You know how the Luxor is a pyramid, right? Well, the rooms give you a view that makes it hard to see the view. When you try to go up to the glass to look out, your head is forced at a weird angle.

Although Orbitz discloses that this hotel charges a $15 ""resort fee"" many hotels routinely waive such fees if asked. Particularly for short stays in which you are not using anything included in the fee. My trip was an overnight trip. I didn't have a laptop so didn't need Internet access, I didn't need access to the gym and like the rest of the free world, I have a cell phone and therefore did not need to make local or long-distance calls from the room phone. I explained this and asked quite politely for the fee to be waived. The manager refused. She said a full 80 percent--80 PERCENT-- of the patrons ask for it to be waived and they flat out won't do it. She also said it's the same at every MGM property. 

I made a mental note to remember that so that I wouldn't book at another MGM property or any hotel insisting on such a bogus fee. 

Then I saw my room.

And I came to understand why they charge this fee-- I can only hope it's being squirreled away into a fund for COMPLETE room renovations. My room on the 2nd floor (in a section of the hotel with the nerve to be named ""Pyramid Deluxe"") was super shabby!

There were lights out in my hallway and it was scary and dim. There was visible dirt on the comforters. No tub. The shower door was off the track, and the shower head itself was old and malfunctioning. The carpet was severely stained. The toiletries were generic off-brand. ALL of the towels, from face to bath, were dingy. Simply: It was gross.

Then there's the TV. Poor cable signal and limited channels. And then of the channels that exist: No BET? No TV One? Seriously? There were several Spanish-speaking channels and an Asian-market channel. But for all the African-Americans I know who spend copious amounts of money in Las Vegas each year, the Luxor doesn't carry either major cable channel marketed to African-Americans? Duly noted.

I had to wonder if Luxor set these old, cruddy rooms aside for people who they know got deals on Orbitz. I was there for a show, so I didn't even have time to ask for another room, and they probably would have been disinclined to offer one. Long story short: I wouldn't stay at the Luxor again, and I also would have to seriously think twice about reserving a hotel room through Orbitz--not because they did anything wrong, but because if this is how hotels treat Orbitz customers, it's not worth the discomfort to book through them.

For years, I didn't step foot into this hotel since new hotels were opening and such and what a horrible mistake I made.  I didn't have a whole lot of lugguage here, just a couple of jackets and such, since my real lugguage was at the Paris Hotel & Casino.  

And apparently, security and other hotel personnel kept checking in on my room when I wasn't there (don't know why, but I could've been on the casino floor or eating somewhere) and on the night I was going to check out, I go into my room and it was cleared OUT! My jackets, my snacks, some money, and other belongings were ""thrown out"" by the housekeeper. WHAT THE F***?! I was able to claim my jackets, but the money and snacks were gone, their reasoning for doing so, was that they thought we had checked out already.  

Luxor is beyond unprofessional and just out right disturbing.  Looking through my stuff and my room to see if I was even staying in the room.  My room key still worked and clearly in the system, it should say the room is still occupied.  

Till this day, I'm still angry that they took my $5, cheetos, and a Scooby-Doo keychain I won from the arcade... Who knows what else they'll take from you, just watch out!

The front desk staffer who checked us in made sure to give us a room on a high floor with a decent view. It was a nice size, though the lighting was a little dim. I didn't like the bath products that looked like they were in little mayonnaise jars or the fact that we didn't have a bath mat. I'm still working out my feelings towards the various types of mirrors in the room. I like the way I looked in the skinny mirrors on the armoire, but I didn't like the false sense of thinness that they instilled in me. I liked that I was able to pluck my eyebrows perfectly with the aid of the magnifying mirror in the bathroom, but I didn't like seeing every pore on my face in such disturbing detail.

The beds were comfy and there was an extra pillow waiting for me to cuddle with drunkenly when we got back from our night out. Tita had to settle for snuggling with the extra blanket. The curtains did a very good job of keeping out the daylight, but we were still woken up too early by the whores next door who let their cell phone ring incessantly as they chattered away at 6am.

The Sunday brunch buffet, while not mind-blowing, was certainly decent enough, AND we got a $3-off coupon when we checked in. I am totally enough of a cheapskate to use a coupon at the buffet. Also, endless pretty good mimosas! And tasty carnitas! And chocolate cake!

The pool area was nice, not overcrowded but plenty of hotties. The security staff let us hang even though we had checked out and didn't have room keys. It was hot as hell and I forgot sunscreen, so I'm kind of lobstery today.

The casino was fun, even though I lost all my gambling money. I did win $165 playing roulette, and then lost it all at the blackjack table and Deuces Wild video poker.

The restaurants were decent. I was particularly pleased with Cat House's (see separate review) ambiance and food. Very tasty! We got free admission into Cat House and LAX by wandering around in the building earlier in the day. LAX was not particularly my thing, but thats okay.

The view from the 9th floor to the atrium was amazing and the view from our pyramid room was pretty nice facing Mandalay bay and the airport. 
The reason why the elevator shakes a lot is because the elevator is traveling across the pyramid. Its not like a typical elevator that goes up and down, its traveling diagonally. 
The luxor should take better care of the outside of the pyramid by cleaning the windows because it looks a little dusty. The hotel has a great design to it and its a shame to see it look shabby. The beam on top of the pyramid is pretty impressive. I suggest they should put light beams out of sphinx eyes that would be cool to see. Overall its a good place to stay on a budget in vegas.

It saddens me to leave a less-than-positive review for the Luxor; it was previously my go-to in Vegas, but it's slowly become less and less hospitable -- even in the short course of less than a year.

I'll start with some positive feedback.  For instance, the hotel looks a lot better than it did some years ago.  The interior has been upgraded, it's much lighter and brighter, the buffet is wonderful and a good deal can be had if you're staying at the hotel, and it boasts some great stuff in-hotel if you don't feel like hitting the Strip.  However, most of the things to do in said hotel were closed this time around, with no forewarning to paying customers that they'd be out of luck during this time of reconstruction.

Hey, I get it.  Vegas is a 24\/7 kinda place, but while taking down multiple ""attractions"" in a single period of time may save you the effort of extended labor, it also leaves your customers pretty displeased that half the coupons in the book provided don't work because the places they're pertinent to are closed.  ""Come to our night club!"" becomes ""Come look at our night club from the outside and wonder what it might be like to attend some day!""

Then there was the room.  Ah, the room.  The bathroom floor was dirty and was never properly cleaned during our four-day, three-night stay.  When we used one of the bars of soap provided for showering, they took it when they cleaned the room and didn't replace it -- or the shampoo that we had used!  I concur with one of the other reviews on here that the room is quite stuffy, which is compounded by the fact that there are no windows to open, which is important because we woke up two of our mornings there to a stench not unlike that of an open sewer.  I don't even know where it came from, though the smell around their pools and overhead walkway was similar.  Pretty disgusting.  Do they honestly expect that nobody will notice that?

A very special kind of aggravation was having to deal with the suits that circle like hungry sharks in the entryway of the casino, which we had to pass through to get from our rooms to the self-park area.  Every single day, multiple times a day, we were accosted by, ""Hey!  Wanna buy some tickets to a show?""  Are you kidding me, Luxor?  Stop harassing me, already.  I was a paying customer.  Peddle to some other poor shmucks coming into your casino off the strip.

So here's the tl;dr version:  It's dirty and it sometimes smells.  The things to do in-casino are shut down without warning and without information readily available about when they'll be back in business.  Anywhere you walk in the casino is as likely a spot as any other to be harassed by Luxor's suit-wearing panhandlers.

When you know someone higher up, it's hard to beat their friends and family deals on their suites. I stayed here last weekend for my birthday and was really excited for this trip. After finally getting here after stopping at the amazing Whole Foods down the street (we almost couldn't leave), we got in the check in line. It was somewhat long but went by pretty fast. 

The guy checking us in showed us the room we would be staying in (The Pyramid Suite) saying it had two TVs, separate living area with couches and a fridge and we get to the room and it didn't have any of that. It was cramped, did not have a fridge (um we just bought all this food), no couches, no second TV. The bell man comes to drop off our stuff and even he says we're in the wrong room and it's too small. 

Ok, whatever I just figure we can call and switch rooms. The lady at front desk is so rude and basically tells us that we're paying a reduced rate. Um yeah I am, so what?!! After speaking with her for a while she finally switches rooms and we get the right one and it is so much bigger. Cool. After lugging all our stuff in there we realize the fridge and AC and TV don't work. At this point I am annoyed. We had to get an electrician come fix it because a fuse we broken. Finally we settle in and everything is going great. 

Now when we checked in, the guy at the front desk said that he would comp some champagne flutes for us since it was my birthday. When we called to get them sent to or room, it literally took an hour (I wish I was joking). He also shows me a bill and he's trying to charge me thirty something bucks for them. I specifically told him that they are comped, ask the front desk. He says no I need to know for sure or I'll get charged for them. I said hold on I will call them again. Sure enough front desk tells me yes they are comped. Then he says no I need to talk to them personally. At this point I am like f the glasses. So I let him come into the room and use the phone, I don't even know if he actually called, then he walks up to the table grabs the glasses back and leaves. I am literally like wtf? Is this real life? Five minutes later he come back with the glasses and goes ""here."" 

Needless to say, my stay was annoying as hell. I bumped up a star because my last stay at Luxor was amazing in the Tower suites. When we checked out we definitely mentioned what happened, and the manager on duty I think her name was Janelle was amazing. In fact she was the only competent person we met at the hotel. She comped a room for us which was really sweet of her. She saw notes under my room for the glasses and I also had comped buffet passes for me and my friends for the weekend and NO ONE told us. So basically there is some really bad miscommunication at this hotel. I was really pissed about not getting the buffet tickets but oh well. I would advise against staying at this hotel since there are so many better ones on the strip but if you get a good deal I would say go for it. Just don't expect good service.",3,3,3

There is a good selection of food, everything from a Deli to a Mexican Bar\/Restaurant. Pricey but good.

I was on hold for ten minutes until a very rude bellman told me that I should go west or learn to read a map. It is clear that the staff is dissatisfied and full of disdain for guests.
The next morning, I discovered that my double locked bicycle had been stolen off my car in the lit garage. (The front desk upon check in had resassured me that if the bikes were locked they would be fine because there was 24 hour security and security cameras).
 
The security was rude, did not understand why I was upset ""It's just a bicycle, mam."" Then, after going through the process of filling out paperwork, I am told that they do not report the thefts to the police. I spent the next few hours at the LVPD.

-Water pressure in the shower was great
-Room was a good price
-The lobby looks nice
-pool was large (however, one pool was closed off)
The negative:
-Only 2 elevators were working for two of the days we were there which meant we had to wait for an elevator to arrive or one that had room for us. 
-Air conditioner was situated in such a way that the room didn't get cold. Only the side of the room with the windows got cool. I kept wanting to turn up the air conditioner but it was on high already.

-inside the elevators was chipped and run-down

We've been coming to Las Vegas now about 5 times since 2006, our last visit was from 4\/3 to 4\/8.  Every time except once we've stayed at the Luxor and it rates 5 stars from me because we DO keep going back.  Why?

-Reasonable room rates, even with upgrade to Tower Deluxe room which we always do as I just LOVE the separate bathtub\/shower
-So you don't get a good view of the Strip.  Big deal.  Walk outside.  I'm just happy my curtains close properly & the room is dark for sleeping. 
-I've always sleep really well and have not yet had a problem with noise.
-No coffee pot? no fridge?  no shampoo?  Bring your own.  I think in Vegas most hotels don't put those in the standard rooms as... it's Vegas - they want you to get out of your room, eat in their restaurant downstairs & buy their spa products.  But if you call housekeeping, the staff wil gladly give you any shampoo, etc that you need
-Yeah, it is south of the other hotels on the Strip, but we like to walk (gives us something to do 'cause we don't gamble. hehe) or take the bus if needed.  Never had a problem getting to or from a show.
-good access via the walkway to Mandalay Bay.  Nice bars and restaurants.  Speaking of...
-Just love T&T (Tacos & Tequilas) in the Luxor's Atrium. High quality Mexican food and the drinks will make you very happy.
-Fantasy is the best stripshow we've seen.  The girls are terrific dancers, their lovely host can sing and is funny, comedian Sean is a riot.  I'm just sayin'.

It's a decent hotel that get's overlooked, but that's the way it is.  Over the years we've had a few problems (missing TV remote, hate the resort fee that's tacked on for services we do not use) but never had any charges on our bill that were wrong.

the room doesnt worth more then $45 even no refrigerator or bathtub.

The bad looks dirty (I was constantly thinking how many people did something un on these sheets sorry my language)

I had always wanted to stay at the Luxor because it looked so cool as a kid and the light on top of the pyramid is basically iconic (and really helpful when you're stumbling home trashed at night), but I can't tell you how disappointing it was. Keep in mind this is coming from someone who has no problem staying at a Motel 6 or Super 8. First of all, as soon as you get in the door (after what feels like a mile long walk from the parking garage) you're greeted by an overwhelming perfume that they pump through the whole place. No joke; it sticks in your clothes, and it smells exactly like an at home Brazilian waxing kit. Instant headache. Second, the place is a damn maze. The basic setup of the pyramid means the elevators are on the very edges of the building, so you're walking forever to get anywhere in the hotel and even then you can't find anything (took us two days to find the Uber pickup location). When we checked in I told the man working the counter that we had called and paid for the parking fee and resort fee for the whole trip ahead of time. At first he said that wasn't even possible, but then he finally found the transaction. Having cleared that up he gave us the key and said nothing more about parking, so we assumed it was taken care of and we would be able to come and go. Nope. Had to pay parking to leave the next day. Went down to talk to them after that, and the check in line was about 50 people long, so we paid again that day. Finally the next day (our last day) we saw the line was short and were given our parking card. On. The. Last. Day. How does that help, I ask you? No offer to reimburse us either. About the actual room: it was what we asked for (which is rare when you book through a third party site, so there's that), but the slant of the pyramid means your whole room is slanted as well making you feel cramped. The decor in the rooms and halls is old and tacky and honestly not worth what we paid. Also, no mini fridge, no microwave, no shelf in the shower, not even a shower cap or body gel for God's sake. We got one bar of soap and a lotion, which for a hotel we paid over $100 a night for that isn't even ideally located on the strip is ridiculous. You seriously get more amenities at a $50 hotel. What exactly did we pay for? The 'luxury' that they advertise wildly? And here's the best part: at 8am on our second day we were awakened by hammers pounding the wall next to ours, which was shortly followed by jackhammering down the hall. They were literally doing a full remodel on our floor while people were staying there! Don't get me wrong, they desperately need it, but they didn't even think to shut that floor down and put us somewhere else. And when we asked about this someone just blew it off and suggested we ask to be moved to the tower if possible (which is seriously a crazy long walk through the labyrinth, not including the insanely long line at the front desk to even complain). So we toughed it out for the rest of our trip. By the time we left we were so pissed and over it that we didn't even go down to wait in that long line to demand a refund; we just booked it out of there. The Luxor prettttty much ruined our Vegas trip, so avoid it at all costs.",0,0,0

I just recommend you be aware of the following:

1. Early check in fee
Check in is at 3pm. If you want to get in earlier even if your room is available you have to pay $22.40

2. Resort fees
For each person you pay $22.40.
In return you gain access to the pool, access to the fitness center, free daily paper, free printing of your boarding passes, free local and long distance calls and the coupon book.

We used the pool, the fitness center, and the phone.

In terms of the coupon book, there's $20 credit for dining (limited to certain bars and restaurants) and complimentary entrance for two to the LAX club in Luxor. Those were most applicable to us.

3. Check out is at 11am
Make sure you're not to hungover.

We were only in the room to sleep and shower, and since we only had to pay the resort fees and early check in, it was worth it.

I still don't understand the early check in fee and resort fees. The room was already ready, the pool is already there, and not many people use the fitness center. It's not like I inconvenienced you, Luxor and MGM properties!!!

I would probably consider Luxor to be a Mid-Class hotel and Casino. Not really the low end of Mid Class, but more of the middle to high end of the mid class hotels. It does have its ups and downs, when staying at the Luxor. 

Let start off with the Parking Garage. We really couldn't find Valet, cause the arrows are not up to date on where everything should be. So we found our way to the garage, which, probably seen better days. Then again, Luxor is 15 years and still running, I would probably say, that its better then others that probably been there longer. 

When we checked in, the person who checked us in, was very nice and talkative. She liked the fact that, us locals, are taking advantage of the discounts on vacationing in Vegas, just to get away from home. Despite the fact that we have no kids, you can't really pass the opportunity of cheap rooms. Especially the Spa Suite, which is bigger then an average room, that we usually would get at any other hotel in Vegas. 

Our room was on the 29th floor. Just one floor shy of being on the very top floor. It was a very nice room size for a mid class hotel. We got the corner of the pyramid, with a king size bed, a spa tub which is close to a slanted windows. It also had a separate living room space, that had its own TV, table and couch. But of course, the down side of it, is a lot of wasted space. Its nice they had everything, but I think, they could of put more in the room, then the basic essentials. They did have a fridge, which was cool, but no mini bar. They did have a closet with an ironing board and blanket, but no extra pillows. The bathroom was nice and big, but again, wasted space, where they could probably put more into it, and not enough lighting in the bathroom. They have lamps by the bed, in the living room, but one overhead light, over the sink of the bathroom, that's not even bright enough to really see how you look in the morning. Not until you put your face, right against the mirror to see how look in the morning. Now, thinking about it, not really sure if that's a good thing or bad thing. The windows to the pyramid needs cleaning on the outside. Mainly opening your curtains and seeing dirt spots from rain streaks, doesn't really make your view of Vegas any prettier. 

The first thing we did, was buy tickets to the Titanic exhibit. Of course, its our second time doing that, so I probably won't right another review, but the second time around, we were able to read everything and not fall behind and went at our own pace. We didn't get a tour guide this time around, but I think it was better. But I still love the Titanic the first time around, and always be one of the best attractions to go to, over and over again. 

We also got Criss Angel Believe tickets, where I wrote a review about it, and stated that it was an OK show. Criss Angel is a good magician, but his Vegas show Believe, is a copy of his best work from all his show on TV, but  in a live version. Wasn't really impressed, cause they took out the Cirque Du Soleil of it, but it was great seeing him live. Just wish he did more to it, and something new, then to recycle his work in a live show. 

Room Service for morning breakfast, was kind of pricey, but very well presented. I got the steak and egg, and it smell and tasted great. My wife got the continental breakfast, and she was full, after the fact that we left Luxor that day. So, it was a decent choice for room service, just wish it wasn't pricey. 

Over all, I would recommend this place for short stay, just to have a place to rest. If you could afford the Spa Suite, go for it, that Spa tub was awesome. Don't worry about mooning Vegas from your room, cause you probably won't be the first, nor the last. I'm sure no one else will see you if you do. The scenario is decent, where ever you go in Luxor. Just don't expect much when it comes down to amenities. Read my reviews on Titanic Artifact Exhibit and Criss Angel Believe, then you can probably judge, if you want to go see it or not.",1,0,1

The first night I was on the 4th floor pyramid and had to use earplugs to sleep. Do not accept a lower pyramid floor if you're a light sleeper - they bump techno and club music all night in the casino and the bass will make it difficult to sleep. 
I was able to move my room the next day, but this took over an hour because I had to call for a cart THREE times in total (once during the initial call. Once 20 minutes later. And once 20 minutes after that.) Each time I was told a cart was on its way. 
Finally an hour later someone showed up. When I complained about sitting around and the hour that was just wasted, he said the ticket didn't come in until 10 minutes prior. I called the bell desk again to find out about this and they claimed I told the front desk I did not need a cart.  Ok, so the person at the desk apparently messed that up - but there was no explanation of why the 2nd phone call didn't yield in results.  And the bell desk when I called the second time HAD my information, so none of it made any sense at all. On a slow Tuesday afternoon I was dumbfounded as to why this could have happened. 

One gross thing was the toilet in the new room didn't flush properly. The jetstream didn't reach the whole bowl, so all throughout the week TP and um, bodily waste, would collect towards the front of it and I'd have to take another piece of TP and manually push the buildup down. It was gross, but I didn't want to deal with changing my room again over it. I was thankful I didn't have a roommate, because that could have been even more gross. Additionally....the sink drained extremely slowly. I dumped the contents of the ice bucket out after they'd melted and it took a full 15 minutes for the water to drain. Also gross....and ghetto. 

I couldn't do a room charge for food. After wasting no less than 20 extra minutes trying to get this sorted at the restaurant, the reason for this was finally given - apparently when checking in, the front desk person did the equivalent of closing my tab when I paid for the room (which you have to do upfront.) He didn't ask me if I wanted to do this or not. He closed my credit card in their system. I wanted the room charge so my M Life account would be credited for the money I spent on the food. If I want to contact M Life I can probably get them to credit it, but is it really worth even more time than was already wasted onsite? Not a great experience as a new M Life member. 

Their fitness room, although nicely equipped, is not 24\/7 access and closes extremely early at 8:30pm. The first night when I was there and they booted us, myself and the other several people leaving grumbled about the early close time. Some people like to work out at 5am...some of us like to work out at night. Even 9pm would have been more reasonable!

Aside from that my stay here was great for the value, and the room was spacious. My only other disappointment was that none of the rooms seem to have bathtubs, (unless maybe the deluxe suites do) this was disappointing as I need to take baths when I travel to manage back pain.  They do have a jacuzzi but it's not very hot and in January closes at 4pm. I will also say that this hotel is quite popular and the jacuzzi was often filled to capacity, so it wasn't very relaxing with people being loud\/drunk etc. They do have an indoor spa but it's an extra $30 per day to use it.

Speaking of extra costs - they charge $15 if you want a late check out!! $15 for an extra hour of sleeping in? That's terrible. Way to gouge your customers, MGM. 

In short, I might stay here again for the prices and overall feel of the place. But on an upper floor...and with jacuzzi visits planned out better. And hopefully bathroom facilities that work properly.",0,0,0

Good old Luxor from the outside the hotel still looks good fast check in, nice bar's located around the casino floor, not as big gambling area (no prob not really a gambler), Starbucks, Mc Donald's and ease of the tram to Excalibur and Mandalay place mall that connects to Mandalay Bay hotel.

It's gross. 
The hotel rooms were pretty poor. Unfortunately I was here for 4 nights for a conference last week. I stayed in the East tower, for reference. How in the world is there a hotel that does not offer wireless? They have an ethernet cable you can connect to, but there is no desk or table, so you have to stretch the cable onto your bed. Even when it is plugged in, it was so loose it kept falling out. Even if I was not there for business I would be disappointed. My room did smell, all the time. There were a couple of dead bugs, maybe moths, in the drawers so I obviously had to keep everything in my bag.

But their service and the attitude of the staff is awful. I often complain about service, my yelp reviews are testament to that. I have this notion that if somebody is laying claim to my hard earned money then they have to act like they deserve it. I worked hard for this money, you don't have an automatic claim to it.

Things went wrong at the Luxor as soon as we checked in and went to the room. First of all, we had asked for a room with one king bed, not two queens, second, the room smelled strongly, very strongly of Chlorine. It felt like the room had been a Chemistry lab until just then. So I call to complain about both things. Turns out that when you ask and they reserve a room with 1 king bed that means nothing. Cue the Seinfeld bit about them knowing how to take a reservation but not how to keep it. And it is the keeping part that makes it a reservation. We told you, right on the website that we can't guarantee the bed type, she said. I remembered looking at the website carefully when I made the reservation, it said no such thing. I went back and checked after, it still said no such thing. So..pants on fire! Then about the chlorine thing, she agreed to change my room. Only to change my room I need to head back downstairs to the reception and collect my new key. Now what you need to know about the Luxor is that it is shaped like a Pyramid, each side of the pyramid is about a city block long. So when your room is at the opposite end from reception, you basically have to walk approximately 1.5 city blocks to get to reception. 0.5 block to the elevator and 1 to the reception. If you're lucky, it's only 1 block. Ok, so I walk to the reception, meet the manager and tell him my story. No problem, here's the new keys. Walk back 1.5 blocks to my room. Pick up our luggage and wife and I schlep it all 1 city block to the new room. Yay! the bloody key does not work. What the hell? So walk back 1.5 blocks to the reception. Tell him the new story. His response? ""Did you have your cellphone near the keys?"" 
Me: Perhaps.
He: Sir that might be the problem. But here I've fixed it, it should work now.
I start with how this is a little frustrating. I've just been on a 2 hr flight to get to Vegas and now I've been doing all this walking for a room that isn't even the kind I asked for. He can't do a damn thing about it. Finally he takes $10 off my bill. Thankfully the keys work now.  Now it's late and only an hour left before the show to which we had already booked tickets, and I'm hungry after all this walking. We head downstairs to the Pyramid Cafe for a quick bite. What a disaster area? The food there merits a whole other review. Let's just say, my wife might as well have been served a large bowl of salt.

2 days later, we're heading back to our room, and guess what, the keys don't work. I head back downstairs. It's the same manager guy, he recognizes me and asks what the problem is. I tell him my keys don't work. He asks, surprise! surprise!, whether I had stored the keys near a cell phone. I lose it. 
a. Both my key and my wife's aren't working.
b. People tend to have cellphones in their pockets and their hand-bags. Hotel keys tend to go in the same places. If a hotel made a key that doesn't work when placed close to a cellphone, perhaps they need to rethink their keying system.
c. In any case, stop pretending like it's my fault the keys are not working.

The right response would have been to send someone to our room and fix the door lock. Or to offer sympathy. But to start again with this cellphone nonsense? Do they not teach their service personnel basic courtesy? Do they really take their guests for idiots? I mean to say, WTF?

Oh also: they charge you a ""resort fee"" that goes towards newspaper, Internet etc. The Internet access is a joke (no wifi), but we never got a newspaper, nor were we told how to get one. So, liars again.

And finally, no way to make a little coffee in your own room in the morning. You have to walk (you guessed it 1.5 city blocks) to the Starbucks near reception, get your coffee and walk back, try that before you've had your morning joe!

Just don't stay there ever. Save yourself the trouble. There are much nicer places on the strip.",1,3,1

While reading other reviews I was a tad worried that our rooms would be awful.  Other then that I had no major worries. Check-in process was insane. There were so many people trying to check-in and out that you could not tell which line went where. Also there were many Luxor employees ""hanging"" around the registration area that did nothing to let guest know where to go. Once we found the line it was not that bad of a wait because they opened up more check-in stations.

We were in the Pyramid and were told how to get to our room which was pretty easy. My only complaint was that it was on the other side of the casino but that is nothing major. I was pleasantly surprised when I entered our room to see modern and updated furniture as well as a brand new TV. My only concern with where the room was that we would hear a lot of noise from the casino below but we heard nothing our entire stay.

As for the casino it is just like all the others I have ever been too. My biggest complaint of all the casino is Vegas are that they allow smoking which is disgusting and make it unbearable to gamble in the evenings. During the day and early afternoon I was fine but once the early evening and late night hit I could not stand to be anywhere near a casino.

Food was rather lacking in my opinion but they do offer an array of fast food and casual dining plus two Starbucks. It was not that big of a deal to us because we went to Mandalay Bay and New York, New York for dinner the entire trip and that was connected by walkways. I just wish they had a few more options for breakfast other then Mcdonalds, Starbucks, and the Pyramid Cafe.

There were about three shops in the Luxor so just go next door to Mandalay or down to City Center or Planet Hollywood to get your shopping fix. As for entertainment the Luxor has Criss Angel's Believe, Carrot Top, Fantasy, and Menopause the Musical. We saw Criss Angel and I was not impressed. Compared to the other hotels on the strip Luxor needs to think about getting some more or different shows. We did not try any of the bars or lounges at Luxor as we went elsewhere since most were closed on Monday and Tuesdays.

Check-out was a breeze since we put the daily resort fee on a credit card. We just used the express check-out located by the bank of elevators or the main desk to return our keys which avoided the long check-out line.

Overall this was a great hotel and even better deal for six people. I would not hesitate to stay again.",1,0,1

The lovely Luxor was our home base of operations for our little New Years Eve extravaganza. And to be blunt it was great. 

We ate some fantastic meals (The Cathouse) and they have a great place in the middle to get sandwiches (Backstage Deli). So on food it gets high marks.

The gambling was good....well as good as it can be when your loosing your ass at the craps tables. With friendly dealers and Pit bosses who actually acknowledged you existed.

I had personally stayed at this property in Oct 2001. Back then I was in awe of this marvel of architecture; this time not so much. We had booked into the pyramid and at check in the clerk told us she was upgrading us to the tower due to being sold out in the pyramid. It is my understanding that the pyramid rooms are under renovation and we were lucky to be in the tower. I will agree to the tower being nice our room was clean and newly renovated. We passed by some pyramid rooms and saw peeling wall paper and the rooms were just plain wore out. Overall the entire hotel\/casino is wore out IMHO. If you pay attention you will see the dirt everywhere. We will never stay here again; there are just too many options available. The draw backs are the same as other reviews in here but the MAJOR DRAWBACK in the rooms walls are, as if, paper thin. Every night we had to deal with the guests next door. We could here their every word, thump and bump. This does not make for a quiet stay when you need rest. We knew when everyone in the tower was flushing a toilet or taking a shower. The buffet was awful! I am being kind. The only place worth eating at in this property is the Back Stage Deli. While still overpriced it was still the cheapest place to eat and the most food. I got violently ill after eating at the Public House- heed my warning. Bring water. You will be thirsty and at $3.00 a 10 oz bottle you wont regret buying a case of water from Walgreen's or Walmart. I can only knock MGM Resorts for allowing this property to run into such a ragged condition, but they are slowly but surely fixing her. The big problem is the noise and outrageous prices they charge for food. This does not make for much desire to gamble in their casinos. We've found other locations that just feel better.

I called about a month ago and they told me that I could check in earlier that 11AM if a room was available. This was a lie. My room was ready but we had to wait until 11AM. So we checked our bags to bellhop and went to the buffet...I'll do a review on the buffet later (not good at all). As you know, there are two parts to the Luxor...the pyramid and the Tower. STAY IN THE TOWER! The tower rooms are much nicer and bigger. Shower, soaking tub, comfortable bed and pillows, floor to ceiling windows. The pyramid rooms look old and motel-ish to me. We were on the 9th floor facing the ""strip"". This hotel is at the end of the strip so you can only see the MGM, Excalibur and Tropicana from your room. There is no mini fridge  or microwave here but there is a store downstairs that is open 24\/7.  With this being said, prepare to walk! Wear comfy shoes because you are a good distance away from everything. 

I knocked off two stars...1 for the casino and 1 for the check in process. You know how some casinos reek of cigarettes? Well that is one thing you don't have to worry about in Vegas. All the casinos are well ventilated and smell nice...the Luxor however does NOT ventilate the smell well at all. They just cover it with a perfume! You smell it as soon as you enter the hotel. It's strong enough to give you a headache. Also, the Luxor is apart of the Take a Break timeshare thing so be prepared to be approached by a man\/woman asking how long you're in Vegas for around every corner in this casino. As for check in, they had about 10 windows for check in...but only 4 or 5 people working. The line to check on was crazy long and took about 30 minutes to get through.

There was also a $15 per night resort fee which said it covered in-room internet, the gym, etc. When it said in-room internet I just assumed it meant wireless. It doesn't. You pay $15 per night for wired internet (if you brought a cable and if you can find the plug...we couldn't). 

There is no wifi available at all in the rooms. None. So, the first day I camped in Starbucks all day and paid $9.99 for slow wifi. On the second day I discovered that if you sit in the Bazaar area, you can connect to the MGM or Mirage free wifi and get better signal that you can get from the service you have to pay for elsewhere in the hotel. The chairs are also more comfortable and the ladies that work at the snack shop there are really nice.

Our room was in one of the towers and it looked like it hadn't been upgraded in ages. The door handles were all scuffed and scratched. For some reason you don't get a real comforter either. Just a sheet, a thin blanket and a ""satin"" cover. Saving on laundering costs I suppose?

The walls are also very thin. We could hear everything going on in the rooms next door. Even just the flush of a toilet can be heard.

The elevators are literally falling apart. Many buttons are missing and the control panel is exposed in many of them. I felt oh so safe.

The housekeeping staff doesn't follow the ""towels on the floor need to be replaced, those hanging don't"" rule. I try to conserve water in hotels by not asking for new towels every day. I don't get them at home, why would I in  hotel? But they replaced them every day anyway. Not very ""green.""

My final, and biggest, complaint is that the room keys are terrible. In 3 days I had to get 4 new keys because they stop working if you get them anywhere near a credit\/debit card or a cell phone. I'm a girl, I keep everything in a purse. How am I supposed to keep the key away from everything in my purse? I tried by surrounding the room key with business cards but that didn't work.

One night at 3 AM, I returned to my room and my key didn't work. I went to the front desk to get it fixed (again) and they said their system was down so they couldn't give me a new key. They told me to wait by the elevators for someone from housekeeping to let me in my room. I waited by the elevators and no one showed up. So I went back to the front desk and finally got a new key. When I got up to my room, the phone rang and it was housekeeping telling me that someone from the front desk was ""looking for me"" and then put me on hold. I hung up after waiting 30 seconds.

Seven years ago, we stayed in the pyramid after a busy holiday season. We'd requested an early check-in after driving in from Los Angeles, and I thought that the smudges on the windows, the stale air and the light coating of grime could be attributed to the rush to get things ready earlier after what must've been a busy New Year's Eve crowd. However, arriving for a regular weekend in November that was not connected to a peak travel event, I'm not able to give them the benefit of the doubt this time.

Luxor wouldn't have been our first choice, but because they had offered a fantastic rate and our activities were planned closer to that end of the strip, we felt we couldn't pass up the opportunity. We hadn't been through the doors in seven years, but the lobby looked pretty much the same. Not that a hotel has to constantly redecorate, but in a city like Las Vegas where constant change stimulates customer attention, you'd think that it would try to look fresher.

The lack of freshness followed us to the higher levels of the pyramid. Looking over the railing while making the long trek from the elevator, the dimness and the sense of uncleanliness makes you think that you're actually in an ancient Egyptian tomb. There were four of us staying in three rooms on the same floor, so I know that I'm not basing our experience on one unfortunate room. As soon as we opened the door, the room smelled of stale smoke in a way that houses smell when every occupant has chain-smoked since 1972. Being part of the pyramid, the windows do not open, and there is no way to circulate fresh air. I awoke each night with the ominous feeling that I will one day be diagnosed with lung cancer from second-hand smoke inhalation, and this particular stay at Luxor will have been the cause of it all. 

The room's air was cold, but adjusting the knobs only made the room colder over the next few hours. It was 75 degrees outside, and we were wearing jackets inside. One of our group called for maintenance on his air-conditioning knobs, and another commented about some spots on the wall. I had noticed these, too, which makes me think that Luxor prefers the darker earth tones of their chosen patterned wallpaper and carpet so that you don't notice the filth. The furniture, as I remembered it, was the same only more scuffed and scarred than last time. The curtains were soiled where hands had grabbed the fabric to open and close them rather than use the poles. Surely Luxor can afford to replace soiled fabrics and circulate furniture that needs repairing.

There was rust around the bathroom air vents, and there was nothing fresh about the bathrooms. I realize the rapid turnover of hotel guests in Las Vegas, but I would think with as much revenue as they generate that Luxor could hire more cleaning staff and block off sections for regular inspection and deeper cleaning. At the very least, the cleaning staff should be trained to look up occasionally so they might see the collection of cobwebs above the bed, which were the first things I saw each morning. 

Perhaps the goal of all Las Vegas hotels is to encourage you to get out of the room and spend money, and maybe the Luxor goal is to make your room so repulsive that you don't want to return until the last possible moment.

Unfortunately, i did not get the same experience i had before. 

I checked in at MLife line since I am a member, let's just say I was not given the room that I wanted, their excuse ""It's the weekend and it's fully booked"". Fully booked my ass! I am willing to pay for a suite (since it's my birthday) but no, they did not give us a suite. Oh well. 

We were given a tower room at the 8th floor, first concern was when we entered the room we noticed red liquid on the carpet, we did not bother, instead we covered it up with a towel. 
Second thing was, the hair dryer, it was not working, we called housekeeping, they replaced it, but still wasnt working. 
Lastly, the TV was not working. When we called housekeeping, they said somebody will come up in an hour. An hour had passed, no one came. We had to leave the room. We didnt bother to call again, instead we went to the front desk to tell them what's going on and the guy where just like ""we cant do anything about it"".

It's my birthday, i dont want to stress myself out and we have the whole weekend planned, we got parties to attend to, so we didnt bother to argue. After my experience, i dont think I'm staying here again! 

Pyramid was nice, just not the experience, I thought you get to be treated like Kings and Queens but I got treated like shit instead and it's unacceptable.",0,0,0

When I called to complain they only were going to come up and clean the jacuzzi. I told them that was not acceptable after getting a visual of that HAIR!!
Then I spoke to Management then they upgraded us again which was okay just more space.  But my experience in this upgrade was awful as well....housekeeping never bother to clean our room for 2 days. Not to mention the SMOKE that came into the room all day.

It's awesome at night too. I usually like to just wander around, take photos and taking in new sights. Lord behold, when I was by the reception\/Mlife membership area, there was this one asian woman who came up to me asking several *intimate questions. I politely asked **Are you selling me something? She assured me that she wasn't selling anything. She kept asking me where I was from, how long in town, how much money I'm spending. **I thought it was rather a little rude to ask all that to a stranger. Then she just grabbed my hip, hands, taking me to this station where this one older white guy was smiling at me. It turned out they were trying to sell me a package timeshare or whatever it was for 3 nights for $165. I politely said to the guy, I thought it' was kinda rude that woman forced me over here to Hear your Pitch. He kinda ignored it and tried to do a Hard sell on me. I just look at him and said **No, I declined. Then I immediately saw an attitude from these 2. Literally, I just shake my head in contempt and Rolled my eyes at them. Honestly, I understand that this hotel is a 3 stars hotel and maybe your employees and these 2 are starving for money or whatever But That is no way to treat a guest. Or even a potential Guest. I left with a sour note, honestly I go to Vegas multiple times a year and I considered the Luxor many times but never again after this experience. On another note, these people at the Luxor should take notes and learn from the Wynn and the Palazzo, when I stayed and visited over there, the staff and manager were super Nice and accommodating, they weren't money hungry and grabbing people to sign up for some stupid timeshare shit.

The morning after my first night, I noticed my arm itched. After a few hours, I realized I had a line of what appeared to be bug bites on my arm. I called down to reception and told them I might have bed bugs. They moved to a worse room on the first floor and told me someone would call me. By the evening, no one called and the bites began to show up on my neck, back, legs, etc. By the morning, I still had not heard from anyone so I called the front desk.
The front desk manager told me the room had come up negative for bed bugs...as if the bug bites on my body didn't matter.
I didn't have these before I arrived. Unless I somehow got bed bugs from my own car on the drive to Vegas, the Luxor has bed bugs.
Nothing was done to compensate me (except for washing a small pile of clothes that I had to request from the front desk after a waitress at one of their restaurants told me they should have offered this to me)... All they did was delay and make me feel like this was my fault. I'm not unreasonable, and I tried to keep my cool, but their lack of concern really got to me. I didn't expect a free vacation, just someone to confirm this was real and help me address it. Maybe try, ""oh, that's terrible. Let me walk you through all the things we can do to make sure that if our tests were wrong, you don't carry them to another one of our rooms or to your home."" Instead, I got a smug, corporate non-apology.
Thanks for ruining my vacation. I suggest others not ruin theirs by staying at the Luxor.

Update: when I checked out early, the manager covered one of the two nights I stayed at the hotel. He still refused to accept that the room had bed bugs nor give me any help ... even after I showed him the numerous bites on my arms.

I think that says that we have had at least average to better than average experience here which is why it's getting three stars. Our last stay here, in April 2017 which also happened to be during our wedding, brought the rating down. 

The rooms are fine. We've stayed in the tower rooms as well as a pyramid suite. The rooms are a bit run down especially in the pyramid but they have everything you need and they're fairly comfortable. The showers are big but everything just needs a face lift and seems musty. 

The hotel itself is great and I love the Egyptian theme and energy of the casino and main areas. There is an amazing smell when you walk into this hotel that I can't adequately describe. I love it. 

The restaurants are ok but not great. The pyramid cafe for breakfast has probably been our best dining experience here. We have also been to the sushi place, Mexican, public house, crepe fast food type stand and several of the food court locations. Nothing was amazing and the food quality has definitely continued to decrease with each visit we've taken. A short covered walk to Excalibur yields better and higher quality food and mandalas bay which is also connected is better yet. 

Service here has always been exceptional and unfortunately on our trip in April it was unacceptable and hence the reason for lowering the star rating. Everyone from the check in registrar to the mlife representatives, and we are gold mlife members, were just not nice. The woman at the mlife desk when we checked out was borderline rude in fact which we have never experienced before. Everyone just seemed to not give a shit about us and we were very put off. We actually booked our next trip for this coming September at New York New York because of the poor service we experienced here in April.

Pyramid Room: Blech. Even the non-smoking rooms smell like smoke.

Pyramid Suite: Smells like smoke, but there's a freakin' hot tub in there! That's pretty awesome... but if it costs more than $190\/night, I wouldn't do it.

Tower Room: Awesome, they are nice and comfy, and I would suggest staying here for how cheap it is (and not for how very, very far away it is from the middle of the fun on strip)

Pool: Good pool, nothing spectacular, but good

LAX: This club doesn't have a whole lot going on, but if you are female and you get in for free, then shake your ass a little in front of the VIP section so you get in there for free too-- then it is pretty alright (though the same can be said for Hyde and The Bank)

Bodies Exhibit: Neat , nothing too outrageous and crazy in there, but if you're at all squeamish (and I mean, even just a little bit) DON'T GO. You'll be wasting your money as you run through the exhibits to get out.  But for all of us that aren't, the BEST room is the veins and arteries... so cool.

Titanic Exhibit: An actual piece of the ship is in there... and it's big.

The amenities seem to be a bit outdated, but was average for what you pay. There was not a fridge in the room and our bathroom was in need of a renovation, but overall it was comfortable. The beds are like clouds, so I got great sleep (or maybe that was the alcohol?!).

There is an extreme convenience factor here because there are indoor bridges that connect you to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur, and it's within walking distance of NY-NY and MGM. We must've walked between these areas a dozen times in two days.

We spent one of our nights a bit more low-key and stayed ""local."" We started at LAX in Luxor, which was overly crowded and music was all over the place, but there were cheap drinks and a free cover for ladies. We then had an easy time walking over to the rooftop bar at Mandalay.

Luxor definitely draws in a younger (late 20s\/early 30s) crowd so that was great. I noticed that the surrounding hotels catered to older crowds.

Luxor is slowly falling apart from the inside and has the worst infrastructure I have seen in years. 

This was my first trip to Las Vegas and with Las Vegas hotels. I got a fantastic deal from Expedia from Saturday night at December 28, 2013 to Monday Dec 30, 2013 for 2 nights. I have never visited Las Vegas so I was just going by the reviews and hoping for the best. Very Disappointed.

Here are the things a normal 2 star hotel like, say, Comfort Inn has over overpriced Luxor.

Free Wifi 
Free Breakfast
Clean Bathrooms - we found hair and condoms on the floor...really....
Proper Outlets - The plugs keep falling out of the outlets. We could not charge the iPhones because their outlet system was ancient and we literally could not plug in the chargers since the connection was too loose. We had only one proper outlet and for the others, we had to literally HOLD the charger close to the port. Can you imagine a Comfort Inn without a proper outlet?
Proper Wired Internet -  Our Wired Internet (for which we paid our resort fee)  did not work because of the room's ancient infrastructure. The man from the front office who had to fix this issue just peace'd out on us because it was late. We spent over 3 hours with his man. 3 hours we could have spent exploring Las Vegas.

The food for which we were given discounts for was overpriced.

Our Last Day in Vegas, we shifted to a 2 star hotel. It was nothing much but it had all these things and it was much more satisfying.

We were offered a room upgrade for a small fee, so we upgraded to a Pyramid Suite on the 17th floor. That was the highlight of our entire stay. 

We got to our room to discover a dank, gloomy room that smelled of stale cigarettes and mold and mildew. The air conditioning was insufficient and the room never cooled down. There was even a flyer placed in our room advising us to keep the curtains closed to keep the room cool. I thought that is what AC is for. We had a nice view, but couldn't enjoy it because the room heated up too much. Also, the furniture was uncomfortable and the bed was extremely hard. Sleeping on concrete would probably be more comfortable. 

The air handling system on the casino floor was poor. Every location in the casino smelled like you were at a cigarette smokers convention. Even the restaurants reeked of smoke. 

This place is in serious need of a remodel. Another Yelper posted a photo of the pyramid suite from 10 years ago and the only change to the room was a new bedspread. The furniture and lamps were identical.

I guess there's a reason this is one of the cheapest hotels on the strip.  $40 for a room with a $20 resort fee.  Where do I begin?  We stayed in the pyramid because we had heard the rooms were pretty cool.  Because of the weird shape, you have to walk all the way around the pyramid to get to your room, unless you happen to be by the elevator.  It does have a cool look when you look out\/down from up high, but it's also a bit creepy.  I started getting vertigo!  Anyone could throw something down or jump off, which I have heard has happened in the past.  Yikes!

The elevators were in terrible shape...missing buttons, scratched everywhere, generally dirty.  Once we got off the elevator, the hallways were scratched the entire way down the wall.  There looked to be damage on the ceilings...water or structural problems?  I felt like I was walking down the hall of a sketchy, cheap motel.  Once we got in the room, there was grossness (I don't want to know) on the phone, the chairs were scratched and splintered, a pillow was ripped, the bathroom door had water damage, etc.  I could go on and on.  Oh, and our curtain was broken, so I had to use 3 bobby pins to get it to stay shut and try to block out some light.

We did not end up gambling at the Luxor.  It feels so dark and the dealers we saw were rude.  Their uniforms were also not professional looking.  Luckily, Mandalay Bay and Excalibur are attached, so we spent our time\/money there.

The place needs some work!  It's a cool concept done terribly wrong.  We walked through the tower, and it looked like a completely different place.

I would rate it a 3 1\/2 for real but will do 4 to increase this low ranking.  Luxor is certainly one of the more affordable hotels and casinos on the strip.  I like the location of the hotel a lot.  It is close to the very, very  nice Mandalay Bay and the WAY WORSE Excalibur.  Btw, I would put Excalibur in my bottom 3 Vegas hotel \/ casinos. I found the pricing and value proposition of Luxor to be on par with Monte Carlo.  However, you can't say you have slept in a Pyramid every day can you!?  The restaurant and shopping options at the Luxor are solid.  The pool is pretty good too and is a very large size.  The rooms are fine.  I have had better and I have had WAY worse in Vegas.  You get what you pay for in LV and I was fine again with the value.  If you want to situate yourself on the lower strip this is a great location.

Guess I was expecting an Egyptian motif instead. Basic no frills room, could use a little update. I stayed in the tower and the only cool thing about that is due to the pyramid shape they actually use inclinators rather then elevators. I was told the difference is an elevator goes straight up and down while the inclinator goes at an angle. It's kinda cool since it's such a mild angle but still something you can definitely feel. Bottom line, at the end of the strip, nothing special. Disappointing if you're expecting the hotel theme to be carried thru from lobby to rooms.",2,0,2

Not anymore!

Whoever has been in charge of running this casino has apparently not wanted to put a dime into keeping it maintained, which is disappointing because it's the most unique casino on the Strip.

We booked the pyramid suite, and the room itself was decent, although there were water stains on the ceiling, apparently from the soaking tub above us overflowing at some point. The power of the air conditioning in the bedroom couldnt be adjusted because the knob had been torn off and never repaired, and in the living room, the temperature couldnt be adjusted.

The wifi was horrible and almost unusable. 

This place is so cheap, they couldn't even replace the piece of paper on the phone with the right room number, and instead just wrote a 1 over the 0. Who thought that was a good decision?

Seriously. I'm curious.

The elevators were pretty rickety, and sure enough one of them broke down while we were there.

But the biggest issue was the exact same one that was mentioned in another yelp review on OCTOBER 25th.

When we checked in at 3pm on Sunday, he saw a dining tray with empty bottles and old plates of food in the hallway right outside our door.

Eww, but whatever.

At 7pm, it was still there. So when we went to dinner, we spoke to a manager at the hotel registration desk and asked to have it removed. He said he'd get right on it.

The next day at 1pm, when it was still there, we spoke to another manager, who made a big show of writing our room number on a piece of paper (and then circled it, to show that it was super important) and started trying to argue with us about why it's there. He said it was from in-room dining, and that the customer hadn't called anyone to pick it up.

1. I don't care WHY it was there. Do the people responsible for the hotel not walk into the places they're responsible for at least once every few days? There's no excuse for it being there for more than 24 hours. None.

2. Trying to imply that our complaint wasn't valid, and the whole ""it's not my fault"" mindset was insulting, and immediately made me feel like I was talking to a child in a suit. Just get it the **** away from outside my room. Do managers here not have training in customer service? Step 1: Say ""yes, ma'am. I apologize for that disgusting tray being left there for so ridiculously long, and I'll handle it immediately."" Step 2: F*****g handle it immediately.

3. This man-child was so hilariously incompetent, when we came back to the hotel at 9pm, the tray was still there.

Finally my husband called housekeeping, and the woman who spoke with broken English fortunately had the competency the hotel manager lacked, and got it taken care of in a matter of a few minutes.

You'd think that a seething review mentioning this problem a week ago would be enough to let the hotel managent that this is a problem that needs to be looked at, but nope. Same exact thing, a week later. So Luxor staff apparently doesn't take reviews and complaints seriously. Which, in all honesty, was already apparent by two managers ignoring our complaint.

Oh, and the employee that kept hassling us, multiple times a day, about wanting to give us deals and discounts, only to tell us that no, we can't have any of that, once we told him, multiple times a day, that we're locals, was obnoxious and horribly unprofessional. And you'd think after the third time, he would've remembered us.

Oh and the chipped and faded tables in the Tender steakhouse were a great touch. When I pay $34 dollars for 5 scallops, I love eating them off of a table that should've been trashed years and years ago.

It's sad how far this casino has sunk. It looks like they haven't put a dime into it since it opened, and training their staff in customer service is obviously not a priority.",1,2,0

There were 3 guys in a 2 queen room with a rollaway. Our total for Wed-Sat 3 night stay was around $580 all in (after taxes and resort fees). So for under $200 a guy it was quite comfortable and less then we would have paid at other properties at the peak time of the NCAA tournament.

The Good:
-Nice bathroom that seemed relatively new
-Good maid service, who did a great job cleaning up a room with 3 guys in it
-In room safe was necessary to have and it worked well (fit my laptop)
-""Wired"" internet. For some with tablets they didn't have internet, but two of us had laptops with the plugin so it worked quite well. The ethernet cord can literally stretch across the room. It's probably 50 ft long. While a minus for some on reviews, I actually liked the internet being wired. Strong signal that worked well.
-Spa access for $15\/day was great. Nice smaller spa that had everything you wanted at it, including all the water\/juice\/fruit you could eat. That alone paid for itself (bottled water is $3 on property and its pretty small).
-Across Las Vegas Boulevard was a Chase ATM and very cheap beer at a gas station. That was nice to have when walking down the strip.

The Bad:
-Staying in the Tower the elevators were away from everything. It was confusing when first getting my room key as to how the hell to get to my room. While it was nice to be away from the casino floor (unlike the pyramid rooms), it just seemed a little far away.
-Friends that were staying mid-strip were either a 20 min walk away, or a $15 cab ride. The location is what it is, but if you plan on meeting others in the middle to north part of the strip then its simply not the place for you.
-The casino is outdated as everyone else mentions in their review. It's a catch 22 for MGM. Do they pour money into a place that was built during ""old vegas""? Or do they focus their efforts toward the middle-north part of the strip where the future is. The good news is Mandalay Bay next door is very nice and connected to the hotel, only about a 5 min walk away from the Luxor casino floor.

Overall I would recommend staying here if the price is right and you are comfortable being away from the action at the very south end of the strip.",1,0,0

Booked by Travelocity.

When we aproached the Luxor we where amazed at the sheer size of of the piramid. The hotel was nicely themed, and there was plenty of things to do inside the casino while we where there. Check in was painless and less than 5minutes, however when we approached the counter we discovered that the room with the king sized bed we asked for 1month ahead of time was no possible for us. Her only excuse was that it was the holiday weekend and rooms fill up quickly and that I booked through a 3rd party. This is unacceptable! I am a guest like any other guest and we where promised something by one of their representatives and was not delivered instead we received a pyramid room with two queens how romantic.

Despite the problem with the room our stay wasn't horrible, our room had a decent view sitting on either the spa or the adjacent room. In our pyramid spa room. Bathroom was great, shower was big. Room had 2 AC units 1 was somewhat broken but did not really make that much of a difrence. The casino was more or less the same as the others nothing really special. The cathouse club was really fun to dance in, themed like a brothel. The buffet in the Luxor wasn't all that great we visited a bunch of hotels and and ate at their buffets and there are better elsewhere.

We could not walk around the Luxor without being hounded by timeshare reps. These people really bring the atmosphere of the hotel down. If me and my girlfriend where living together and\/or where 25 them maybe we could have participated in their offers. They where just a nuisance to us.

The Luxor happens to be at the bottom of the strip near the Excalibur, MGM and NYNY right near the airport. We ended up getting the Deuce Bus pass more towards the end of our trip after having to walk up the strip so many times to see the Bellagio fountain show, the Gandola rides, the volcano show, visiting the flamingo to see their park inside the hotel, the circus circus to see the circus acts etc...

While visiting the other hotels we found out why they where priced much higher, they where bigger, nicer, and closer to everything we wanted to see there where not any girls girls girls guys ANYWHERE near the streets on those hotels and there where no timeshare that hounded us. Don't get me wrong 55dollars a night for a room with a spa being right on the strip is great and had they not screwed me over on the room I would have rated this place higher but this was just my experience. Next time we go we'll be staying at another hotel but it would not bother me to stay at this one again if we had no other alternative.",1,0,0

Room was an adequate size. We had a king bed tower room. Elevator was tucked away about a 1-2 minute walk from the front desk. 16th floor view was nice, except the windows were extremely dirty and could use a clean. The room was also in bad shape; there were tiles when you first walked in that were cracked and covered up with black duct tape. The shower walls were very dirty, I mean, like black dirt all up and down both the shower and the tub area. I don't know why the staff didn't clean something so obvious from the previous guest. It was gross. We also only had 2 pillows on a king bed. 

The purchase power amenities of the Luxor were numerous. I bought coffee from the numerous Starbucks every day. We sat and drank beer at the Public House one night and hung out with the nice bartender. My husband liked to sit in the small sports area and watch\/bet on games. Probably the most convenient was the access to the Mandalay Bay, which was where my conference was held. It was still a 10-15 minute walk from my hotel room to the conference, but at least it was inside in the AC.

All in all, you get what you pay for in the Luxor. It's a cheaper hotel on the strip. The rooms need to be upgraded. If you are not spending a lot of time on your room, or are not picky, this would be fine. If you are expecting grandor, don't pick the Luxor.",5,0,1

I used to be a hotel snob in Vegas(Palms, Bellagio and HR) but was forced to stay here due to a last minute trip. We got a great rate that was probably  40% cheaper than other hotels with similar ratings. Upon arrival you notice its pretty massive inside the pyramid. Check-in is usually a long line even late at night but fine. I've only stayed in the Tower Rooms(free upgrades after joining the Mlife rewards program). While not 5 star these rooms are well appointed and recently renovated. They were very comfortable and I've had great views each time. The English Pub and Tacos & Tequila restaurants have great happy hours and good food. There are at least three starbucks in this place and the convenience store is decently priced and even had a few novelty snacks from Shark Tank(cake balls,etc.) that we loved. There is a $5 black jack table that usually has a seat early in the morning. The casino is also a decent size and I frequently play there before going further down the trip. The pool is okay but could have more chairs and nicer people working at the bar.Overall this place is great since it's only a place to sleep. I've gotten comped room offers several times over the years so it's a great value when you consider that aspect. I can gamble or eat\/drink\/shop at all Mlife properties and that generates new comps.

I was the only person in line and David, an older looking gentleman, lets  a random guy cut in front of me.  I told him that I was in line and he raised his voice at me and dismissed my concern.

My hotel reservation was suppose to come with $30 food credit, but it didn't show up when I checked in.  After I showed them my confirmation email I thought that would be squared away, but when I went to check out, I noticed the food charges made to my room were not taken care of.  So be careful about your bill because they may overcharge you.  I eventually got it squared away but it was quite a hassle.

We walked through several hotels and this must be the smokiest one.  This may be a pro or a con depending on whether you smoke.  We asked for a non smoking floor, and they said all their floors are nonsmoking, but there was definitely smoke on my floor.

It's located towards the end of the strip, so night life was difficult unless you're a super walker or a luxurious taxi rider.

One thing I must say is that the Evening Call (Fat Tuesdays wannabee) drinks spot is so damn delicious.

But let's get back to this review on the hotel!

My friends and I ended up with a suite, and it was just alright. There was a lot of weird spaces in the room, which made the room awkward. But then again, once you're drunk, I'm sure you can take advantage of that space with someone special ;). What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas right? ;) On another note, there was a HUGE dead moth located near the windows of our suite, EW. But it wasn't like we would die with it....

If you're big on security, this place is for you because in order to get up to your hotel, you need the card to your room EVERY SINGLE time you're on the elevator. So, it could be annoying-- but safety is always first. But for me, I wasn't bringing a million dollars to gamble, so I really had nothing to lose.


Overall, this place was alright. It didn't meet my expectations, but then again, I have high expectations. As for proximity to the strip, I thought it was a bit far-- especially since we had to walk through a million bridges to get to our destination. Coming back? Eh, probably not.",4,3,4

Got comped for a stay here and it's the best thing ever.  Thank you to a great benefactor. Unfortunately, I didn't really have the chance to check out any of the shows or other offerings like shopping, different food establishments, the pool and such. I'll tell you this much though, the rooms are super nice. The beds were really comfortable, I literally knocked out as soon as my head touched the pillow.
 
I was told that my reservation came with 2 free buffet tickets but I did not get them on check in. No problem, we were up early and mostly out of the hotel anyways to try and make it to the buffet time slots. 

Resort fee is $30 per day plus resort fee tax (?!) $4.01. First 24 hours of parking is free then $10 for overnight parking, per day. 

I'd like to come back and check out Criss Angel Mindfreak and have the chance to really walk around the hotel and check out all they have to offer.",20,14,18

Like Jisoo's complaint about paid parking, it was HORRIBLE.  Paid for parking, but no parking was available.  Had to park at Mandalay Bay which was modern and had the parking spot indicator.  Those of you who drove in Singapore will be familiar with this method or letting people find parking quickly.  There are parking spot indicators above each spot.  Green for available, red for taken.  Signs indicated number of open spots in each lane.  Luxor did not have this.  NYNY had this.  Bellagio's parking was half-implemented.  Valet parking was occasionally roped off as closed so never tried that.  Parking entry and exit was slowed by this paid parking requirement.  With a limited number of exit lanes, and people forgetting to pay for tickets before trying to exit, blockages occurred.  Luxor, facility-wise, elevator had an open control panel and anyone could fiddle with the insides.  It is unlikely we will return to Luxor.

The room rates are among the lowest on the Strip, and the property seems to be trying to cater to a younger demographic with their nightclub.  This might all be fine for a certain Vegas visitor.  For an inveterate gambler and tourist like myself, however, there are better options for just a little more money.

Do what you can to book the Tower room, as I did when I stayed there.  The rooms are newer and nicer than the Pyramid rooms, though you won't get to ride the diagonal elevators (called ""inclinators,"" which actually seem kind of cool).  You also won't worry about some of the problems others have complained about.

The parking lot is difficult to find and FAAAAR away from the front desk.  I didn't learn that valet parking was free until *after* I left, even though I asked if there was a closer lot when I checked in.  You would think that customer service would have thought to mention that, but no. 

You will be assaulted by salespersons the moment you step onto casino carpeting, and you just have to sneak around them, apologizing as you go.  They know you're dragging luggage with you, though, so you're going to run into them sooner or later.

The room was nice, but very dark.  With all the lights on, it was still dim in the room.  Fiancee complained about the bed and pillows being awful, but I can generally sleep on anything.  They didn't have a king-size available, and we had to settle for two queens.

Luxor sits on the extreme south end of the Strip, and it's difficult to get around without a car or monorail.  I also swear they have two Starbucks on the floor, and they're 10 feet from each other.

Conclusion: For the price, you get a fair amount.  The room will be nicer than the similarly-priced Imperial Palace.  The location is far worse, though, so you need to ask yourself why you came to Vegas.  If you want to walk from casino to casino, try another property.

EDIT: The poker room staff is incredible, and when you can get a game going, the comps are very generous.  I was given a free Starbucks as a preferred player after just 5 hours, since I was pivotal in starting the 2\/4 game.  5 stars for the poker room.

I remember going to this place when I was in college, and it was so cool, because, hey, a pyramid!  However, other than a decent club, I watched the place slowly slip into a place that wasn't really noteworthy for the things Las Vegas was known for.  Food, clubbing, casino, shows.  They've picked up the shows from other places second hand (not bad shows, just been around for a while), and I think their nightclub is still solid, but this was the first time I stayed there.

It was for a conference, so my main focus was getting to and from the Mandalay Bay Convention Center. But the rooms surprised me. It's now a non-smoking hotel. The casino is still exceptionally smoky, but the towers were pretty smoke free. I know one night I had sheets that has someone cheat and smoke in that room, but the bed was comfortable, the shower was good, and they had decent tv channels.  It was easy to get around, no wait for taxis, and the staff at the front desk was actually charming.  The bell service was good, and hey, if I'm looking for location without the cost, I'd consider it again.

I also love that it does connect to both Mandalay Bay and Excalibur.  The small mall between it and Mandalay has my favorite burger in it, so that was a plus.

Cons... their casino is sad... not very large, and not a lot of people in it.  The shows are not my thing. I saw Blue Man Group in the 90s, and I think I'm good on that one. I might see the Jabbawockeez, because I've heard it's fun, but the area for all of that just felt claustrophobic somehow. There was only room service between 6am and 2pm.  Seriously?

Stuck between Excalibur, the hotel I stayed at, and Mandalay Bay, the hotel hosting the conference I was at, Luxor was a good location for me to pass through on my way to someplace else.  The same way most people think of my home state, New Jersey.

Luxor is gorgeous outside.  The giant pyramid, outlined in lights and sending a beam into the sky at night, with a obelisk and a sphinx standing guard.  Inside, it's impressive as well, certainly more so than Excalibur, where I stayed, but I was sad to see the Egyptian theme fall to the background behind the omnipresent glitz and sheen of Vegas.

Nice, for what it is, but I prefer the thematic consistency of NY-NY and Paris.

For whatever reason, I also found Luxor to be the most oppressive, cigarette smoke-wise.  I hated how smoking was allowed in all the casinos in Vegas anyway, but most seemed to have better ventilation or less smoking.  I still wish there were designated no-smoking gambling areas.

To be fair, I was starting to get sick the night the smoke bothered me the most, but still, even after that point I didn't find the other casinos as bad as Luxor.

I saw Bodies... The Exposition at Luxor and found it much more interesting and... enjoyable? (odd adjective to choose here) than I expected.  Humans have a surprisingly small spleen.

Ate at Tender Steak and Seafood, and I'll review that elsewhere.

I booked this hotel because my husband usually stays at Hooters but I wasn't going to take my 3 year old and mother to stay there. The price was great and I know that I had heard of the hotel, and I didn't shudder with any of the descriptions I had heard so I thought we would give it a go! A few days before we left I came on good ole Yelp to see what everyone thought of Luxor and was immediately terrified!

    I was dreading staying there after reading all the awful reviews and when we got there I was more than happy with the hotel. It was the 3-11 concert weekend and spring break so there were more than the usual amount of drunk college kids running around, but the hotel staff was still so great. Everyone we dealt with not only met our expectations but surpassed them!

    We decided to stay an extra night and the girl at the desk went into her computer to give us a discount we wouldn't have normally gotten. She also went out of her way and ran back and forth between us and the concierge to help us figure out a show we could take our daughter to see, even though she could have very easily told us ""thats not my job, go talk to the concierge"". The housekeeping staff was great also. My husband was working in the room and told them we didn't need a cleaning (silly man, 2 clean towels will not dry 4 showered people). We called down to the desk and had fresh towels in less than 5 minutes. The hotel was clean, they weren't down comforters or memory foam matresses, but they were clean and in good shape.

    I don't know why these people had such bad experiences but we would stay here again in a second. I should also say the other 3 times I have been to Vegas I stayed twice at the Venetian and once at the Palazzo and for about $120 less you really can't beat the Luxor. You won't get the decadence or glamour of those hotels but what do you expect for less than $100 a night?!

First call to the front desk resulted in the woman laughing.   She KNEW it was a fucked up room   

Three phone calls later we forced them to move us to the tower for the remainder of our stay.. Afrt the guest services lady mused ""i wonder if they forgot that room""   Only an offer of the garbage buffet as a comp for the shitty room and horrible customer service.   We said no thanks to that- but were offered nothing else like a refund, or tickets to something in house or on another MGM property.   

This place is completely disgusting   You want to stay anywhere else in LV.  Just make sure its not an MGM resort-  obviously they are only interested in pushing garbage to maximize profit


Update: ...  So in reading Lori's ""comment"" it makes it seem that Guest relations is just now finding out about this here on Yelp, and really appreciate the feedback...   No,  We were talking with Guest relations after being laughed at by the one front desk rep.   It was your department that did move us to the tower room-   but when were rebuffed by the offer of the repugnant buffet (see Wendy's review on ""more"" for ""more"" details) she had nothing else to do.   In a town which runs on keeping people happy by offering ""comped"" everything,  your department had nothing to offer.   It was a garbage room that hadn't been updated,  and some of the worst customer service I've experienced in Las Vegas.   Perhaps I need to remedy the situation through my credit card company?",3,4,0

They look like they tried doing the Egyptian thing but couldn't afford it so they stuck with style Motel 6 instead.  Also wish the windows would open. Real air ventilation was in deep need. Well at least the place is clean. 

The damn hotel is super far from everything. Meaning either you break your legs trying to get somewhere or pay a hefty price for a taxi be anywhere other then your hotel. The casino is okay....reminds me of Reno. Only ate here once and that was for brunch.

They do have a burger place that's open 24\/7 which is good for when your heading to your room after a long night an want to grab a bite to eat before heading in for the night.

We (my fiance, my 16mon old daughter, & I) stayed from Dec. 2nd-6th 2012 (Yes, it took me THIS long to review it. So sue me).   

PROS: 
-Free parking
-Upper level parking has entrance right into the casino. 
-Fast check-in (especially for a Friday)
-Starbucks at practically every corner 
-Buffet was decent (different review)
-Decent room (good enough to sleep in)
-Monorail between Mandalay and Excalibur

CONS:
-Those DAMN timeshare people
-Just 2 elevators! (Luckily our room was near one)
-Layout of the casino is kinda scattered for my taste
-FAR end of the strip (then again that can be a Pro for some people)
-Getting a drink took almost an hr, according to the mister (then again, they WANT you to spend more on gambling)

Well we waited 25 mins and went back to check in again for the second time. All she said was NOPE still not ready and smiled. I went and sat down again waited another 20 mins and then decided I was going to call the front desk from my cell phone when I spoke with a  Gentlemen he told me my room was ready and to go back to mobile check in and give them my room number he gave me. As I approached the mobile check in for the 3rd time I was greeted my a man that said oh I'm sorry your room is not ready I explained that I called and spoke to Tony at the front Desk via my cell and he said oh I'm sorry I cannot make you your room key right here. WTH. This has now been almost 1.5 of drama, as I am getting more upset by the minute, He says oh wait one minute, wow comes back with 2 room keys and that is it. Hands them too me and says ok well here you go. As I am standing there wondering if he was going to direct me too my room he is just standing there. I asked him, could you please let me know where my room is? He says yes I can, go to Starbucks make a left and follow all the way down to elevator.
YEAH
not that easy for your info there are 4 points of the pyramid and different Incline elevators in the hotel. It took 6 different employees from Bar staff, to waitress, to a bell hop too get us too our room no one knew where 1836 was. Seriously. By then I'm past furious with 5 suit cases in tow.
When I get up too my room, the room looks like someone just had sex in the bed. Bed sheets on the ground and shampoo in shower. So gross I called and spoke to a manager and they gave me another room . After 3 hours of checking in and trying to find my room drama. We decided to go down too the pool. Ummmm Gross. the Pool had foam in the corners on the pool that looked like sun block foam and the Jacuzzi was luke warm and actually had bottle caps at the bottom of the pool. We left there and went to the buffet. Paid 86.45 for four people to eat at the buffet and the food was cold and I have honestly had better food at a hospital. for 86.00 bucks I better have more than a good salad bar. Over all the stay here was not something I would recommend too anyone. 
YOU KNOW THAT SAYING YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. WORTH SPENDING AN EXTRA 100.00 FOR QUALITY SERVICE AND A NICE CLEAN ENVIORNMENT.

Then comes check in day on May 22, 2015. I arrive at the hotel, and the concierge is rude. She stated the wrong room, and I asked her what room was given to me. She ensured that there would be three beds and not to worry. Finally get into the two rooms. What a surprise only two beds are there. The entire room also reeks of cigarettes. I immediately call a representative, and she apologizes and says that there is nothing she can do if the rooms aren't available. She even has the nerve to claim that I made the mistake when I booked the hotel. I assured her that I made the reservations over the phone. After arguing for at least thirty minutes she finds a smaller connected suite. We have bell boys sent to our room to move our luggage.

This was a return trip to Vegas after going in February 2011.  That trip was great and we were sad to leave.  We were looking for the same kind of trip this time around, but cheaper, so we stayed at Luxor (last time we stayed at Paris).  Unfortunately, everything about our stay was awful and we were actually relieved to return home! I will try to break down the awfulness that is Luxor:

Rooms: Our room was in dire need of updating.  The television set was old school and the air conditioner reminded me of Motel 6.  I don't so much care about modernization, though; the worst part by far was the bathroom.  Our shower had tons of soap scum, as well as dust.  The door was peeling and cracking along the bottom.  When I opened my washcloth the first night, it was to find a long black hair inside. I am blonde.  It was so gross that I found myself regretting that I didn't bring shower shoes.  The towels smelled burnt- not sure if they were old or if they had been previously used in smoking rooms, but even my 7 year-old commented on the towels being ""stinky.""  

Food: I can't say enough about how bad the food was and I think this was probably the worst part of our whole weekend since we get very excited about eating.  The More Buffet was quite simply the worst I've ever been to.  It should be hard to screw up breakfast, but they managed.  The eggs were runny and had the oddest taste.  The scones could double as weapons, they were so hard.  The only item my son ended up being able to eat was a bowl of cereal each day.  Being economical during this trip was really important, so we needed to take advantage of our two free buffets per day.  In our defense, we tried the other places, but they were equally bad.  We ate at Rice and Company and had the  most bland teriyaki chicken ever.  We ate dessert at the Pyramid Cafe and it was just... gross.  

Customer Service: The first incident took place at check-in, when we were handed our room key and directed to elevator 2, which ended up being the wrong elevator for our room, and which resulted in quite a hike across the hotel.  We had to find out on our own that elevators 4 were the ones we needed.  We also experienced poor customer service at the More Buffet, Rice and Company, and Pyramid Cafe.  The servers at the buffet just seem very brusque and were not friendly... (maybe I am just so upset over the gross food that I interpreted it that way).  The hostesses at Rice and Company were snooty and acted like they were annoyed with us.  Our server at the Pyramid Cafe was certainly a character, but I just don't like it when the server becomes a big part of your dining experience.  I think they should be unobtrusive.  

Besides all of these cons, you know those salespeople that you find at every hotel and casino that try to offer you tickets when you walk by their kiosks? Well, they are staggered throughout the floor of the Luxor, so there's no way to avoid them, and they were by far the most aggressive and rude ones I have ever encountered! One in particular was very demanding that we follow him to get free tickets and acted offended and angry when we told him no- several times.  We were literally accosted at least three times on the way to eat breakfast every day. 

I read below that this is a good place to go if you are in your 20's and perhaps that's true.  There were a lot of drunk jerks running around over the weekend.  At nighttime, when we went to the buffet, I had to tell my son to close his eyes because there was always a girl pole dancing right in front of the escalator! Just not really a family atmosphere.   

All in all, we decided that we would never stay here again, even if it was free, even if it was a free suite! We chose not to complain to management because a) we were afraid of what management would be like after all these other experiences, and b) there was really nothing that could ever entice us to return to this place, so why bother? Oh, I forgot to mention that there was also a hidden $50 ""resort fee"" upon check-in (we had paid our entire fare through Expedia beforehand), which might not have been so irritating if there was anything resort-like about the place.

Bottom line: If you are looking for a place to sleep and that's it, this would be fine.  If you care about comfort, class, environment, etc., stay away!",4,1,2

This was a last minute trip to Vegas so we didn't have much of a choice in terms of choosing hotels. Luxor is on the way south of the strip so I would be apprehensive if you don't like to the ride the bus or take cabs or walk. It is connected via free mono rail to Mandalay Bay (yay!) and Excalibur  (uggh!) We stayed in the pyramid side of the hotel and not the tower which are supposed to be better.  Finding which elevator to take is hard as there some rooms apparently even on the ground floor!! The place is open and gives and airy feel. Now for the rooms due to the shape they are huge and I mean some of the bigger rooms I have seen on the hotels on the strip. Style is showing its age but I guess they go with the theme of this place.

 It's not really a casino that excels at capturing any specific section of my attention -- the rooms I've been in are very much ""Okay"" but aside from a couple papyrus heiroglyphs on the dresser I could be anywhere else on a budget.  The gambling action is far from the walk-in off the Mandalay catwalk and I never really saw any specials that grabbed me.  If you want cheap gambling, you go to the Excalibur.

It was only 12pm when we checked in but our room was ready. The process went smoothly and in no time we were headed to our room on the 12th floor.

What you pay for when you stay here is the name, plain and simple.  We got a decent deal, but after staying here, we still felt like we spent too much. The rooms are crap, the beds are crap, the bathrooms are tiny.  We chose to stay in the pyramid for the experience, and because we had heard about the ""inclinators"".  

In retrospect, that was a really stupid reason to get a room there.  The stupid inclinators made me sick half the time, and their locations were very far apart from each other.  There are two banks of inclinators on every floor, and in the pyramid, the set-up of the rooms is a big square.  There are inclinators in two corners of this square on each floor.  We got put in the farthest possible room from the stupid inclinators, and since we did a lot of walking in Vegas, this was BAD.  A major pain in the ass.

The location of Luxor sucks too, because it's at the end of the strip..

The first time I stayed at the Luxor, I believe I was in my early twenties. (I'm now 31.) It had just opened, and seemed exciting, dramatic, luxurious, and exclusive. 

The second time I stayed there, five years ago, it still seemed like an upscale resort. I remember that the pool area seemed elegant, refined, quiet. I spent $20 to luxuriate in the Luxor's spa - a $20 well spent. I remember that the room seemed clean and very nice.

Fast forward to this past weekend. Oh, lordy, how times have changed. 

The Luxor has become a stench-filled, Starbucks-shilling, depressing, run-down, depressing casino. What once seemed cool and cutting-edge - you walk into the casino and it's like you're really in an egyptian tomb - now feels claustrophobia-inducing. There is a Starbucks around every corner, which far from increasing Luxor's coolness quotient, makes it seem obnoxiously commercial.

So, upon our arrival, we were greeted by the sight of hundreds upon hundreds of people, snaking around roped lines to register for a room. Here's a strange thought: Possibly hire more staff to cover a busy summer Saturday morning? 

The nice lady at the front desk offered us an upgrade to a tower room for ""only $30 more."" We promptly asked her to comp us, as it had just been my friend's birthday. Astonishingly, she agreed. Points there. 

However, we asked for two things: A non-smoking room, and a rollaway bed. Neither request was fulfilled.

We walked into our room, and were immediately assailed by a wall of stale cigarette smoke so intense that the smell lingered even after we retreated back to the hallway, closing the door. When we went downstairs to switch rooms, the new registration lady told us that it was a non-smoking floor. Uh, yikes. 

Happily, we were able to switch rooms. But the room we got was pretty disappointing. To summarize:
- Not enough lights. It was so dark we could barely see what we were doing.
- No table\/chairs, just two (hard, uncomfortable) beds covered in dated, cheap bedspreads. 
- No touted ""Las Vegas guide"" anywhere to be found.
- No minibar.
- Bathroom's tub and shower were nice, but the magnifying mirror was practically falling off the wall and had not been repaired. 

Oh, and the rollaway bed? After twice asking the reservations desk people, and calling much later that day from the room, IT WAS NEVER DELIVERED. That's right, three separate requests did not prompt the staff to roll a bed into our room.

So, what else sucks: I have allergies and am sensitive to cigarette smoke. I can honestly say that I have never been so uncomfortable - runny nose, sneezing, scratchy throat - then when simply walking through the Luxor's massive casino level (the main floor). Having walked through numerous other casinos on this trip, only the Luxor produced that kind of reaction in me. There was an uncomfortable cloud of stale, acrid air in the casino, pure and simple.

And the pool area? What had once seemed refined and luxurious now seemed crass and like spring break central. There were thousands of screaming kids, buckets of beer bottles everywhere, no umbrellas ANYWHERE (and it was a hundred degrees), and the only refined, luxurious part was the ""VIP area"" where you had to pay extra for nice, plush chaise lounges and umbrellas.

The message: We treat our typical guests like overcrowded cattle. We are desperately trying to regain our faded glory by creating some faux exclusivity, so that only high-rolling guests get comfortable lounge chairs and shade. The rest can fry in the sun for all we care. 

And LAX night club? I've had enough faux exclusivity for a lifetime. They practically beg you to come to the nightclub by handing out ""VIP passes"" all over the hotel. Then, when you go to enter the club, they take forever to process the standing crowds, like there's any chance they won't let people in. Once you enter - deja vu time - there's literally nowhere to sit in the entire club for the normal folks. Only if you reserve in advance and pay extra do you get your own little lounge area. They'll taze you with a cattle prod if you dare even to glance longingly at one of the velvet ropes surrounding one of these choice nooks. (Well, not really, but you get my point.)

And the food? ""Fusia,"" the oh-so-creatively named Asian fusion restaurant, was okay. ""Pharoah's Pheast"" is now called ""More: The Buffet at Luxor"" - not an improvement. I guess Luxor's new owners are trying to move away from the overt Egypt-ness of it all. 

Having visited all the higher end hotel\/casinos at the end of my trip, and having charmed my way into the leagues-above Wynn pool area as a non-guest, I can honestly say that I will never stay at the Luxor again. It's worth the extra cash to stay at a nicer hotel that doesn't induce periodic sneezing fits, claustrophobia, and asthma attacks. 

Oh, and stay away from the inclinators. They make you want to throw up.",0,0,0

The Luxor is an OK place to stay. I stayed here when it was my first time in Vegas. We stayed in the Pyramid. The elevators do go at an angle, which was a different feeling than I've experienced. 

The hotel is HUGE! Most of the hotels on the strip are grand and large. Inside is beautiful, with water fountains, a Titanic artifact exhibit (the real stuff) and an exhibit of Bodies (real dead bodies). Carrot Top and Criss Angel have shows here, too. 

The Luxor is in the middle of Mandalay Bay and Excalibur Hotels. There is a tram that goes to all three, and walkways with airport style horizontal escalators to help you walk. 

The rooms are average. Hard to look out of the angled windows.

Is it comparable to Venetian or Bellagio? Not by any means. But if you're looking for an affordable hotel or you're going on a serious college budget, then I highly recommend staying at the Luxor hotel. 

CHECK-IN\/REGISTRATION
Checking in is never a long line but if you do check in around 10pm it does tend to get a bit busy. I've never personally waited more than 10 minutes in line because there are always plenty of receptionists checking guests in, so it's very efficient. Once you do check in, the receptionist will ask for your ID, credit card, and an MLife card if you're a member. 

The receptionists here are so incredibly friendly and I can't remember a time where I DIDNT get a complimentary upgrade! Whether it's simply asking for a room closer to the elevator or switching my 2 queen beds to 1 king bed, Luxor receptionists go above and beyond and get me complimentary upgrades simply because it's available. Now if that isn't enough to get you to stay here, then I don't know what will!

ROOM\/AMENITIES
Come in with low expectations. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it's an inexpensive hotel with respective room amenities. The rooms are fairly small and if you're staying in pyramid rooms then chances are your room will have a slanted wall with a window (it's a pyramid, I'm sure that makes sense). The tower rooms are great and a little bit larger but not by much! The tower rooms are also a bit of a walk too so I highly recommend just staying in a pyramid room. Their amenities are your basic shampoo, body wash, lotion, and soap. They do have two types of body soaps though: one bar soap and one pyramid-shaped bar soap... super cute!

DINING
I've only frequented the food court because they do have a McDonald's here, but what I really like about Luxor is that they connect to the shoppes at Mandalay Bay where they conveniently have a Fat Tuesday! So if you're looking for other dining opportunities you get a double whammy: the restaurants in Luxor AND the restaurants and shops at Mandalay Bay. Can't argue with that!

PRICING
Rooms are incredibly cheap at almost any given night here. I used to go to vegas for 2 nights until I found out how ridiculously cheap their Sunday-Thursday nights were (I'm talking $20-50 a night) so I just always extend my stay. The resort fee is $28 compared to other MGM resorts that charge $32.98 so when I mean this resort is cheap I mean it is REALLY cheap! 

Overall, I have never had a complaint about this hotel. It is an inexpensive hotel with respective amenities but it is certainly the best and cheapest option you can get while staying ON the strip and in an MGM resort as well.",3,0,1

The Luxor is one of the better budge t hotels on the strip.  The room was spacious and clean.  I know it sounds weird but the Luxor smelled great!  The lobby, the casino the room all had the same smell and I loved it.  This hotel is pretty tame compared to some of the others.  I greatly enjoyed the Chill atmosphere.  You can walk to Mandalay Bay and Excalabor without leaving the building which is nice.  They offer dining options for everyones needs (nice, upscale dining and food court style dining).  The staff could not have been nicer!  Everyone was so very helpful.  They even offered airport check in at the hotel.   I was able to check my bags at the hotel and not see them again until I arrived back in Phoenix.

It's not the Aria, Wynn or Cosmo but for the price point and give the fact that the Luxor is one of the older hotels on the strip.  .it is A+

I recommend staying the East Tower.  It's quieter than the pyramid, and a little newer.",5,1,3

Upon entering, I noticed a scent that is pumped in to the air. I'm not sure what it was but I figured they did that to counteract the smell of cigarettes smoke that 100% of Las Vegas Casinos have. In my opinion, I didn't like that scent, whatever it was. (Upon entering the Mirage, it smelled like coconuts. That I did like. But I'm digress.) I haven't been to Vegas in a couple of years but realized that this casino seems to attract the younger crowd. It didn't bother me but when you are constantly running into scantily clad college girls and beer laced jocks, it can be overwhelming. The casino appeared to be clean.

For example the elevator to get to our room was in need of service as the doors would repeatedly open and close prior to actually moving to take you to your intended floor. Plus the lobby area to the 2nd floor smelled like diapers and the walls looked old and dingy.

The room served its purpose since we were only sleeping and bathing there so for bare essentials it was ok. The bathroom needed a little work as the sliding door to the shower did not slide easily and the towel rack connected to the door was broken.

I tried calling them to let them know it was our anniversary, and I would like to have some champage\/flowers in my room upon our arrival, and I gladly would've paid extra.   Person on the phone said they can't do this because they don't know what room you will be in till you check in.   I begged and pleaded to the person if they could make this possible, they said no.   Now I understand that she may not have been able to do this, but she could've at least offered a spa credit, casino credit, or a credit to one of their crappy shows since it was our anniversary.  Other hotels routinely offer you some discount tix to a show if you are staying at the hotel.  

 One thing that sucked is we had to drive around the hotel four times before we finally found the self-parking.   Then once we actually found it, we had to drive around for another 30 mins before a parking spot finally opened up.  Just imagine how thrilled we were to see the LONG ass line for check-in when we finally found it.    We stood in line almost an hour to check-in.   No additional welcome offers once we checked in either.   We stayed in the Pyramid Spa suite, which was a great room that has its own spa tub and a separate shower.   We did use the Nuture Spa, and I'll be writing my review of that later.

One annoying thing is that everyday we would have a voicemail on our phone, and it would just be a stupid advertisement for the show ""Menopause"" that is held there at the Luxor.  Are they really that desperate that they have to leave you a voicemail message?  The show must really suck.  I wouldn't mind staying here again, but I think there are plenty of other hotels where they can at least offer you some comps for staying there.

***On a side note, my wife and I kept wondering...why are there so many annoying ass kids staying at this hotel?     There are no shows at the hotel that can kids can see.  Why not stay at the Circus Circus or something like that where your kids can at least have some fun.  Better yet, why even take your kids to Vegas in the first damn place.   You can't go to any of the adult shows cuz you are stuck dragging their asses around everywhere, and your kids don't wanna do any of the crap you wanna do anyway.

When we finally arrived to the room. I double checked the cleanliness of the room as others on Yelp recommended. Oh my god the sheets had stains on them as others have taken photos of. Luxor's website stated that they recently renovated this tower, cheah right fools. They did not do anything.

Understandably this is Vegas and people get a little crazy but damn. Every single night people would run the halls screaming and knocking on their friends' doors for some dranks. The hotel took no action whatsoever.

The pyramid shape is grand in itself and once you step inside, the colors of gold are splashed everywhere plus you'll see a couple familiar egyptian statues, sculptures around the area. It definitely brings out the ""adult playground promise"" of Las Vegas 

After a 10 year hiatus from this place, I still found the hotel to be an ""ok"" weekend stay if you go with a large group (ie. Birthdays, bachelorette\/bachelor parties and family short weekend getaways). Not the quaint, romantic hotel rooms for couples.

However, it's not so convenient with shops & restaurants compared to the newer hotels like Wynn or Venetian but it does have a cool swimming pool where lounge chairs are often available and the nightclubs, LAX & Cathouse are the other popular places for nightlife

Parking is free and only mildly inconvenient.  I didn't have too much luggage so the walk through the casino to the front desk (about a ten minute walk) wasn't too bad.  If you're with a family, lugging bags latched onto bags with tots in tow, then that's a different story.

If you don't feel like staying in the Bellagio or the Venetian, then a place like this is the next rung down.

It's located right in the middle of all that's worth seeing in the strip (NY NY, Mandalay Bay).

The main buffet is okay.  I don't particular favor buffets to begin with but for convenient eating (meaning you just need sustenance), it provides what you need.  But there are plenty of other better buffets in the adjacent hotels\/casinos.  Stick to the restaurants though.

The pool is crowded and chaotic--and not in the sexy way you see on TV commercials.  Lots of families and kids cannonballing into the pool so if you aim to recline and look calm and cool like Don Draper, try the Venetian.  The Luxor is where you lift up your sunglasses to give a sidelong glance at the overwhelmed father telling his six kids to stop running.

But if you just need a decent, affordable room that is centrally located in the strip, if you just need a place to sleep for the few hours you'll probably devote to sleep because you'll be out and about and grubbing and clubbing in the bright bright bright lights of Vegas, then the Luxor won't fail you here.",4,3,3

Positives:
This hotel is probably one or the most affordable hotels on the main strip.  The rooms and suites are decent size. I still think it's pretty cool it is shaped like a pyramid, even if it is a bit outdated. The casino tables here are a bit cheaper then the other casinos. So you can find 10$ and 15$ black jack tables! The oasis pool is actually the biggest pool from any of the hotels and they always have a decent DJ by the pool side.

Negatives:
Steer clear from the buffet and any of the eating places here, they all pretty much suck. If you are looking for two queen beds it's based on availability and they get taken quickly. I and one of my boys did not know that and got stuck with a king and a roll up bed. Another thing is it is very difficult to get sleep in this hotel, not sure what it is but maybe since they pump oxygen in the room.

Another thing to remember is you are south of the strip, but you are only a 10 - 15$ ride to practically anywhere on the strip.",2,0,0

The primary reason for our visit to Las Vegas was to see Duran Duran in concert.  My son and I are big fans and I thought it would be a nice surprise to take him and the wife to Vegas to see them in concert.  In addition to seeing Duran Duran, we also saw the Blue Man Group at the Luxor as well as the Michael Jackson One show at the Mandalay Bay (same place where we saw Duran Duran at.).  I had originally looked at booking at Madalay Bay as two of the three shows we were seeing were there but in the end chose the Luxor as a cheaper choice.  Looking back at it now, perhaps saving the $150 in total, may not have been the best choice.

As many reviews here have stated, the Luxor is what it is.  An okay hotel on the strip that is reasonably priced.  Also as many have stated, you now pay either $10 per day for self parking or $13 a day for valet parking.  We chose the valet parking and it was billed directly to our room bill.

Yes, the hotel is rather dated but the people working there were quite friendly.  We arrived to check in at 3 PM and the wait time was about thirty minutes.  It seemed like they had about 12 check in stations open and the line seemed to be moving quickly.  I did notice during our three night stay that check in was totally dead pretty much anytime after 6 PM on each of the nights we were there.

We stayed in the pyramid room.  I was going to pay a small fee to upgrade to the tower rooms but I had read on the reviews that they were located a bit farther away from the action so we decided to stay in the pyramid.  Yes, the rooms are really dated but they were very clean and for the little time we would be staying in them, it was oaky.  The one thing I did notice, as pointed out in the many yelp reviews, was the air conditioning was not really cold in the pyramid rooms.  I prefer to have my rooms ice cold and this was not the case at the Luxor.  I would not say the rooms were hot but would guess they were in the 75 degree range.  I noticed that if you sat at the table near the AC unit, you could feel the cool air but not so much if sitting or laying on the beds.

All in all, the stay at the Luxor was okay and in all honesty, I can't see a return visit.  I generally like staying at NYNY and think that would be my choice for the next Vegas trip.

We never got a chance to visit the buffet as I had a free coupon from playing My Vegas, but from reading the reviews I may not have missed much.  The shows we saw were all really great.  If you are staying at the Luxor you should see the Blue Man Group as it was a really fun show.  Cant believe we never saw this show over the last 10 plus years!  Also, the Michael Jackson show at the Mandalay Bay was outstanding!  We had seats in the nose bleed section and we were running late and arrived at the show about 5 minutes prior to start time and the usher asked if we wanted to sit closer to the stage.....UMMM, Yes!!!   Dead center stage around 15 rows deep.  Outstanding!  I slipped him 10 bucks and he seemed quite happy!",3,1,2

I was worried some of stains in the shower would start talking to me or move. 
My husband and I got ""VIP seating"" next to the pool (whatever that means). The waitress service was excellent but we agreed the next time we pay for upgraded seating next to the pool we are doing it at Mandalay Bay.

I chose the Luxor b\/c the room photos looked nice on their website...of course. When I got into my room, the first thing I noticed was that the bed sagged. The bedding looked like it had been on the bed since the 90s. The furniture was very worn (I didn't sit on it). The lighting was awful...too dark (like vampires were staying there). 

And then the bathroom...MOLD all over the ceiling and shower wall. Rust on the bathroom door. My room smelled like smoke, I couldn't sleep in the bed, my neck hurted...kept waking up. I wanted to relax on my vacation, but unfortunately my room was not an inviting space. I will never stay at the Luxor again. 

The casino area is nice (of course), but as soon as you step into the elevator to go up to the rooms...that's how they get you. There should not be cracks in the walls...The Luxor is a rundown DUMP!!!

They have definitely did some remodeling and upgrades since the last time I stayed here and it looks a bit different than before all for the better especially the lobby.

The check-in was a quick process with not much of a line and the gal who checked us in was nice and even gave us an upgrade to a tower room. The checkout process was even quicker with an advanced iPad system in the lobby done all by yourself without having to wait in the long checkout line.

The room was spacious and was kept clean. It isn't as fancy as the Wynn or Bellagio, but for what we paid for it, it was worth it. It even came with a decent view of a small section of the pool. The room was very quiet and I never heard any of neighbors from either side.

We spent a few hours at the pool and it wasn't too busy since it was very hot mostly the whole day we were there with temps in the 100's. Good size pool for wading in, but too small to swim in.

The have a newly remodeled food court area with nice looking store fronts plus new choices from the last time I was there.

The real downside is that they don't have Wi-Fi in the rooms, but only in the common areas like the food court, lobby or pool. They also have a time limit of 48 hours for you to log-in if you stay at the hotel. Not good if you stay longer. Otherwise great hotel to stay in and wouldn't mind coming again in the future.",7,4,3

I recommend staying away from the pyramid rooms and get a room in the tower (still run down, but better than the pyramid).

The nightstand had a piece of wood missing from the bottom, the two chairs that were in there didn't match and the bottom fabric was coming undone. I'm not expecting much but a stapler and some glue would have done this room some good. But I get it, you get what you pay for.

I usually stay at MGM Grand for the convenience of it. It is in the middle of all of what, I feel, is needed in Vegas. I was a little apprehensive staying here, as I had a bad experience here a few years ago and said I'd never be back. Nonetheless, our friends were here and this is where we opted to be for them. We booked a suite via my MLife card and saved a good 20% off our suite. Upon arriving into Vegas, the Luxor had a VIP check in line. But my status with MLife wasn't good enough. I hate lines. I don't do them. I am quite impatient in them, in fact. I have to be a little foo foo in this review ;-) The line moved rather quickly and quickly we were on our way up to our suite. We had a corner suite with the view of the strip; well, as far as one can see down the strip at the Luxor, since it sits a little off the main strip. Our room was dated. It was big and the bed was comfy and firm. The room was dated, though. It is in need of a renovation that gets it out of the 90's with all the purple velvet couches and diamond printed rugs. The armoire, was warped and falling apart. The suite was nice though. Relatively quiet. The hot tub sat on a platform of tile, (thats a little dangerous if its wet on the tile from the hot tub and there is any alcohol involved), overlooking the street. We liked being able to take a hot tub at the end of a night of debaucheries out. The Luxor doesn't have as many restaurants open as MGM late at night for drunchies. But there is a Starbucks. I was okay with this hotel. But it's not my fav and again, needs renovation. The design is cool and the layout works. Just update the hotel already.",4,2,2

By price point, Luxor would be considered a lower-end hotel on the main Las Vegas strip.  There are two main casino owners on the Strip; Caesars, which owns 5 or 6 properties, and MGM, which owns a similiar amount.  The benefit to these is you can play with your players card at a property and receive discount and comp room offers at their related properties, so always keep that in mind.

I stayed in a Pyramid tower room, which are the properties older rooms.  You can tell based on the radiator how old it is, lol.  However, it was clean and looked rather modern.  The windows were at a 45 degree angle, which makes sense, since it is a pyramid.  Luxor does offer a seperate tower with regular type rooms. The slanted wall does make for a smaller room, but you still get two queen beds, a beautiful bathroom and a shower.  The shower is big, but there is no tub.  The casino provides individual mini bottles of conditioning-shampoo, body wash, and moisturizer.  My room was on the 27th floor facing the strip; at night, I could see Planet Hollywood in the distance through Excalibur  It is really beautiful.  The entrance to the room in via the inside of the casino, and you can see 27 floors down. It is kind of cool, although it does seem mildly dangerous if you are tall, clumsy \/ and or drunk.

The casino itself is spacious, offers a good number of slot machines and games.  I did find the dealers at the craps table to not pay attention to me, which annoys me, because I had a great experience up the Strip at another casino unrelated to them - it looks like little Italy on the inside.  And I lost money at both, so it has nothing to do with that.  It is connected to Mandalay Bay via the Mandalay Bay shops, which are very nice.

The pools are beautiful.  It offers 4 pools.  There was a gay event both days (they have a gay event normally on Sundays), but there was plenty of room for gay and straights alike, and if the straights were uncomfortable, there were 3 other pools. The pool area had food, drinks, and a little shop with sunscreen, water, etc.  And you were able to charge to your room.

The biggest negative is it is at the end of the strip, so I think it is a little less busy.  Friday and Saturday night in the middle of the strip is very busy, exciting for gaming; at the end, a little less.  Its not dead, but it took awhile to pick up. Its also far -- 1.1 or 1.2 miles from Aria and even further to Mirage.  These are MGM properties, related to Luxor, that's why I named them.  .. So it's a walk.  When its 100 degrees out, that's far.  However, a cab ride to Flamingo was $11.  Not terrible. 

From the airport, by the way, its $18 to Luxor.

My biggest problem is the resort fee.  The rate for Friday 9\/6 was $75 and Saturday 9\/7 was $96.  This included a 30% reduction because of the player's card.  With taxes and fees, the total was $171. However, all the resorts (not just Luxor) have added a ""resort fee"" which they add at the time of check-in.  Luxor was $18\/night; i think the ""higher end"" properties were $20-$30\/night.  The competition does it too.  I don't entirely understand it; its so you can use the pool (although I had to pay for an event at the pool), get bottles of water, and the newspaper.  Its a general complaint; just put those in the price of the room.

Also, they gave you a booklet worth ""$800"" of discounts, but it was ""buy 1 get 1"" etc, or $20 off with two people a meal.  Which is fine, but I did travel alone, so it was no good to me.

The front desk and bell service were all very friendly and helpful.  Checkout was easy on the TV.  I used a debit card, so it did ""double charge"" for 3 days (the hold and then the actual room charges), but if fell off on the 3rd day after I checked out. 

Overall - I'd stay again.  I've stayed in 7 properties -- from Imperial Palace to Caesars Palace to Wynn -- and this was perfect.",6,0,1

This is a great one to stop into before heading into the airport on the way home. If you have to check out of your hotel and have a couple hours to kill before your flight you can do it here. I have never stayed in the hotel but I saw Fantasy and Carrot Top here and the theater is great and both shows were very good. Carrot Top for me is the Kind of humor that really makes me roll with laughter.  Also, I have seen Blueman Group and that is a show I would highly recommend. I didn't see it this trip but seen them before and it's a great show. I wanted to see Mindfreak with Criss Angel but didn't have the time. 

I like this place a lot too because it has a monorail to the Excalibur and the Mandalay Bay so you can drink away and not have to worry about driving to visit these hotels and casinos. 

When you enter this hotel its wide open and you can see to the top of the pyramid. To the left are large and very clean bathrooms and to the right the front desk it has been kept in amazing shape. Straight ahead is a bar and the casino. It just looks beautiful. Also what I like about the Luxor is when you walk it the hotel lobby for check in is very easy to find. 

The casino area is large and very nice. Plenty of slots, and table games. All the table gave aren't super high minimum bets. I did not see any $5 tables however. Generally on the strip you won't find lower minimum tables and that's fine.

Usually when I come to Vegas, a few friends and I come on a Thursday night and stay in a cheap hotel. Then Friday when the rest of our friends come, we move into the lap of luxury.

Luxor used to be a popular hotel. I remember when I used to come to Vegas with my parents as a kid, it was just being built, and I always wanted to stay in a room with a slanted wall. Vegas has changed a lot over the past few decades, and Luxor is no longer considered a luxurious hotel. It seems as if the newer hotels on the strip are always trying to top one another in architecture, decor, and luxury. And yes, they are doing a good job.

If you want to do Vegas cheap, Luxor is a good choice for a decent hotel.",3,1,1

We didn't have to deal with the crazy elevators, fortunately and\/or unfortunately, as we were on the 5th floor, but our room was spacious and clean.

Plus, now with Uber in the area, it's around $5-8 to get to hotels like Paris, Bellagio, etc. The location being on the most South end of the strip is not much of an issue anymore.

There was a long line even before check in time began at 3pm, probably due to the long weekend. The line did move quickly and Bryan was very friendly and informative. This hotel is part of MGM enterprises so not sure why we had a $20 plus tax resort fee at this location but not at Mandalay Bay (which also allows people to redeem complimentary rooms), which has much nicer rooms and many more amenities. I mean they don't even have wireless internet in these rooms. There also is not a bathtub for small kids to bathe in. The self parking is a pretty far walk too which makes it difficult for those of us traveling with small kids and luggage. During the long walk we were solicited twice by timeshare sales people. We do own a timeshare so we understand the process of soliciting couples, but why were there 2 different tables between the parking lot and hotel registration? The rooms need major upgrading aside from the tv. There was a very dusty plush soccer ball on top of the closet, my goodness, no wonder we were sneezing! We may be accustomed to the smaller, nicer hotels where the parking lot is right outside and rooms are nicer so it may just be our expectations. Too bad we could not pay for an upgrade to the newer rooms in the West Tower as another reviewer described, but it was a long weekend and I heard veterans were able to stay for free so kudos to them, they deserve it. The 2 stars are just for the employees, even the housekeeping crew greeted us and we did not have to pay for the room, aside from the questionable resort fee. Bryan gave us a room that was on the highest floor available at check in time because we asked for it. We more than likely will not be returning here except to watch the Jabbawockeez.

The pros of staying at the Luxor is that they have a food court (Quiznos,McDonald's, Starbucks, etc.). and the Pyramid Cafe (good for breakfast.)  You can walk to Mandalay Bay (which houses House of Blues-good for lunch, RumJungle-ridiculous cover but awesome club) via an indoor walkway (that has some nice shops and restaurants.)  You can also walk to Excalibur (and maybe catch The Tournament of the Kings show, or a frozen drink from Dick's Last Resort) without leaving the Luxor.

Its very affordable, and the staff is really nice and responsive.  However, the rooms are a little worn, the beds are uncomfortable and its kinda at the end of the strip.  They charge you 14.99 per day for internet that isn't wireless (there is a strange patch cable apparatus on the side of the TV that connects you to the internet.)  Our iron didn't work, we asked for another and that didn't work either...this pissed me off because I didn't get to wear my freak um dress as I was unable to iron it.

The room was decent, maybe I'm used to more amenities in the hotels on the strip,  even from the non higher end hotels. It got the job done.

Luxor is in walking distance to other hotels (Excalibur, Mandalay Bay, New York New York and MGM Grand). It's a little bit of a trek from other parts of the strip but do-able. I could walk to the Aria through the various hotels and walkways in about 25 minutes.

As we chose to head to Vegas for probably one of the most crowded weekends Vegas has ever seen, we chose to stay at Luxor since it seemed to be more friendly on the wallet than our usual other end of the strip.  Luxor is one of the older hotels on the strip and this is how I broke it down: nice on the outside, okay looking in the casino\/lobby area, and why the eff am I here in rooms.

ROOMS:
Two Queen beds, tube TV, dresser, dining table and chairs
No safe (wtf!!)
No closet
No wireless (I laughed when I saw my friend had to run the Ethernet cable to her laptop)
Clock radio, no aux cable or ipod charging deck
Only a shower, no tub 
Bathroom lack ventilation (I take hot showers and it was horribly stuffy coming out)
Lighting is horrible
After noon, you have to call to get maid service 

POOL:
Okay, so I actually enjoyed the pool. I got to the pool right before 2pm and when I got down there, it was almost like a Vegas pool party.  There was a DJ playing house and hip-hop and tons of people in the pool.  There were a good number of ""paid"" areas to sit at (yes, pay a fee to sit there!  Wtf).  Luxor's pool is more adult rather than family friendly.

OTHER NOTES:
*$16.80\/day resort fee
*Non friendly concierge staff - we forgot our keys and had to get new ones at concierge. The staff was not friendly at all about it
*Valet was full at 6:30am. Really? Yes, so we had to self park the car far away...
*Elevators are slow

The decor around the hotel is nice and sticks with that Egyptian theme, especially the buffet it's very lovely to eat there. Food could be better though. 
What I really loved about the hotel which sounds strange is the smell. I don't know what the smell is but when you enter the Luxor from Excalibur it smells sooo good! I wanna know what it is so I can buy that febreeze or whatever it is! The beds in our room were super soft! It's like sleeping in a cloud you just get so comfortable which is a plus after a long day of walking. 
What I didn't like about the hotel was the $112 fee, usually in a hotel you get the deposit back but I didn't here which annoyed me. Also the elevators, they go super fast or I don't know what happens but they made me extremely dizzy whenever I would get in. They really need to fix that problem.

Be advised that the check-in process is loooooong! I arrived around 8pm on a Wednesday and waited in line for at least 20 mins.  The only time the line wasn't looping back and forth was between 1-2pm.  The hotel has a fragrance that almost covers up the smell of cigarettes.  Kinda smells like strippers and regret.

The restaurants aren't very good, and they're expensive for the quality of food.  You also can't call ahead for food to go. You have to walk down to the restaurant and wait, which I find annoying--especially hungover.  I even asked if I could give them my CC # (in case they thought I wouldn't show) and if they would make an exception.  Nope. 

I rented a movie one lazy morning and the screen froze about 10 mins in.  I called to report it and they told me it would be about an hour before a maintenance person could come to fix it.  The thing that really bothered me was that the operator kept mispronouncing my name, even though I corrected her twice.  I ended up fixing it myself.  How?  I unplugged the TV and plugged it back in.  Poof!

At this point, the lack of customer service at the Luxor is becoming obvious.  Don't get me wrong, they're nice, but not willing to take care of people.  I think it speaks to their training and demographic.",0,0,0

I was scared and just ran into hallway and downstairs. The siren got switched off after 15 minutes. I asked one of their employees at front desk registration and he said they suspect there was a fire but not sure.

I requested an upgrade numerous times because I was celebrating my 60th birthday with my sister who came in the day before I arrived. Her room was so filthy, she was moved to an upgraded room immediately, at no charge.  I was told I would have to pay $10 per night for my upgrade.  Then she told me she could go down to $5 per night.  I agreed, we were only staying three nights and she had a room next to my sister.  
The room had two queen beds.  I requested a king.  I think she could have advised me at the desk.  She had such a poor attitude and I was her first guest.
Once in my room I called downstairs and the upgrade fee was removed, I think.  They are still playing around with the final charge.
Everyday my sister was chasing housekeeping for towels.  There was a serious face cloth shortage.
Signage is terrible.  Would it hurt to put signs next to the elevator buttons?
Clearly, they cannot hire enough staff to work the front desk, evidenced by the long, long check-in line.  
BTW, I'm a local.  I have stayed at almost every hotel on the strip.  This was by far the worst.

Not that we weren't intrigued by the Luxor before, but the nightly rate and the fact that it was steps from the start line definitely were added bonuses.

They really don't have signage that will direct you to registration parking, so we had to ask one of the overworked valets, who directed us to the 15-minute parking along the side of the road. It's handy to have, but it was pretty busy when we got there, so I'm not sure how they handle overflow.

The check-in line was pretty intense. There was a good group of people in front of us, and there were only a handful of people working the front desk. Still, it seemed like the wait wasn't as bad as it seemed it'd be, and we were at the front in no time.

The check-in process was painful. I'm not sure if the guy we were working with was new, but he sure acted that way. He was confused by our request to charge everything to a card that was different from what they had on file. He kept making jokes about the free beer that we would be getting at the end of the half marathon. He kept asking the same questions over and over again (one of my pet peeves - if I've already answered you, I really do not want to have to repeat myself.)

He walked away halfway through our registration, without so much as an, ""Excuse me, I'll be right back"" or any kind of verbal indication of what he was doing. He just kind of moseyed off, and then moseyed right back after two or three minutes. When he came back, he said, ""So...did you want to add in a password?""

My husband and I responded with our very best *cricket, cricket* expressions. He returned in kind. After a beat or two of us looking as confused as he seemed to be, we finally said, ""What's the password for?"" To which he replied, ""For the key"" and I just *know* he wanted to add in a ""Duh!"" at the end.

Once we finally squared that away, he thanked us for coming and tried to shoo us along. Without our keys. They were sitting on the desk, right in front of him. Yet, he didn't hand them to us. I pointed that out, and after a couple seconds of blinking, he handed them over, and told us which elevators to use to get to our floor. I then asked him how to get to the elevators from self-parking. He replied, ""It'll be obvious.""

Too bad it wasn't.

Anyway, the rest of our stay was great. The room was clean and spacious, if a little worn down.  The patch jobs on the walls were obvious and some wall pieces - especially in the bathroom - were starting to peel away. One of the bedside lamps didn't work, but there was more than enough light in the room to cover for that. The TV seemed a bit old and didn't immediately respond to the remote, but we only had it on for the briefest of moments. 

The views of the hotel lobby from the floors above are pretty awesome. There's a particular feeling up there - kind of an auditory removal - that can be a bit disorienting. It's almost like you're in a sound-proof room, which is kind of cool. And, being up that high, you can see the tippy tops of the ""buildings"" within the lobby. I thought that was pretty nifty.

Parking was a breeze, and it was easy to maneuver our way through the casino to get to the elevators, once we figured it all out (""obvious"" my eye). The people we encountered out on the floor were all helpful and friendly, without being too intrusive.

About the only thing I'd say is that some of the interiors could maybe use a little attention. There were a few elevators that had things torn away, and it made it look a bit junky. Oh, and the elevators can get crowded very quickly, and when there's a lot of people in there, it can get stuffy. It's amazing how hot it can get in just a few minutes. Turning on the air in the elevators would help a ton.",1,0,0

Feels like it was remodeled several decades ago, trashy feel, hasn't been updated in forever. Too many smoking rooms not enough non-smoking rooms. Poor lighting, difficult internet (no wi-fi), just an ethernet cable from wall. Bathrooms seem outdated, dusty, broken.. Very far walk from elevator to many of the rooms. Noisy.. so you always have to have fan on in room, and even then it's too noisy. Customer service hit or miss - most front desk staff seem very grouchy, but found an occasional cheerful person with customer service in mind. 

When I checked in I was told the non-smoking room I had confirmed through my reservation was unavailable - they had NO non-smoking rooms left and I would just have to deal with it, check back with them tomorrow. They said they could send someone up to 'freshen' up the room with some deodorizer. Eeeeks! I am allergic to smoke and any fake spray scented stuff so I quickly declined. They sent someone anyone and I sent him away. Called front desk and finally got another room that was tolerable. Bizarre. But glad I did not have to find another hotel as it was late at night when I checked in.

I was here during winter and my room was freezing. Jacked up the heat but the room took hours to heat up.

We came in for a friends wedding, which is the main reason we chose this location. Mandalay was a bit too pricey and this was attached so not a bad deal.

The line was long, but a really nice front desk lady named Marilyn helped us out. She saw we had a wheel chair and brought us over to the VIP services area. Check in took minutes and she made sure we were in the towers, and near the workout facility. She was the best front desk worker I've ever dealt with in Vegas. She deserves 5 stars. 

It does take a while to get to the tower rooms, but wow, it was worth it. Normal elevators, and a pretty quiet area. The room was spacious and updated. Two beds, a nice flat screen TV, chair and a view of the pool. Nice.  It was very clean, so I was happy about that. 

The hotel is a little confusing when trying to get around downstairs, but nice enough.  Checkout was pretty decent too, and they let me check our bags until it was time to leave.

wall paper is peeling off the walls
the location is horrible for getting around the strip
the pool is not exciting
The parking is very difficult

The service is bad, and here is why:

Our bathroom had not been cleaned when we arrived. We called housekeeping, instead a repair man arrived, and said there was a leak in the bathroom, which explained the pile of sopping wet towels. We asked if we should change rooms, he said no, the hotel is at 100% capacity, he would fix it.

Late that night we returned to find water sprayed all over everything in the bathroom, although we could not see water leaking. All of our items were soaked. It was too late at night to deal with calling down, damage was already done. We woke up to a rain shower in our bathroom coming out of the light fixture. This happened three times, and filled the wastebasket we put underneath it about half way. 

When we checked out we asked to speak with a manager. I explained the story and pointed out that they knowingly checked us into a room that had a leak...we had never called for a repair man, someone else had before we got there. He only offered us breakfast or a room upgrade on another visit. (An upgrade is worth the same as a stupid breakfast)

He went on to say that he would have to investigate what happened. Are you serious? I should have said ""fine I'll wait here"" but i didnt think of that until afterwards. I was offended. A hotel chain that brings in billions of dollars can't own up to its mistake and comp us our room? We were totally inconvenienced, and did not receive even close to the service one would expect from a major hotel on the Strip. After I refused to back down, he agreed to give us a free night stay on our next visit. (great I get to come back)

He refused to give us a refund since we had already paid through priceline. As someone who has stayed at almost every hotel on the Strip, EVERY other place has been superior. I was very disappointed.

Update way after the fact: I never even received the free room voucher for another stay. Really Luxor?",2,4,2

However, we were just looking for a clean room with a comfortable bed and the Luxor did provide that (though the bed does seem to be nearing the end of it's useful life.) Word to the wise -- don't stay in the Pyramid -- if you stand in the casino, you can watch the smoke go up and settle in the top of the pyramid from where it proceeds to 'rain' down again, getting sucked into the walkways to rooms.  We stayed in the tower and our room was relatively smoke-free. We also got very comfortable chairs and a good-sized table. You could really have dinner in your room if you wanted.

We really liked our bathroom. It was big, clean and had a nice magnification mirror for shaving\/makeup\/flossing.  There was a gigantic tub that we didn't use because it was so dry, but a little oil and a candle would have made a for some nice romance if we had wanted to go that route. The soap, shampoo and lotion was fantastic -- smelled  great and didn't bother my sensitive skin. The towels were so-so, not fluffy, not soft, not very big. I'm short and barely managed. The one thing we did not like was the lack of a full-length mirror. The wardrobes have mirrored fronts, but it is cut in half due to a thick wood border and you can't really see what you look like before a big night out.

We really enjoyed our first night in the casino -- at about 5 or so the locals start showing up on weeknights, so it gets busy and buzzy even if you stay midweek. The drinks are small but very good and fairly constant. Their slot machines aren't as loose as they are at other casinos, but they are still fun to play. My partner played blackjack and walked away even after a few drinks. For about ten dollars or so we got   two drinks and about an hour and a half of amusement -- not bad in my book. (Tip -- if ""Gabriel"" is available as a Blackjack dealer and you like a smooth, unfancy but precise dealer, he's your man. We had a fantastic time at his table.)

The Luxor connects to both Mandalay Bay and Excalibur -- the crowd at the Excalibur reminds me a lot of Octoberfest at a bar frequented by grad-students. We didn't go to Mandalay Bay and we really didn't see people come in from over there either, so I can't comment. However, the connection to the Excalibur was nice as it gave us access to some cheap eats and allowed us to get through the strip fairly quickly without going outside into the dust-storm that happened one day. (Las Vegas is a desert -- this happens!)

I have three final thoughts that aren't exactly about the Luxor but apply none-the-less.

* Vegas is not kid friendly, and I don't know why people take their kids there. If the pools are closed, like they were when we went due to inclement weather, there is nearly nothing for kids to do but run wild and get bored. Also, there is all kinds of questionable behavior happening right in front of everyone. While there might not be naked people, in some cases, it's as good as. There are barkers handing out cards with pictures of topless escorts at all times of the day and the dancers and cocktail waitresses go out with a coat over their costume on breaks. You have to walk through casinos to get anywhere in your hotel, so there is plenty to see that is not kid friendly. People swear and spit and piss in public. Leave the kids at home.

*Regardless of your gender, get a facial before you go home. Casino air quality is variable, but generally pretty smoky and if there is a dust storm or inversion, outdoor air quality is equally bad. You will want this stuff sucked out of your pores. Fortunately, every Casino has an attached spa that offers both a ladies' and gents' facial service.

*Watch your dealer carefully - if the game play is too fast, or the dealer seems aggravated by onlookers, or if they are constantly fiddling with their cards, get up, let a pit boss know that Dealer X is making you uncomfortable and go to a different table. Casinos know that you are there to have fun and play games, so they don't want you walking away unhappy\/having a bad feeling.",1,0,0

Last time was great no complains but this time the story is different. So as some may know the pyramid suites have the hot tubs in room to which let me say are amazing, they are spacious and very nice. The only down side this time is if you want to drain the hot tub you have to put your leg all the way inside the tub and open the whole so the water can drain. That is very annoying because I like to rinse the tub with hot water before using it and to drain it i have to go inside of it. It is a really bad design and they should change that. Now for the room. This time around our room had no tables inside. We kind of ignored and said ehh we can deal without a table, but what kind of suites dont have a table? Anyways moving on ... we turned on the hot water but the hot water handle was broken so we called the front desk. They immediately asked us if we wanted to move rooms which we said yes. They said they will bring the keys to our room. 30 minutes later no one has brought the keys so we called. We were placed on a brief hold and than they told us that we dont know what happened and we have the bell boy bringing the keys right now. 30 more minutes later totaling 1 hour of waiting someone brough us the keys. We moved to a different room and to our surprise it had a table. I asked the bell boy why some rooms dont have a table and he said they just remodeled. That is a bad remodeling if you take out a table + the room looks really oldish like it looked 9 months ago but whatever. Now the hot tub worked fine and everything was good until we were woken up by screeching noises coming from above us or outside. We went to sleep late so we really wanted to sleep in but the noise kept on happening. I once again called the front desk told them about the noise and they said they are probably remodeling on top and offered us a room change again. This time i decided to go down and get the keys myself so i dont have to wait an hour. We moved rooms and once again to our surprise there are 2 tables now. Lastly we usually do t get room service and just ask for extra towels from the housekeepers. This time I decided to cal the housekeeping and ask for an extra pillow and couple of towels. Same story as with keys it took them an hour and 3 phone calls to bring the towels. All in all the hotel is nice but the service is desperately in need of change.

The hotel has by far the best design and layout of all on the strip, but the actual guest rooms were a disappointment. We found the beds to be extremely hard and could feel springs poking through. The pillows were flat as pancakes and the beds are not dressed with a fitted sheet so if you move at all you'll find yourself sleeping on the bare mattress.
We were startled to find that the fitness center onsite is not included in your stay, but is $10 per day per user. No thanks.
The food at the breakfast buffet was wonderful; however, on Saturdays and Sundays the price increases $6 per person because mimosas are included. You cannot choose non-alcoholic breakfast as we found out once we reached the front of the line. The woman at the register was rather sarcastic when we asked and told us to read the sign (which listed both rates). She made sure to tell us that the mimosa is complimentary. Since when does extra $ for something mean it's complimentary? Whatever, we went elsewhere.
The other heads-up I'd like to share is to not waste time or money seeing the Criss Angel show. You only see about five magic tricks and the rest of the two hours is filled up with people performing a poorly choreographed dance routine in strange costumes.

Check-in was efficient and the woman was polite. We received a tower room with a strip view. In addition, we asked for a non-smoking king and there was no smoke smell in the room. 

The room was clean and didn't seem old or rundown. The bathroom had one sink and a separate tub and glass-enclosed shower. Some of the things about the room were strange but it wasn't a big deal taking into account the very low price we paid. For example, we only got a single trashcan situated next to the toilet. They use some really cheap brand of toilet paper that is thin and abrasive. We also had an adjoining room with strangers next door and the noise was much louder through the door than I thought it would be. The television was a CRT but we didn't really use it anyway. There was no room safe but the front desk did offer complimentary safe deposit boxes that were located somewhere in the lobby. There was complimentary internet via hard wire that came from the rear of the television. It wasn't really convenient to stretch the long wire across the room but we didn't really use it anyway.   There's lots of advertising at Luxor (flyers in rooms, phone messages, aggressive timeshare people, etc) but it is easy to ignore. I just gave a stern ""No, thank you."" to the timeshare people and they quickly moved on to the next victim.

We used the gym, which was included in the resort fee. The room was long and rectangular with weights on one end, a stretching\/ball area on the other and cardio machines in between. They have a little fridge in the gym with complimentary water but didn't offer any spray or washing solution to wipe off the machines after using. The people working at the spa didn't check to see that we were actually staying at the hotel, which I found strange. I chose a machine in between a porn star and a couple of European dudes lifting weights while trying to gain her attention. Best workout ever. 

The rooms also come with 2 small bottles of water per day. It was a great way to rehydrate after a long night of drinking. Oh and the clientele was very interesting here. It seemed it was a lot of college kids and recent college grads and porn industry folks who were in town for AVN. I like the location a lot but I prefer to hang out in the hotels nearby, not in Luxor itself. Overall, I might consider staying here again but the whole pyramid tomb thing makes me paranoid. The price paid for the room was very good for the quality of the room we received.

In the casino, we hit up the craps lesson, which happens everyday at 1pm. I felt that the lesson was very good and, later on, with the help of the dealers, I picked up rather quickly.",1,1,1

But my teen daughter had really good grades and she wanted to see the glitz of the strip and the shops and the fountains, etc. so I booked the cheapest rates without being 'off-strip"". CES was coming in this week, so that was not an easy feat, either. I digress...

This review is for the room. In the Pyramid, 22 floors up. I am not very comfortable being in a totally enclosed hotel (look it up...carbon monoxide is a silent killer). So that is one star off, but I knew that was coming. 

The room itself was what was expected. Clean. I would have liked a coffee machine of some sort so I would not have to get dressed and pay $6 for a latte at Starbucks in the casino. I small fridge would have been nice. Ironing board\/Iron was provided. Not needed. 

Now the 2nd star missing: No wireless internet access. Who carries a laptop anymore? My tablet stayed in the suitcase. 

The shower floor was sluggish. The maid has to clean soap scum off the floor of that shower every day...you would think he\/she would tell someone that it needs to be dealt with. The toilet was SO low-flow that TP did not flush unless you dropped it directly on the water in the bowl. The travertine tiled shower was obviously new...too bad they could not get the plumbing right.

And the bathroom fan! NO conversation could happen in that room when the bathroom light was on because of that turbofan blowing\/sucking. ""WHAT? WHAT DID YOU SAY??"" Nobody was able to primp\/makeup\/brush teeth without that annoying noise. Make a separate switch for the fan, please. 

I never saw concierge service. I guess it was there. But the concierge desk at Excalibur and Monte Carlo were very nice. 

The buffet breakfast was horrific. Late night supper was better. (we got the $35\/all day Luxor\/Excalibur passes for one day) Excalibur's dinner was OK.",1,1,0

The hotel looks great and we had a great view of the atrium as we walked out of our room.  We used the express check out on the television because during our stay  I noticed very long lines at the check out and check in desk.  

My biggest beef with this hotel is that we booked our room online through priceline and got a decent rate.  However, we were charged an additional $69 for our four night stay for a ""resort fee"".  We never received any extra service for this fee, to me it's a total rip off.  You can't opt out of it, they just add it.

Also, as we walked in carrying all of our luggage we were greeted by a friendly, professional looking woman who asked if we were checking in as if she was going to assist us.  All she wanted to do was try and sell us a time share.  We were accosted by these salespersons several times throughout our stay and it was quite annoying.  For the price we paid, esp the extra resort fee, I don't feel guests should be bombarded by sales pitches.",0,0,0

I didn't pay for it so that probably helps a little bit with the rating.  I knew this wasn't going to be a great hotel or anything but I was still a little excited to stay there just because it's so random and funny to stay in a pyramid shaped hotel.  

Well, the elevators are weird and not in a fun way.  For some reason, I thought they would be glass so you could see out.  Not the case.  They move upwards at a diagonal angle which is unsettling when you're sober and nausea inducing when you're drunk.  Our room was ok.  Nothing to write home about but no problems either.  The windows and slant of the room make it seem much smaller than it probably is.  

Check in was easy and quick.  Tacos N Tequila restaurant had good guacamole and a bachelor party there bought us Patron shots.  So that was good.  

Gambling was ok, again nothing exciting.  

We went out by the pool one afternoon.  It was so hot and there was no shade.  At a certain point in the afternoon, the glare coming off the pyramids was horrible.  Also, I don't need to look at a larger than life size poster of Carrot Top when I'm trying to relax.  

Overall, it was ok but I don't think I would ever pay for their weekday prices or would be in a rush to stay there again.",0,1,0

Unfortunately, from within one of the pyramid rooms, one would have a rough time finding anything that would distinguish it from a mid-range motel (not hotel) room - except that slanted window.

We decided to stay somewhere that would be memorable to a child, in the hopes that it would actually remain memorable.  Unfortunately, the cost for that was a room that was substantially more expensive than what I would have considered similar quality elsewhere in Vegas.

The Luxor was undoubtedly nice at one time, but it feels very much like a has-been that is in need of a new image and a severe remodel.  We were in a room on the first few floors of the pyramid, which was not too terrible.  Despite other comments, the noise from the casino floor wasn't really noticeable.  The view of the atrium is great, though from our room, we had to go down an elevator and then sneak onto an inclinator to get any worthwhile view.

However, from the Luxor, everything's a major walk.  This is no fun with kids.  Luxor shares a little elevated transit tram system that will get you up to Excalibur, where you can walk to NYNY and then MGM Grand, where you can then get to the Las Vegas Monorail.  There's a trick or two in doing that without walking all through the Grand.  Unfortunately, the LV Monorail is a miserable experience in itself, because at most stops, you are forced to walk a long way (often through large shopping areas, or around parking areas, and always through the casino floor) to get from the street to the Monorail.  The end result is that you're almost always tired by the time you've beaten your way from your Luxor room to your destination, and it can take up to an hour to get there.  And there's still the trip back.

Overall, Luxor was a disappointment.",1,1,0

I enjoyed the Public House; however, skip the buffet and the cafe. Both the buffet and Pyramid Cafe were NOT worth the price due to the food and beverages being very sub-par. 
In regards to the rooms, I feel they are in need of a huge update! Especially the washrooms. I just didn't feel they were as clean as they could have been and the towels smell funny..Moving on, in addition to renewing our vows and eating, we enjoyed two days in the spa!!

The staff was so friendly and professional from beginning to end, including over the phone. I was blown away by their service! Because I arrived in Vegas very early, 5am to be precise, I asked them to keep my bags for me while  I gallivant on The Strip. Later, they took my tag and brought my small bag to the room for me. I could've done it myself but they are nice like that. Of course, I tipped the guy.

On checking in, they told me they no longer had the room I had booked, they upgraded me by two rooms! I ended up in a massive room with two queen sized beds and a living room, giant TV's everywhere, a full bathroom and a Jacuzzi in the bedroom and a great view. I wish I had more time here! there's a Mc Donald's somewhere in the building, so I had that for a late night stack in the early hours of the morning.

The lady at the desk, told me to take my time looking for it, I did and it was all good. The watch was actually in my bed.

This hotel needs some serious updating. Both of our TV's were big tube TV's, the sofa and chair looked like they had been ridden hard and put away wet. They were faded and sunk in in spots. 
This hotel does not offer WI-FI at all, free or otherwise. They do have 'wired' interet that is free. I found this to be a pain. There is a black box attached to the TV that i supposed to have an ethernet cable attached to hook up your computer. Neither of my TV's had the ethernet cord necessary for internet hook up. When Icalled down to the desk, the woman had me pulling both TV's off the shelf to see if there was a cord behind. I told her there was not a cord behind either TV, and she sounded like she didn't believe me. 
Finally she agreed to send someone to check it out. A man came and saw that there was no cord available and hooked one up that he had brought with him.

I found out that any hotel on the strip will loan a wheelchair to someone in need, whether you are a guest of their hotel or not. The Luxor charged a $15 per day fee even as a guest ofthe hotel.

It's priced in the medium\/high range, but offers a low\/medium tier experience, not to mention it's at the far end of the strip.  

- The AC is so-so.  Make sure to close the blinds on your window otherwise your room will warm up quickly & take a long time to cool off.

- Because the elevators (""inclinators"") are slanted to the shape of the hotel, it's more like riding a subway car than a traditional elevator.

- Also, the elevators can make a lot more walking than you expect.  Like a lot of hotels, certain elevators only go to certain floors.  However, unlike a hotel where all the elevators are clustered in a centralized location, Luxor has an elevator bank in each of its four corners.  Your particular elevator will only be in one of then.  This means you may need to walk to the complete opposite end of the hotel to get to your elevator & once on your floor double back to complete opposite end again.

- The design of the hotel is such that the hallways of the hotel are open to the atrium.  If you're on an upper floor, it can be fairly un-nerving if you don't like heights.  

- There's no wireless Internet.  However, they automatically charge you a ""resort fee"" which includes a wired one in your room.

- Check-in lines are long, but you can check-out through TV.

I mean, its not terrible... it's just... odd. The approach to the Luxor reveals its glass Pyramid and Ricotta cheese colored Sphinx exterior, it's ""Donald Trump""tacky.
 Once inside, you will find the Interior walls are adorned with hieroglyphs everywhere, ""etched"" into plastic or styrofoam film scenic panels, framed ""gold"" jewelry and paintings of Pharaohs and other folks dead for 4,000 year... Ewww.

I'm used to more business traveler type hotels, so to enter my room and have no amenities is awfully disconcerting. No mini fridge, no coffee maker, not even bottled anything... I had to remember to grab something near the lobby before the trek up to my room. The entire hotel, in an unsettling twist has a uniform musty smell to it... musty. How do you accomplish that in the desert ?!  Its odor is very reminiscent to 300 year old hotels in London... not Vegas, the Desert Vegas !

One thing I learned when I stayed at the Luxor and worked at the Mandalay Bay is bring sneakers cause you're going to put on miles & miles & then more miles... man

Anyway, the Luxor is used and in need of a refresh, maybe a MerMaid motif for the next Go-round. But then again, I did stay there for 3 nights for under $300, so who am I to complain and I'm sure the gamblers didn't notice it as they bet with feverish zeal to get those lights to light up !

I'm unsure of food, since we ate out most of the time, there's a ""Food Court"" and we stayed away from it like the plague, I get the idea that perhaps food prep isn't The Luxor's long game and I wasn't inclined to ""Test the Waters"".
All in all, the luxor is okay, kind of dated, whether it's dated by 15 years or 4000, I think its time to renew, revitalize and reboot to a new millennium.",2,1,0

I was thrilled to see that despite the renovations to the casino area and common areas, that I had left the good stuff like the fabulous art intact, but added a plethora of new dining options and many exciting bars and clubs. I also appreciate the fact only Luxor is proudly LGBT friendly, and even host a swim party during the summer months.

My room in the tony East tower was so comfortable, modern and inviting.....that I spent most of my time during the day in it! but then again I had to work remotely during the day. I was thrilled to find out that the room had a wired internet connection. not only was this vastly faster than wireless, it was safer and even faster than my connection at work!

The furnishings in the room more outstanding and in pristine and like new condition. And so very clean! I fell in love with the comfortable bed and crisp clean white linens!

Service is what makes or breaks any business, and this is where Luxor totally trumps the Las Vegas Sands properties and by now second favorite MGM Grand. every possible interaction with a staff member what a pleasure. and if you needed anything special it was delivered in less than 5 minutes. Amazing!

What are remembered very quickly after not visiting in about 6 years, was how quickly and easy it was to get to your room. because of the layout of the east and west towers, you are never further than  ten doors from your room. and the tram to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur always ran on time and was such a convenience when visiting other MGM properties.

Lastly, I wanted to thank the MGM Grand Corporation for the impressive payouts are received on the slot machines. winning $1,000 made me do a happy dance!

There are a couple of good things going for it, though, during my visit that made it a fairly pleasant stay although your mileage may vary.  

Let's get some of the negatives out of the way:
-The rooms need a touch-up.  I was put in the newer West Tower rooms and it was still fairly old-school from the furniture to the amenities there.  Not terrible by any means but the tech inside and the quality felt older.  
-The food options could be better inside.
-Check-in lines can be super long if you come in the middle of the day\/early night.  
-The hotel clientele definitely feel older as well for the most part.  

Some of the great pros include:
+Service was terrific all-around on my end.  The cashier who helped me out (Lucy I believe) was extremely great at helping me get settled and feeling like a champ (even though I'm sure some of the nice pluses like a $20 food\/drink credit wasn't because of my stellar attitude :P).  
+It's connected easily to the Mandalay and Excalibur without ever having to walk outside and gives you access to extra shops and restaurants without having to travel too far.  
+Drinks are relatively cheaper as well as some of the casino tables compared to the fancier locations.  
+Although still smoky, people at least seemed generally nice all-around.  

Luxor still has some tricks up its sleeve and as long as you're willing to concede with a few amenities as well as the location itself, it's not necessarily a bad choice if you get it for the right price.  

(Random note - An Uber driver told me about a canal ride that used to ride under the casino before it flooded the casino or something? That sounds awesome!)",5,2,1

We drove up from Laughlin, so arrived at check in at 1 PM. Check in is a 3PM. It was Wednesday, so I figured there would be a room available, and there was. But the Luxor's policy is you must wait until 3PM, or pay $20 to enter room early. Paying for late check out I can certainly understand and have paid in the past, but I have never had a hotel charge to enter an otherwise vacant room a couple hours early in the afternoon. We paid the $20, no big deal. 
We went into the room and found the internet was a 20 foot long crinkly wire that came out from behind the TV. No wireless internet. I had not seen a wired internet since my last hotel stay in a 3rd world country. Luckily I had my trusty laptop, but our Ipad was useless except for our 8 year old being able to play a game. 
The flat screen TV was inside a closet with large doors that opened outward only 90 degrees. Which means you must sit directly in front of the TV to watch it, or the doors are in the way. Why not just remove the doors?
As others have mentioned, there were pubic hairs on the bathroom floor. Perhaps the cleaning staff keep a jar of them to sprinkle around for ambiance, I don't know. There was also some kind of yellow chunky stuff stuck to the wall next to the toilet. 
My wife brought our 8 year old son to the pool. About 108 degrees outside. You want shade? Another $20. The room itself is inexpensive, so no big deal.
Worst experience was when my wife brought our son back to the room from the pool. Her key would not work. She called me to come to the room and try my key instead of going downstairs with our son and waiting in the check in line for a new key. I was eating at the Excalibur and had just received my food. I told her to keep trying and I would hurry eating and be there as soon as I could. I ate fast and went to the room. Pretty long walk. When I got to the room, my key would not work either. We went back down to the long check in line in the lobby. We waited in line again and at the counter we talked to  a receptionist who was apparently having a bad day. She told us the keys would not work because we had mishandled them and thus demagnetized them  She strongly suggested we should have known better and had we not been so careless with our keys, we would not have suffered this inconvenience. 
When I asked her if it was then all our fault, she said she would not talk to me anymore since the room was reserved in my wife's name. She then asked me ""Who are you to this woman? Are you even with her? I'm not talking to you."" Maybe she thought my wife had just met me on the Strip.
We then asked to speak to a manager. We were directed to the front desk manager on duty at that time. The manager was very polite and apologetic. We got our keys straightened out and had no more key problems. She even comped us $50 to use at the buffet.
I would have given the Luxor one more star had the first receptionist not been so rude and surly. 
The Luxor was the least expensive hotel on the Strip when we checked. But next time I will spend a little more and hopefully get a better hotel.",0,0,0

I guess it's just a warning to people who are trying to have a pleasant experience in Vegas.  From the moment we arrived we were made aware that this is not a classy place and we will not be treated well.  I was asked to put a credit card on file for incidentals, which is normal at a hotel, but they pre-approve $150 on that credit card that you can't use for other things on your trip.  The lady at the front desk said not to worry it will only be charged if I get room service or anything like that.  What was left out was the room has a $25 a day ""resort fee"". That should have been explained and honestly included in the price.  I paid for the room ahead of time including all taxes and fees. I asked what the resort fee was and they said it covered the extras like Wifi and the gym.  Anyhow, the Wifi never once worked and I could not find the gym when I looked for it.  So, after checking in the lady gave me directions to the elevator that included me walking across the casino.  I found out later that there was actually an elevator right behind the reception desk that would have saved me about a third of the walk.  Even then my room was so far from the elevator.  My ""non-smoking"" smelled like cigarette, it was dirty and outdated.  As a matter of fact, housekeeping only cleaned it once and even then the missed the mold in the shower and all the dusty corners of the room.  One day I decided to stay in and watch movies.  Well I couldn't finish a movie because it would shut off and there was no way to re-watch it without re-starting the movie.  By the time I got to the third movie, I gave up.  I was still charged for it though, even though I couldn't get more than a couple minutes into it.  Room service was terrible.  I ordered an overpriced bottle of wine.  They charge a delivery fee and a fee for each glass.  I asked if there was anywhere in the casino where we could buy a cheaper bottle and they said no.  It took 45 minutes.  I called right away to order the next bottle and they said it would be over an hour, but if I wanted they had 2 stores in the casino that sold better wine for half the price. On my final night there I stopped at my room to change before dinner and a show.  My key didn't work, so I went down to the front desk and they said that I went beyond the $150 charged on my card and they needed another card.  That's fine, but why was I locked out of my room?  I talked to the assistant manager, I think his name was something like Aria.  He refused to give me his card and was terribly rude.  I told him about the service up until that point and when I was done talking he just walked away.  I called him back to ask for his card and he refused.  I have never been treated so rudely.  I asked for his boss and I believe his name was Casey.  He told me that his employees are not trained to act that way and he is so sorry.  He said he would send someone up with new keys right away.  I waited at my door 20 minutes and still nothing.  I went back down, asked for the manager again and told him my keys still weren't there.  He finally gave me new ones.  No apology this time.

Decor: I loved the Egyptian theme and was fascinated by all the decor in and outside of the hotel. I was super excited to see Criss Angel stuff all over the hotel.

Room: We stayed in the pyramid part of the hotel and price was very affordable. The slanted Windows were pretty cool and the beds were quite comfortable. 

Food: The food court was convenient during the day, but if you're looking for something late at night, backstage deli by the Criss Angel theatre has some great options. For breakfast I was able to buy a filling bagel breakfast sandwich for no more than $6.

Casino: Not as crowded as some of the others I had visited, which was good. The bar had fast service and the drink servers throughout the casino were very nice. 

Cleanliness: Restrooms around the hotel were kept very clean. Our room was also very clean when we first arrived and kept nice and refreshed throughout our stay. 

Convenience: Designated Uber and Lyft stops which was perfect for catching rides to other parts of the strip. We took a Grand Canyon tour bus and it was also very convenient to catch the bus on the Luxor property. Indoor walkways to Mandalay bay and Excalibur were great for getting around to the other casinos.

That being said... the hotel manager, Justin was amazing. We spoke to him about the show stating our complaints and he was very accomodating and not only did he comp us a few drinks (which didn't make up for the $160 we spend on tickets but made it sting a little less) and he also contacted me via email the next day and said he had spoken to the Cirque people and they would be contacting me - which I thought was great customer service.
We did not stay at the Luxor but we will definitely consider it next time.

But, it is the Luxor - a gigantic pyramid at the south end of the Strip with all the basic amenities you need in a place where you are never in your hotel room anyways. I stayed here recently for two nights as part of a package deal. I knew what I was getting into, I think that most people who disliked this place expected a bit more...? 

The hotel was big and grand and not too smoky. The Pyramid rooms were a bit dark and shabby in some areas, but were not hard to walk to. The bathroom was clean and shower spacious with convenient little toiletries for the taking. The beds were comfortable enough, not like I noticed much as every night we would just hit the pillows and zonked out immediately. The pool area was nice (aka the tanning parking lot), would've been much better if the rest of the pool area was open (half was closed due to construction), lots of tanning room and hairy greasy men. It was 100 degrees, so def bring some sunscreen. Had a late night bite at the Pyramid Caf... I would NOT recommend this place unless its 3am and you are desperate. Ate at the Pharoah's Buffet the last day there, it was exactly what you paid for ($15 per person during lunch time). Don't believe the pictures on the buffet ads... you don't get shrimp nor prime rib unless it's the dinner menu. The lunch selection there was quite terrible I'll have to say (I MUCH prefer the Buffet at Wynn, now that is a gourmet Vegas buffet!!). Oh, and I agree that there is way too much time share-pushing at the hotel. I would say we were approached a total of 7 times in 2 days. Grrr. Go away.

Overall, if you can swing a good deal\/rate on this place, it's not bad at all. Right next to the Mandalay Bay. Not a far walk at all to the New York New York Hotel and MGM Grand. We were also able to walk to the Bellagio and Ceasars without any problems. Any further and you might want to take a cab.

Booked my reservation through MLife and upon arriving I stood in the dedicated MLife line. Now usually this line is shorter and moves a bit faster than the general line but I was less than satisfied at the fact that as soon as I arrived there was one 1 front desk agent working with more than 6 people in line including myself. I'm pretty understanding with waiting to check in but this time was absolutely ridiculous! I timed my wait and it took 18 minutes to check in and as I stood in what should've been an expedited VIP check in line as I watched the regular check in and they were moving faster! I would've been better off going in that line! Nonetheless I continued to wait and FINALLY I was called up by a fantastic front desk agent by the name of Crystal I believe! She was very professional and courteous! I think she could see the frustration on my face from the wait but once i was recognized as being a valued MLife member and upgraded to a nicer room my whole experience took a turn for the better :-) the Players suite in the east tower was more than I expected! Good Job Crystal!! So glad I chose to stay and will definitely book this kind of suite or better next time!

I, to be honest, usually stay at MGM. However, my recent trip was for my other half's 40th birthday and he wanted to stay in the pyramid. We got a killer deal on a deluxe pyramid room - we were on the 21st floor as far from the elevators as humanly possible, basically in a corner. We had a giant room, with a big king size bed, a massive bathtub with a view, and a separate living room, and a separate bathroom with a shower and toilet. 

Our room was nonsmoking, and actually seemed pretty clean air-wise. I have really bad allergies and had no issues. Our room, being so high up and so far from elevators tucked away, was also very quiet. And yes, the ""sideways"" elevators will catch you off guard when drinking or not paying attention. 

Checking in was painless and the front desk always seemed exceptionally well staffed. Checking out - just as painless. 

Where the Luxor is lacking is this: the hotel is starting to show its age. Our shower leaked onto the bathroom floor. There was a few inches of dust on the sprinklers in the room. The elevators are wrecked - super squeaky and banged up, the buttons on the floor look like drunks have drop kicked them. The tile trim around the tv stand in our room was broken off and laying on the floor. A picture frame was shattered. Any surface out of the way - under the a\/c or couch, needed a vacuuming. 

I just made it sound dreadful - but it isn't. It's just feeling like it needs a deep cleaning.  I wasn't grossed out or inconvenienced - our bedding and towels were clean and fresh and the room was well appointed and comfortable - you just look in a corner and wonder the last time someone really vacuumed. Again- not enough for me to even complain to staff. It's just lost a bit of its polish after 20 years of abuse from drunks. 

I'd stay in a pyramid suite again in a heartbeat - the view, privacy, giant tub, and convenience of the Luxor to the strip are all fantastic - especially for the prices rooms have been going for there. It's comfortable and we really have no complaints - just remember it's not one of the brand new high end hotels anymore. It's now a nice hotel very well priced for the amenities it offers.

Ask him why was this price now? He does not know. What a crap. The person check the system and see the rate offer at the time of booking. Now honoring the price $143. 

Trying to sell me early check in time for another $24+. I refused. Then ask me to pre-check in. They will text or call when my room will be ready. Within 47 mins text came and room was ready 12:47pm. 

Now got to my room (1:50pm) and found out TV remote or TV was not working. Saw the house keeper in the hallway (2:00pm). Ask for assistance and said will come to my room, but never show.

No one show or call. Call the front desk again. The are surprise to hear NO one have come to the room, ask to hold the phone and check. Return with house keeping said the TV is not work and no signal. Ask how was this not told to me on or before receiving my room. Ask for a different room. Now the Luxor representatives front desk said they are sold out. Now I am VIP from Excalibur and Luxor member. Platinum, Gold, Pearl now because last year stay 14,200 points now drop me to Sapphire.

This is my last stay with Luxor or maybe the family brand. Do not wish for friends or family with this kind of service and experience. 

Now is past the time they promise someone coming to fix the TV. Start writing this 2:22pm and 3:10pm.

Guess what is happening next. Calling to front desk to find out with the TV person. They transfer me to resolve the issue directly with the engineering department. Engineer dept has only one person to cover 22 floors. Which I found out. They have you down but do not know when they can come to resolve or fix the issue. The engineer dept apologize for the inconvenience. But what does an apology means when you are paying and waiting, but keep bouncing you from one department to another to resolve the hotel or in this case they can resort issue. I am not the employees of this hotel, why do I need to do your hotel work? I am a paying customer\/guest. Whatever you do STAY AWAY! 3:19pm now

Received call back from April 3:25pm. Front desk manager Nick has been informed of the situation. Scott the engineer will be coming 5 mins. 

3:30pm Scott came and found the TV was not plug in properly. Tip Scott $5 for his 5 minutes of service. All the time telling me the remote was not working and need to be replaced. TV signal is not coming into the room. All excuses. Hate those kind of people keep passing you to different department without knowing what you are talking about.

I will never go back to this hotel.. I would much rather pay more than have to deal with this dirty hotel again. 

Here's why....

1. No full length mirrors in the rooms. I MEAN- really? Obviously if youre going to vegas, youre most likely getting dressed up & going out. But if you plan on staying here, plan on not knowing what you look like when you walk out of your room.

2. The lighting in the bathroom is TERRIBLE. If you're a girl & you are getting ready in the bathroom- Please be advised....the lighting makes you look like shit no matter how hot you are. 

3. We asked for towels & it took AN HOUR for them to bring it up. This happened not once but twice- and when we complained, the lady on the phone said ""You know, he's got a lot of rooms to go to he will be there as soon as he can."" Sorry- I wasn't aware they only had 1 guy delivering towels to the entire hotel. 

4. The hallways are dirty & dark. The carpets are disgusting, and the walls are DIRTY. I felt like I was walking down the hallways of a dirty motel. I mean really, can  you add some lights? 

5. The housekeeping ladies literally opened the door to our room 5 times throughout the trip for NO REASON. We even had our privacy sign up, they would just open the door and then close it at will. SHADY.

6. Valet parking was full ALL weekend. How does that even happen? It didnt matter what time of day it was. It was full, and we had to park in self parking which was also full except for the top level at the way back. 

The third night we were there we ended up getting a room at the Hard Rock instead and let me tell you - it didnt even compare.

PARKING: The parking here is absolutely awful! It takes about 10 minutes to find the parking lot, and they charge money on top of the ""Resort Fee"" to park in the garage. It takes literally 35 MINUTES TO WALK FROM THE GARAGE TO THE REGISTRATION DESK! Ridiculous! 

CHECK IN: The only reason why in giving this hotel 2 stars is the service, line was long and slow but the woman who checked me in was very nice and helpful, she suggested I upgraded my stay but did not, wow! I really should have!

CORRIDORS: The hike to the room from Registration was actually not too bad. My room was Tower Queen. The elevator was nice, but the corridors not so much! The corridors were Stylish and small, not more than 10 rooms per corridor. However the trash cans were full, the ice machine was broken and lights were out. The corridor also had lots of wine glasses laying on the floor, looked to had been there awhile. The carpets and walls stuck of mildew and mold. 

ROOM: The rooms was nicely themed, however is gets a little awkward having King Tut watching you shower and take a number two! The bathroom was old fashioned with a dirty phone but I did have a nice separate Shower and Bath. There was mold under the sink and bleach around the old toilet. Water pressure was good. The foyer had tile and a nice big closet. All the furniture was old and outdated completed with scuff marks and chipped paint. The bed were OKAY but not the most comfortable and the 2 pillows were flat and and old. The room was VERY poorly lit, way too dark. 

THE VIEW: My view could have been good but I had a big sticker of the Blue Man Group so I looked a holes all day!

FOOD: The Starbucks was very expensive, two coffees and a danish was over $18! The buffet however was large and delicious! They offer all day wristbands for about $40-60.

CASINO: The casino was very cramped. The casino had low ceilings and a lot of cigarette smoke, but it is an old hotel. The tables were not too full, and they did have a lot of slot games. 

OVERALL; I was very disappointed. This hotel was much nicer 7 years ago, it has such nice architecture and theming. Sad to see they do not keep it maintained. I would not recommend this hotel at all! With The price and resort fee you're better off going to a newer resort on the strip!",3,2,1

They have this program called mlife where you can get discounted rates.  It requires that you pays percentage up front.  I am a mostly cash on hand kind of person.  Whatever card you use to make your first payment with is the only card that the application will allow you to pre-check in with when the time comes. Don't use your debit card like I did.  A potentially long line awaits you if you do.

Check-in isn't all their fault...a major conference and the boxing match of the century was in town.  It took more than 30 minutes to get to the desk, though.  They should have been better staffed.  I paid for my room with my trusty USAA credit card.  As they handed me my keys they informed me that my credit card didn't authorize for double the amount (it should have, but I didn't argue), so they put an additional $300 hold on it.  How tacky!?  This isn't a five star hotel, and I'm not a teenager at spring break aching to throw the room refrigerator into the hotel swimming pool.  I am a business professional.  I guess by this policy you know that you are either in a budget hotel where they are prone to have issues, or it is a really upscale place with amenities and nice small things that might accidentally go missing.  Let me assure you, this is the economy line of Las Vegas.

Next I was introduced to the elevator ride to my eleventh floor room.  The elevator service is S-L-O-W and there were at least fifty people waiting.  Again, not their fault, but definitely a design flaw in the elevator quantity & service.  Luxor service personnel were in the midst with carts as well... apparently there is no maintenance\/service elevator. I started looking for stairs.  When I got to my room it was okay, but not equipped to break even with the heat of Las Vegas.  The AC can keep up at night, but in the day don't stay in your room.  There was an open bar of soap in the bathroom.  I do not see anything in my room worth double my stat or a $300 deposit.  Certainly nothing that could be carried out.

PROS:
The room was clean aside from the open bar of soap.  Rooms can be obtained for near per diem rates if you reserve them through the mlife program (also see the con).

The maid service is friendly & accommodating, and the location is convenience if you have business in the Mandalay Bay area.

It takes 90 minutes to check in here.  That alone should make it a 1 star hotel.

You walk about two miles just to get to the strip.  On top of that it's all the way at the south end of the strip.

They have sales people wanting you to go to the time share at ""Grand View"" & Luxor will actually give you free shows or in my case free 4 dys\/3nts next time at Luxor. If you get the free hotel, I'd say take it....ITS FREE!! I know you have to go through the whole time share, but still.

The huge frame of a mummy on the bathroom wall freaked me out though. There's something wrong about doing your business with a mummy watching you.

The pool area wasn't bad, pretty big and super crowded. There was only one bar though, and if you were in the pool with the waterfall, you gottta make the long trek to the other side to get a drink... while burning your feet on the hot pavement, mind you.

Long walk through the casino to get to elevator. Room was hot and stuffy. Turned AC up all the way and it never did get cool. No suitcase rack in room. The entire hotel looked in serious need of a remodel.

Wanted a light supper so went to the food court. Sticker shock! $6 a slice for pizza! $14 philly cheese steak sandwich! No thanks.

I was only staying at the Luxor for three nights. I've been to Vegas twice before and decided to give it a shot with Spring Break and all. I know people say that you barely spend time in the hotel rooms but this was down right sketchy\/disappointing on all fronts. Go to another hotel and don't waste your money on this...spend a bit more for a better experience.

Summarized:
Over an hour wait for check-in

Check-in employee told us that we would be upgraded to a DELUXE room in one of the towers instead of the pyramid like we had originally picked. We got to the room and it was super small, old, no fridge, and just gross. I think I would have been better at a Hotel 6. There were old bags of trash and linens sitting in the hall that stank, stains on the hallway carpet, and there was a feces\/puke smell by the elevators that conveniently greeted you every time you got on and off

Smokey\/old ash trey smell everywhere with poor ventilation--I know there is smoking permitted in the casinos but this one was just rancid compared to others--even Excalibur was better.

Food selections in the hotel were just lame. You have better choices at Excalibur and Mandalay Bay.

Wasn't able to get to the pool due to the weather but it looked ok.

There was SO MANY KIDS EVERYWHERE I thought  was at Disneyworld and not Vegas.

This is unacceptable and they still charged us for parking. I've never experienced such an awful employee at what is supposed to be a nice hotel.

I wasn't amused when we were placed in a room that smelled like weed. Apparently, either housekeeping doesn't know the smell of weed, or they are probably smoking it in the room themselves. So, having to transfer rooms was a big ordeal and a waste of precious time since we were only here for the weekend. If you are on a budget for food, there is an affordable food court on the second floor. Our room was decent although I wish the bedding was more than just a very thin blanket, if you could call it that.

When we walked in, we were swarmed with people that wanted to sell us things. They asked if we were checking in, and then led us to counters to buy things. (The hotel is aware of this.) The line to the actual check in was over an hour, and they wanted to put us in two queens even though we reserved a king. (Honeymoon!) When we finally made it up to the room, our keys didn't work. My husband went back down to the check in desk and waited another 30 minutes just to talk to someone. During that time, security came up and demanded my ID because I was standing outside our door. When he checked, the hotel had no record of us being there, so of course that caused a bigger issue. 

The air in our hotel room didn't work, so it was extremely uncomfortable. My husband couldn't sleep because we were hot and miserable. The hotel is old, dirty, and looks like it's falling apart.

It was a mix feeling about this resort:

Hotel : From the outlook , this is a amazing place with the huge stature standing high ceiling open up as you look up to the rooms, it is a pyramid :) and this why I am here !When you get into the room  ,needless to say all other reviewer made it so clear already, room is dark, simple, peeled  wall,  furniture, stains carpet, and water dripping on the day we arrived because of the rain  ( 25 of April )  with $25 + 12 % tax resort fee per day you will get :no cafe, no fridge, no microwave.  The room comes with iron broad, iron, wifi and a safe.

Service: Front desk with Josephine and her supervisor Mark were trying their best to accommodated us, they are trying to move us free up rate tower, as we all understand the tower side would a be more expensive but as I mention before I am here for the Pyramid so we are here to stay on this side if we can. Their final resulting the solution by we are keeping our room with no resort fees as long as no more tripping water, we agree since we are here not to sleep in the room all day .At this point we would give a 5 star for service until the last day before we leave.  We went to ask for the location direction pick up to go to the airport next day, when we apposing by an oriental clerk (Philippine if I am correct with her accent). I was stunk by her opening ""What do you want ""my goodness, she must be having a rough day? And my stars just drop!

Location: Luxor is almost at the south end of the strip, can be joining walkway within 3 hotels, Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay bay. Since these are the almost out of the others hotels , in the hot  day you have to spend from $5 to $7 ridicule for the  1 L water bottles , we walked cross  the bridge to ABC and pay $1 each , with this money that was enough to pay for a decent lunch.

$ 800 coupon: We did use 2 coupons for the whole book, one for $ 20 to dine at the Steak house and one for the Dairy Queen, while booking with others hotel you would have much better offer as free tickets to show or free buffet at their hotel.
Travel the strip: We paid $8 ticket can be use for 2 decks bus or an express bus within 24 hours. Some time we take a taxi back to the hotels form mid strip and it cost $ 10 to $12 ea.

Overall, we will give it as  for 3 stars,  due to the location my future reference will be the mid strip for sure .",1,0,0

Yes I am talking about the bathroom. I just got this strange feeling from the whole place that I didn't quite like.

But then, our short upgrade was over and we were promptly returned to the Luxor pyramid room. The Pyramid rooms are quite a bit older, stranger, have a slant, and makes very poor use of space in the room. The room is dimly lit, it's got random stains in places I'd rather not know why, and it just seems overall kind of on the old side.

The rooms are DARK like so dark you can't read a book comfortably.
There are no full mirrors in the rooms, no minibar or minifridge.
My television was missing a remote control which took 3 calls and 5 hours to rectify.
The elevators incline at a very strange angle and it feels like you are on a ride at an amusement park only it isn't amusing.
The plumbimg made a clanging noise all night and day 
""it's in the pipes"". It was like Chinese water torture.
The buffet at Pharaoh's Pheast was less than memorable, and don't go by what it says on the main floor, cause quite a few of the items that were supposed to be on the buffet were no where to be found.
Also, stay close to your room if you eat here, I was running for the bathroom not long after eating.
The internet connection they offer is neither cheap nor reliable as I kept getting disconnected and had to keep logging back in. 
There are many other places to stay that look like they are better maintained, this place looks good a first glance, but a closer look will reveal that it is not worth it.

It is also pretty far from the heart of the strip. It is easy to get around if you want to visit nearby (Excalibur\/MGM Grand\/New York, New York) but anywhere further than that is a fairly far walk. The beds are comfortable, dining is okay and the casino has a good layout. However, the pool closes at 7PM. Which is one of the main reasons I'm rating this a 3\/5 instead of a 4 or 5.

I recently wrote a review regarding a few leaks we had in our ceiling while staying in a suite we had for the weekend. (Which was not handled or taken care of in any way, might I add). I thought that situation was pretty crappy however it got much worse. 
The morning I was to check out, I got out of bed and found a BED BUG in the bed. Appalled is an understatement. I immediately got on the phone and spoke to a ""lead"" as there was no manager available at the time. I was then passed around to 3 different people before there was a solid plan on what was to happen moving forward. They ended up sending security to do a report. They shut the room down and had to send out professionals to confirm that it was indeed a bed bug. I was already checking out but the thought of sleeping in a bed with bed bugs for 2 nights in a row, grossed me out, I didn't even have the courage to pull back the sheets to see if there were more. 
While I was out for the day (my stuff stayed at the bell desk), I got a call from the manager stating that they did confirm it was a bed bug in my bed. They told me as a courtesy they would refund my stay, and that they would need to send my clothes to be professionally cleaned. I elected to send my own clothes out to be professionally cleaned because at this point I don't trust them or anybody they deal with. Unfortunately because I chose to have my clothes cleaned by professionals in my area as I was not staying another day, they do not compensate for that. Understandable. However, once I got my portfolio of charges, I find a charge of $80 for a roll away bed that I did not have! It just keeps getting better. I called the manager again and stated that they have got to be kidding me, Day 2 we had 4 leaks in the ceiling from the rain, that were not fixed. Instead they placed towels underneath the trash cans I had placed underneath the leaks. (leaving me with no trash cans for my trash). Day 3 I find a bed bug in my bed and they charge me for a roll away bed that I didn't have. That's far too many mishaps for a weekend stay. The crazy part is, everybody involved except for 1 manager treated my Mother and I like it was no big deal. I'm sorry but when I'm spending any of my hard earned money on a place to lay my head, I at the very least expect it to not be bug infested and water leaking. Never again will I stay at this establishment. If you choose to, make sure it's not raining outside if you're staying in the pyramid, and always pull your sheets back off of the mattress to check for little critters.
Once I figure out how to post pictures, I will be posting pictures of the bed bug I found in my bed and the trash cans full of water from the leaks in our ceiling.

I'd say the Luxor and New York New York are the best bang for your buck on the strip.,0,0,0

I did a review on the horrible place we stayed the other two nights. The price was very comparable, but the resort fee was ridiculous!! Can't fault the Luxor though as everyone else has the same fee. What made this place stand out for us was the architectural design! Although we didn't get to stay in the pyramid the room was large, clean and very modern. The only complaint I would mention is the shower head didn't work and the water just kind of poured out. We took in the Blue Man Group and The Buffet which are reviewed separately. Blue Man Group - Awesome. The Buffet - not so much! This place is a tourist attraction in itself! The only other hiccup was the text checkout. We had already left and I attempted to utilize this method of checking out, but kept getting an error that they couldn't find my reservation. It was resolved with a simple phone call however.

I mention this because of some of the reviews depicting rude service. I am in no way excusing a rude staff member but I think that there has to be some understanding. 
My second night of my stay I had requested a room upgrade. Not because the current room was in any way insufficient, but more for a different experience.

I've seen conflicting reports on whether Pyramid or Tower rooms are supposed to be the nicer ones. Given that I had a ""comp"" night (""comp"" in quotes since I still had to pay the insane $28 resort fee) I'm assuming the Pyramid are actually the more basic rooms. 

Nothing really special about mine other than that the window was slanted and some random heiroglyphics on the wardrobe door. While it was decent, clean and had a comfy bed, it's definitely not a ""luxury"" room by any stretch of the imagination. The most ""lux"" thing was a shower with a sliding glass door in an otherwise typically tiny bathroom (whose hot water smelled like sulphur, probably got an ancient water heating system ... smell is due to harmless bacteria but not the most pleasant thing to wake up to). 

That $28 fee doesn't get you in-room coffee, of course, not while they have two different Starbucks trying to sell you a small black coffee for $3.25 plus tax. Also, a high floor in the Pyramid doesn't guarantee a nice view, as one side is completely dominated by The Two Towers and the Excalibur straight ahead. You do get free wifi but the speed is mediocre and they have the grapes to try to upcharge you to a faster speed after already hitting you up for $28. Stay carny, Vegas. Oh, and speaking of carny, the TV selection is worse than at budget properties. It didn't even have all the channels that were listed on the guide, for example it didn't have the listed Comedy Central and USA for some reason. 

The best thing about the room is that it was very quiet. I was impressed that noise from the open floor that the walkways look over doesn't really get up to the rooms at all. If you can get a decent discount it's a reliable place to get some uninterrupted shut-eye for a night or two, at least.

Check-in line is insane at any time up to 9 or 10 pm even on a weeknight in a supposed low period, be prepared to devote at least 30 minutes of your night to standing. Fortunately they have drop-off checkout boxes in the morning. 

CASINO: I didn't gamble here, honestly I just ignore Strip property gaming floors for the most part as the pay tables always seem to be the worst anywhere. Seemed sparsely populated if you don't want to be crowded, though. The crowd here seems to be more family vacationers here to see the Jabberwockiez and etc. 

FOOD: Typical carny Strip pricing that I refuse to pay so I didn't even look at anything but McDonalds. Which is open 24 hours apparently.",2,1,1

This review however is about the Luxor hotel in particular and not the city of Vegas. Trust me, if I could write a review on a city, I would- and it would be Vegas. With that said, we were really excited to be staying in one of their luxury suites that was heavily discounted because of the economy. The truth is, the room itself was fantastic despite some cleanliness issues (there was major long black hair in the jet tub, and I am blond) and some plumbing issues in the shower (it wouldn't drain, so you had to take a shower with your feet in a bath), but it was over all a very aesthetically pleasing room. The reason I give Luxor a worse rating than the local motel 6 is because of the service. The first night we stayed up until 3am and were starved from our flight that night and from walking the strip. We came inside our hotel to ask the concierge where to eat to her reply ""there is a deli in the hotel"". We were mortified that Vegas closes so early and that our only option for food was a hotel deli. We ate our sandwich and went to bed. So much for the nightlife in Vegas. The reason I blame the hotel is because after returning home, I hear that the concierge was wrong and that there were many places to eat on the strip late night\/early morning. The next day we saw the sites and went to bed late again. We woke the following day to a loud fire alarm going off in our room warning us of an emergency. My husband and I quickly grabbed our clothes and ran down the 11 flights of stairs to evacuate the building. We hit the last floor and were at the back of the hotel. We walked to the front of the hotel and inside to see what was going on to see everyone acting normal. We asked the concierge (different woman this time), what was going on and she replied ""I don't know what you are talking about, just go back to your room""....wow! So she wasn't sure what was going on, if there was a fire, or an emergency but she wasn't willing to ask someone either. Obviously the hotel is not concerned with your safety. We decided after not going back to our room but instead grabbing lunch outside of the hotel, that we would leave the hotel and Vegas for good. We walked back inside to once again talk to a new concierge and to ask to check out one day early where we were shoveled around to 3 different places to finally a woman who I presumed to be the manger angerly checked us out without asking the reason, because she didn't care. We didn't get a partial credit or a thank you or anything. I couldn't believe the lack of customer service and just plan decency of the Luxor. The buffet they have there is decent but that is only because we paid half price because of the deal we got online. I definitely would not pay full price for it. You know, for the starving economy that Vegas claims, I really didn't feel they were that hungry for business. Luxor is truly suxor. Never again!",4,4,2

The Luxor has done something tricky.  They've managed to disguise their 2-star hotel by spotting it with 4-star features, like ""internet"" and ""buffet"" and ""shows"".  They also have ""concierges"" and ""room service"".

We were actually greeted first not by hotel staff, but by one of the discount-ticket booths that try get you into purchasing all sorts of whatnots.  This was bad sign #1.  We then proceeded to the huge check-in line, which managed to stream out to the door.  This was bad sign #2.  It literally seemed like it would be more beneficial to listen to the discount-ticket seller than waiting in that monstrosity.

After eventually getting our room keys and trekking to the proper elevator, we had the pleasure of watching the room service staff at work.  Somebody had left their unfinished meal outside, and the staff was ""cleaning"" it.  This meant moving it from the corridor to a secluded corner where the remnants of who-knows-how-many meals also lay.  The best part was that the leftovers remained there untouched until we checked out the next day!  Mmmm... delicious.  This was bad signs #3 and 4.

Walking around this hotel is a chore in the pyramid.  Each corner only serves certain floors, so if you're unlucky enough to be in the 50% (yes, 5-0) that are on the opposite side of the building from your specific elevator, you're going to be walking a LOT.  After trekkiing to our room, opening the door to our room, we were greeted with a beautiful view of the airport's runways, carpet from the mid-90s, a CRT television (wow!), and an air conditioner that made my old college dorm seem palacial.

The bed was like a cupcake - not something you want to sleep on.  It was just a huge mattress topper, but with little support to speak of.  The bathroom was pretty spartan, so it did actually feel like we were living similarly to the ancient Egyptians.  I guess they can get their 1 star from this.  They offer internet, which was wired from a 25-foot cable set inside your dresser.  Somehow, they have decided to install a router in every room, but neglected to get wireless, or more importantly a digital thermostat.  Your air conditioner is the On-High-Med-Low\/Hot-Cool kind, so if you find yourself alone, late at night, waking up to change your room temperature, fear not.  For you are already at the Luxor.

Needless to say, we didn't feel particularly encouraged to spend time at the casino or the restaurants, so we walked the 1\/2 mile or so to citycenter and spent the rest of the day there.

Even for the low prices, you're getting ripped by their ~20$ resort fee.  The only reason I'd stay at the Luxor is to beef up my mLife account, and then hop over to some of their pricier resorts to get my comps.",2,1,0

Even though they do not have the casino they are dedicated to having nice rooms and all perks that come with places as such. We like some of the other folks who wrote reviews got upgraded to a tower room that was a few bucks more and you got a tub that had the jets in it was to me the only difference in the upgrade alone with a flat panel TV which should be a standard for these places by now. In the hotel world they would be about the Holiday Inn's of the world with a decor that leaves the place dark and dreary. They room was cleaned everyday but it was not consistent on the number of towels and even the last day the bed was not completed 100%. It was like the person went on break and forgot they were not finished with the room.

It's located at the far end of the strip, but is connected by a small tram to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. From Excalibur, you can walk catercorner to the MGM Grand and the monorail to get you to other casinos on the Strip.

You'll probably want to do that since the Luxor is pretty mediocre compared to the other casinos. The room is actually fairly spacious and has the basic amenities: bed, table, bathroom, cabinet with tube TV. The furniture was a little dinged up and the carpet was a bit frayed with a red stain in one area (creating the fun hotel guessing game of Blood or Kool-Aid?). But comfortable enough. I should point out that I had a Pyramid room and I understand some of the Tower rooms are nicer.

The hotel also has the basic shops necessary to run a small village (24 hour convenience store, 24 food place, minor shopping, etc.) as well as a small casino area in the center of the pyramid. It's just that the casino area suffers compared to the gaming floors in other places. There are a few shows (such as Carrot Top) available as well.

I was staying here for the half marathon and for the race it's a nice location. Conveniently located close to the start and finish with a tram from Mandalay Bay. Luxor might be a good choice for the Vegas visitor who's just planning on using the room as a place to stash their stuff while they spend all day on the Strip.

We were up on the 15th floor as all other floors were booked. Our view from the room was great, but we didn't plan on spending much time in the room.

The room was well equipped... 2x comfortable queen beds, clothes storage, safety deposit box, nice bathroom, etc. The rooms are well sound-proofed and air conditioned. Extremely good value for money.

We visited the local Walgrene Pharmacy for all our water, snacks and alcohol needs, as Vegas is very expensive (as expected).

The hotel is well located on the main part of the strip. It's within a 10-15 minute walk of big hotels such as MGM, etc. And cabs on demand out the front of the hotel.

Do not visit the ""Lux Nightclub"". $30 entry and this clearly isn't 'the place to go'... Was empty at midnight and didn't get much busier.",8,2,2

Which seems a while to wait to post a review, but I was talking to a friend about visiting Vegas, and that got me thinking about this place again.  I see that several other reviews reference my major issue, so it must still be a thing.  And if a business has not earned your repeat business, I believe in telling them about it, and they are clearly reading these reviews.

Most of our visit was completely acceptable.  The room was about what we expected, we enjoyed the casino and entertainment at the hotel.  It was easy to visit Mandalay Bay and Excalibur, and the tram was right there as well.  

But we won't be back.  You can thank the time share salespeople.  When we got into the lobby with our bags, they were the first to greet us.  We didn't know any better, so we thought they were there to help.  Just a waste of time.  For the rest of our visit, you couldn't go anywhere on the property without being aggressively annoyed 2-3 times.  Terrible experience, made even worse by the fact that we were paying for the treatment.  Should be a 3-4 star review, bumped down to a two and almost no chance for a return visit.",1,0,0

First when we got to Luxor the check-in line was ridiculous. I swear of everywhere i've stayed in Vegas this has got to have the longest\/slowest lines. After about 45 minutes waiting in line we finally got our room on the very top and we were dissappointed. The room was plain and very uninviting & I didn't dig the slanted wall at all.

I really didn't like the layout or the feel of the casino floor so I didn't end up playing that much there.

Spent some time at the pool and did like that because it was a decent pool and was not crazy busy.

Nobody at the casino was mean or rude to us just didn't like the vibe.

On a high note my friends and I ran into Criss Angel 3 times while there. Once we were in the elevator (inclinator) and I didnt even notice until a friend poked me and said something. The next time was right outside of the elevator and I was going to go ask for an autograph but his bodyguard looked like if I came close he was going to tackle me and he was on his cell phone yelling at someone so I declined to get near him. The last time was once again at the elevator.

I dont hate this place but until their rooms are more inviting and the vibe is better I wont be booking a room there...I might come for a short visit though.",0,0,0

The lighting was very poor, and the electrical sockets were hanging off the wall. The room maids didn't clean my room twice! I mean seriously I left the hotel room at around 10 am. and they come between 11 and 2. WTF?!..On top of that the valet is scary and a joke! They have a policy that states ""If valet if full at any time and you are guest at the Luxor you may still valet your vehicle."" So my roommates go to valet at midnight, the valet was full. The lady named Bonnie came up and asked if we had a room key. We did and we Showed it to her. She then got angry and said that they were full. I mean WTF?!. We then told her again that were guests here and she dismissed us by saying "" OK, just go then leave the car here!"". The manager also didn't give a flying heck and  he dismissed us as well.

When we arrived in their pyramid deluxe rooms, it was extremely dirty and housekeeping was sent up to clean it. When we continued to find other unsanitary issues, front desk was extremely understanding and professional about it. There was no hint of skepticism or indifference that you usually get anywhere else in the customer service industry. They immediately moved us to an upgraded room along with other comps. 

Unfortunately, we got a call on the last day saying we had to move rooms due to other customer issues. Even though it was an inconvenience, they accommodated us with a suite, which was gorgeous, and the manager Juanita personally brought up the keys to our room to prevent anymore inconvenience. 

We also had issues with having to redo room keys a couple times a day even though it was in a solo pocket (so it shouldn't have been demagnetized). Every staff in the hotel we encountered were wonderful (Alex at the front desk, beverage staff, flight bar staff). 

All the issues we had at this hotel are usually deal breakers for us to not return but the way it was handled turned the situation into a wonderful experience and we will be returning to Luxor over other high end hotels that we've stayed at (NYNY, Monte Carlo, SLS, planet Hollywood).

I returned and  I had 2 nice stays 8\/2014, 1\/2015. no more deposits, resort fees remain but its everywhere now no big deal.  They got friendlier staff put all new carpets in hallways and casino cleared up the smoke that burned your eyes. It was the luxor I knew to love all those years ago. But in june I had a comp room got upgraded to a tower room. No upgrade room was falling apart stains everywhere. So you can tell it was a bad room they gave out since it was free. I fell asleep and woke up to a bed bug in the bed  so nasty, went in the other bed and itchy. I took a shower put those clothes in a bag and stayed up till check out. I went to the pool at 11. for an hour looked for a chair all taken people sitting on towels on the concrete since no chairs open. out of 4 pools one open and the west tower pool open with hundreds of empty chairs but you have to pay to use that pool. most idiotic thing I ever heard there was like 8 people in that pool while the thousands stuck out of pool or crammed into one pool in june on a Saturday. who's in charge of this insanity?

I said what's peoples favorites from the drink menu?   he responded with another I don't know!  Like It was another to get a suggestion and it was weird me asking. I picked two drank  and left. terrible service. I then went to have an appetizer and some beers at T&T before I left for my trip to Laughlin. Sat at bar nobody waited on me 25mins the bartender talked to this group doing shots with them and laughing. Myself and this older couple sitting next to me who was there 10mins before me  who never got waited on looked at each other and couldn't believe what was happening. we gave up and left terrible. I vowed I would never stay again. But this January I booked a trip for my mom and I I wanted to surprise her with a Jacuzzi suite and luxor had a deal 15% off and a 20 F&B credit so I took a chance.  Room was terrible door was scratched up, room was falling apart . Room 3080. stains everywhere, tape all on ceiling, carpet is all ripped. Was so embarrassed it's not a Jacuzzi tub it was a oversized bathtub in the room. I could of booked a hotel elsewhere $100 less and just got a bathtub. Big waste of money. I also noticed no voucher given at check in so inquired the concierge and nice woman said I'll get someone to help you. That's when the friendly stopped. Here comes this woman and say's.....""what's your issue? just like that.  I simply and nicely said I was to get a voucher with my reservation gave her my id mlife card and the booking code and page it was from. Looked at it and said so yours your problem here what's your issue? Said it again I didn't receive my 20 F&B credit. Gave me a dirty look rolled her eyes grabbed one off the desk said here and walked away.

Not only are the rooms super super outdated, the customer service is horrible, and I realize that Luxor is pretty far away from the action on the strip. We stayed 1 night and checked out early. Totally disappointed in the hotel.

BTW, we made it known that we were unhappy with our 2 double beds instead of a king bed (and I know we checked in late, but I called 30 minutes earlier and they confirmed I had a king non smoking). No one at the front desk offered us anything! Not an, ""I'm sorry, here's a free pass to the club, here's 10% discount on the room, here's a 10% on the buffet..."" Not a thing!

But, for $36 a night, you get what you pay for, right?  Before the trip, I was reading the reviews for the Luxor and was cringing... we were going for a anniversary celebration trip and looking for a deal on a nice hotel via priceline.com and I was disappointed with the result of my best price negotiation.  

My husband and I were in one of the rooms in the pyramid on the 13th floor and booked it for three nights.  The elevator to our room was close to the entrance, as well to our room.  The elevator is different than most elevators and has some definite wear and tear; plus, given the unique design, it's a different kind of feeling than most.  

Our room was reasonably clean, dated, but clean.  The bathroom had a large shower, but no bath tub which was a bummer.  Since we were planning on spending a reasonable amount of time to relax in the room, this was a bummer-- if you're going with the plan to make your room more like a locker room  in between partying at night and partying during the day, then this probably would be ideal.  The bathroom also had a large sink area and then a separate vanity area in the entry way area (perfect for a group of girls getting ready and having to do make-up and hair, right?).  The plumbing worked for us-- I noticed complaints about it from other yelpers prior to our trip and I was nervous about that for sure!

The beds were like Motel 6 beds.  There was a good sized window with curtains and we had a view of some of the strip and the airport.  It was fine having the drapes open at night but as soon as the sun came up in the morning, it was like being in a solar oven!  to add to it, the air conditioner did not work.  Well, slightly chilled air came out of the vent and you could feel it only when you stood right by it, but if you were more than two feet away, consider it a really weak fan.  This of course would be fine if you were staying there over the winter months; but we were here in July with the high being 110 degrees.  

My biggest gripe would have to be the smoke in the rooms, even the non-smoking rooms.  My theory is that the pyramid funnels the smoke up from the casino on the lower level up to the top of the pyramid.  If you smoke, this probably isn't too much of an issue, I'm assuming, but for the non-smokers, this is horrible!  The room was basically smoky and hot and was far from an escape from the heat.

So, after one night of being a trooper, we decided to check out two days early; not because we were hotel snobs, but because we were looking for something more relaxing, romantic, and well honestly a room with a decent air conditioner and without smoke that left my throat dry and burned my eyes after sleeping on an old bed.  

When we went to check out at the desk, the woman behind the counter noticed that we were leaving two days early, asked us if we understood that we could not be reimbursed for the two days we weren't staying there, and then continued checkout as usual.  I was somewhat surprised that she didn't offer us an upgrade to a better room, some sort of compensation, or even the opportunity to take an online survey or something.  But then again, I saw the other people checking in beside us and if I were her, I probably wouldn't have wanted to make a big deal out of it since we weren't.  

But be aware that we booked the room for 3 nights and stayed only 1 night because we were that dissatisfied with our room.

So, two stars because even though the rooms are smoky, dated, hot, and minimal, they are dirt cheap to be on the strip, even if it is the end of the strip.  I don't know what Priceline.com is thinking when they give it four stars when everyone else gives it less, but maybe there's some sort of business deal worked out.  The hotel is more like a 3 or 2.5 star hotel.",4,1,0

The ancient Egyptian theme is pervasive.  Beyond the pyramid and the sphinx, there are hieroglyphics on the bedspread and the dresser and faux artifacts on the walls.  The elevators shimmy as they go up introducing a lateral sway that is necessary to climb along the edge of a pyramid.  Really in every respect, the theme is present and imposing.  Surprisingly, it didn't feel hokey at all -- in fact, it was all rather enjoyable.  

The room itself had a very large shower stall instead of the usual bathtub which was a considerable improvement.  The perfumed soaps were very nice too.  I loved the view of greater Las Vegas from the hotel room, and the glass was nicely designed to keep out all superfluous light from the outside and not affect the internal room temperature.  

As a casino, I did not have much luck here with me quickly losing a small fortune at both the roulette table and the blackjack table.  Oh well.  The Liquidity bar was just okay, and the champagne brunch they offer on weekends wasn't especially good.  Also, being located on the southern end of the strip, it can be difficult to access some of the other big name casinos.

All in all though, the Luxor worked wonderfully as a hotel, and I would recommend it for that purpose.",3,1,3

I ended up at the Luxor and, despite what a lot of people on the page are saying, it's actually a pretty sweet place.

Yeah, it's showing its age. That happens. It's called aging. I can forgive that kind of stuff when the staff makes up for it - and the Luxor staff treated me like a pampered prince, festooned with gems and rare rubies. 

It was my first time in Vegas, and the woman at the counter was extremely polite while answering my inane questions about the area. Something as simple as that totally made me relax to the max.

The room was a hotel room. Nothing too fancy (considering I paid less than $100 a night) but nothing alarming. My bed was soft and my shower was hot. Dreamy!

I'll agree with everyone else that wifi is sorely needed. The ethernet jack was helpful, but it would have been nice to not have a big cord to step over as I moved around the room. 

In short, it's a well-priced place to stay if you want to rock Vegas and save a few dimes. Will likely stay there again in a few months when I roll back for another conference.

First -- I think the location sucks. The only thing further south on the strip is the Mandalay Bay and there is nothing at this property to keep a person inside the property --- this means lots of walking or cabs. 

When I stayed here in February I was given an automatic upgrade to one of their Tower Deluxe rooms. This had both advantages and disadvantages. I was impressed with the bathroom. It was very large and the seperate tub\/shower was a nice feature. It would have been nice to have used the whirlpool tub, too, but the jets didn't look clean and I wasn't about to risk it. The disadvantage was the distance from everything. The ""towers"" are back behind and off to the side of the Pyramid -- it was a bit of a hike to get back to their elevators (but they did have their own seperate check-out which avoided having to spend any time in the lines at departure.)

The room itsself was... moderate. It reminded me of a Best Western but instead of above bed paintings of some random barn or lake... there were Egyptian decorations. The bed wasn't great and the comforter felt like it was circa 1985 Motel 6 style.

The casino is ""under"" the property which made it a little smokier than some of the others --- I'm a smoker, so it didn't bother me, but I was able to notice the difference in the air if that's saying anything.

Bottom line, if you're looking for a place to crash and not spend lots of time in, and don't mind walking... Luxor isn't a bad choice. Otherwise.. move up the strip a little and get something nicer.",1,0,0

I checked in Saturday about 10pm and was looking forward to a shower and then a great steak. I mean it is Saturday in Vegas, right? 24\/7 right?  Well apparently not at the Luxor! Steakhouse closed at 10 and get this, even room service AND the cafe both close at 2pm!!! Yes PM not AM! Only option was the deli!

My ""suite"" was not very nicely furnished, but it was quite large. The living room couch was not a sleeper and was super cheap. The coffee table was at least a foot taller than the couch so it made watching tv very uncomfortable. The furnishings are very cheap and badly outdated. The elevators are weird. They go sideways because of the pyramid and are very rough, but not alarmingly so. Wifi was not very good

I ate at their steakhouse Tender and was disappointed here also. $137 for an 8oz filet and Main lobster tail. The steak was amazingly tender, but dry and had no flavor. Lobster was stringy and tough, but the potato au grauten was excellent

Staff was very friendly

I found the casino staff to be very friendly and I won a few bucks so no angry loser here. I did not like the selection of slots and video poker. I prefer old school reels .25c & $1 but too many .1c machines and multi line machines. As a gambler I do not like the blackjack here simply because they mostly use the bs continuous shuffler machines and pay 6\/5 for blackjack unless at a $25 or bigger table

Well, low and behold we finally wade through the other group of everyone else who was waiting to check in, and we get to the front desk.  They issue us our room keys and we are off to our spa suite... or so we thought.  The room was already booked to another couple who informed us that the room was filled with mold and they were checking into another room in a bit.  I went downstairs to alert them to the situation and they apologized and upgraded us for free to the premier suite.  Very nice digs, although it was a bit creepy because we laid down for about 45 minutes in between gambling sessions, left for an hour, then returned to change.  upon our return, the messy bed had been folded and chocolates were left on the bed.  But that was the only thing they did...  it was a ghost that offers turn down service.

long story short, the hotel room was great, but the food (with the exception being the room service breakfast) was marginal at best.  The CATHOUSE dining area, Pyramid Cafe`, were all mediocre, and even T&T (Tacos and Taquila) had good food but mediocre service.

Actually, they didn't lose it, they said that we had arrived the day after our reservation date but they were going to ""try to accomodate"" us and find a way to dismiss the 'no arrival charge'. We had double checked that we had booked the correct night before continuing our reservation - the front desk lady said that we needed to recheck our paperwork for the correct date and that ""people make mistakes"". We pulled out our reservation papers and we were correct - their computers were wrong and we were there on the correct date! We didn't owe a fee, but they kept acting like they were really helping us out by not charging us....um, your computers screwed up Luxor! After some typing on her computer, the front desk worker gave us our keys and almost forgot to give us the coupons we were supposed to receive with the package we had booked. She disappeared for a few minutes and came back saying that they were out of the coupons (for 2 for 1 buffets, a $50 credit to their steakhouse, and something else...spa passes?) and that we could just charge everything to our room and they would make sure to credit us back for it. Oh and the catch was that since they didn't give us actual coupons we had to credit them all within our stay. We were there for one night, and it was already 3pm....there was NO WAY we could eat that much in a few hours and use the spa facilities, especially since we were going to a show that night! Plus we figured they would ""forget"" to take the charges off and we'd have who knows what on our bill. No thank you. 

My husband and I got to our room, after walking forever through what looked like a hallway in a basement (talk about realistic pyramid hallways, the ceilings were insanely low) and rode a regular elevator up one floor to another scary hallway. We got into our room (an old one btw) and saw a lovely view of....the valet lol. It was ok though, we weren't there to stare out the window all night. My husband went into the bathroom and came right back out. The maids must have forgotten to clean around the toilet \/ toilet seat b\/c my husband said there was either vomit or poop on the lid.....it's pretty scary when you can't tell the difference lol. I refused to use the toilet in there, yuck. I can understand trying to accomodate us or whatever, IF they were busy, but I think the worker put us in that scary room on purpose b\/c we proved that they were wrong. The lighting in the room was bad, the beds were old and scary, and the check out feature on the tv didn't work. 

I will say though that the bath products smelled really great and I made sure to bring them home with me. That was the plus of the room. We did not use the shower, and every time I had to use the toilet (the little bit we were in the room) I went to use one in the casino.

My husband emailed the Luxor as soon as we got home and they emailed back the next day saying they would have a manager contact us.  We are still waiting to hear from them, and this was in February.

6. West Tower was under remodel construction.

When I think of a hotel room on the Vegas Strip, I think of a place to get a few hours of sleep. It doesn't have to be a big deal because I'm not usually in Vegas for their hotel amenities. They all pretty much offer the same thing, and seem to be comparably priced. We booked a room at The Luxor. We checked in, ate their dried up buffet, then started gambling. While unpacking, we noticed a weird noise and a foul smell coming from the bathroom, but didn't think much of it. We returned to a stronger foul smell, but still didn't think much of it. The smell got progressively worse as the night went on, but I didn't want to wake up at 3 or 4AM to have someone come fix it. Before leaving the room we called the front desk to inform them of the smell, and asked them to send somebody up to fix it. We returned around 8:00PM, and could barely breathe without feeling like we were going to throw up. We called the front desk again to inquire about what could be done to resolve this issue, and were told that somebody came up to snake the drain. No resolution of any kind was offered. It's funny how the drain was snaked, but none of my toiletries were moved. We asked that somebody come in to fix it. 3 hours later a maintenance tech shows up. He confirms that the sink had not been snaked, and in fact was the shower and sink leaking sewage underneath the bathroom tile. The manager we were speaking to at the time said there was nothing that could be done, she's sorry that we were lied to, but because we booked through a third party, could not be compensated for our inconvenience. After a few minutes of our pointless conversation I asked to speak to the hotel manager. She said the same thing. ""The hotel takes no responsibility for any wrong doing when booked through a third party."" I explained to her that I didn't care WHO we paid. We paid for a place to sleep, and didn't get that luxury.  A Casino\/Hotel Manager unable to comp a room??? While we were packing our stuff, changing rooms, and unpacking our stuff just to re-pack it in a few hours the night before we had to leave, the super nice bell person informed us that this happens all the time.

In a word, if you want to use internet in the room, don't stay here. Secondly, it's at the south tip of strip, going to the central is a lot more troublesome than what the map might have suggested you. Thirdly, there are a lot of workers doing ""promotion"" in the casino floor, they will try to lure you with free show tickets, but it will waste a lot of your time. My girlfriend and I call these spams. In the end, don't get fooled by the outlook of the hotel, the inside is a bit old and outdated. I, personally, will never ever stay in this hotel again. It is just a terrible experience staying here.",0,0,0

After we checked in, we took the elevator up to our floor, and it felt like forever walking to our room. It was on the complete other side of the pyramid. Being an older hotel, I wasn't surprised. I was just complaining because I'm pregnant, moody, and I felt like walking this far to my hotel room was ridiculous. Not to mention the ice\/soda machine was close to the elevator as well so walking to get ice was a pain. We walked in & discovered two queen beds not the 1 king bed that we had reserved. The blankets & pillows looked DISGUSTING. The TV's remote was missing, and the internet (not wireless, btw) cost $13 a night. The ethernet cord was so short that we had to drag the coffee table in front of the tv, place my laptop as close as I could to connect it, and to charge my laptop i had to stretch our my charger all the way across the dresser since there was no other outlet close by. The room was pretty big, but it just seemed so dirty. Room service was ridiculous (that was expected) for a nasty breakfast that I could've enjoyed much better at Ihop for $4.99. The valet parking was pretty good service. 

I thought to myself, hmm, we'll probably be lucky and have a good experience. I heard that if you stay at the tower rooms, you'd enjoy it much better since it's more up-to-date. My friend had a better experience than I did, and we went around the same time. We had a room in the pyramid. I totally regret staying at this hotel.",0,0,0

The check-in process takes a really long time even when they have most of the windows operating, but the problem for us when we stayed here this past week was that the A\/C didn't work. Or more precisely, it runs but it doesn't get any cooler than 80. 
 We went to our room, it was warm, so we set the A\/C on high to cool the room quickly. Didn't happen, as the unit blew warm air, even after we return a few hours later to a still hot room. I got on the phone, which put me through a series of recordings, then an operator (hitting the ""front desk"" button on the phone takes you everywhere but there) before speaking to a desk clerk to to tell her that our A\/C wasn't working and we wanted to switch rooms. While I'm sitting on the bed, which is still made up, I look down and see that the sheets and a pillowcase have BIG, deep yellow stains all over them. They are so big and dark that there is no way the staff didn't see them. And I'm wondering, ""what the hell is that?""
The front desk told us to come down, and we told a clerk that the A\/C in the room wasn't working. She gave us an upgrade to a tower room, which had much nicer furniture and clean bedding. HOWEVER, the A\/C didn't work any better at all. We came to the conclusion that they had set the units to a temperature, which seemed to be 80 degrees. We had spent two hours of our trip dealing with the rooms, so we gave up. My husband actually had to pull the chair under the warm vent and slept there because it was cooler than the bed.

The room was very nice.  Nice tiled walls and bathroom, comfortable beds.  
Yes, it is a little ways to the strip, but glad it was on the opposite side of MGM.  Easy to catch the tram to Excalibur and then make your way north. Easy walk to Mandalay also.
I am glad it is located on the southwest end of the strip. Less crowded than the other side and strip area, yet easy to get to if so inclined.

Elevators are kind of strange.  Noisy, probably because of the angle they travel to get you to your room.  Sounds like a wooden rollercoaster. Reminds me of the Wonkavator.

The wi-fi needs to be accessed through a particular browser, but the staff just says its spotty rather than explain it to people, however, since we are IT geeks we figured it out in 5 minutes. The fact they couldn't tell us outright was lame. 

We needed two nights and they were sold out for the next night, however, rather than telling us to check for a cancellation or adding us to a wait list, the front office person offered no options. Also the front office clerks left a screen turned around with another person's personal account information on it. I was close enough to read the whole screen and could have taken a photo if I was criminally minded (thankfully, I am not) Interestingly there was a floor manager right behind the counter. I directly asked him if they always left personal details for other too see and he spun the screen back around but did not offer an apology or anything to reassure me my credit details would any safer.

Buffet was yucky - dry steak overcooked, mushy sushi rolls (cucumber roll only), some other fare not worth remembering.

About the only advisement I can give people is to upgrade your room as much as you an afford because the regular deluxe rooms are beat up and worn.

The facility has need of a lot of fixing and upgrading but you won't find that being done.  Carpets where you find them are skanky and feel tacky. The shape of the building is why you are probably there to say you stayed.  The next door neighbor, Mandalay Bay, unless you really get into the new tower and upgrade will disappoint you as well.

Food?  Even the best dining experience will be like eating portions served from the Buffet line with extra spices laced with better grade of brandy in the sauces.

What makes me such an expert?  I have been escorting Asian gamblers to Las Vegas for years.  I started by accident back when the Mint was still operating.  Yes.  That's a long time.  I have stayed in some of the best hotels and got to know what is what.  I have slowed down my visits to escort whales because I do have a regular professional career that I went 7 years of university studies to be outstanding in. 

What I have noticed recently is the downward spiral of Las Vegas grandeur.  The service, facilities, the glamour is gone.  I went to Singapore and Macau and they have it.  I want the Las Vegas of 20 years ago back!

We should all demand that management get their acts together because the choices how we spend our money for gaming, rooms and entertainment are votes whether they are successful or not.

Just my humble opinion.

If that is you, take some time to read what I have to say. First of all, the Luxor is located at the beginning of the strip so you're going to be far away from everything. At first, I thought walking everywhere would be just fine until I started doing it for three days in a row. In 100+ degree weather and going in and out of hotels with air conditioning, it was a pain to walk the strip without driving. 

Second, the hotel is a bit outdated and very small. The elevators were so old, it was like riding a roller coaster up to our room with a ton of noise. Some times the elevator would malfunction and stop at every floor level before it reached your destination. I wasn't sure if it was a ghost or it's just super old but it happened too frequently and wasted a lot of our time because of that.

And lastly, our room was a bit small for two beds. Not much room to move around but if you are trying to cram more than two people, it does get a bit tight. I guess you can say that was on our part but I believe two people would be just fine. The shower was great but the toilet is a bit uncomfortable for me because the water level was too high if you know what I mean. Also, our room did not include a fridge at all. And for the ice vendors? It was literally across the other side of the hotel from us and took about two minutes just to get to it.

Overall, there isn't anything fancy about this place at all. It is definitely just a spot to crash after you have been partying down the strip. Once again, it is a far distance if you decide not to drive or taxi it. It's a great place with affordable prices and with your simple food court of McDonalds and sub sandwiches. If you're on a budget like I was, this would be the place. If you're looking to have the best time of your life, even inside your own hotel and room, looks elsewhere.",5,1,1

As I move the banana over, The banana was apparently holding down on the buttons of bets from the previous person...

I had a fine time.  The room was updated and clean.  The hotel was nice, the spa was great and the pool was fun.
I really do not know what people are complaining about.  There was nothing that was really that run down or dirty.
My only real complaint was the very thin walls!  Our neighbor brought a young lady home...that woke me up!  Oh well,he is on vacation and deserves a little fun.  But the 6 hour fight afterwards, kinda sucked.
We called security twice and they came up to confront him in a timely manner.  So that was good.

I have stayed here years ago and the rooms were decent for their prices. Now, it seems it's run down in some rooms still. My parents stayed in the 'Pyramid Deluxe' room and they said it was not deluxe at all! It was old and run down. Haha...This was the cheapest of their rooms. 

We originally reserved for the 'Pyramids Deluxe' rooms for the price too since I was saving mula but we were offered a $10 upgrade a day for the next updated room (Celo Pyramid) which they say have been updated recently. Why not?! I didn't want to stay in an old room. Great offer by Grace!! Good customer service and nice room offered indeed. I am glad we were offered the upgrade but I felt bad for my parents who did not. I can only rate based on my experience though. 

The king bed we had was nice. The bathroom was very nice and spacious! The closest was outside, unique but I thought it was a better design. The bed pillows fluffy. I just wish the blanket was a little thicker. Heater and AC worked. There was a nice size TV and table and chair to use. Our view of Mandalay Bay and Delano hotel was nice but the windows were so DIRTY!! I could not even take a decent picture outside! Humph.... They need to clean this asap!! It's very ugly to look at from outside as well.

The wifi worked well in the room. That was a bonus!! What I didn't like was that our room was far from the elevator. Since there was only one elevator for each floor, the pyramid has four corners so we had a ways to walk. What was weird too was the elevator moves sideways which makes me a little dizzy. Room service was quick (10 mins) when I ask for another pillow. They gave two! They only have three pillows for a king bed and I didn't want to share my pillows with my hubby! ;-)

We came to Vegas around the same time last year and their was many construction within this hotel. It is so much better now; more shops and restaurants. Can't rate the pool as it was pretty cool outside this time of year.

The hotel is south of the strip but close to the airport It's easier to be in the middle of the strip but they do have a tram to use. All in all experience has been good! I would stay here again. Totally recommend this hotel for decent prices and as long as you get the better rooms.  [36\/100]",29,14,21

First impression set the tone.  Arrived at the long check-in desk with multiple stations.  Some had signs that read ""closed"" and others read ""check in.""  We walked up to a clerk under a ""check in"" sign who said, ""I'm closed.  Please wait until someone calls you."" Asked concierge about steakhouses and he offered no insights other than the Luxor's own steakhouse. He did pull up a list of steakhouses online though.  Something I could never possibly have done myself...

Pool closes at 8pm?  I've stayed at Motel 6's where the pools stay open until 10:00.  We were looking forward to a twilight swim.  It's still 95 degrees at twilight in Vegas in August.  And the pool's closing? What's this additional resort fee for?  The cost of the extra staff needed to kick everyone out of the pool early?  Is this normal for this town so we'll all go into the casino and eat and drink and gamble more...?

We got off to a bad start right away at check-in when they told me the King room I had booked wasn't available and the only thing left was a Queen.  The negatives steadily accumulated from there on.  Before we began to unpack, I saw that the lighted make-up mirror was dangling from the bathroom wall.  When I touched it, there were sparks and the GFCI breaker blew.  I asked to be switched to another room and was told that there wasn't another vacant room in the entire hotel (right) so I would have to settle for a repair.  Guy came and removed the mirror.  Nice repair!  The hair dryer didn't work.  There was no bath mat and the floors were super slippery when wet.  We had to call housekeeping for suitcase racks.  There were only two bath towels.  No coffee in the room (come on, even the cheapest motel has some sort of coffee service), The beds were so squishy you felt like you might smother if you rolled over in your sleep.

After checking in, we lugged all our suitcases and bags all the way through the Luxor, up the elevator and then nearly all the way around the pyramid only to find out that our assigned room already belonged to someone. There were clothes strewn about the room and everything! Major fail!

However, upon learning about their error, the hotel staff upgraded us to a suite without further question. The suite was great. We had a jacuzzi tub in our room and an extra living room, which gave us the much needed space to spread out our stuff. The room was clean and comfortable and even had a mini fridge.

One downside we quickly found about staying at the Luxor is the elevator system. Elevators are located at each of the points of the pyramid base but only go to a specific group of floors, often leading to a lot of extra walking. The elevators are also shaky, not sure if this is caused by age of the angle that the elevators travel at as it climbs the side of the pyramid.

The location at the end of The Strip also makes it difficult to get around. Next time I'll prefer to stay somewhere more central. But at least now I can say that I've satisfied my 10-year-old curiosity of what it would be like to stay in the giant pyramid.",0,0,0

Once we settled into our room we started noticing the little things. The Jacuzzi is uncomfortable and very out dated, there was clear water damage that happened in the room. We could see a line on the lower part of the wall that signalled water damage. To get into our room we had to shimmy the door handle to make it open after putting the card in.

 Ich musste anlässlich einer Messe nach Las Vegas. So bin ich hier gelandet, viel Zeit hatte ich nicht (ca. 24Std.) , außerdem hatte ich einen ausgeprägten Jetlag.


 Okay, i can't get no sleep... Was also tun?


 Natürlich zocken!


 Ich hatte eine aussergewöhnlich intensive Glückssträhne. Beim Roulette.


 Das Ende vom Lied war, dass dann doch die Zeit knapp wurde und ich meine gewonnenen Chips in bares tauschen musste...


 Und ganz offen, es war eine beachtliche Summe aus meinem Einsatz von 500 USD geworden!


 Zwischendurch wurde ich vom Hotel Management noch gefragt, ob ich dem ""Club""? beitreten möchte. Meine Spielzeiten und Gewinne wurden dann aufgezeichnet, dafür bekam ich aber mein Zimmer stark ermässigt!


 Gesagt getan, meine über 100qm Suite hatte so dann nicht mal mehr 100USD gekostet!


 Das Zimmer war übrigens fantastisch, mit einer riesen Whirlwanne direkt am abgeschrägten Fenster, mit Blick auf den stripe. Wow! Leider hatte ich das Zimmer im Prinzip nicht genutzt. Weil ich tagsüber zur Messe musste und nachts im Hotelcasino verbracht hatte.


 Den Sack mit dem gewonnen Geld musste ich auf meine Kollegen aufteilen, weil die Summe das Ausfuhrlimit ,pro Person, weit überstieg.


 Von den vielen Restaurants hatte ich leider nicht sehr viel mitbekommen.
Viel Pommes und Junkfood. Hat alles eher an typische Freizeitpark- Themen -Küche erinnert...


 Und ehe ich mich versah, war ich auch schon wieder am Flughafen, auf dem Weg nachhause...


 Dort hatte ich noch kurz, mit einen einarmigen Banditen, richtig Freude. Der spuckte nämlich auch Eimerweise Gewinn-Münzen aus. Die Umtausch Aktion dauerte dann so lange, dass ich fast meinen Flug verpasst hätte.

For a business trip, the room was reasonably priced, the A\/C worked well, and the bed was comfortable. There is a tram you can take to Excalibur and then walk to the MGM Grand to catch the monorail to the convention center, so traveling around from the Luxor was not too difficult. If I was visiting Vegas however on a trip for pleasure, I would recommend staying somewhere a little nicer. The pool was very crowded and our bathroom shower wasn't cleaned well.  The lines for the Starbucks were always huge, and I felt the customer service from hotel staff could have been better. It took an hour for us to get through the check-in line when we arrived. There were good options of restaurants (Mexican, sushi, American) and they were reasonably priced, but the food was mediocre. We didn't spend that much time in the hotel, so it wasn't a problem, but if you are going to be spending more time in the hotel, pay a little more and book a nicer place.",0,0,0

I was skeptical because of the Yelp reviews and normally I stay further down the strip but this trip I needed to be closer for an event at Excalibur. 

From the very beginning at check in Luxor was great! My check in experience was just fine, I asked where the gym + pools were located and the front desk gal showed me on the key card map. 

I agree the rooms do need updating (tapestry, bedding\/furniture) but it's not a deal breaker. Bed is comfy and housekeeping peeps would say ""good morning and hello"" when passing by. (To me that's a extra nice gesture!) Bathrooms are cool and clean. Our room was in the pyramid and in back of the Sphinx, so it was neat to look out and see that! You will do some walking due to the pyramid elevators being only at one location on your floor so keep that in mind if you're traveling with children that hate walking! (I didn't mind I need the extra steps!) Luxor connects to Excalibur and has a free tram with Mandalay. 

Heads up: There is a resort fee so keep that in mind when booking. (Wi-fi and gym, pool)
I checked out the gym and it's pretty cool. Must wear shoes in there too no flip flops! 
My favorite part of Luxor is the pools! Wow I really like the vibe out there! It's hot it's Vegas cool off at the Luxor pools! If you want a spot on the chairs you gotta wake up early! There is also a paid pool area and if you are interested in renting cabanas that's available as well. I wasn't too keen on the shows, last time I saw Jabbawockeez here but they have since moved to their new show to MGM. Not interested in the current ones, so if there was something I was interested in I would definitely pay the money to watch while staying here! 
(That's a minus star for show, ok bites+ outdated room decor\/tapestries) 

If you live Starbucks I believe there are 2 here! Convenient if you need that daily coffee and want to get work done without being in your room, I did just that! Keep in mind they are Vegas prices. I needed an extra key and the front desk is divided into various services which is really convenient. A manager approached me asking what type of assistance I needed, and told me I was in the correct line and to have my ID ready to speed up the process. That was perfect and her tip was spot on. My party wasn't too keen on the eating establishments offered here, so we ate elsewhere but it wasn't a big deal. Checking out was a breeze there are so many options: front desk express lane, TV checkout, calling front desk, drop card by elevators or email checkout. 

One of the closest hotels to the airport soon it was a breeze to take transportation straight to Mccarran!  

All in all my family and I enjoyed our experience at Luxor!",4,0,2

We booked a stay at Luxor just for a night and as I stayed at the Luxor as a kid, I thought it would be nostalgic to stay there again. Not so much. The atmosphere has really changed in there to being focused on the casino and shows part rather than customer service and the Luxor theme and that little thing called CLEANLINESS!!
Anyways, I'll go on to list the pros? And cons. 

I'll start with the cons:
1. The smell. I think they're trying to cover over the cigarette smoke, but holy moly it was stinky!!! It smelled like they were pumping air freshener through the AC system. It was so strong it was truly overwhelming. I would discourage anyone with smell allergies to go in there. 
2. The smell of the room.  It smelled moldy. Which i actually preferred over the casino part. 
3. Dusty. Our room had clearly not been cleaned recently before we made it in there.there was dust on the ice bucket, lamps,telephone and clock. Definitely started sneezing. 
4. It was so run down. There were walls peeling, cracks, worn out wallpaper and sink area. 
5. Brownish Stains on the sheet. Need I say more?
6. Walls are paper thin. We could totally hear the whole conversation of the people next door and even could hear the people upstairs going pee. Wow. Disgusting.

Pros: hmmm. Well I'd say the only pro was that there's a Starbucks inside making it easy to get coffee in the morning. Of course it's way more expensive than one outside the hotel. 

In summary, we were so happy to get the heck out of there. And shower after. I wouldn't recommend this hotel nor would I ever stay there again. I will always have my memories of what it used to be like but I guess quality gets overlooked here. Well, even basic hotel upkeep and guest services get overlooked.",9,2,0

We stayed for 3 nights and all in all I would come back again, but with so many different options, I would to try something else. My 2 friends in the other room had a big issue. For every night of the 3 night stay, the fire alarm went off around 4 in the morning. It would drive me nuts but my 2 friends kinda took it in stride.

This was my first time in Vegas and I was shocked at how expensive the necessities were in the hotel shops. A big bottle of water was 4 bucks and a 2.5 ounce of edge shaving cream was 5 BUCKS! I will let you in on a little secret. For the water, you can get like a 8 OZ bottle for free in the fitness center (which we did use on the 2nd day and it was VERY nice). You do need to sign in but they don't really check. (Also the tap water tasted like rusty old pipes.)

A regular bottle of beer was like $7 but if you play poker, you can get it for free (but you should really tip the waitress $1)

Also if you have to get a non alcoholic drink go with a drink at Starbucks which is everywhere. While everything else seemed to have tripled in prices, the drinks at Starbucks weren't that much higher than normal (that's probably bc the normal prices were high to begin with LOL)

Also unlike New Jersey's AC, parking was pretty much free everywhere so for me that was a pleasant surprise because we did have a rental.

Lastly the WIFI sucks. You get like a small amount for free and can get more for a price. WTH is that?!?!?",0,0,0

The hotel actually is quite outdated, with many rooms (stayed in three rooms) that have old (but clean) bathrooms. When checking in, thats not unusual in Vegas, most of the times there are long rows with people waiting to check in. Except the rows check in service is quick, the staff is not really friendly, they provide you the basics. 

Half our stay we had a day of thunderstorms and rain. Never seen such a storm in Vegas, but the windows of our hotel room (tower room) started to leak. We instantly got a new room, but I was actually quite surprised water was flowing inside, how can that happen in such a big hotel! 

Another positive point is that we had to leave earlier than planned, and got a restitution for the canceled days. The hotel provided good service there.

The casino is not really spectacular, I like the MGM and Aria more as a place to stay. The buffet is ok, not excellent. The bars are also ok, not excellent.

The room we stayed in did not have a fridge and the lighting was terrible. The mattresses seemed to slope slightly, which did a number on my shoulders. I didn't stay in the room for that long, but I was expecting more amenities for the price. If you're bringing kids, STAY AWAY.

Also there are lots and lots of huge Carrot Top posters...reason enough to look somewhere else...",0,0,0

No WIFI but wire connection was fast. Staff (especially Aliesha on the check in desk) were friendly and anxious to help.  Major downer...the pool.  NO SHADE (it was 112 degrees when we were there over the 4th July wkend) and they charge $40 for an umbrella, $70 for an umbrella on a chair, and $300 - $400 for a cabana.  How do they get away with charging for shade?? I saw so many families with young children circling for shade and finally having a quick dip and leaving.  And the LOUD hip hop music was terrible.  There were few 20 somethings around the pool...mostly families and 30 plus people so I can only assume the DJs were playing for themselves.  Not relaxing. I've had skin cancer and I pulled a chair under the shaded corridor to the bathrooms...yuck...but I had no choice. Also, the chairs were very dirty with caked on filth. Titanic Exhibition was amazing!! Well worth the $...and coupons for $5 off were everywhere.  Be sure to try the Deli...Brad cooks up a storm in there.

Now it's gross and poorly maintained. When we checked in we made sure we got a newly renovated Cleo two queen room. Our room was located on the 23rd floor room 23026. After we checked in we looked at the room and noticed that the drapes we hangin in the corners on both side. We called the desk to tell them about the drapes and no body ever came to check them out. There were only 3 towel in the bath room so we requested more in the same call about the drapes the towel came up 20 to 30 min later. They never came to fix the drapes so the did black out any sun what so ever. We showered and left for the night to go dine at a restaurant in the Excalibur it was all served family style. We walked the strip only for my companion to start feeling sick at first we thought it was the food but four of us ate and only one got sick. She started vomiting and had diarrhea and could not even get out of bed she was so sick poor thing couldn't leave the Luxor for the whole next day. She later contacted her doctor at kaiser who informed her she had the stomach flu. To quote the dr. It only come from contaminated surfaces such as bedding, door knobs and other unsanitary surfaces. If you value you health spend a little more for a better hotel. The Luxor is a cesspool for bacteria.

The breakdown of my trip:
I stayed in the a Tower Luxury Suite in the East Tower. It was nice and worth the extra $$$. Why go to Vegas and stay in a room that reminds you of your bedroom? Bathroom was large. But I have seen the Tower Premier Suites and yes they are bigger, but they are also more $$$. Jet tub and big shower.

The Tower Luxury Suite looks just like it does on the website, minus the flowers. There was no Flatscreen, but that didn't bother me since I didn't spend that much time in my room anyway. The room comes with a fridge and a nice sitting area. That fridge came in handy.  The carpet was clean. The fridge was clean. The bathroom was kept clean during my entire visit. 

All in all, I don't see why people are talking bad about this place. I mean yeah, the MGM grand has more amenities, but the prices are high, the service is bad and the rooms are not as clean as they should be. I guess people downplay the Luxor because its been there for a while and people don't think its hot enough...Whatever I thought it was great.",1,0,1

I must admit I was more than a little hesitant based on the many Yelp reviews I read prior to my trip to Las Vegas.  However, after my weekend stay I can safely recommend the Luxor.  

The Luxor is an iconic Hotel located on the Strip.  The hotel is designed in an Egyptian theme and the hotel is shaped in the form of a Pyramid.  (Anyone that has seen the Las Vegas Strip has seen the Luxor) The hotel has a night club- LAX and several restaurants.  The hotel is also home to some pretty decent shows-Carrot Top and  Criss Angel to name two.

I arrived in Las Vegas at about 7:00 a.m. and check-in is at 11:00 a.m.  So, I checked my bags at the Bell desk and explored the Strip until check-in time.  After a few hours of exploration and a early lunch at Gordon Ramsey's Burgr, I arrived back at the Luxor and checked-in.  The check-in was quick and easy.  (The hotel made sure to collect the Resort Fees of course)

The room was large and clean with all the basic amenities you would expect-flat screen tv, iron, desk etc.  I just don't get the ""bad rap"" this hotel receives from Yelpers.  Maybe I need to stay at a four or five star hotel just see the difference.  But, from my stay at the Luxor it has everything I would expect a hotel on the Strip to have. 

Maybe the only negative was the Timeshare people with their aggressive sales tactics.

I would definitely stay at the Luxor again.",4,0,1

Although my boss booked a room with 2 beds, since my coworker and I were sharing a room, they assigned us to a room with 1 bed.  When we called the desk to complain they said we could come back to the front desk and they would reassign us.  They had put us at the very last room on the 6th floor in the pyramid, and it was a very long walk back to the front desk.  We discussed it for a minute and decided we could live with one bed, and proceeded to unpack and settle in.  Not 10 min. later SOMEONE ELSE ENTERED THE ROOM WITH A KEY CARD!  We were shocked!  They reassigned our room even though we had not returned to the front desk.  Just where did they think we were?  This couple was there for the same trade show.  It was awkward but we decided to pack up and move after the front desk agreed to send a bellman with a cart and our new room keys.  It took about 15 min. so we had to wait in the hall until he arrived.  We had hoped for a closer room, but no, now they put us at the next to the last room on the 9th floor.  Err.

The good news is our room was nice and it was so much better having our own beds.  However, we missed a short reception before dinner with all the moving and unpacking.  The room was fairly large with a room safe (I like these) and large 2-sink bathroom.  The shower was large but the shower head was terrible.  Think being hit in the face by a fire hose while showering.  Beds were quite comfortable.  

I really don't care for this hotel.  The elevators travel on an angel to accommodate the slanted pyramid and they don't feel safe at all.  Stone cold sober you feel like you've had too much to drink, and you'd better be leaning against the wall or hanging on or you might lose your balance.  Walking to and from the room was a really long hike, and looking from the lobby up gave the impression that the higher floors were on an impossible angle.

But, I actually had a nice hotel room at the East Tower 5th floor with a kingsize bed.  It was very quiet at night and our room was always made before we got back in the afternoon.  So, our hotel room was actually great and we slept very well each night.  We did tip the maid each day $3. and our room was well stocked and made. 

I can say that even though there were so many people at the hotel, it was not as crazy or crowded with people like the bigger hotels such as the Bellegio, Harrah's, Ceasar's, MGM....those hotels were too maddenly and too much people.

The elevators needed your room key to access your floor, which I feel is good minium security.  1 elevator at the end wouldn't accept our room key, so when that one opened, we just waited for another elevator.

Walking through Luxor is such a maze and constantly getting lost the 1st couple of days, but after our 3 day, we figured it out, but was leaving to go back home.

they charge a resort fee of $12.95 for you to have internet access, free newspaper, access to gym, and something else.   This fee is mandatory and you get it added on to your bill.  Quite a lot of the hotels charge this.    I just heard on the TV news that Treasure Island plans to eliminate this fee.  I think this is high, but many hotels, car rentals, charge some extra fee.

Luxor does offer to print complimentry airplane check in boarding pass for you.  I went downstairs to the business room and they told me this.  This business room is separate from Luxor and privately owned.

If you want some great pictures go to the tram where it takes you to the Manalay and Excalibur.  You can see the front of the hotel and it's quite impressive.  

There was an incident with my party and the hotel staff manager was very nice and helpful.  He made it a point to see that the rest of our stay was an enjoyable one.

So, my experience at the hotel was positive and the room and staff were good.     This is not a high end hotel, but in the middle and we found everything to be good.  

It seems that people either have very high high expectations or they don't want to spend $$$ to stay at the Wynn, Bellegio, etc. yet want that experience.  Luxor is not high end, but they are decent middle of the road hotel.  I found the accomodations and everything else satisfactory.

If you want to avoid walking on LV Blvd.  You can walk through to the Excalibur and walk through New York New York .  From there you can get to the MGM hotel.  Or you can go out and walk a block into Monte Carlo, take a tram to City Center and  Belligio.

The self parking lot spaces were sufficient, but parking was always full and hard to find.  It makes not not want to go out alot bc you will have a tough time finding a parking space......at least in the covered parking lot.  I didn't want to go to the roof level, so maybe there's more parking there.

I would recommend the Luxor hotel.",2,0,0

No issues with the room, or room service at all. Maid did not touch our luggage or personal belongings. She made the bed and cleaned the tub and left. She also left us extra towels and toiletries without us even asking. 

The service at the front desk was OK. no issues but nothing to brag about either. Very nice.

The restaurants were good. We ate at tacos and tequila and it was very Delicious. We also ate at the buffet and the pyramid cafe. Both were about average. Nothing extravagant. Very fairly priced. We did eat at TENDER as well. A+ best steak Ive ever had, and sides were Delicious. For two of us to eat it was $200, but worth the price.

The last day of our visit we got a massage at the Nuture Spa and Salon. The lady who worked the front counter was rude. She was not nice and did not make you feel welcome. Once back in the spa it was beautiful. The lady at that desk was so nice and very helpful!! She makes you feel very welcome. My massage was awesome. After I explored.

Just the theme and decorations are really neat to me. The granite and marble is crisp and cool (especially in the summer time). But this place has definitely changed over the years. There is no longer an arcade on the atrium level - but now there's a connection to Mandalay Bay which is nice. 

Our first room was in the pyramid on the fifth floor. Talk about not having a view or the experience of using one of the diagonal elevators - I was disappointed to say the least. And then, after unpacking everything, we discovered that the heater was broken. Now I know that usually people wouldn't need to use a heater in Las Vegas, but it was December and our room was pretty dang cold. (I mean it was snowing on the freeway on the drive there!) 

So, after packing everything up, we went to the front desk and they upgraded us to a west tower room. It was quite a hike to get to the elevators, and when we got in the room, the first thing we checked was the heater. It didn't really work there either, but at least it turned on and wasn't broken. The hot water in the shower, tub and sink also took about 5 minutes to actually get hot. And during our 3 night stay, our toiletries (you know, the little shampoo and stuff) were never replaced, even though I'm sure the maid saw the empty bottles sitting there.

Overall, you'll get what you pay for if you stay at the Luxor, It's one of the cheaper places on the strip.This place has definitely gone down in quality over the years - especially compared to the newer hotels. So if you're looking for a good cheap place to stay without a lot of flair, this would be it.

Next day, moved room to the 20th floor  for the kind bed, which came with a view of I-15 and the mountains beyond.

Overall, have to agree that this place is not posh as it once was. Lots of wear and tear - scuff marks on doors from kicks, wallpaper peeling off at various corners, thin walls between rooms, and stains on windows - to name a few. But, the price is low and if the plan is to spend time outside the hotel room, then it is likely a good deal. BTW, the elevator (incinator) system is quirky in that elevators located in different parts of the building serve different floors. Also, the start and stop of the inclinators give a feeling of instability, which can be lead of a feeling of off-balance.

Neighboring Mandalay Bay is much nicer inside and more inviting. So, we did eating and dancing there including nice buffet and good live-music.

In summary, the Luxor looks really cool from outside and a distance, but novelty wears off once you are inside and notice the wear and tear. But as a low-price base for on-strip activities, it meets the standard.",0,0,0

Got some great rates in the past $60-80 a night online with some coupons for the spa, dining and IMAX show.  
Love the decor of being in Egypt.
King Tut museum wasn't impressive, but free.
I remember when they did the barge tour inside the pyramid and that 
was weak too.  They closed that one.
IMAX ride, In Search of the Obelisk was weak too, there are other movies. $12.  Like to location of being near Mandalay Bay and the tram to it.

Pool is nice, four of them.  One has these huge huge columns with 
water spewing from them.  I seem to go when at least one pool is 
under construction.

Luxor is a two because of the following reasons:

Staying at the Luxor for 7 days. First time in Vegas, and I have to say I was expecting more for the money.

Pros: 
Spacious washroom with both shower and soaker tub.
Clean
Plenty of closet space

Cons: 
""Upgraded"" from Pyramid room to a room on the third floor of the East Tower - roof level with a lovely view of the roof, air intake units (complete with constant humming), and the side of the pyriamid. Would have been nice to see a tree, plant, or even sunshine.
Looonnnnnggggg ethernet cable behind the television stretches across the room and almost reaches the desk. Tripped over  the cable several times. No wireless internet
Room service dishes sat in the hallway two days before being picked up from the room next door - I don't get the impression they are service oriented.
A maze of hallways and elevators to manouver through to get to the room.
Smoking in the casino common areas - smell like smoke at the end of every day

The line at the check-in desk was long but understandable given the event, so I wasn't bothered by that. Once I got to the front desk and checked in, the woman who checked me in was friendly and professional. She explained that I would be given room 53XX and she gave me my room-keys, but she also explained that it would be about an hour until my room would be ready, and that I would receive a text message once my room was available. No big deal - I left my bags with the bell desk and went to the bar to kill some time. After waiting ~90 minutes at the bar I went back to the registration desk to inquire about my room, and I was assured again that it was almost ready and to please wait for the text message confirming. I left the Luxor, walked around the Strip, had some dinner, met up with friends, etc., and yet 3+ hours later I still hadn't received a text confirming my room was ready. I next went to the Info desk and was assisted by Stacey. She was apparently just beginning her shift and stood there for over a minute while I waited as she texted on her phone and joked with a co-worker. Eventually she noticed me, and I explained how long I'd been waiting and how desperate I was becoming for a shower and change of clothes. Stacey explained that my original room was still dirty from the previous guest, and she made a big show of ""pulling some strings"" and announced that she was going to place me into a ""better"" room that was available immediately. She handed me my new room-keys and I gratefully headed off for the elevator. However, as I walked I glanced at my ""new"" room info and keys and saw they were for room 53XX, the exact same room I was originally assigned. Now frustrated and angry, I returned to Stacey's counter and asked her explicitly why she'd lied about giving me an ""upgraded room for my troubles"" only to give me the same room I'd originally been assigned. She played dumb and claimed that it was purely a coincidence, that she'd selected that room number just by random chance, etc. Needless to say, I was beyond frustrated.

We were in the East Tower and our room was perfect!  King Deluxe with oversized tub and large shower.

Upon check in we also got a discount book with coupons and a $20 voucher to some Luxor restaurants.

* We liked the tram that cut off some of the long trek up the strip.  It runs til 12:30AM.  Nicely air conditioned which is very helpful in 120 degree heat.

* Pool - not overly crowded and we were able to get chairs no problem.  But, they do also offer a VIP pool where you pay $10-15\/day for entry.  And then they have cabanas and other features as well.  I was bummed that there weren't any slides or fun features...
What they should tell you... you can not bring any outside alcohol to the pool area.  I didn't think that would include my 48oz pina colada boot that I bought inside Luxor!?!

The check in area is NOT confusing at all. As far as the elevators in the pyramid go, they are shaky because they are older. The elevators are in fine working condition, if they weren't then they wouldn't be using them. 

The staff was very friendly to us and were very helpful. The maids were pleasant and did a great job of cleaning our room. The beds were comfortable, pillows were amazing, and the bathroom was nice. 

As far as the casino, it's not one of the largest but it's still nice. There are plenty of slots, there's a high limit area, and there are plenty of tables. The property has two Starbucks which was very convenient.

Tired of seeing my Vegas reviews? Yea, I know. I live in Orange County but I have been to Vegas like about 5-6 times in 2011 and at the time of writing this review have already booking my first Vegas trip of 2012. But I am getting a head of myself...

This is my very first stay at Luxor and I mainly picked this hotel for the price. I usually get a pretty good discount whenever I stay in Vegas because I come here so frequently, but I think I got an awesome deal considering our trip was Friday to Monday over New Years weekend.

When booking the hotel, I made it a point to stay in the East Tower mainly because the Tower was built after the main pyramid which means its newer. Checked in without any problems and when I got to the room, I noticed that it had the same basic layout and furniture as in the Tower Rooms at MGM Grand. The only thing that was missing from the room which I was kinda bummed about was they didn't have an in-room safe. The only means for locking up personal items is to secure the items at the front desk. Housekeeping was great, respected the Do Not Disturb sign when up, and still cleaned the room after heading out for the day fairly late. Visited a couple of the restaurants and lounges at the hotel and was pleasantly surprised.

I think Luxor is a pretty decent Hotel especially if you look at your room more like a place to crash than to be pamper. I think you can definitely get away with an inexpensive Vegas trip by staying here and you get a lot of value for your money. If you are looking for something really nice or are use to the 5 star rooms, then you might want to pass. Overall, I enjoyed my trip and the value to price ratio definitely places Luxor in the list of hotels to consider when doing Vegas on the cheap. 3 stars!",2,1,1

The service as just as lackluster. The line to check in was ridiculously long. Luckily, we were able to use mobile check-in so we skipped the line. The service was awful, too. We had a question about the bill and the bell desk guy sent us to the concierge. We knew that was wrong, but he insisted. Of course, the concierge sent us back to the bell desk. Someone there finally directed us to the checkout line, which wasn't as long as the check-in line. Lastly, someone came to our room at 10 a.m. to unlock the safe that a previous guest had locked. I asked if they had left anything in the safe and the serviceman said no. I told him to come back later. Checkout is at 11 a.m., so there was no reason he could not have waited do this between the hours of 11a-3p when they're getting the rooms ready.

I am bummed that they only include wired internet, not wireless or Wi-Fi.
They gave us a paper notice last night saying they need to shut off the water from 3am-7am for water piping maintenance. Just like home.. Then the water was NEVER turned back on. At 11am, I still haven't gotten the chance to shower and the toilet was filled with piss we couldn't flush!! When I called, all they said was ""sorry, we don't know why the water won't turn back on for the east tower and we don't know how long this will take.. we can move you to another room. "" So fine, I said ok to the room transfer... But had to wait on hold for more than 20 minutes for another rep to ask me why I was calling and then finally say they'll move me. WTF?? Waited another 15 mins for a bellhop to come help us with moving the luggage (note I had to ask, they did not offer help). Second room was in the pyramid. The moment from entering this room, it was so stuffy like no air had been running for a while in this room. So I left the door propped open to air it out. The bathroom was smaller and even older looking. The shower had one tiny ledge to put your toiletries.. when I requested extra towels and pillows, they delivered extra towels twice and I had to remind them about the pillows.. seriously?
Later around 430p a security guard came around and said we couldn't have the door opened. Well, excuse me, have me suffer then!

I then went to the front desk afterwards because I couldn't bare it any longer. Thankfully I was changed to a room in the east tower which the rooms there seem to be more updated and nicer. Although the room was nice and my allergies were non existent, I had lost one night of sleep due to a domestic disturbance next to my room. Apparently some guy was beating on his girlfriend.

Constant updating keeps people interested, and more importantly, keeps a casino relevant.  There are timeless casinos that seem to age better than others, whether it's for an incredible amount of investment to keep them feeling fresh paired with a classic style, or a hefty dose of nostalgia that keeps people coming back to relive their greatest Vegas experiences.
 
The Luxor, as one of the grand casinos introduced during a 1990s boom in themed casinos, has neither of these.  It's a grand casino for sure - with multiple towers, a large gambling floor, and an assortment of shops alongside the fairly standard casino show offering (currently The Blue Man group).  Unfortunately for Luxor, the theming hasn't fared well with time.  20+ years since it opened, the Egyptian theme just feels tired.  It's further amplified by peeling paint and smoke stained walls in this dimly lit pyramid.  The assortment of shops isn't particularly unique, and feels downright cheap in most instances.  In short, it's not a casino destination anymore, but rather an aging relic at the end of the strip that can provide a cheap place to stay.
 
I stayed here most recently for the classic bachelorette weekend.  Our room was a pyramid suite with two queens.  The bedding was clean, as well as the shower and toilet.  It was hard to look past some smaller issues - peeling paint, sticky spots on the carpet, and an oversized bathroom that felt like a waste of space.  Others on our trip had the same style of room, albeit much larger due to their location in the pyramid.  Despite the room size, they had no more furniture, but just giant voids of space.  Perfect if you're planning on bringing in multiple rollaway beds, but primarily just awkward.
 
Without any great amenities and a pretty ho-hum room, this place can earn a solid 3 star rating because of the price advantage.  You simply can't stay many places on the strip on weekends without being really invested into a players club, or paying hefty room fees.  Luxor provides one of several budget options  available to those willing to sleep at the end of the strip.
 
One complaint we had - when we arrived at check-in, we were told there were no more rooms available in our room class.  Since we had paid upfront, we insisted we should either receive a free upgrade to anything else with the number of beds we'd signed up for, or a total refund on the spot.  They played with us for awhile, insisting we could have a similar suite size, but with one bed (not an option for us).  When we didn't back down, they magically ""found"" a room.  It felt like a cheap ploy to get us to upgrade, or sloppy booking.  Either way, it's inexcusable.  At the very least, they shouldn't have acted like finding the exact kind of room we reserved AND paid for well in advance, was somehow a favor. 
 
Stay at Luxor for a cheap night's rest, but plan on spending your time (and dollars) elsewhere, and be prepared for some sneaky business practices.",8,3,1

The room was dark, gloomy, outdated and worst of all FILTHY.  I would understand old furniture, dated interiors but filth?  No thanks.  

- I had just settled in the room and decided to watch TV.  When I picked up the remote there was LOTION\/CREAM on it.   Housekeeping did not bother wiping this down or disinfecting the remote?

- There was mold on the tub grout.  Disgusting. 

- Not sure if it's the tile design\/color but it just looked filthy.  Reminds me of green mold.  Could it have been green mold?  I did not even bother wiping to check\/confirm.

Last week my husband and I had an amazing 5 day\/ 4 night stay at the Luxor in Las Vegas. Check in Tuesday afternoon was fairly quick, only stood in line for maybe five minutes and our upgraded tower suit was already ready for us. We stayed on the ninth floor with a partial view of the strip, facing the Tropicana. King size bed was so comfortable! I can't stress that enough!! Pillows, even better! But my favorite amenity was the soaking tub. Filled that baby up and dropped in a bath bomb and I was in heaven.

Using loyalty points we earned from the MyVegas game app, we were able to get two separate nights for free. Well, we still had to pay resort fees, but that's not a big deal really. 

When we were checking in, the woman at the front desk was extremely helpful. Because I had one free night on my MyVegas account and my husband had the other night on his account, with the help of the front desk clerk, we were able to merge our two separate nights into the same room. This prevented us from having to check out and then check back in later on, essentially allowing us to sleep the previous night of alcohol consumption off well into the afternoon!

The rooms were pretty comfortable themselves. The beds were great to sleep in, providing restful sleep. They do have a nice size TV in the room, though we didn't really use it. The think the window in our room was slightly tinted, because even when we had the curtains opened during the afternoon, not much light seeped in which was actually perfect as it helped lower the heat from outside coming into the room.

The hotel's pool isn't really as grand as the other pools at other resorts, but honestly as long as it does the job of keeping me cool and refreshed in the horrid desert heat, I'm happy. The casino floor is like any other hotel casino. Full of people and the smell of stale smoke stained forever in the air.

This hotel is also directly connected to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur from the inside, making travel between these resorts easier.

Now, for the things I disliked about this hotel.

The paying for parking, even when you're staying at the hotel, sucks. Had to pay $8 a day for parking, meaning $16 in total for us. If they have to charge for parking, at the very least they should offer some sort of deal for hotel patrons that are staying more than two days. 

Also, while the hotel does free Wi-Fi, it doesn't always work well. Several times when I was in the casino and even in my room, the service on my phone wouldn't work or was extremely slow or poor in performance. Something they should look into since Wi-Fi is important in today's modern world.

They do have an early check-out time as well. Before 11am pretty much sums up their check-out policy. They should raise it to at least 11:30am.

Overall the room was adequate and worked well - I mean, how much time do you actually spend in the room in vegas? I do hear the Tower rooms are nicer, but for the sheer novelty of staying in the pyramid and the convenience its worth a try.

The only thing I didnt like was that you had to take one specific elevator (elevator 1B) to get to the room. The other was that the room did not have coffee maker :(

Otherwise quite well, $95 per night.

Note that its now becoming a habit to tack on an additional ""resort fee"" of $15-$19 on top of you regular hotel bill......even the Palazzo charged me when I stayed there.

The quality of the room was like a motel 6, beds were unremarkable, but watching my brother's hungover fat friend soak himself in the large tub in the corner of the suite proved amusing. 

Can't complain about the price, $80 a night for each suite. They told me no wifi in the room even if I paid for it, but hey there is complimentary WIRED internet in the room! Is this place stuck in the year 2000? Do people other than business men still travel with their laptops\/notebooks? I thought most people have smart phones and tablets these days. No wifi.... pfffft.  

My reservation included a ""20 dollar food and beverage credit"" per room. Funny thing was, this credit was only useable at the nicer restaurants where all the entrees are at least $30 or $40 or so...... 

The staff was friendly for the most part, no complaints there. 

Again the big part for me was the hidden resort fee. (on top of my prepaid room) I was never informed of the resort fee, at check in or at check out. $40 per room. The lady in the accounting department days later told me that $40 ""includes FREE wired internet, a FREE newspaper, FREE pool access and FREE access to the gym!!!"" 

Well its not really FREE then is it???!?!?!? 

Lastly, while calling the hotel days later to inquire about the surprise resort fees that showed up on my credit card I had to wait fifty minutes.....  Each time I called them I was able to get through to a reservations agent within seconds, but accounting? I had to wait FIFTY minutes! I counted them! Im serious. Their accounting was in some central off site call center too, its not like it was some small team there at the hotel! Just this process of TRYING to inquire about my extra fees was honestly what pushed me over the edge from a ""not that great stay"" to ""im never staying there again"" as well as inspired this review. 

NEVER AGAIN LUXOR! NEVER AGAIN!


One last detail: I threw up on the elevator. And im not sorry. (Yes ON it.)",5,8,2

The 800$ in so called savings coupons was a sham except for the free dinner. No real accomidations either, no fridge in room, no microwave and the elevators are a dam nightmare! Oh and about every 2 hours random hotel guests come knocking on your door looking for weed...""not my room stoner try the rappers next door""!, the convenient stores rapes you for basic needs like 5.50$ for a 2 liter of soda or 15$ for a half pint of well booze.

The good thing is, it is on the strip and by Mandalay Bay and Excalibur.  First night we were there the fire alarm went off.  Some jerks put a lighter by one of the sprinklers downstairs lobby.  That's no fault of the Luxor's but still no fun.  Our sections alarm stopped but I could still hear the other sections of the hotel's alarm.  Did not go back to sleep. 

The bathroom was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Seemed out dated and the vent was dirty.  Good NOTE:  Loved the shower, it was nice and the water came out strong.  Water was not the wimpy water you usually get in other hotels.  Room was ok, bed was nice.  The AC is really out dated. It was either cool, cooler, or freezing as the settings.  We could not put it at say 74 degrees.  So we would freeze or be hot.  The view was nice, that I loved.  

The food....where to begin.  We ate at the mexican restaraunt there.  Now I am originally from Texas, I know Mexican food.  I cook Mexican food.  The food was good there.  I was happy with the food.  Big portions for the price.  Then I ate at the Palace Cafe for breakfast.  TOOOO EXPENSIVE!  The food was subpar and you didn't get a lot for the price I paid.  The MORE Buffet at the Luxor, PEOPLE SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!  HORRIBLE!!!!  Went there for dinner, expensive.  The meatloaf was the only thing that was good...and the water.  Decided to go there for breakfast on our last day instead of the Palace Cafe.  HORRIBLE!!!  The potatoes were good......yeah...let's see.  Nope the potatoes were good.  If you wanted toast you would wait a century because the toaster took forever.  My friend didn't want it really brown either just toasted and it was forever before it popped out.  The food for both dinner and breakfast was not warm enough.  by the time you got back to your table it was already cooled.  The food bar, ate at the pizza place there...got sick to my stomach.  There's a McDonalds, never went there...I'm in Vegas why the hell do I want to goto a McDonalds in Vegas when there's one right down the street from me.  Plus we looked at the prices....expensive!!!  Oh and the Asian restaurant that is there was closed the whole time we stayed there.  So go some where else if you want any Asian food.  

The carpeting is out dated, does not match the egyptian vibe that was all around.  

I will say the people working there were helpful and nice.  They were very good. I loved the Egyptian statues, the pyramid loved that.  The Elevators were a little scary.  One elevator just stayed opened on the 19th floor, our floor half the time we were there.  Just a note:  People the elevators tilt...you're in a pyramid, they have to tilt.  Was cool but scary too.  

They have shows there but I can't stand Carrot Top, he is not funny.  Chris Angel, eh I've seen better magicians.  I did like the Titanic display.  I didn't go into the exhibit but saw the ship and some other stuff.  

Gambled and didn't win nothing.  To be expected...but if you want us to stay and play more.  Let us win a little to keep us entertained because if we just keep losing...we're going to walk away.  We went to another hotel and gambled.  Did better there.  Trust us we know the house will win, just keep us amused.",1,1,1

This is the pyramid-shaped hotel, but most, if not all, of the sphinx references seem to have vanished. Vegas has degenerated into largely a sinking cesspool of depravity, probably starting with that whole ""what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"" ad campaign and it's perfectly reflected here, with their overly risque ""do not disturb"" door hangers. Definitely not shooting for family friendly here.

They seemed to have decided to go for the inside of a pyramid thing instead of a high end hotel disguised with a glass pyramid, so there's lots of stone work, a sort of staircase thing in the middle, rocks in the shower, hieroglyphic-like scribblings on the furniture and so on. Showers, for those that care about that, are the pits, one of the worst I've experienced out of years of staying in hotels. I wasn't staying long on the most recent trip, so I only really had one episode of which to object, but any longer and I might have been looking for a new venue.

This is a place that really wants you to walk. There are two banks of oddly rattly elevators in the corners and you're hoofing it from there. No idea why they thought that would be desirable, but it wasn't. At all. On the lower floor are various shops (including a convenience store thing that had less selection than several shops I've seen at actual airports) for they, like the rest of the hotels seem to be trending, thought it a smart thing to import malls into the hotels. Casinos? Good. Restaurants? Good idea, but some of them are not worth visiting. Malls? Dumb. I get it. They want everyone to spend ALL of their money without ever having to leave again, but that's just more shit to have to wade through. 

Check-in line is astronomical, partially because they couldn't be bothered to fully staff the front desk. At no time did I ever see any of them fully stationed, which is a not inconsiderable pain in the ass. Staff was mostly friendly and kind, which I appreciated, but I don't really think they valued my time or my comfort much.",2,0,0

This all glass pyramid resort hotel and casino in the desert, is still, in my opinion, a beautiful site on the Las Vegas strip! From the eye-catching site of the Pyramid as you drive by, that impressive sphinx, the Egyptian artistry in and around the building and columns, after all these years it is a beautiful hotel! 

The inside is even more impressive.... I really love the way it was built and an attention to detail. I have never been to Egypt (only seen it in movies) so this is the next best thing here in Vegas! From the moment you walk in, the lines, the artistry, the beautiful decor, the ambiance, to name a few .....

The Luxor is located minutes from McCarren International Airport between Mandalay Bay and The Excalibur. It is connected by walkable bridge to the Mandalay Bay (The Shops at Mandalay Bay), or just a quick monorail ride from Mandalay Bay or The Excalibur!

Every stay of mine the service has always been top notch, from the front desk check-ins, concierge, restaurant staffs, casino floor workers, everyone is sure to make your stay a memorable experience! I have stayed at The Luxor at least once a year for the past five years! The room rates are very reasonable and competitive in comparison to other resort hotels and casinos! The best rates in my opinion for a hotel of this caliber!

Rooms: the rooms are older, but elegant and spacious. The rooms have that touch of Egyptian artistry throughout. In all of my stays I have always had a stand up shower (no tub), however the shower is very roomy and wide. The vanity and mirror are long and wide, depending up how much space you need (ladies? LOL)

Depending on your mood, they offer varied dining experiences;

Signature Dining Experience: Tender's Steak and Seafood and Rice & Company.

Casual Dining located Food Court on the Upper level: Nathan's, The Original Chicken Tenders, Bonanno's New York Pizzeria, Johnny Rockets and Starbucks. For those who have not been here in a while, McDonald's is no longer there.

They also have The Pyramid Cafe, MORE The Buffet (lower level) Backstage Deli, Tacos & Tequila, and an array of bars through the hotel.

Nightlife: LAX, Aurora, Flight, High Bar, Playbar, Chonga Bar and Centra.

The Luxor also has a wedding chapel on the upper level, the M-Life experience, as well as nightlife, shows and entertainment. Please check with the resort during your stay on current  events.

Included with your $29 resort fee are:
- Access to the Fitness Center
- Internet access
- in-Room local and long distance calls (excluding international) and 1-800 calls
- Daily newspaper
- Airline Boarding Pass Printing

Parking: as with all hotels and resorts on the Vegas strip, there are always ample parking! MGM Resorts as well as other hotels throughout Las Vegas are now charging for parking, however, if you are staying at The Luxor, parking is free at all MGM Resorts for the duration of your stay. A parking card will be provided to you at check-in.

I did not know what to expect from the exhibits at Luxor but all I can say is.. WOW. Totally worth the money to go into Bodies and Titanic. Totally different experiences in each but both are mind blowing I don't want to ruin anything for anyone just go see them. We had a chance to see Criss Angel as well.. Cool show, I am still trying to figure out some of the tricks.

Aurora and Flight, the bars in the casino were a great hang for mid day. They have happy hour specials or you can check in on Foursquare and your first drink is buy one get one. Great deal and the bartenders were awesome. They made great drinks and and were very personable.

I'm a HUGE fan of the valet parking, the best part is it's free. The Valets where nice, friendly, helpful and right up on it. The bell staff also gets high marks for thier service and friendliness. When you have 6 girls you have lots of luggage, they were careful and professional the entire time. 

Check in was fast and easy. We were upgraded as we had requested two rooms adjoining...so although we wanted to be in the Pyramid the Towers were nice. 

The Hotel Cafe has a bit to be desired. We ate here on the way in and out. The way in was tolerable...although the menu selection wasn't anything to be deisred. Its the same menu for room service. On the way out we were desiring the Buffet and ventured to the More Buffet but couldn't justify $35 for breakfast. COME ON that is ridiculous even for VEGAS! So the cafe again it was. Once we were in the front of the line the wait for a table was autrocious, THEN the wait for the waitress to even come over for drinks was a good 20 mins. so much luck for getting out of Vegas before noon. The food was good, and satisfied the masses. 

Saturday we spent the day at the pool and got a cabana. There seems to be some false advertisement on the Luxors website about the cabanas. As it stated that drinks, and a fruit plate was included. Upon asking about the fruit plate we were informed that it was for the higher ended Cabanas, yet the website did not clearly state this. The Cabana Host manager stated he knew this and apologized. UMMM We want our DAMN FRUIT!  

Getting the the Cabana by 10am as requested we were all STARVING and looking around for a waitress. Called the front area...they said one would be over. 15 mins later still no Waitress. Finally we went to the front and asked for a waitress....5 mins later a sweet waitress came over took our drink and food orders. Well what happened next floored me. The regular waitress for our cabana shows up a good 30 mins later pissed off that someone else served us and treated us like shit the rest of the day. NOT GOOD SERVICE AT ALL! IT definatly put a damper on our drinking and enjoyment of the pool services.

There is an older gentlemen in a vest waving us toward him, and he asks with a clipboard in his hand are you guys guests of the hotel? ""Mary says No we are here to see the fireworks""..... He looks at us and says pull forward to the VIP section and be sure to Tip VIP!!!! I am like F@#& Yeah!!! 

Pulling forward another guy asks can I help you??? Of course do as we are told right??? I say were VIP & he looks at the car paused for a moment and says Ok move forward... Now understand that we are not driving the  2010 Lexus GS350 it was at home instead we drove too Vegas in the 2002 Camry Se for Gas Mileage so when we said VIP the guy probable thought yeah right... :)

Forward we move right to the front of the Hotel... When I say front I mean the car was parked 10ft. from the glass doors.... We stopped the car.... handed the keys to the Valet and passed him a Benji $$$... CHA CHING!!!! We were in!!!! 

The hours that passed were reflected in the pictures we posted... Plenty of Beer lots of Gambling & Rocking the New Year with My Baby Mary V.

I try to stay at a different hotel every time I visit Las Vegas, and so when the opportunity came up to stay here at a super huge discount, I was totally on board.

This is for our room that we had in one of the towers. I think I would rather have stayed in the pyramid itself, but a room is a room, and I can't imagine the experience would have been all that different.

Check in: took way longer than necessary. We got player club cards after the guy at the desk erroneously told us that our current ones expired after a year (not true. the cards never expire, however the points do!). 

We trundle over to the back corner and find the elevators. They are decorated to look like walls of an Egyptian ruins. Loved the little details. 

The room itself? Nothing special. Two boring double beds in a room that had some cheap, mass produced Egyptian-themed prints and framed art. The bathroom had a separate shower & bath, and a fairly well-lit mirror. However, I hate when the vanity\/sink area is in the same room as the toilet & shower. It seems like such a small thing, but it makes such a huge difference if you're splitting a room. 

Wifi? Get real. They charge you a $16\/day ""resort fee"" which includes internet, but they can't seem to do any better than to supply a long, ridiculous ethernet cord coming out from the armoire. Seriously? Is it still 2003?

All in all, it's an ok hotel, but only ok. I think the location at the end of the strip is a bit detrimental if you prefer to walk around all day like I do, and there really isn't anything truly exceptional about the hotel to win out over more centrally located casino\/hotels. I wouldn't die if I had to stay here again, but I would probably prefer to stay somewhere that had more convenience and\/or nicer rooms.",0,1,0

We normally stay at the Stratosphere, but we wanted to try somewhere different. It's safe to say that I was definitely disappointed in this Hotel. 

The first thing I noticed about this hotel was the smell. I liked that it didn't really smell like smoke, but the artificial vanilla-type smell that they were pumping through the air ducts ( hotel and casino), was very overwhelming. There were times where I felt like I couldn't breathe due to the heavy aroma of the vanilla smell. 

Now on to the room: Tower Deluxe King
This hotel is old. I understand, but the rooms are disappointing. The furniture is all scratched and chipped, our mirror was broken, as well as a blood like stain on our sheets. The air conditioning is very limited with its settings, and they advise you to keep the black out curtains closed to keep the air in. 

The most disgusting part of this hotel was the bathroom. I'm appalled that people don't complain about the bathroom more! Out of the 4 rooms we had reserved, 3 of the showers did not drain! Our shower was definitely the worst! (See Pictures). It was filthy! There was mold growing in the caulking of the shower where the glass panels connect to the gold frame. The shower head was caked in green build up! Not to mention the shower took about 10 minutes AFTERWARD taking a shower to drain, so you are standing in water your whole shower.

The lower level where we checked in looked decent too. Once we got to our room though, it was a whole different story. A previous review mentioned that the room would have been cool in 1991. More like 1975. The ugly ass bedspread and curtains looked like they were straight off the set of Sanford & Son, Maude, All in the Family, and The Jeffersons, The bedspread was very cheap and flimsy. The actual bed was hard. The egyptian decor was cheesy. The only nice thing about it was the bathroom.

We stayed in east tower and there's a long walk to the room.

Our room also smelled like smoke even though it was a non-smoking room. My cousin is allergic to smoke so this was a big problem.When we called to complain about a possible room switch, they told us since they gave us a courtesy early check in, they couldn't switch us. Mmm kay, what does that have to do with a smoky room that we paid for not to smell like smoke? After several calls, they agreed to spray a ""special air sanitizer"" to get rid of the odor. That took forever. We also had to call several times to get them to bring extra towels\/washcloths and pillows.

The a\/c was horrible. It was up as high as it could go and didn't feel like it was even on.

The concierge was rude. Tons of annoying sales people trying to get you to buy timeshares and get $200 off another visit within 1 year. The catch? You have to put down a $100 deposit. Ha!

No information was given about how to get around Vegas. We actually went to Excalibur and talked to their concierge there. They gave us info. I definitely wouldn't stay here again. My cousin got a discount rate through her coworker that knows a Luxor employee. No wonder we got the discount. Nobody wants to stay here lol.",2,5,1

I booked through AAA.com (never again).

This hotel is nothing special. I personally don't like the Luxor because of the shape of the hotel. The elevators move at an angle and your windows are cut at an angle. 

Overall I think they need to spend more money into upkeep for the hotel rooms. The furniture looks warn the windows don't look clean. It looks like they spend money to upkeep the main lobby but not the rooms. I won't be staying here again. 

Dislikes:
Elevators are super busy and take forever to be free.
Check in takes a while. We waited 30 minutes in line on a Friday to check in.

Easy to find on the strip and located within walking distance of the places most people want to see. Had to wait about 20 minutes due to long lines at check in.  Room was nice, nothing special. The hall ways on our floor were oddly slanted (not due to intoxication) giving me the impression that the building is going through some structural issues.  Chose the Luxor because it had the best price. $120 double queen on a Friday.",1,0,0

But now it has become run down and really low budget in a bad way.  A year ago I got an offer for 3 free nights, and usually I would stay in nicer places but thought, it's free..lets give it a try.  When I went to check in at the VIP line, they didn't have any record of my reservation although I did have a printed receipt and confirmation number.. They asked me to step aside while they figured out what happened.  40 minutes later I was fuming and went back up to see what the delay was. If it wasn't for the fact that my nights were going to be free, I would of turned around and looked for a room elsewhere.  They finally straightened it out and up to my room I went.   I had stayed there a few times in the 90's and it had really changed.  Rooms are shabby and worn looking, dust on furniture and the restroom had mold in the shower.

First of all, the check in. The check in itself was fine, I was aware of the $25\/night charge for the resort. I had booked through Expedia so it was pretty smooth. But then, as soon as we walk away from the desk, we are pulled aside by some concierge-events guy. We knew he wanted to sell us something and we had literally JUST got there, still had all our luggage, so we kindly said no. He talked over us with his spiel about Criss Angel and whoever else, and we again said no thank you. Eventually we just walked away. This happened on the way to check out, also, except it was a lady who literally cornered me. I understand the hotel needs to sell tickets to these events to make it worth it to host them, but don't be so aggressive. It's a turnoff.

Second, the room. Our room was smoking-optional, we were told we could change to non-smoking the next day at noon. I didn't smell smoke immediately so we unpacked all of our stuff and went about our night. However, the smell almost seemed to get worse as the trip went on. The bedding was the worst. I put my face in a pillow and immediately had to get up, the smell was so bad.  Our sink also had holes in the side? It looked like someone had tried to patch it and failed so every time we turned on the sink water went everywhere. ALSO, no refrigerator and no microwave. Of course the hotel wants you to eat in their overpriced buffet and at their overpriced food court locations, but at least give me the option. Lastly, guy at check in said we'd have a view of the pool from our first floor room. We opened the curtains and there was a white brick wall. We could see half of the lifeguard, but that was it. 

Third, the casino. The casino was awful. We're not huge on gambling but we do like slots. The first time we gambled we went to the Excalibur and had a pretty good time. There were a ton of machines to choose from and they were paying pretty good. Of course we lost money, but the winning was there. The next day we went to the casino at the Luxor. It is tiny, there is a very limited selection of slots and the ones we did find didn't pay out at all. I know it's all random, but give me something. 50 cents, a dollar, anything. We ended up going back to the Excalibur to gamble. Still lost money, but there was also some winning.

I know you pay for what you get, and this wasn't a $150\/night luxury hotel, but still. I wouldn't stay here again. It's really pretty on the outside, the pyramid and sphinx are beautiful, but I would pay an additional $40-$50\/night for a better hotel with a better atmosphere. Pass through the Luxor just to see it, but don't stay here.",2,0,0

It has always been my opinion that the hotel shouldn't matter when traveling because the whole point of traveling is to be out of your room.  But the HUGE way this hotel fails on is parking.  When coming home after midnight after shows, the last thing you want to see is that the TWO STORY parking lot is full.  Plus full of vultures.

Just think of what they could do to the appearance of the hotel room windows to improve the view when you look up inside the pyramid. I can't believe its still so plain and unadorned. The outside of the Luxor draws you in, only to be disappointed by the been-there-done-that interior.  

I have yet to stay in one of the rooms and would like to do that, as the slanted walls and view of the inside of the building would make it interesting, but other than that, there's nothing special about the Luxor.

Literally, nothing has changed. No upgrades or renovations to the rooms whatsoever. The bed is now four years older and uncomfortable as hell. Luxor claims it was a king sized bed but it sure looked like a queen to me. The bathroom, while nice and decently sized, has the same $5 shower head that we complained about before, and a toilet than runs 24-7. Apparently our 16th floor room had a nice view of the strip, but the windows were so dirty and in need of a squeegee that I can't be positive. 

I was prepared to leave a three star review  until it was time to get my bags and leave for the airport. I had taken advantage of leaving my luggage until it was time to leave, and when I picked it up the bellhop manager retuned after ten minutes announcing they couldn't find my luggage. Really? I had to go in the back room and look for it myself, resulting in another ten minute wait and cutting it too close for my flight. 

The rooms are not that bad, but could use some fresh updates. For a hotel at the end of the strip, Luxor needs to step it's game up to stay in competition with other strip hotels. Next time I'll spend a little extra elsewhere for a five star experience.",9,0,1

I've stayed here several times throughout the years, and I still enjoy being here.  Then again, who could resist staying inside a pyramid?! (Yes, the windows are slanted.) 

The room was clean, not dusty, and everything was in order.  Housekeeping was on top of it.  There was no fridge or microwave in our room but we didn't spring for a suite, as we knew that we'd only sleep in here.  Our room was close to everything, so it wasn't an issue.  (Yes, the Pyramid Deluxe rooms may need a bit of an upgrade, but the pricing reflects that. And it is still on the Strip.)  It's 420 square feet of space, with a table and two chairs for eating, vanity table with mirror,  writing desk area, four-drawer chest, a closet with removable ironing board and iron, 40-inch flat screen TV, and a stuffed chair. Bathroom had a decent sized shower, single sink with a large counter, hair dryer, a few toiletries, and a water-efficient toilet.  

Hotel lobby clerks = friendly.  

Yes, it's on the South end of the Strip, but you want to know something? It's not so damned packed here!  If you want to be comfortable and have some semblance of privacy, this is the hotel\/casino for you.  I'm not saying it's dead here, but it's a bit easier to get around than others. 

Gambling. They have high roller rooms, and they have reasonable low limits on some of their tables, and they do have penny slots! (I'm not much of a gambler, so it's important to have options.)  

Food court  = good. Nathan's, McDonald's, LA Subs, Bonanno's Pizzeria and Starbucks. There are two Starbucks inside the Luxor, including the one in the food court. Smart idea, if they want to keep people gambling away into the wee hours.  

Restaurants. We did enjoy TENDER steak & seafood restaurant, and took advantage of Backstage Deli (open 24 hours).   Sorry but skipped the buffets here, as the reviews were so mixed. 

Pool =  a nice place to hang out.  C'mon, how could you not appreciate being in a pool\/hot tub by a giant black pyramid?! The spa\/hot tub is small and limited to 8 people.  We were impressed by the amount of islands in the pool.  (Concrete islands, that you can stand\/sit on or place something on.)  Plenty of beach chairs, but it gets scarce when it's busy here.  It appears that it's safe enough to leave your stuff here, but I'd suggest not leaving too much valuables out in the open anyway.   And you will need a room key for access to the pool, so don't forget it. 

Parking = we took advantage of valet, which was free, but you've gotta tip.  Just make sure to keep track of the valet ticket, and use the scanner, coming or going.  (The first night, the valet person took the scan portion of our ticket...so we made sure to keep track of it after that!)  They do have self-parking, too.

As much as I've enjoyed staying here, there are some gripes... 

First and foremost, the timeshare people who kept approaching us were annoying.  Sorry, but we had no time nor interest in a timeshare presentation, no matter what they were offering as an incentive!  We solved that issue by walking apart, and it's high pressure sales by the lobby\/main entrance. You were WARNED.  

Second, the directory in the room needs to be updated as some of the extensions were not working or misdirected, and they need to post HOURS for their amenities! 

Third and lastly, I'm disappointed that the pool closes down at 7 p.m.  We would have loved having a few evenings by the pool!",5,0,2

They have dumped some significant money into giving this place a facelift. However,  I still don't think I'll ever go back to the spa.

It's a bit more affordable then my previous stay. It's also away from the main crowd, so it's naturally quieter. In the West Wing tower, there is a pool, spa, work out center, and a couple of business terminals in a hall way. The room itself is reasonably sized, but a great value considering the cost. 

The work area is decent - although, it's too comfortable. I feel asleep a couple of times in that chair after a long day working at a tradeshow. The work area is configured more for lounging with a drink in hand, versus working on a computer. 

What cost the fourth star is the mist that is circulated in the atmosphere to mask the cigarette smoke. The smell is a poor attempt to hide the smoke, and increases the mass of the particles in the air - allowing the particles to cling to items more often, such as clothing, suit cases, computers, or even my respiratory system. 

I don't like that mist, and I don't like how I have to spend hours on end in a hot shower to attempt to clear my respiratory system of that mist. Cigarette smell, I can deal with; masking agents which clings to cigarettes smoke and make the mass of the particle mass larger - I don't like.",4,0,0

Review #34:
this place is solidly average for Las Vegas, and not as tacky or lower-end as I'd expected; the Egyptian décor is somewhere in between cool and silly; no doubt that the pyramid structure gives a very interesting effect to the view above you, particularly on the 2nd (mezzanine) floor; connected to the Mandalay Place shops & restaurants, so easy access to the more upscale Mandalay Bay; the outdoor pool area looks like it has a nice relaxing vibe; most of the restaurants are mid-scale, and even the steakhouse is quite accessible price & vibe-wise; lots of entertainment\/shows options here, and lots of souvenir & sundries stores; best craft beer bet = no doubt, it's Public House, which has an upscale sports bar feel, and solid but pricey beer menu (around $11 for a 22 oz. draft); also saw 1 or 2 decent taps at the nice bar off of the hotel lobby, but that's about it",2,4,2

The gaming floor is a little small. You can walk around the place in like 5 minutes...Maybe a good thing? The first machine i played was some electronic craps. Played a minimum wager bet and a Field bet. Hit double 6's and the machine broke LOL... I had to call a slot attendant over to fix it and they voided my win... Not expected but rules are the rules i guess.

The entire staff of Luxor looked like they were miserable and that doesn't really put me in the mood to lay down some real bets. The electronic Black Jack is pretty fun but don't count the house letting you win more than $115 there. Roulette was also a blast. Great odd's and it seems like the most legit electronic machine on the casino floor. I didn't come to win...so anyways..

And a yes, what all those other Yelpers say about the people heckling you to buy Time Shares is 100% true. Every time we left and re-entered luxor, we were hassled by oriental women who barley spoke a lick of English about Free this and that. That right there is what dropped my review from 4 stars to 3.

Enough of the bad stuff, so they have not 1 but 2 Starbucks!!! Oh and they have a 24\/hr Krispy Kreme!! Two of the 3 reasons why I came! They are linked to the Excalibur and Mandalay bay and supposedly they have a Tram that goes back and fourth. The Buffet was pretty decent. The Go-Go dancer that was half naked was different... It looked like she was out of place and didn't really go well with the casino... Not a reason to come back...i would go to Pink Flamingo for that... And lastly, the SKY LIGHT WAS NOT ON!!! I wanted a to see that but i guess they are saving on the electric bill....

But yea, i was planning on coming back in November but I really don't think i will be returning.


A side note to Luxor - GET RID OF THE TIME SHARE SALES PEOPLE!! One of my biggest reasons why i might not be returning.  Give the staff a pay raise or some free Red Bull because they look like they need it.",2,2,1

We got the suite with the tub in it. Great customer service from the moment we got here. Getting a taxi was always easy. Affordable too.

Although, the elevators were my least favorite. When looking up reviews for the hotel the main complaint was the elevators. You would think that if so many people have complained about them they would get fixed...

- The Luxor has NO wifi. So, if you have a Ipad or other tablet, you won't get any internet service. That sucked!  Mandalay Bay does have free wifi so walk thru the hotels and get access to their service.  

- I tried three restaurants at The Luxor and they all were TERRIBLE. Eat elsewhere!!

- While I stayed in the West Tower and not the Pyramid (thanks, Luxor, for the upgrade -much appreciated), the walls are thin so you can hear everything said. Also, there are doors between rooms, so I heard LOTS.

I'm a fan of any thing Egyptian even if it's just for decoration and for years I was looking forward to staying here; maybe my expectations were too high.

My experience started with check-in and while I was returning the rental car across the street at the Tropicana and my wife with baby in arms went over with my license and credit card and tried to check-in but because she used a third party site to book they would not let her check-in and cited fraud related purposes.

Okay I understand but then I called reservations, I verified my information and asked them to add her to the reservation and they would not so she had to wait for me and ironically she was the one who made the reservation with my info in the first place.

Let's ignore that and call it my misunderstanding - they are protecting me. So after check-in I walked over to the bell desk and asked them to deliver our bags and they told me I had to call from the room to get my bags delivered even though I was going straight up and when I questioned why; I got a little attitude, almost rude - so of course when I got to the room I had to call twice because they got busy all of sudden and didn't pick up the first time.

The elevators are located in a far corner and only in one corner of the whole building (16th floor) and of course our room was located diagonally from that corner and it felt like a 1\/4 mile walk. The room was okay space wise, nothing special but the shower drain was semi-clogged causing the bottom to fill up, then towel bar fell apart on the floor and design wise the shower didn't have a shelf for shampoos etc, unless you put it on the now flooded and soapy shower floor. Nice... Holiday Inn Express has better showers.

By the time we got down to the gaming floor - the music was tiring and sleepy, lighting and lack of colors made the place feel a little like a dungeon. The tables were okay, gambling wasn't bad but one of the dealers was talking so much to the other players about old movies i.e. Clockwork Orange that after 20 minutes of slow, boring and unfocused dealing I went to another table.

I ordered a drink, asked for Goose and was willing to pay an up-charge but was offered only Sky or Absolute; three watered down drinks later and barely a buzz.

Perhaps my only valid complaint is that three of the atm\/redemption machines were broken and after walking the whole floor the one working machine we found had a long line.

Overall we just spent way too much time waiting...",1,0,0

True, it is a bit of a walk to the north end of the strip from here... but we managed to walk all the way to The Mirage and back on a nice sunny day and survived unscathed with drinks in hand.

The pool was nice.  There was 3 of them... one was closed every day when we went, but the other two were open.  One of them had a bunch of hanging out bars\/platforms in the water where you could set your drinks down while still sitting in the water which was cool.  We got to the pool early in the AM so we got good seats, but they did tend to fill up pretty quick and by the time we left the pool area you would have been lucky to find a seat, let alone a seat for your entire party.  Only bummer was the ""no outside food\/alcohol"" policy at the pool.  Not sure how well its enforced really... I mean, I brought my morning coffee out and I wasn't patted down for cookies.  So it may be lax.  i didn't try to charge in with a big ol frooty cocktail though.  I would be bummed if I just bought a big frozen drink and then came to the pool without knowing the rules... so you've been warned!

The architecture and design of the hotel was really neat (obviously!) it's a pyramid!  cool!

The room was clean and didn't have any funk or odors, etc.  Cool pyramid shaped soaps in the bathroom.  haha - the little things...

The McDonalds was hopping for breakfast inside the Luxor and I got coffee there every morning for a buck or two -- not too shabby.

Plenty of bars and casino action... although I found the bar service at the slots to be REALLY crummy at the Luxor.  I would say it might have been because I wasn't high rolling... but after slottin' it up at the other casinos, I found the waitresses to be MUCH nicer elsewhere (especially New York, New York nearby).  The couple waitresses we had at the Luxor we pretty much had to lasso to get any attention.  They would hurriedly zoom past us and roll their eyes as we placed our orders as she clearly had better places to be.  They were only giving out bottles of things like coors and bud light, etc.  While at the New York New York we were sippin on Newcastle and Stella Artois for free.  .... and I was tipping at both places... so it's not like I was stiffing them.  sooo... YRMV, but if I were to go back, I definitely would go to a different casino if you plan on drinking.

Another annoyance -- that is apparently at all the casinos there is resort taxes and fees.  Watch out for those... I think it was like $20 a day for me and my gf.  Didn't really expect that on check-in, but oh well... when in Vegas!  

It was convenient to walk between Excalibur\/Mandalay bay as they had motorized walkways and things that made getting back and forth a breeze.  The New york New York was really close by too, which is where we went for food a couple times.  Seems like they had a lot better food choices if you wanted something quick, and not break the bank, but still being delicious -- some New York Deli place had the bomb Rueben.  But that's beside the point, being a review of the Luxor.

Anyhow, in closing, I would stay here again given that it was ridiculously cheap to stay here and I didn't mind walking up and down the strip.  If you don't enjoy walking, you might want to park yourself further north to be in the center of the action.

Soo... I give it 3 stars -- since its Luxor Hotel AND Casino.  4 or 5 for the hotel and 1 for the Casino.  comes out to 3 in the middle.",9,2,2

They didn't even act like they wanted me back or anything, the MLife rep pretty much just told me to go pound sand. So I will do just that, at a non-MLife resort.

The self-park parking lot was very big and conveniently located at the back of the hotel with an easy walk way that led you right inside. I had requested a crib which never came.

A great part about the hotel is, even though it's a smoking permitted hotel, you couldn't tell because of how nice it smells inside.

Taking the elevators (inclinators??) was not so very fun or easy, the Luxor elevators could use some updating. They are wobbly and loud. In general they just made me nervous.

Upon getting into the room and looking around, I was not very impressed. I was able to have a suite for my stay and I have to say the set up is weird. It seems as if there is a design flaw somewhere and the space is not properly utilized. There is a huge tub by the beds, which doesn't bother me but with this being a suite I would of thought it would be a jacuzzi tub. There was also a purple couch as well, which was cool...the random white and black stains were not so cool. Needless to say I didn't use the couch. The bathroom was OK my only real big complaint is the fan didn't work (or maybe it was super quiet) and in the shower there is no ledge so I can easily shave my legs.
In the room there was a refrigerator but the suite did not offer a microwave or a coffee pot. There is internet access however it was not wireless. You have to plug it in to a long yellow cord. 

Going down the casino to play the slots were as expected, the air was no more or less polluted than any other Casino. Easy access to drinks (alcoholic and non) and food. There are 4 bars on the Casino floor and 2 different places in the food court to buy the frozen alcoholic drinks. Upstairs from the casino there is the food court, a couple of restaurants and some of the attractions. Ate at T&T and Rice & Company, I have defiantly had better of the genre of food that is served. However it was good. Be careful when going up to the food court, in the middle there are sales people trying to get you to buy timeshares etc.
Easy access to the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay.

The beds were actually pretty comfortable though. The casino wasn't very busy compared to Caesars palace where we stayed the last visit.

First of all, the beds are comfortable, the rooms are relatively big, and I've never noticed a conspicuous lack of house cleaning. So if all you are looking for is a basic place to spend the night and you've managed to find a cheap room rate, stop reading right now. The Luxor will suit you fine.

If, like me, you have to actually get some work done while you're in Vegas... well, you could do better than the Luxor. The $18\/day convenience fee includes wired (!) internet access, which is ridiculously dated - throw in some WiFi and I would gladly pay that fee, but wired internet access does me absolutely no good. The room lighting is extremely dim, making it difficult to not only do any work but also to see yourself in the mirror. Speaking of the mirror, the only full-length mirror is on the front of the TV armoire and divided into four quadrants by the wood edging of the doors - meaning there really isn't a full-length mirror. The towels are rough, there's no coffeemaker in the room, and the decor is getting sort of dated. Again, these are things you probably don't care about if you're staying in the Luxor for a cheap, fun Vegas trip - however, they matter to me as I can't choose my dates and thus have to pay upwards of $100 per night for a sub-par room.

As far as the larger casino, it's OK - I actually kind of like the cheesy pyramid decor downstairs, and the location isn't bad (though I wish they would connect it to some other casinos by tram so I didn't have to walk through the Excalibur in order to go north on the strip). The casino is nowhere near as smoke-filled as the Excalibur, though not quite as pleasant as Mandalay Bay. I like the restaurants and shopping in Mandalay Place, and it's not really that far to walk to the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, or even as far north as Caesar's if you have the time. None of the restaurants in the Luxor are really my thing, though I appreciate that they have three separate Starbucks locations (crucial when there's no in-room coffee).

Apparently they haven't bothered to take a gander in ole Brit's direction these days.  ""Sexy"" is not the first word I think of when she is mentioned.  

I'm sick of Vegas trying to go ""ultra-hip"".  There's certainly a market for those schmucks who like to spend way too much on pink martinis to impress people they'll never meet, or to try to pick up girls\/guys they stand no chance in hades in hooking up with.  However, I'm sick of EVERY property on the strip trying to go in that direction.  The Luxor never has been sexy, and I like it for that!  

The reason the Luxor gets three stars is because its still a pyramid!  That in its ownright makes it cool!  What would make it cooler?  Get the Pyramid Brewing Company to open up a micro-brewery in the hotel!  It would be perfect!  Of course, I'd be asking the same Ivy-League material executives of MGM-Mirage who closed down the only micro-brewery on the strip at the Monte Carlo, to accomplish this task.  I won't hold my breath.",1,4,3

Chose this because I got an Internet promo code for $194. Never stayed there before and the BF said why not. I called in after making my reservation to inquire about an upgrade and was told I could do so for an additional $35 per night for a Spa suite. The Spa suite includes a jacuzzi right next to the window so you can overlook the strip. She told me she had stayed in that suite herself seven times and it's usually booked as a honeymoon suite. Enticing right? Had to confirm with the BF, so I had to call him. I called back not more than 3 minutes later and was told they were sold out. The conversation went something like this...

Me: ""HUH?! Someone just told me you had them available.""
Him: ""Oh, wait a minute, (silence) yes we do have them available but for $139 a night.""
Me: ""But I just called like a few minutes ago and was told I can get them for only $35 more.""
Him: ""No, sorry. We're sold out.""

ERRR! But surprisingly, when we checked in late at 4am on Saturday morning, we were told it was for a Spa suite for the price I paid for $194! What happened? Nobody knows, I got my Spa suite. Sweet suite, right? She made it sound better than it was. The suite itself was eh... OK. For the price it  fit fine. Everything is out dated compared to the other suites we have stayed in along the strip. The room needs more ventilation. We were in a smoking room and smoking in it of course, but the smoke just filled up and didn't leave. It was uncomfortable. There was a lack of lighting and the bathroom definitely needed a better working fan too. Had a fridge and two t.v.'s., though small and really old. The carpet was a little sticky and I kind of got a rash after sleeping in the bed the first night.
What I did like was that the hotel staff was very friendly (5 stars). Especially the dealers. They remembered our names even after we had left and returned to the table hours later! The cocktail waitress was always around for our drinks, BIG plus! 
I gave them 3 stars. 2 of which is because of their attention with guests otherwise it would've have been a 1. And, it also didn't hurt that we won $600 playing craps.

If you plan on going to LAX, upon check-in ask the front desk person to give you LAX room keys. This will let you in without having to stand in line but you still have to pay cover charge.",1,1,1

The inside of the resort was amazing!  No pictures could do ever do it justice.....the statues, open beams, water features.......so cool!!!  The place is just huge and took forever to get from one point to another, but this was the case with all of the resorts on the strip.  No problems with smoking except for at the pool.  We were trying to relax at the pool and people around us started to smoke...that was really gross!  You have to get to the pool super early to get a chair, it gets crowed very quickly.  They should have a smoking section or ban smoking at the pool.  The room itself was average.  It was neat and clean with a really comfortable bed and pillows.  I was cold and called for an extra blanket which was brought up right away and it was nice and cozy.  I took away a strar becasue there was not a fridge, coffee maker or a microwave in the room.  That alone would be enough for me to not stay here again thou.  We had to buy everything and with the resort being so huge it was not convienent to go off the strip to eat.  The cost of the room is really good, but everything else is so freakin expensive!!!!  We ate at Luxors rice, T&T, public house for dinners.  I thought the food was rather bland and way overpriced.  We split many of our dinners because they were rather large.  We also ate at Jimmy Buffets Marg. ville.  The food was just okay.  Over all the food in vegas was terrible.  I have had better food for much less money here at home.  I saw the Beattles love show and that was worth every penny............incredible show!!  If you like the Beattles, don't miss this show.  If you only do one thing in vegas, it has to be this show!  You also have to check out the volcano in front of the Mirage, the fountains in front of the Bellagio and the Flamingo habitat at the Flamingo.  These were all free to see and totally memorable! just amazing!!!!!!!!  Skip the shark exhibit at mandalay bay thou.  Not worth the 18 bucks to see it.  The zipline downtown was fun and the Gondola ride at the Venetian was great.  The best resort for oppulance I think is Ceasers palace....WOW!!!  Just incredible.  One more tip.......5 nights is too long of a stay and too expensive  3 or 4 nights would be better.  Hope my trip review helps!  Take a TON of pics.  You will not save any money by shopping here and there is a CRAZY amount of shopping.  Don't miss the forum (shopping insanity!) in ceasers palace and the canal shops at the Venetian!!

We had not even checked and felt like we were being feed to the lions. We continued to the front desk, where clerks were standing around and had to ask someone to come to the counter to check us in. We arrived at the room only to discover the last guest had smoked up a pot farm, it stunk.... the smoke was still floating in the air, the room was to have a tub and shower not a handicap shower with no curtain that you roll into. Called the front told them this was not going to work and we needed a regular room with tub and shower, and to please send a runner with the new keys for another room. It took well over an hour for someone to bring new keys so we could move. Even with the door open and using the room spray we travel the smell was horrible. Room number 2, again they put us in a hanidcap room this one did have a bathtub shallow with all the hanidcap rails a small roll in shower, it did not smell. Disappointed with the bed in both rooms, we have seen better beds and linens at best western and the tv in the huge armore was one of those 60.00$ tv's they sell at walmart, not what you would expect to see here, maybe motel 6. Understand staying in Las Vegas I did not plan on spending much time in my room, but what time I was there, I expect first class comfort not budget dump. Upon are return to the room it was time to take a hot bath, retire, and resume our adventure the next day. After my bath I pulled the plug to let the tub drain, only find the tub was draining and coming up the shower with my tub water and raw sewage quickly flooding the marble floor with black and brown stuff grabbing towels and blankets was able to stop it before it hit the carpet......Again called front desk asked to speak with the manager told him this room would not work we needed another room and to send someone for this mess. Manager advised no rooms left but he would put us in a new room after 11am said they would upgrade us to players suit at no charge. Took 1\/2 for janitor to come with plunger, when he plunged the shower black and brown stuff now coming up the tub drain and the tolet over flowed with more sewage, he called for housekeeping to remove wet towels and blankets and she did a quick clean just enough to get the water off the floor but shower and tub still had black brown stuff smeared all around, was fine as it was 5am by the time they were finished, we just closed the bathroom door and went to sleep. Called at 11am spoke with different Manager was told our 3rd room was still not ready, I explained well we are hostage here as we cant use the bathroom and we need to move asap. At this point we are forced to use room service, as we cant wash up and eat a meal in one of the resturants till we have moved. 12:30 next call to Manager room is still not ready but they have another room they could send us to, would have been nice if the front desk or Manager could have called as they new we are waiting (more poor customer service) Well room 3 was a nice room as far as the bedding, linens, 42 inch flat screen but all of the rooms are tired\/worn out, and if you want to use your laptop there is no wifi, the first 2 rooms have a cord located behind the tv which you pull across the room to plug into your pc, if you want to set on a table, your other option is to stand and hold your pc in front of the tv plug in and log on. omg you pay a 10.00 per day resort fee for 2 bottles of water, free internet and a newspaper one would think if would be wifi, If you stay here you have access to 2 other casinos via there tram, as we walked around all 3 of the casinos we were surprized to see most of the resturants are empty, some had 0 customers first reason is luxor, mandolay bay, and excalibur are priced 30 to 50% higher then if you eat further down the strip, 2nd they close up at 10pm unlike New York New York there resturants are open late and they even have specials that start after midnight. Last but not least one night as we headed back to our room we pass the front desk around 11pm they had one desk clerk and a line of 50 plus people who wanted to check in they have 30 counters to check yet with this line only One counter was open. mmmm go figure

I stayed in the pyramid with 2 Queen beds.  The room was really spacious and had a nice Flat Screen TV.  That seems to be what the judge of a room is.  I stayed on the 25th floor and had nice views inside the casino from my hallway and outside the window.  Luxor is a little off the beaten path, but it's a nice hotel with interesting features.  The price is right - you can usually get a room for $30-60 a night even on the busiest of nights.

The 2 biggest drawbacks I had to staying at Luxor is that I had a room that was West facing.  The sun, setting in the west, beat on my windows all day and the room was like 90 degrees.  No joke!  This was with the drapes completely closed.  If they were open, it would have been over 110 degrees inside, without exaggeration.

This leads me to the 2nd drawback, which is the antiquated AC unit.  It wasn't powerful enough to keep up, so no matter how high I had it turned on, the room was not cooling down.  My advice is to request a room that is facing one of the other directions and you will be good to go.  I don't remember my room #, but it was directly opposite the check in desk, so maybe request a room that is above the check in desk.

I know that seems OCD, but it will make a huge difference in your stay.",5,1,0

There are plenty of Starbucks in this building as well as some restaurants.  An abundance of slots and some table games as well.  The casino has a little for everyone.

i'm not kidding, i didn't watch any horror movie, we weren't drunk, and i'm not that imaginative either. but i'm asian, and yes supernatural exists, go to bali if you don't trust me, and what happened here is still somewhat nothing compared to bali.

i got the spa suite a week ago, to be precise, it's room 12860

it was our first night in vegas, so when we saw the room, we THOUGHT it was okay, but as soon as we moved to caesar's palace and hard rock, that room was like shit, but still better and cheaper that mgm though

here's the problem, believe it or not, this hotel (especially this room) is haunted. laugh if you want, i don't care. i'm writing this review for those of you who are ""sensitive"" so that you won't be attacked in here

the suite consists of the living room and the bedroom with jacuzzi, i slept in the living room and nothing happened to me (or probably because i slept so deep) but they who sleep in the bedroom were attacked the whole night

my sister slept next to the jacuzzi and it was dry, we cleaned it out, there were no sound for like hours but around 3am, the water started to pour again and stop and pour again and stop, just like someone is teasing her, then her blanket were pulled down gradually (it just doesn't makes sense at all for a blanket to go down with an interval) she grabbed back the blanket and she felt by herself that someone is pulling down the blanket, as soon as she grabbed the blanket, something grabbed her leg and pulled her down. she struggled and kicked but there were nothing to kick and suddenly every kind of terror disappeared. that's what happened to the bed next to jacuzzi

for the next bed that's located far from jacuzzi, there were these twin sisters of my girlfriend's who throughout the night heard the sound of cellphone interference through a speaker. the problem is, we didn't put our cellphone next to the bed, and afaik, there were no speakers at all near them. the final blow here is that one of the twins were physically twisted to the other way around by a certain of force, it's like being rolled forcibly

laugh if you want. but hey, different people experience different life. i wasnt born sensitive about this issue but they were born sensitive. so you might not be born sensitive but im sure my review will benefit someone else who's ""sensitive""

I want to like you. I mean, come on, you're a giant pyramid. However the 45 minute check-in line on a week day (not exaggerating) and the ten minute check-in process that made the line make more sense (still serious) was painful. 

What's even more painful? Being on the same side of the hotel as the pool -- that means being forced to listen to a very loud and proud rendition of Bruno Mars and every other top 40's hit at 8 a.m.. Sometimes your guests want to sleep in. Sometimes they don't want to be barraged with bad pop music until 10 o'clock. 

That brings me to my next point... the pool and hot tub are only open till 8. (Everyone told me all things in Vegas are 24 hours, your pool doesn't even stay up as late as my grandparents.) And your work out room closes at 7?

I want to like you, Luxor, I really do. You can start right now by turning down the music and restarting it in an hour with something sexier like Portishead or Goldfrapp. Please and thank you.

Yours,

I informed AJ Medina (Luxor Supervisor) that my Wi-Fi connection did not work during my stay and wanted to see if there was anything she could possibly do far as reducing my resort fee or whatever seemed feasible at the time. Ms. Medina replied, that no I am not going to adjust your resort fee and your Wi-Fi didn't work because you stayed in the east tower (I was not informed that Wi-Fi was not available in east tower upon check in time!) . I kindly pointed out to Ms. Medina, that my work colleague (Tracy Childress) who was staying next door at your sister property Excalibur experienced a similar issue and they had no problem comping her resort fee for the inconvenience. Ms. Medina replied sarcastically "" I highly doubt that, let me look into this to see if your telling the truth"", and to my surprise Ms. Medina actually took it upon herself to research my collogues personal information (not sure if this is Luxor protocol?) in the computer system. In conclusion, my issue was not rectified in any manner whatsoever, a simple apology would have even sufficed. I find this conduct very unprofessional and an embarrassment not only to me and my wife on the receiving end, but to Luxor as a overall",0,1,0

When we arrived at the hotel, the valet told us we had to pay to park for both the valet and for self park.  It isn't cheap either.  Come to find out that any hotel associated with MGM hotels has to pay to park.  Complete garbage!   

At check-in, the check-in clerk wasn't happy when we told her we prepaid for the room.  Our room had two options for beds, king or two queen beds.  We asked for the king but she was snotty and said only the two bed option was available, nor did she ask if we wanted to upgrade to a different room.  Which we would have paid the difference.

As far as our stay, typical hotel and casino.  Our room was clean but the air conditioning was lukewarm at best.  We did ask the maid but she said it was because of the sun and to keep our shades closed, which we did and it still didn't help.  

The gaming floor was okay, we played the penny slots.  They had some cool games.  We did try the buffet and it was decent.

Whatever awe the unique design and phony far-flung exoticism it may have once elicited has long been surpassed by much nicer hotels which haven't let their selling points go to rot. 

From the outside, Luxor looks like a dusty, long-abandoned talisman left in the front yard of a backwoods trailer park's lone hippie mystic. The inside looks like that hippie mystic's 35-year old sofa. 

Upon arrival, guests are treated like chum for rube-hungry hucksters. ""Checking in?"" asked a shark. ""Sure!"" we replied, thinking we were chosen to bypass the long check-in line because we radiate so much awesome. Instead, we were given the hard sell on a timeshare opportunity. ""Come see it,"" said another shark, a blonde this time. ""We'll even give you lunch!"" We deflected free tickets to the unsavory likes of Carrot Top and the Australian Bee Gees, then were offered a discount on the one show we expressed an interest in, the Beatles' Love, which just happened to be dark that weekend for performer vacations. 

The carny pitch work continued for the length of our stay in various corners of the grounds, and though I am generally polite to a fault I finally found that my best recourse was to simply wave them off like they were covered in dogshit. 

Elsewhere, the Luxor continued showing itself to be a top shelf discount destination, seemingly stuck in its '90s heyday. 

The ""inclinators"" were a shaky, queasy affair, and unless you got your bearings before departure you were in trouble. Depending upon where your room was located, your walk to and from your specific inclinator could be quite long. 

Which brings us to the rooms themselves: We specifically requested a non-smoking room, both in making our original reservation and again at the front desk upon check-in. Our request was clearly heard but was ignored. The room stunk o stale cigarette smoke, like the ghost of Dean Martin was slumming it. We requested a change to an actual non-smoking room and were given one with a shittier view. 

The TV turns on at nearly full volume. 

The bathroom was filthy. 

The buffet was dismal, with few healthy options that weren't completely wilted and bland. 

We left a day early, partly because the Luxor was such a bummer. If you ever see me there again, you'll know I messed up pretty badly.",6,5,0

- elevators are VERY SLOW and very creaky (glad that I made it to my floor - 13th)
- No Ice in any of the ice machines (tried 6 different locations on 3 different floors)
- No wireless - have to connect using a hard-wire cable if you can find it behind the TV

The desk staff was friendly helpful charming and fun to work with our group. They quickly assigned us two rooms that were joining which is what we wanted. It was a bit of a challenge finding the elevators for the West Wing so I would recommend some additional signage that is clear especially by the hallway near the Starbucks and the yogurt place. 

There was a huge variety of table games and slot machines. I really enjoy video blackjack so please keep those machines around. It was easy to get an m life card but if you ever needed help with your M life card the line was
kind of long move slowly. 

The bartenders at the center bar were great and had great suggestions we weren't sure what we really wanted to to drink. The chairs around the bar however were not particularly comfortable. 

I stayed in the west tower and my Verizon wireless didn't work well at all. No service and text messages wouldn't go through well at all. Was disappointed that they didn't even have wi-fi available in room. Was told I could hook my laptop up to the modem cable in the room...who carries a large laptop. I use only an iPad exclusively. Update your technology...I think Luxor can afford it. 

My one bad experience with Luxor staff was at the LAX nightclub. I was standing in line was asked to move to the left side by a short black man in a black suit that worked for the club. I moved to the left-hand lane like he asked but apparently it wasn't most left lane against the wall which I didn't even realize was there. The short black man got up in my face and said you have a problem getting against the wall. I felt physically threatened. Asked him to please calm down I didn't realize where I was supposed to go. He got literally 2 inches from my face and said ""excuse me what did you say"". At that point I just walked away this is not a pleasant part of my vacation nor a place I want to spend any money.

After visiting the property's casino many times on past visits, I decided to try the rooms out, as I usually stay and gamble on the Boulder Highway side of town. As some of the other reviewers have mentioned here, I thought it would be very unique to stay in a Pyramid room, so I gave it a try.  Keep in mind that this property has really done away with a lot of the Egyptian theming and artwork over the past few years, and is moving towards a more modern, hip look.  I kind of liked it better when it was Egyptian.

I'm a member of the players club, but got a much better rate directly on the Luxor's website utilizing one of their offers, which gives anywhere from 5-15% off the going room rate depending on what time you book it. I booked a Pyramid Deluxe Room at a rate of $116 per night, which was not bad for a weekend. Utilizing the offer meant paying for the room in advance, which was no problem.

I arrived at the Front Desk at around 11:30 pm. There was no check-in line whatsoever, but I'm guessing that it was due to the fact that it was almost midnight. The front desk clerk had no problem locating my reservation. However, I had paid for the room in full in advance but she kept saying that my debit card was not charged yet, and it declined when she tried to charge it for the full amount of the room. A couple of minutes later, she arrived with a manager saying there was a mix-up somewhere and that the room had indeed already been paid for. I didn't really appreciate the time she wasted in doing all that.

I was given a room on the second floor, and after locating the elevators, I realized that they had placed me in a East Tower Deluxe room instead of the Pyramid Deluxe room I had booked online. I'm aware that the room types and preferences are not guaranteed when booking on their website, and they classify the Tower rooms as being nicer and bigger than the Pyramid rooms (they actually classified the Tower room as a free upgrade,) but I decided to stay here specifically for the novelty of staying in the Pyramid. Point blank, if I would've known this was going to happen, I probably wouldn't have bothered staying here.

The East Tower room, #2333, although it wasn't what I originally reserved, was very nice. I didn't have any issues with cleanliness, maid service, wear and tear or anything else some of the other reviewers have pointed out. The one thing I did take note of was that I could hear the plumbing from other rooms and it was pretty loud. Whether someone was taking a shower or flushing the toilet, you could definitely hear it - almost louder than being directly in the room it was coming from.

I opted for the high-speed internet connection both nights and it worked flawlessly, along with the entertainment center and all the other amenities the room had to offer. The bathroom contained a separate deep-soaking tub and a glassed in shower stall. Water pressure was very good.

The casino is huge with a large variety of slots and tables. I actually won some money here, which is unusual for being on the Strip, period! Cocktail\/beverage service was very rapid.

The only restaurants I visited were LIttle Caesars Pizza and Nathan's Hot Dogs which are both located in the Food Court. Although they've always been great, I did notice they tended to be a bit pricier here than at their standalone stores, but hey, it's Vegas right?

Check-out was flawless, and I received a full refund on the cash incidental deposit I left with them, minus the charges for high-speed internet. They did ask me how everything was, but really didn't have too much to say when I explained that I didn't receive the room type I had originally booked. I did happen to notice that the check-in line was packed, slow moving and almost going out the front door at this time, so I can definitely agree with some other reviewers that it seems to stay very long during peak periods.

Overall, it was an okay stay, and other than the fact that I didn't get the Pyramid Deluxe room and the issue the desk clerk had with billing at check-in, the place was flawless and I'd definitely be back. I've heard that if you book through the Player's Club, you can use the North Entrance to check in, which is probably a big time saver, and also might have a better change of getting the room type you desire. I'll have to look into that on my next trip.  

Just a quick heads up - the spa suites in the Pyramid no longer have spas that are working.  I guess they are too old, and the property decided to discontinue the upkeep.  Some friends recently visited and mentioned that they're now just like regular tubs without jets.  Something to consider, because these rooms were always high-dollar, even when the spas were working!",6,0,2

Overall, it was a pleasant Hotel. If you know you're just going to be in and out of the room, or not necessarily staying in the Hotel\/Casino, then this is a great spot. 

We stayed in the Pyramid Spa Suite, which has a huge tub in the corner of the room, which overlooks Excalibur and South Strip. It has a separate shower, so it can please everyone. The room was clean upon arrival, we were checked in fairly quick. The elevators were of to the left, and around a corner, which just felt awkward. 

The Valet was quick getting us settled. Was kind of put off by the fact that he told my husband that ""they work separately from the guys inside"". Hmm, we knew that, and planned on tipping him. Just rubbed me the wrong way, sort of like he EXPECTED it? Maybe that's just me.

Our luggage was brought up to our room fairly quick, very impressed with that. 

The Hotel itself does seem a little outdated, for instance they didn't offer WiFi, but you could hook up your computer\/laptop to the Ethernet cable. I suppose I take partial responsibility for that downfall because I just took our tablet, and not the laptop. Also, reception SUCKS in this hotel! No signal whatsoever. 

I didn't realize that The Luxor had a walkway through to the Excalibur, so that was convenient. They also buddy-up with deals and offers. 

Oh, and those people who harass you into buying a timeshare? ANNOYING. I seriously considered walking around with a ""No Soliciting"" sign hanging from my neck. That's seriously such a put-off for the Hotel, I hope they realize that.

It's at a fantastic location, just minutes from the airport and still on the strip-though at the beginning. But it has a lot to offer besides the funky decor, the interior is gorgeous and there's a of food and exhibits. At the front desk is Evening Call, so you can already pick up drinks as you check in! We arrived and made online reservations and got assisted right away. They gave our room away, but I told her we were there for my birthday, so she hooked it up in the East Tower (the older part of the hotel) with a KING size suite.No wait at the front desk and were quickly accommodated.  It was awesome, but it was quite a walk and it's actually away from all the casino and the rest of the hotel. But quiet and comfortable is what I enjoy. The hotel came with free drink vouchers among st other complimentary things. 

The room itself .. some of the reviews are right. It's not as CLEAN as you would expect it, but it was neat and sanitary. There were some old spots and the sheets seem used, so we called in room service and had those exchanged quickly. The bed was super comfortable and bouncy! The bathroom was huge with a tub AND a shower, which was my home made hot tub since I had no idea where the pool was. 

The hotel itself has lots of restaurants and lounges, as well as a gentlemen's nightclub. It also is connected to Mandala Bay and Excalibur which has a tram that takes you there, so a rest up on your pretty feet from those heels. 

Sucks there wasn't wifi, but I was on vacation so I just wanted to enjoy myself. What did suck was the room didn't have free coffee which I'm so used to. The bathroom was well stocked with toiletries and fluffy, CLEAN, white towels. The AC\/Heater was old school, but worked like a charm. Sadly, being in the old part of the hotel our room view wasn't sexy what so ever! Regardless, it was a cheap and good stay for our quick Vegas trip.

I've been to the Sky Suites at Aria, so my expectations for expensive suites are astronomically high, and for the prices they charge, they should be.

This is an update so check out the former review if you want to know what a room in the pyramid is like; this is a review for one of the ""fancy"" suites in the tower - Room 21-253.

So I was here for a 21st birthday party for one of Jen S.'s coworkers. I didn't know her but apparently her dad bought her a suite for her birthday. We got up there and... oh gross. It looks like a mix between 1992 and ""Egyptian"" explosion. Think a beige, plastic column with a glass round on top for an entry table, and couch pillows embroidered with Anubis embalming a pharaoh (google it, it's a very common Egyptian tomb painting.) 

The view was of The Orleans. Ha. Ha. Ha.  The room was just incredibly tacky. It works for the cheaper rooms because it's not such an explosion of '90's ""Egyptian"" decor, but it's too much in these suites. 

The bathroom was huge but hideous. Think of a brass inclosed walk in shower and hunter green tiles. BLEH. It was too much to take in.

When we walked in, there was the trashiest girl I've ever seen, screaming at some guy, while sitting at the dining room table in the suite. Her weave was showing, she was dressed worst than a coke whore, and was covered in tats and her face and entire spine was pierced with CZs. She was 19. Gawd. When she pulled out a rolled up $100 and a ziplock filled with assorted pills, that was my cue to leave. I don't do drugs and I'm not going to be anywhere other people are openly doing drugs. If you stay around trash, you begin to stink so Jen and I bounced real quick, told them we'd meet them at Haze and we headed on down to LAX.

Das Luxor ist zwar recht weit am Ende des Strips aber da das Wetter selbst im Dezember meist (bis auf einen Tag) super war, hat das Laufen nicht gestört. Ansonsten gibts ja auch noch Taxen und die Hotels & Casinos in unmittelbarer Nähe haben einiges zu bieten.
Unser Zimmer war gut, normales Double Queen in der Pyramide. Preisleistungsverhältnis total okay. Da es nach einer Nacht allerdings durch den heftigen Regen ein wenig ins Fenster geleckt hatte und wir danach fälschlich ein Raucherzimmer zugewiesen bekommen haben zeigte sich das Management beim zweiten Umzug großzügig und hat und in die neu gebauten Tower verfrachtet. Wir wurden in eine der wundervollen Tower Luxus Spa Suites upgegraded und wollten unser neues Reich kaum mehr verlassen.
Auch das Casino und der hauseigene Club haben uns gut gefallen, auch wenn wir kaum gespielt haben. 
Das einzig Nervige war die Raucherlaubnis im Casino, durch dass man ja nun zwangsläufig durchgehen muss um zum Essen, in sein Zimmer zurück, in den Club oder überhaupt irgendwo hin zu gelangen. Da stinken die Klamotten wie nach nem Clubbesuch.
Das Essen ist in Ordnung und auch die langen Schlangen beim Einchecken kann ich nicht so bemängeln. Es sind ausreichend Mitarbeiter beim Check-In, wenn man aber nunmal mit 30 Leuten auf einmal ankommt, dann muss man halt 10 Minuten warten. Fand ich nicht schlimm.

The Luxor Hotel and Casino is were we decided to stay. At the time, the Luxor was one the best facilities on the strip. Yes, there was the Bellagio, the Venetian, and the Palms recently opened but you could not beat the price for what I considered to be a 4 star facility. I made two subsequent trips to Vegas in 2009, and my most recent visit just last month December 2016, the latter with my wife. 

While I wouldn't consider this place to be a dump, it seems to be well on its way. 
During my recent visit, I started to feel nostalgic as I walked through the doors of the hotel. Could it be this is the first time my wife and I have been in Vegas together since our initial trip nearly14 years ago checking into the same hotel? It felt as if we were just there yesterday. Everything looked the same as it did when we checked out over a decade ago. Then it dawned on me, it wasn't nostalgia; every thing was exactly the same. Except for some additional stores, and a couple of Starbucks locations, nothing has changed since I checked out in 2003. Walking into the room was like stepping into a time warp. Everything from the bathroom to the window curtains looked exactly the same. It seems like the Luxor is taking this Ancient theme to the extreme. 

The outdated decor presented some dangers as well. The iron-board nearly smashed me in the face as I tried to open it; the iron itself had no setting on the knob so beware of your delicates. 

There was a silver lining in this stage of stagnation. My wife loves the classic Wheel of Fortune slot machines and the Luxor still had a few of them stashed on the floor. 
The Luxor is not the best mega joint on the strip, but is still probably still one of the best values if you want to stay on the strip. Though outdated, the pyramid rooms are a pretty decent size; just don't expect four star amenities.",7,2,2

Let's start at the beginning.  I'll start by admitting I'm no fan of Las Vegas, as it embraces everything I think is wrong with America.  Being of that mindset, I was thrilled to find out that an annual convention was being held this year in Las Vegas, and it would necessitate a three day excursion to the city that has perfected tackiness.

It started when I needed to book a room for my stay.  The first night was a modest $139, with rates climbing exorbitantly on the following two nights.  With a $400 stay for Tuesday night, I ended up booking the only room I could within walking distance of the Mandalay Bay.  

Upon arriving at the hotel I was immediately asked about taking a timeshare pitch, an ominous sign that I'll talk more about later.  As for check-in, I did not have an excruciatingly long line, as I'd expected, but was given a double bedded smoking room in the pyramid, after requesting a king sized, non-smoking room in the newer tower.  Upon arriving in my room, I found it was dark, cold, loud and worn.  I investigated and found the hotel had opened in 1993, and for a property only 14 years old, it's definitely feeling its age.  (No wonder with 5,000 rooms and constant wear\/tear with Vegas revelers.)  The beds had dingy bedding and only two *uncomfortable* pillows.  My $15 Internet connection didn't work (but wonder of all wonders) it did work long enough to charge my credit card.  Speaking of charges - the hotel and casino likely are jamming cell phone signals, as I was not able to make or receive any phone calls the entire three days I was there.  As I was there for work, I needed to be in contact with co-workers and clients on a regular basis.  This definitely proved to be a problem.  I had to resort to using the hotel phone twice to make long distance phone calls - once to check my voicemail, and once to instruct someone to call me at the hotel.  Upon getting my final bill, I was charged $14 and $12, respectively, for a one minute and (according to the bill) a zero minute phone call.  

Add to my frustration every time I went to enter or leave the hotel lobby the same timeshare pitchman\/woman would ask if I was at the hotel for vacation.  The final straw was when I was checking out and they asked if I'd like to come back for $99.  I turned and said, ""You could never pay me enough money to come back to your hotel, let alone BUY into it.""

Bottom line: Do not stay here.  Whatever the rate you're quoted, it is not worth it.  If I had to stay here again, I would make sure you had no reason to use your phone and could be guaranteed a room outside the pyramid tower.  Don't hope to do a lot of gambling or partying here, either, as there's one overpriced lounge in the lobby ($9 for a whiskey and coke) and a small, crowded casino.  Save your money for somewhere that's worth it.",1,0,2

We already knew about those people that try to get you to do a meeting to get free or discounted show tickets. So we were prepared to say no. It started to become a habit each time we walked by those timeshare workers. They would always bother you asking if you wanted discounted show tickets. It happened multiple times while we were there. This was really annoying as they are waiting in the walkways to prey on the people who don't know. This is something that will probably make me not come back here. 

The casino itself is ok. Nothing really exciting about this place. It feels nostalgic being there since I remember coming when I was a kid to ride the rides and watch the shows.

First off, the 877 number for Room Reservations takes you through 10 MINUTES OF ADS for other services. As soon as I thought I was through it, the recording said the number for my area had been changed. I took the number down, called it, and it ended up being Nationwide 411...  I called the general number and got transferred to the Front Desk, just as quickly, I got disconnected. I called back again, and his time a guy answered and helped me out. He emailed me my statement, after realizing they had someone else's email account associated to my number, so they got my statement the first time perhaps, but to date, there are no pending charges. The guy who took care of me was very nice at the beginning, but then seemed pissed off at the end and promptly hung up before I could say thank you. Not to fond of this quick check out thing. I could have saved the trouble I guess and could have gone to the front desk, it was only 645am, lines couldn't have been that long.

The hotel theme is really cool and I have always a big fan of egyptian art.  We got to stay in the Pyramid. We also had a view of the awesome looking lobby from our hallway. The only downside is the elevators which are shaky and ride on a small slant. It's not a deal breaker but it wasn't always pleasant. I'd still go there again despite that.  The rooms are decent, good sized and clean.  They don't have all the amenities (coffee maker, fridge, etc). but they were still nice and the maids cleaned it nicely every day.  We saw the Carrot Top show while were were there which was hilarious and the Titanic Exhibit which was really cool. Our room was also not a far trek from the pool and it was nice to look at the Pyramid from the pool.  The hotel connects to the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay hotels without having to go outside.  There were also a lot of restaurant choices and they have a really good buffet deal.  I would go back again if i could but i'd probably want to try out other hotels there just to get new experiences.  I'd definitely recommend it to someone whose never been there.",0,0,0

The rooms are a bit annoying if your staying in the pyramid as you cant really look out if the windows I kept banging my head when I went over as I kept forgetting they were slanted. Another down side to the hotel is they don't have safes in the rooms you have to keep going to reception tother safety deposit boxes.

The only downside to the Luxor is that it's at the very end of the strip. Not a big deal though, still plenty of bang for your buck.

For starters when we first arrived to the hotel, we waited a long time in line to check in.  There were only a few ladies checking guests in, a manager was walking around but did nothing to expedite the check in process.  He ignored the long line of people waiting and there was no sense of urgency, they could care less about their customers.

When we finally got into our room we were very dissapointed, the carpet was dirty, there was not a safety latch to secure our room from the inside, the view of our room was blocked by a pillar. 

The room was very outdated and dirty,  Our bathroom was not clean at all, there were some bodily fluid stains all over the bathroom wall.

When I woke up the next morning even though our room was a non smoking room, it wreacked of cigarrete smoke.

My wife and I got one of those all inclusive packages that gave is tickets to the exhibits and Kriss Angel with buffet entry. It really wasn't a bad deal considering how much the cost was without bundling everything. 

The staff there was awesome from the valet down to the bell service. The hotel itself was about a subpar for the money we spent on it. We took the rumbly elevator to the 16th floor and had to make the trek to the other side of the pyramid to get to our room. We were thankful that the Sherpa of the hotel, the bell service was there to taxi our bags to our room. 

The air conditioner in the room was loud and pointed to the hot slanted window of the pyramid, rendering the rest of the room to feel like a sweat lodge. The bathroom was a good size; however there was no tub but only a shower. The shower head felt like a pressure washer and would take a layer or two of skin off after bathing. I guess it's to get the cigarette smell off from the casino. 

The buffet at the Luxor was meek and bland; I suggest journeying over to the Excalibur to hit their buffet. The buffet there seemed fresher and had more variety.
The pool was overcrowded and only 3ft deep in all areas, with plenty of cigarette butt sightings.

I have never stayed at Luxor Hotel prior to this stay. From the time arriving to the hotel, I have had nothing but problems. From checking into the hotel to getting a room with a A\/C that doesn't function properly. Then this story doesn't end here. Its just getting started!  On the 2nd day of our stay we rented a car at Avis which is located downstairs at the main lobby. The person at the front desk told me that they had a Cadillac Escalade when I paid for the amount 300  for 2 days, she then finally tells me that the car is actually unavailable and we got a different car. On top of that the same night my parents extended their stay at Luxor for 1 more night. The person who was handling the paper work FORGOT to put my parents room in correctly so in the middle of the day we got a call telling us to check out of the room or else the luggage's will be thrown out!  I am not kidding you and I barely ever complain but this story only gets worse from here. So my parents arrive at the hotel asking the front desk why the room wasn't booked if the person the day before took all of their information and credit card. Come to find out the card was never charged and the person clearly didn't know how to do his job professionally and the right way. So lets get to the main part of this horrific stay I and my parents had to encounter. Its the last day of our stay . Check out was at 11. My parents checked out of the hotel. There flight wasn't leaving Vegas till 5:45 so they checked in the luggage's to the bell desk man. While sitting in the casino spending last hours at the Luxor there time came to get there luggage's back. Well now come to find out someone ended up walking away with my parents luggage's. Inside was my moms wallet, clothes, shoes, purse and all the identity information. Since my parents are foreign the Hotel managers handled this situation like I am sure they handle all of their situations irresponsibly and unprofessional asking them is they needed something to drink or eat. Are you kidding me ?? of course my parents aren't hungry how could you be when the bell desk man gave away your luggage to some stranger who is nothing but a thief.  When asking to review the camera footage it took them 4 days to review the cameras. I had to fly back into Las Vegas to speak with the general manager who's name is Mark Schonau. After speaking with him on terms of what will happen they told me because the amount was in the thousands of the loss we had to go through rick management. These people who work here have no value in self respect or others let alone know how to handle business and keep it running. Believe me when I say I will take this to every news station possible. If you want to stay at a place who cares nothing about their guests than feel free to stay at Luxor . They are good at doing that !. Have fun and I hope no one EVER gets to experience this type of horrific  stay! I can tell you I will tell everyone NOT to stay at Luxor and to make sure I spread the word.",0,0,0

The rooms were clean an nicely organized. There's some pretty cool artifacts and statues around  the hotel. 

We went to see the Fantasy show and it was ok but was disappointed not to see any snatch :(. On the third day we woke up to the sound of a leak inside our room. I called that in to the front office and they changed us to a luxury suite on a tower which was pretty cool. The towers are much nicer than the pyramid(at least from the inside).

The rooms were standard. They were heavily used but it is expected and I don't really mind as long as it clean which it mostly was. I bring my own sheets and pillows too. 

When I was leaving I got lost (again) and asked a officer who was standing in front of some doors if he knew where the buses were. He decided to lead to them instead of giving me directions, which was great. He lead me toward the buses and while we were walking he said some racist things that I really couldn't believe.

My first Vegas trip memory was made here with my friends back in 94 and I can remember friends puking in the hallway and getting drunk in the room (we were broke!)  The service is always pretty good in Vegas unless you are a real A-Hole.  Some of the older rooms still have popcorn ceiling but the newer parts are a little nicer.,0,0,0

I understand they are being acquired\/refurb'd by MGM, but this is supposed to be an area of world-class operations; with all the potential the unique layout provides and the luxury of having some measure of liquidity, the maintenance and operations Heads should all suffer the proverbial roll.

The Spa Suites are on the corners of the hotel's pyramid, and they feature a sleeping area with queen beds, and a large sitting area with a Spa \/ Hot Tub situated closer to the window for a wonderful view of the LV skyline and strip, or the LV mountains (depending on where you are facing).

I will say that the Luxor may not be as elegantly decorated as the Bellagio, but these rooms, their size and floor plan; as well as, its amenities are well worth the price. We paid $400\/night for our room, and it was definitely worth it.

The inclinators (instead of elevators) are a nice and memorable touch to the overall experience.

And since the hotel had a monorail station within, it made traveling down the strip simple and effortless. Instead of fighting the crowds on the street, we just hopped hotels through the stip using the monorail. Now, it does get crowded in there during the busy hours, but it certainly is a welcome change to the morass of the crowds and traffic on the strip.

If you're in LV, and want to experience the Suite life, I would highly recommend you try one of these Suites before you plunk down $$$\/night elsewhere.",0,0,0

Pros: The room was free. Lots of dining options in the mall between Luxor and Mandalay. Wifi was free and very fast. Good water pressure, and the shower did get very hot.

Cons: Everything else. 

The room was dirty and shabby. Carpet was stained. Bed linens smelled musty. No makeup mirror in the bathroom. Bathroom was  dirty. Not enough outlets, especially near the bed. The hotel was extremely loud, so I was constantly woken up by slamming doors from the hallway all night. Stay away from adjoining rooms--I could hear everything the people next to me were up to. I switched to a non-adjoining room my third night and that was much better. Rooms did not have a mini-fridge or coffee pot. Room service is not available after 3 PM. Casino pumps in this weird incense-scent that gave me headaches. Toiletries did not include conditioner (only shampoo, body wash, and lotion). 

My coworker and I were so unhappy with the Luxor that we were willing to pay full-price to transfer to another, nicer hotel on the strip for the duration of the conference. Unfortunately, even though our reservation was free due to Mandalay's mistake, the manager at the Luxor told us that we would have been charged full price for the full duration of our stay if we tried to check-out early to relocate. 

This hotel is VERY inexpensive (I just checked the website and rooms are as low as $38\/night with a $30\/day resort fee) so it may appeal to someone who is looking for a serious bargain. That said, I will not be coming back.",2,1,1

I have worked in hotels for 5 yrs in chicago and know when I'm dealing with someone who doesn't like their job and thinks me wanting a good room is a huge inconvenience to them. I paid $20 upgrade through Expedia because I thought I was going to get a view. Instead I am told nope, they don't guarantee views and only thing I get for my money is a bathtub.

Called to tell them and they didn't ask me anything just offered to move, to a upgraded room for my continued inconvenience, nope they put me a few rooms down and never asked where the blood was, I know they rented back out. So next day I go down and ask for a Manger and got Crystal and from the beginning I was a huge inconvenience to her, she never apologized and even told me I need to act better when I got upset with her sheer disregard for how they were messing up my trip. She offered to comp my Resort fees,  which basically broke me even with the upgrade I already paid, so I got nothing for my many issues, nothing but attitude.

My mom is a travel agent and had been guaranteed a certain rate and the lady was quite indignant with her.  Our rooms were not ready (it was noon and we knew we were early and we were not expecting them to be ready).  However when we went back, about 5 minutes before the regular 3:00 check-in time we were once again curtly ""assisted"" by the same lady.  We asked if our rooms would now be ready.  We were told that just because 3:00 was their regular check-in time it did not guarantee that the rooms would be available.  Let me see if I understand this?  You have reservations, you check-in right at check-in time and you may not be able to get into your room?  Doesn't make much sense to me.  Anyways, we were surprisingly able to get into our rooms about 4 doors away from each other.  The rooms (tower deluxe) were nothing great.  The bed was comfortable and that's about the only positive.  Not enough towels or pillows.  My parents' room was missing a lamp.  No full length mirrors, only the ones on the big TV\/closet cabinet.  And what hotel in Vegas can justify not having a safe in the room???  Don't they know people come to Vegas to gamble??  Also would have appreciated a mini-fridge of some sort.  We didn't eat anywhere except for the little deli which wasn't too bad.  The food court is only open til midnight which made us take our late night (read 1:00am) craving for pizza over to New York New York.  Most of the dealers and other staff were nice enough.

Upon arriving to our room, we were pleasantly surprised at how large it was even on an angle. We were on the 6th floor pyramid room. 
The bathroom was clean and well stocked and we always had hot water when needed. The only downfall of the bathroom was even when you have the light on the fan is on and it seems like smoke air from the casino or smoking rooms was coming through the vent. 
The room was cleaned everyday and had everything we needed. The TV had a lot of channels however the remote volume buttons were broken, nothing major just a small annoyance.

It's in that in-between land of kitsch and klassy, somehow not quite making up its mind what it is. 

Even though the black pyramid still has that sleek look about it, there are tell-tale signs of trashiness like having Carrot Top as their permanent comedy attraction. The rooms are average with some faux-Egyptian touches thrown in on the bedspreads and the TV cabinet, but for $80 per night, who am I to complain? Well, truth be told, the ice machine was broken and what really blew was the elevator, you should pardon the expression. Because it aligns with the contours of the pyramid, it goes up diagonally, and your stomach does a downshift when it moves. I can well imagine finding yourself on your knees as it jerks upward and not because you're glad to see me. 

The parking garage is quite a trek probably because they didn't have cars in Cleopatra's time, just barges. Speaking of which, they don't have the Nile River cruise surrounding the casino anymore. I guess the owners must have thought it looked cheesy compared to the canal in the Venetian. Yeah, like having a ""Do Not Disturb"" door hanger featuring Carrot Top is not cheesy.

Basically today I was told that after the ""internal investigation"" the woman Lisa in lost and found said she didn't steal my things.  Again, it could have been anybody working in Lost and Found during those 4 days before it was sent back in the mail.  My response to the man working on my case was "" no one is going to admit to stealing!""  Basically I got a ""sorry lady.""  He never said he interviewed anyone else either.  I felt like my claim was just swept under the rug.  The way the investigator treated me it was as if I was the one pulling a fast one!  For a company this size compensation would have been nothing to them.  Having to replace all the items I just bought cost me an extra $450.   I am staying at this hotel in December for a bachelorette party, but after that I will never be back again!   Shame on you for being so blase about this matter!  You have thieves working for you! 
 
Here is the email:
I am writing to you to bring to your attention theft of my belongings while they were in your care. I stayed at your hotel August 15th for one night, reservation was under Jayson Khademi and D'Lisa Ledgewood. When leaving in the morning I left my backpack on the bench at valet and once I realized this I called right away. Lisa at lost and found informed me she has my bag but since it didn't have any identification in it we went over what was inside. Right on top I had a gallon bag filled with skin care products, most of them were brand new because I purchased them right before my 2 week road trip. Lisa even joked that I had quite a bit of skin care items and I told her that I was a salon owner in Scottsdale and an Aesthetician so my skin has to look amazing. She told me how to go online to claim the bag and have it sent back to me. We were on our way to Sedona and the cabin we were going to be staying out didn't have internet. I told this to Lisa and informed her that I would fill out the necessary forms when I got home on Sunday. When I received my bag back 90% of my skin care items were not there. I am not in anyway accusing Lisa, I am sure there were many people working at that station from Thursday until the next Monday that could have had access to it. But because of the conversation I had with Lisa I know all my products were there when the bag was turned in.

List of the missing items and their cost, all were Bioelements which are found exclusively in salons:
Moisture Positive Cleanser $34
Advanced Vitamineral C Complex $50
CreataFirm $62
LightPlex $60
Sunscreen $42
Sleepwear $62
LiLash $140

Total cost of products stolen $450

I had to go an repurchase all of these items at a cost of $450. The way I see it my one day trip to your hotel cost me an extra $900! I have been staying at the Luxor for 19 years. I have always been satisfied with the service until now. It was bad enough thinking I lost my bag so imagine how happy I was to know that it was turned in with all my things still in it.

I recently came here with wife for a 2 night stay on a Thursday and Friday.  When we arrived to check-in at 1:30 a.m., there was a 15-20 minute wait.  The hotel was out of the standard rooms, so we were upgraded to a suite.  However, when we went to the suite, we were terribly disappointed.

The room smelled musty, like it had poor ventilation.  It was creepy because it looked like no one had been in the room for a long time.  The suite was poorly lit and ill-configured.  This may be because it was at the corner of the pyramid.  In the toilet was the feces of the previous guest.  There were two HVAC units in the suite: one did not work and the other we could not turn off. 

The bedding was not soft to the point of being scratchy and rough on the skin.  We checked out after 1 night.  We did receive a full refund, including of the resort fee.  I would avoid this hotel. If you want to spend the same amount of money on the strip nearby, consider Excalibur.",6,3,2

Flat panel television (not much of a channel selection, but that's par for Strip hotels - they want you downstairs playing). The lighted closets built into the television cabinet - which includes an in-room safe - were a nice touch.

The main drawback is how spread out it is. The towers were added after the pyramid was built, and it shows. The path to the tower elevators is long and winding. There are also only two levels to the parking garage, and the bottom level is usually full - which means parking your car out in the summer sun, not fun when you're leaving.

We called several times because it took so long.

Security finally arrived and were nice and took a report and moved us to one of the rooms in the newer towers. The procedure was to wait 24 hours to see if the bugs were bedbugs or not. We went to speak to a manager after the 24 waiting period and they said the ""bedbug"" test came back negative. However, this still does not mean there weren't DEAD AND CRAWLING INSECTS in the bed (we have photos and video).

There were two flat screen TVs in each of the areas, and the jet tub was a delight--especially after a long night of dancing! The beds were a little hard\/uncomfortable, and the pillows gave me a sore neck (so bring your own). Also, we ended up spending a lot on cabs since we were going to places in the middle of the strip (i.e., XS at Encore, Cirque du Soleil at Treasure Island, Lavo at the Palazzo, the Mirage, Hard Rock and Bellagio Casinos). I would do the calculations, because you may fare better staying at a slightly more expensive hotel (Flamingo, Treasure Island, etc.) near the popular, must-see casinos. Also, this casino didn't seem that happening, but we were also visiting during the ""slow season"" in November, so this might be the reason. You probably won't spend much time here once you see it though!

Although the prices appear cheap compared to others in the area, it AIN'T CHEAP ENOUGH to get me to step foot in this shit-hole ever again. First of all, it may be on the strip but nowhere near where anyone coming to Vegas wants to be.... your at least a 5 minute cab ride to anywhere you might want to venture besides Mandalay Bay... which is amazing. I'd rather sleep in a Mandalay Bay bathroom than rest my head on a Luxor owned pillow. Blech! 

The second we stepped into this dark, creepy, dirty, cheap place we were beyond confused. WHERE THE F*CK IS THE LOBBY? There are NO correct signs. We walked around for at least 20 flippin' minutes before even finding the check-in area. And what do ya know, they don't do early check-ins! Who woulda thought such a disgusting place would not accommodate to their guests needs! Ha! So after talking to 3 different employees who barely spoke Enlgish.... go figure.... we finally we're able to place our luggage behind the front desk to go drown ourselves in alcohol to be cleansed of the filth that is the Luxor. (Wait til I tell you how they lost the tag to our bags, that ones a doozy!)

After our 50 pound bags weren't weighing us down, we decided to check out the hotel. I considered, maybe, just maybe I was judging a book by it's cover. But nope! This book is shit, just like it's cover! We couldn't get 20 steps without being harassed by a Luxor employee... ""Hey! You guys from around here?"", ""Hey, you guys interested in seeing a free show?"", ""Hey, you guys interested in additional accommodations?"", oh and my favorite ""Hey sexy, you come to Vegas often?"" .... ""Hey, SEXY?"" Where am I? MEXICO???? Get outa here with your grossness you Luxor creeps! 

Besides the obnoxious employees, when was this place built? And I don't even need to ask if any renovations have taken place, cus that's pretty obvious! The hotel is a straight maze. It's beyond confusing. When you ask an employee how to get to a certain area of the hotel, they give you landmark directions.... ""turn left at the Starbucks"".... THERE'S 5 STARBUCKS IN THIS PLACE DIP-SHIT! Not one ounce of sunlight creeps into this dreary tomb. And the decor.... wait, what decor? Isn't this supposed to be Egyptian themed? We ARE in a f*cking pyramid! And what's with all the dead body exhibits? The ONLY thing I thought was even remotely intriguing was that the Titanic exhibit was there, although I had already seen it at Great America, SO yeahhhhh. 

After attempting to give this place a shot, we went back to get our bags and head to our rooms. When retrieving our bags, we handed a rude bell boy our tag and he vanished to the back, returning with other bags for other guests. We waited about 20 minutes without bags. What the Hell? No one else ever asked us if we had been helped, they just let us stand there looking like tards. Finally, I spoke up.... ""Is he planning on bringing us our bags anytime today or?"" Ugh. Now to our room we go..... or so we thought. ""The elevators are down this hall to the left."" we were told. We follow the hall down and to our surprise come to a 4 way split... which way? There are 3 lefts and NO SIGNS! WOW, REALLY? Now, my patience level is serious at negative 27349826945682. So funny that the employee told us that the ELEVATORS we're down this hall and to the left, because in this hotel there is no such thing as an ELEVATOR.... they are called INCLINATORS and go side to side, not up and down. Oh and when you get in the INCLINATOR, it won't go anywhere until you slide your key, so noooo we didn't ride the INCLINATOR back and forth for 5 minutes before realizing this little fact, cus like I've mentioned before there are NO SIGNS and the employees are VERY intelligent! 

Now for our room. It was, whatever. Motel 6 I'm sure has similar or nicer rooms. Sure it has all your basic necessities, a bed, a bathroom, a TV from the 70s, 2 lamps, no decor, no view. Like I said, it was, whatever.

We originally booked a Pyramid Room, and was upgraded to a room in one of the Towers. Though I would have loved to have stayed in the Pyramid itself, a King size bed was much more enticing.

Our room was clean and large (Hello two wardrobes with lights? I like!), the shower and the bath tub being separate to one another was a bit odd, but whatever. The bed itself was amazingly comfortable. I'm usually not a fan of hotel beds, but plenty of soft pillows, comfortable mattress and clean bedding.

The resort fee? Lame. If you're going to charge me extra, how about having WiFi? For all the marketing around the hotel encouraging you to Check in on Foursquare or get social with the Luxor, providing WiFi to your paying guests seems like a no brainer.

We did receive 2 free drink coupons for each night we were staying at the hotel, so the additional resort fee wasn't that big of a deal as we got 6 drinks out of it. Heads up if you're expecting the included newspaper to arrive in the morning at your room - it doesn't, you need to pick it up in a store near the check-in. 

Also, if you're craving coffee in the morning, you'll just have to suck up the additional cost Starbucks charges in the hotel, the prices are jacked up, but to be expected.

Cons: 

- End of the strip
- Mandatory resort fee
- No WiFi
- No coffee maker in your room
- Worst buffet
- Pool isn't open very late (closed at 6pm while we were there)
 
Pros:

- Dude. Ancient Egyptian theme. Sweet!
- Pretty inexpensive for Vegas
- Titanic Exhibit. Surprisingly very good. Was expecting something super cheesy but it was very well put together and curated.
- Easy connections to the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay
- Possible Criss Angel spottings makes for much hilarity.

I agree with previous posters that it's awesome to have slanted windows and to go up high in the pyramid and look down at the crazy slanted view.  Love it!

Beds were relatively comfy and warm, the AC unit rattled a little, but we all passed out at night so I don't think it was a problem.  We needed extra towels which were bought up to us relatively quickly after we requested them, which was great.

The Pyramid appeal stops at the lobby here. We were stuck in Las Vegas for an extra day because of a plane crash in San Francisco. Being an upper-tier member of United, the airline offers us a crashpad at Luxor, which, to me, is a dump.

*Pyramid room 13011. Piping hot even the curtains were drawn---the gurgling air condition unit is barely working. We decided to drop off the bags and luggage, go out to grab food and come back to see if the room had cooled down. About two hours later we returned, the room hardly cooled, and the hallway outside was way cooler than the room No refrigerator. No ice bucket. No bottled water. WTF?!

*Called front desk and got the response that they were completely full house. The clerk said she would send an engineer to examine the a\/c but could not say how soon the engineer will be there. After the airport delay and cancellation, we were not in the mood to be out and about in the heat. We just wanted to rest so we asked for a new room. The request was denied by Shelley.

*She did offer a room on the 2nd floor in the Pyramid, but only if the engineer came to confirm a\/c unit is not working. *SIGH* Later they relented to give us the room so we packed up again and went down to front desk again to exchange room. Another clerk, who was way more sympathetic with our situation, offered us free upgrade to a room on 7th floor in the West Floor. So much better, and cooler, with  much better fixtures and amenity.

*New room (West Tower 7212) is nice enough, but nothing like what I'm used to. They have NO IN-ROOM WIFI despite the mandatory $18 resort fee. No complimentary bottled water. No refrigerator. No rain shower. 

Overall this is not my kind of hotel. Poor choices of restaurants, more catering toward the chain-restaurant\/fastfood crowds. Hallways reek of cigarette. Poor noise insulation. It is no wonder this is offered as a free crashpad. Luxor is definitely on the low end of the Strip.

I enjoyed the themed lobby and felt like the rooms in the tower were fine by normal city hotel standards, but Vegas has a lot of great hotels so when you are comparing to that bar it's below average. 

The biggest cons are that its location is terrible if you don't plan to stay at this hotel and its adjacent hotels. It also doesn't have WiFi but it does have free internet if you can plug in to a single ethernet port. If you've got a family and WiFi devices you'll probably want to bring your own router to solve this problem.  Bandwidth is limited and cellular access is spotty in the city of Las Vegas, so keep this in mind - online gamers \/ movie watchers are going to be unhappy campers anywhere in the city.

You are a reasonable walk from the Mandalay Bay Casino which is one of my favorites in the city and the theme of Luxor and Excalibur are fun for kids.  

My room was clean and above average but I had to do A LOT of walking in this hotel which became tiresome very quickly.

This is unacceptable in my opinion, especially with a casino that is so far from everything.  We had to walk over to the Excalibur to find anything open (other than the overpriced, random bars that are actually inside the casino where you can just grab a quick drink while gambling - we wanted a place to sit down for food and a drink).  The rooms are very old and dated and overdue for a Tropicana-style renovation.  I left the minute that the wedding was over and moved to a more reasonable casino on the Strip.

Mainly because of the fact that it's in a pyramid. Sure, looks cool from the outside, and we all get excited when you're driving in and see the light from the top as you approach town.

But, as you can see from some photos people posted, the room has a tilted ceiling and it's weird. I felt claustrophobic in there. They also suggest ""keeping the curtains closed at all times"" due to the heat. So why would you want a room with a view? Where am I? I'd like to see outside please.

The check-in process was the longest line i've ever encountered in my life at a hotel.

Also the walkways to get inside the rooms are 22+ stories high, and way up there it gave me some vertigo to even glance at the downstairs.

We ate at both the sushi place and the taco place inside. Good, but super expensive.

Spent a day at the pool here; that was fun. Friendly staff, clean pool, and a cabana for $150. We got rained out though. I was thinking we should be offered some sort of pro-rated refund for the cabana since we weren't able to spend the day there as planned, but that was not offered.

I've stayed at a lot of places around Las Vegas.  Everything from the old Westward Ho and Circus Circus to Bellagio,  Venetian, Palms and several others.

Luxor was a surprise and not a good one.  

Of course, like all strip hotels it has pretty nice public spaces and c'mon, the pyramid concept itself is pretty cool, butt he rooms are just sad!

On this visit, the pools and spas are drained, my rooms and others I know of are dated, worn furniture, worn beddings, marks on walls.

And don't even think to expect a hot water\/coffee maker.  That's only for the Motel 6s and Holiday Inn Express...ok, sarcastic there.

As there is a mandatory resort fee...not really what sure for as the pools and hot tubs are shutdown...internet is included with that $16\/day fee.  Not wifi...it's the old ethernet cable.  What a hoot!

Big picture:  PROS:  Clean & simple.  CONS:  Dated, WAAAY overdue for a renovation, no amenities in the room at all.

Well I can start off by saying I ruined a great family trip for us all and I'm highly upset about it. First off I called reservations the day off check in to see if my party could check in with my card and he said sure as long as they are on the reservations not to mention I just paid for 3 suites. He goes on to tell me that there was no problem and they should be ready to go whenever they got here. Well we all know that didn't work out very well when they got there and tried to check in. So I finally make it there because they aren't able to check in. To find out that one of my rooms got cancelled and refunded back to me because I wasn't there to make the transaction. So that made it harder because we all thought everything was paid for resort fee and parking ... here we go another $150 deposit was needed. I had to leave the hotel again to put it on a card cause at that moment we all pulled out the cash out of our banks... and they don't live here so they don't have banks here. Anyway we finally deal with the rude cashier and the rude manager at the front desk... very very disrespectful people by the way. We get our rooms after 3 hours going over and over again to find out that the rooms we paid for was different! Not the rooms we booked! It was missing half the room!!! So the only good thing we got out of are stay was great customer service from the restaraunt public house! Only good thing everyone was rude! And I felt very unwelcome there by the staff!

I have never been so grossed out by a hotel as I was with the Luxor hotel. A friend and I went to Vegas to have a fun girls getaway; neither of us are hotel snobs but to say we were highly disappointed when we opened the door to our room for the first time is an understatement. The room was dark and dank, the chairs and lamp shades has these weird stains on them(I don't want to imagine what it could have been), the shower still had hairs in it from the previous guest as well as this nasty looking ring of slime around the edges and the air condition was rattling. 

We contacted the front desk and they eventually sent someone up, they temporarily fix the problem, but the noise gradually started back and by our third(and final) night it was back at full volume. Luckily,we didn't spend much time in our room. Additionally, we had to call down everyday to get housekeeping to clean our room and then again to get fresh towels and they had the nerve to drag on that.

The only thing, I did like was how soft the bed was, but because I question the cleanliness of my room, I wasn't able to sleep good because I wasn't sure what filth I was sleeping on top of.

The Luxor itself is a visually impressive building and the interior has the requisite 'Egyptian' theme. The massive American flag hanging from the center of the pyramid is an eyesore and completely unnecessary. Yes, we know we are in America. Once you have walked around there isnt much else to see. The restaurants arent terribly exciting. The entertainment here has to be some of the worst at any hotel (Fantasy? Carrot Top? Criss Angel?).

As for the room I was actually a bit embarrassed. On first glance it looked nice, but when you really looked it was a mess. The window clearly has massive water damage and staining. The carpets were old. The decor was fake and cheesy. The bathroom looked like it has some updating (new floor tile and shower) but then they left the old toilet and the door had peeling paint due to water damage. Hot mess.

We chose Luxor because it is connected to Mandalay Bay via a closed walkway and a Tram and we were taking our kiddo to see the Lion King. It was cheap for a Saturday night. With that stated, I will still chose to stay at Southpoint next time and make the drive. First thing that ticked me off: The ultra pushy timeshare salesman they allow to harass you as soon as you walk into the door with their ""free coupon book."" It is even worse as they appear to be legit employees of the hotel. The man who accosted me gave me a very dirty look when I told him we were only there for one night and to go bother someone else. Second point of error: Rude desk staff who made me push them to receive a room higher than the second floor. How incredible that within a two minute period they went from having no higher level floors to suddenly having them when I asked to speak to the front desk manager. Lastly room quality: There was a very clear toothpaste spit mark in our sink which sorta grossed me out and made me do the bed sheet check to make sure there were no stray hairs underneath the covers. They were clean but the sheets were thread bare and there was an actual hole in one of my pillowcases. The television was an ancient 19 inch embarrassment and there were light brown stains on the lampshades which prompted both me and my better half to yell at our daughter to not touch it. When we attempting to turn on the fan in the room, a clacking sound ensued. Oh well.

Hard to review... I've stayed here multiple times and have enjoyed my stay. The rooms aren't anything special but the price reflects that... You get what you pay for and the rooms have everything you would need and I like the low price point. However, I would NOT stay in the pyramid and think pyramid vs tower is like a different hotel. Totally worth the $20 upgrade. The rooms are dark which I didn't like and maids came by before 9am! On the end of strip and had to take 5 min cabs to get to Paris, Mirage, etc.

This last stay we were there for one night. Valet my rental car at 11:15p. In the morning I realized my ticket had been misplaced and went down to valet desk to get car. Car was not in valet. After hours of looking for the vehicle it was deemed stolen. They had no information for me- did someone else claim my car? Did they give the car to the wrong person? Was it taken when I dropped it off 
 (it was not immediately parked)? 

Filed reports with Luxor, car rental company and police. Luxor lacked a sense of urgency in the matter and kept asking if I was sure I parked it at that valet and at that hotel. Despite my insistence (and coworker that was with me the whole time) security searched the other valet lot as well as Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. Surprise- wasn't there because that's not where I parked. They even had me call the rental company to confirm the car was white...

Luxor paid my cab fare to airport. After filing reports went to lunch then I swung back through valet to see check in once more before leaving for airport. Valet manager was much nicer this time and got the hotel manager involved. She was very nice and comped my stay.

The architecture in and outside the Luxor is simply astounding, the closest I may ever get to being inside a pyramid. I love the light that emanates from the top of the pyramid at night. The elevators are pretty funky, as you are moving to the side and up at the same time, so I recommend you hold on! The pool section is beautiful but was somewhat disappointed as a good portion of it was closed off on a Saturday. Which meant that it was pretty cramped and shaded areas were minimal.

Our first room was in the pyramid, and it was actually quite nice. Big TV, comfy beds, excellent mountain view. Inside the hotel, the room overlooked the back of the mezzanine, which was actually extremely dingy, but who cares what the view is from the room door, right? 

Our second night there it rained. My girlfriend was feeling very ill, and so we decided to turn in early to try and get some good sleep and get her feeling better. We returned to the room around 8pm, to find that the roof was leaking, splattering on the table and chair by the window. I called down to report the leak, and a rude receptionist told me they would send up maintenance. This seemed odd to me, having worked as the maintenance manager for a hotel for a few years. What was maintenance going to go, scale the pyramid and reseal the window in the rain?

By 9pm we still had heard nothing. I called down again and they just transferred my call to housekeeping. The housekeeping manager said they had never received any request for maintenance, and that the policy was when this happened they should just move our room. She then transferred me back to the front desk! 

By 9:20 we were told that they were going to upgrade our room, and move us to the west tower. At 9:25 the maintenance guy shows up, and despite us telling him 3 times that we would be out of the room shortly, he insisted on coming in and putting towels down. By 9:40 the bell hop showed up with our new room keys and asked if we needed help with our luggage. I said no, so he promptly took off without bothering to tell us even what general direction we should head to find this room. 

The upgraded room in the tower was much nicer, though smaller than the pyramid room. When we were finally settled in, my very tired and very optimistic girlfriend decided to take a soak in the jet-tub, and I decided to get a few drinks to put in the fridge. When the tub was full, the jets didn't work. When I returned, I found that the fridge didn't work. So, I went down to talk to the manager on duty. He told me that none of the jets work, and if we want, he could send maintenance up to fix the fridge. After all we had been through already, I told him to send someone in the morning. His response? He wouldn't, but I could call down and have someone come up. He didn't even bother getting my room number.

This is the main hotel-casino I have stayed at when I come to Vegas. Never had an issue. I've come and stayed about 4 separate occasions. No issues to note.  I am not high maintenance, so maybe some people here rating so low need to just relax a bit... Just saying. 

As for Luxor, they provide unbeatable rates for me since I am comped in their M-Life program. I am not a high roller, nor do I gamble. But despite this, they still give me amazing rates with the free membership. Now, please enjoy my  frugal, money-conscious side as it kicks in.  Why on Earth would you spend hundreds of dollars per night for a room when you can get a solid quality room for a fraction of the price....One that you rarely stay in while in Vegas. That's all I have to say, because there are quality rooms here at the Luxor for quality rates, you just have to do your research. If you are lazy, you will overspend each time you step out of your room in Vegas.

The M-Life program spans many hotels other than Luxor, so its a great program to enjoy. It reaches multiple properties, and they share different rate options which will save a lot of green in the end. I use it for everything, and it makes my stays here at the Luxor great. Many things inside are solid, not flashy. Like the buffet downstairs. It doesn't blow you away, but it delivers. Its on par with most of the nicer resort buffets you could go to in town considering price, etc.. Also, the parking is not too far away, so I simply can park and go as I please, even if I am at the end of the strip. Oddly enough, the inside smells of coconut, does anyone else notice this? I love it, and I have no idea why....Its just a little nuance they have, and its awesome.

Its a give\/take when it comes to exhibits and shows. That has been, and will continue to be the major downfall for the Luxor. The shows here are not great, so that's a major hit to their rating on my end. Carrot Top, he's lame. And I hate magic, its not magic. Inception. Sploosh. And a Menopause musical? REALLY?!?! The only saving grace for entertainment are the exhibits. They are amazing. The Titanic exhibit is a must see, it doesn't matter where you are staying, you must go. Bodies is also a great snag for them to have for the next few years. Very interesting, and makes you think before you go smoking while out on the casino floor. So within reason, these both balance out their ratings to a point. I am not a gambler, so unless I get free points I rarely gamble. Therefore its a wash, haha.

Maybe some people should take advantage of those rates and re-rate Luxor. I think they would see the advantages of giving a place a second chance. Although there are many many better options for entertainment down the strip, this place delivers quality, not pizazz or flash with high prices. Come here to stay, have some awesome alcoholic smoothies, and gamble a bit... It gets 4 stars because I never have been screwed with once here, although given the entertainment downsides I'd say its more representative of a 3 \/12.... Either way, I plan on coming here each time, and saving money as I do.",2,2,1

I am DONE with the Luxor and say never again! Thumbs DOWN Luxor #0 on a scale from #1 to #10.",0,0,0

The check-in line was a mile long.  Even so, within 20 minutes we got the key cards to our hotel room and even received a complimentary upgrade.

We stayed in a tower room.  The room and bathroom looked new and were clean and spacious.  I liked our room, even though we felt a bit removed from the main hotel.

The main downfall of the hotel was the food selection; the buffet was probably the worst I've ever tried in Vegas.

One of my other complaints is that housekeeping was about to walk into our room despite us having the ""do not disturb"" sign on our door.  We had been getting ready, so I am not sure they would have walked in had we not said something.  Is this policy to knock anyway?

Despite a couple of negatives, I still give this hotel four stars.  The hotel is a pretty good value for those looking to stay at a nice Vegas hotel, but pay the price of a low standard hotel.",2,0,0

My husband chose the Luxor, and I think it was a great choice. We stayed on the 25th floor. The entire hotel seemed pretty clean, our room included, though we overheard another guest saying that her room was run down. I was surprised by this as I had commented on the good condition of our room upon our arrival. We went to the pool one day, which was beautiful, however the water was FREEZING. My husband and I both recall seeing somewhere that it is heated, and it most definitely was NOT. That was kind of annoying as I had very much been looking forward to swimming. And at only 3 feet deep, it isn't optimal for swimming anyway

Lots and lots of options for food and drink. Lots of entertainment. My personal favorite was the Titanic museum! And gift shop. A really neat experience with SO MANY artifacts from the ship, model first and third class rooms, and a room that is the same temperature as the evening the Titanic struck the ice burg to give a sense of the conditions. Really, really neat. The gift shop was also interesting, with lots of odds and ends.

The staff of the hotel seemed friendly from my few interactions with them. The Luxor is at the end of the strip, so it's relatively easy to get from place to place. If we go back, I would definitely consider staying at Luxor again, though I'd love to see some of the other hotels as there are so many hotels that look awesome. 

Four stars because 1) I don't really have anything to compare it to and I had no major complaints except for point number 2.  2) I forget what it's called but there was some sort of ""hotel fee"" added on to each evening that we stayed. This is completely ludicrous, as they don't even tell you what it's for. It is very clearly just a money grab, something the hotel does because they can (much like a surcharge when you buy tickets for an event online and there's a surcharge...even though a computer did all of the work... and you print the tickets out yourself... it's ridiculous). Personally, I'd much rather the hotel charge an extra X amount of dollars per night (I forget what the fee actually was) rather than charging their guests an additional fee for seemingly nothing.",0,0,0

Rust dripping down in the bathroom, something splattered against the bathroom door, very dim lights. Have to say the biggest complaint is the food service hours. Room service is only available from 6 in the morning to 2 in the AFTERNOON! Yes....so if you are out sight seeing or at a concert or just gambling don't think you will be able to order room service. 99% of the restaurants close at midnight.  What? Aren't we in the city that never sleeps? Very frustrating. ...only option is a ""food court"" with old pizza slices, fried chicken strips and a cheeseburger. 
We also rented a fridge to store water and we're charged 80 bucks for 3 days. Ok...whatever, but hell most motel 6 even gives you a fridge!
So another sour note was the pool. It was not overly packed or anything but there were no chairs. There was a ton of chairs piled up behind the ropes but no one would bring them out. This was at noon to 2....when I would think is the busy time. I don't understand really....if more chairs were out, one would think the Luxor would make more money from its customers ordering food and drinks.
Again we were here for the 3 day country festival so we didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel. Just wish I knew about all of this because I would have stayed somewhere else. After the concert every night we heard so many people complaining there was no food when we got back to the Luxor. Just ridiculous. 

*I know Gluten allergies are just now getting attention, but I have had this disease for awhile. Luxor does not have more than a handful of options either. Very dissapointing.

We both had stayed at the Luxor years ago and had a good experience. In my opinion, the Luxor has gone down hill. I will start with its two good points - the location on the strip (being connected to Mandalay and Excalibur and near MGM) and its variety of food choices on site including fast food on its Atrium level - both good points. This is where the good ends for the Luxor however! It is a particularly dark hotel and I am guessing they keep it dark to hide the fact that it is worn down and poorly kept. We stayed in a Pyramid Deluxe room facing the pool (which even 12 floors up the music was insanely loud). We started out in a 2nd floor room 10 feet from the taxi stand (seriously) with no working AC. It blew warm air - it was 107 when we checked in outside and about that inside. They did not seem to care, but we did ask for another room and were moved to the 12th floor. The AC blew coolish air (not cold) and the room was just worn down. The beds sagged. The TV was about 15 years old. The chairs looked worn and dirty. When you took a shower the drain backed up. Not to mention the key cards worked only about 1\/2 the time. I could go on, but why - it was BAD - even for a deal. Avoid it. There are better deals on the strip. The Luxor is not one of them.",1,0,0

The room was updated and very nice. The shower was incredibly large and that was much appreciated! BUT ... it could have used a shelving unit to hold soap and shampoo bottles other than the tiny soap dish attached to the tile.

I liked how it was connected to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay both with internal walkways and an external free tram, giving you the ability to see and do a lot while staying out of the heat.  The elevators seem to be a bit rickety (the ones that worked anyway) but if you did that much work every day for that many years, I am sure you would be a bit rickety as well.

There was an ""odd"" odor throughout the hotel.  I likened it to potentially their smoke removal\/de-odorizing system?  But, I would rather have that than the thick poison-y\/smoke-y plumes everywhere ... or a smoke-free casino would be outstanding!

I didn't care for the ridiculous ""fees"" they hit you for at check-in.  But, I guess that it just an accepted practice for all hotels in the Las Vegas strip region.  (This was my first trip so I can't compare others.)  I was surprised with FREE parking!  That was a nice. (And apparently free valet as well.)

I was in town for my sisters wedding and I dragged my feet at booking a hotel. By the time I did, everything on the strip was outrageous, so I used Priceline and ended up at the Luxor.  I still ended up paying more than I would have liked, especially for what I got. The resort fee for 3 days? $85. A total waste when it is too cold to use the pool anyway. 

It's at the end of the strip, which kind of sucks, unless you like walking or plan to cab it to the main part of the strip. Cabs t Caesars were about $10-15, and to the airport $30. There is a liquor store just south and in walking distance. 

The rooms are very tired. Both from a cosmetic standpoint but also temperature control. I was either freezing or sweating, no in between. After 3 nights my back is sore from sleeping on the bed, but that's probably not super fair, I am like ""princess and be pea"" when I sleep. I found it to be very quiet despite what some of the other reviewers said and I stayed in the pyramid. 

The elevator does squeak true to other reviewers. 
It also leans, which can't be safe! The casino still allows smoking and it stinks walking through the casino. I stayed in non smoking and you couldn't smell it at all thank god.   House keeping didn't even come to the room in day 2, wondered what that was all about, but with just me worked out ok. 

Check in was a bit slow, long line but they were very friendly. Overall, I may stay here again, but j wouldn't pay $200 a night. It's absolutely not with it.

Our group booked 14 rooms 9 or 10 months in advance.  Upon check in our rooms were in the bottom of the building on floors 2 and 3.  Windows looked out on walls with no sky even visible.  The rooms smelled horrible (all but one).  They were stuffy and nasty, the beds and carpet exhausted like a 1960s freeway side motor lodge still somehow in business without ever being upgraded.  Under extreme duress they moved my room (allegedly an upgrade) to the newer building and that was even more disturbing.  No desk, only a small table and two beat up chairs that sunk so low you couldn't even sit at the low table to use a computer.  Scant assortment random towels, no bathmats, a moldy shower with a broken door, and on and on.  It was funny but angering at the same time.  Luxor blows.

Of course it was my first trip, but this was one of the cheaper options and seemed like a good value.  As a Vegas virgin, I was impressed with the decor and liked the theme and details such as hieroglyphics in the elevators. Casino was spacious, not as smokey as some, and had several convenient bars\/lounges integrated with the floor, if you just want to chill and not gamble.

LAX: crowded, but fun if you like crowded nightclubs and don't mind smoke and not sitting down. Good mix of music, hot crowd.  Put your name on the list as a hotel guest and get in for free. Our wait was about 30 mins. around 11:30.

Liquidity, Flight, Aurora: similar lounges\/bars in casino, good places to chill with friends while taking a gambling break, or for video gambling at a bar.

Pyramid Cafe: Nothing to write home about, but a decent basic, budget option for quick casual meals. Bonus: breakfast all day, friendly service.

Rooms in the West Tower were ok-sized, seemed reasonably clean. You can fit 5 people in a standard tower room, with 2 on each bed and one on chair cushions, if you're really trying to maximize a budget.  Pillows and beds could have been more comfortable, though.  Bathroom was spacious and had a separate tub and shower.  Housekeeping did miss servicing one room when folks slept in pretty late, they should step up their schedule to accommodate a Vegas schedule. And be sure to use the ""Privacy"" door hanger, or you WILL be woken up by knocking and someone coming into your room around 9 am.

Pool area was spacious; busy, but we managed to find a couple free chairs at mid-day\/early afternoon, and could comfortably relax in the pool and quickly get decent drinks from the pool bar.

Location is not ideal. You can use the tram to get up to Excalibur and close to New York, New York, but mid-strip will be a lot of cab rides or a looooong walk. The underground connection with Mandalay Bay does add a lot of food and shopping choices.

Bottom line: if you're on a budget (or get a deal\/comped room here), go for it. If you can splurge, stay somewhere mid-strip or on the monorail route and a little fancier. As always, bring comfortable shoes, flip-flops or something, for daytime and extra-late nights, cause your strappy heels will get uncomfortable fast strutting around the casino or dance floor.",0,0,0

I have been dreading writing this review for a long time because of the almost impossible task of cramming all of Luxor's problems into one review.  If I had it my way, I would turn this into a trilogy.

Let's start from the beginning.  First night we arrive, we are told that we're getting put in a room facing the strip (there aren't any rooms facing the strip in the hotel it turns out.)  We show up to our room and it is on the 6th floor with a wonderful view of the parking lot.  Now, that wouldn't have made me as mad had the lady told me the truth.  I called downstairs and had them change my room.  I had to bring all my luggage back and they sent us to another room in the tower.  FYI - You have to walk really damn far to get to your room if you're in the tower.  Anyway, we get to our new room in the tower and there are holes in the furniture.  Not only that, the AC\/heating didn't work!  We called them AGAIN, and they told us they could put us in the pyramid the next day.

Next day comes, our room in the pyramid is not ready.  We asked if we could leave the hotel and have them move our luggage from one room to the other while we were gone.  I was crazy for thinking they would actually take time to do something for one of their guests so this idea was obviously rejected.  Here's the kicker, since they booked us for a new room in the pyramid (which was not ready,) they ended our reservation in the tower and told us we wouldn't have ANY ROOM if we weren't around when the new room was ready.  We had to stay in the hotel the WHOLE DAY.  To put the icing on the cake, this was NEW YEAR'S EVE!! 

I'm just getting started...  Going back to the night we were in the room with no heating, we got locked out of our room something like 12 times!!  We had to keep going back and forth from our room to the front desk demanding new keys!  This is no way to spend New Year's my friends.  When I got mad at the manager, he looked at me and asked me what I'm trying to get out of this?  I wanted to punch that SOB in his fat stomach.  I replied, ""I want my F'ing room key to work.""  He replied, ""it's probably user-error.""  This is one of those times when I wish we didn't live in a modern society where we're not allowed to ""take care of matters"" ourselves, if you get my point.  

The next day after staying in the hotel all day because we were not allowed to leave or else we'd have no room at all, we finally get into our new room in the pyramid.  The same key nightmare happened all over again and we ended up having to run back and forth from our room many times because we couldn't get in.

During checkout, I demanded to speak with the highest person in charge at the casino.  No one would let me know what this person's name was or how to contact them.  One of the smaller managers even claimed that he was in charge of the entire casino.  A few days after I get home from this nightmare, I get the name and number of these people.  They didn't return my phone calls so I had to keep finding someone higher up to call and finally they called me back.  They apologized, told me they would refund me for my stay and offer me 2 free nights in the future.

As the seasons change, well I guess they don't really change in Los Angeles but you get the idea, I finally see a credit to my bank account.  He didn't even give me back HALF of what he said he would.  I obviously called him back and he told me he never agreed to reimburse me for my stay!  These people are snakes.  I take that back.  I actually like snakes.  These people are roaches covered in fecal matter.

I miraculously got him to fulfill his initial offer and got my money back.  That didn't really heal the wounds of having a miserable first trip to Vegas and on top of that being New Year's.  

Just when you thought it was over...  Fast forward a few months.  I decide to take them up on their 2 nights for free offer.  I had to go to Vegas and really didn't want to spend the money on a room if I didn't have to.  I crossed my fingers that I'd make it through those 2 days without any problems.  Well... I guess my fingers weren't crossed enough.  I took my car from the valet one night because we had to make a show over at the Bellagio and didn't have a lot of time.  When I came back to the Luxor to park my car, they didn't let me park!!  They said, ""sorry, you're going to have to park somewhere else.""  I drove around for about an hour trying to find somewhere to park until I finally lost my mind and brought it back to the Luxor.  I told them I was staying at the hotel and refused to leave or move my car.  They got a manager to come out and he said that they're not allowed to turn away any guests!  What the hell is going on with this place??!!  After all of that, they didn't offer to comp me in any way.  Not a show ticket, not even a free drink for crying out loud!

I would like to begin by giving a thumbs up to the staff at the Luxor.  Every staff member we came in contact with was an absolute pleasure. Thank you all for your professionalism and outstanding service.    Unfortunately the Luxor as a property is an extreme disappointment.  My hope in sharing this here and on FB is that you'll keep your hard earned $$ in your pocket or spend them at an establishment that is far more worthy of your patronage.  The Luxor is very outdated and downright dirty.  Ceilings are a dingy grey and covered in cigarette smoke, the casino floor is poorly ventilated and resembles a dungeon.  While our room was professionally cleaned by the housekeeping staff, it was incredibly run down and in tattered conditions.  Our room had wallpaper peeling off of the walls, baseboard tiles falling off the walls, light fixtures covered in rust and rust bleeding through the wallpaper itself.  The interior of the bathroom door had considerable water damage.  (I have pictures but for some reason can't seem to attach them here) The pool area is a concrete jungle with absolutely no shade and no umbrellas ie....miserable and not at all what one would expect from a Vegas strip property.  MGM properties and the Luxor should be ashamed of themselves for charging such ridiculous high prices for such a sub par property.

My boyfriend took me for my birthday we booked our room for the weekend. Right as we walk in from the parking structure we look for the check in, we got greeted by this man, his name is Rico he told us he can help us to check in but first he wanted to get us set up on some tickets for shows. We thought great lets purchase them get that out of the way! We agreed on our entertainment he told us the price we figured it was decent. Rico then explained we would be picking our tickets up after we see his resort timeshare, explained it would be about two hours of our time we would take their shuttle also get a free breakfast. We agreed on a time of 9:15am for the next morning, paid signed and the paper said no refunds. We the proceed to check in! That went smooth, in the mean time I'm changing my morning coffee plans with my friend who resides in Henderson so I can still catch our shuttle to the timeshare. The walk from check in to our tower deluxe room was easy to find. When we got to the hallway leading to the room, outside of four different rooms were dirty dishes and trash bags! Not very impressed since it was more than two, those dishes and trash sat there from Friday until we left on Sunday at 10am! Disappointed with that. The view from our room was amazing, ac worked great, wish there was a mini fridge, water spots on the bathroom mirror, dark hair in the sink and bath tub! Fingerprints on the vanity mirror! While unpacking,  our room phone is ringing, while trying to retrieve the message our cell is ringing. It was Rico calling twice on our room phone and three times on our cell! After listening to his voice messages, come to find out the time he reserved for our shuttle was booked, that we need to change the time to 8:30am. My boyfriend and said to each other that won't work, I already made coffee plans earlier with my friend. We went down to find Rico, we fan into a woman who sells the tickets. I explained my situation and I can't  take the new time for the shuttle due to previous plans. She said Rico could refund our money and just don't tell that she said this. She pointed us to the direction of Rico. I explained we can't make the later shuttle time. He said he doesn't understand that I had plans before, started arguing with me about Henderson and how long it take to get there and back I told him we planned on leaving at 7am to be back for his shuttle by 9:30. I told him I'm not calling my friend changing my plans once again to catch a later shuttle! That's not my fault the 9:30 was booked. Don't offer me a time that you can't fulfill. He said well you two are going to loose out on your money and gifts ( what gifts are free, the tickets we purchased that we don't get until we get to the resort, or wait my bad the free breakfast. Probably would not be able to eat it I have celiac disease) I mentioned that the lady from the other desk said you could give the money back! His response was that she is lying. He  is threatening about money. I brought to his attention that I don't care about the money we will be loosing out on, there was plenty of that! We started walking away, he was insisting on me giving him my receipt . I told him no, keep talking, it's my paper. I said I'm done with him keep his Bull crap, have fun with that. My boyfriend and I walked away! We went to sit down at dinner Tender Steak and Seafood restaurant. Just opened up the menu, the cell phone rings it's Rico AGAIN, I seriously thought my boyfriend was kidding me! He told my boyfriend that he wanted him to come back to his desk, He said no, Rico said I have your money! Rico refunds our $84.He told Rico don't ever contact us again! So at dinner the food was amazing, very impressed with the gluten free menu. I had scallops with quinoa and a Caesar salad, pretty pricey but I rather pay more than to get sick on vacation! The next day before leaving for the day we put or do not disturb sign up! The maids still came in our room! If we had known they would violate our privacy I would have locked our valuables and put my bras and underwear out of site, along with my medicine! The dark hairs were still in the tub, they could not even clean them the second time! I wiped down the bathroom myself! My boyfriend was over this place by this time!  on our last morning there at 9:15am we get  greeted by housekeeping by opening our door then saying who they were! I was just stepping out of the shower and boyfriend was changing! This was unexceptionable since check out is 11!We will never pay for a weekend here again! I was bummed out, I've always wanted to stay here.Rico and the shitty house keeping ruined it for me.!!!!

Since the corporate de-theming abortion tragedy, I haven't been in Luxor. But I had to check in again. The buffet that was Pharaoh's Feast was one of my first jobs in Vegas! Circus Circus Enterprises days.

I had to walk into one of the small rooms sometimes reserved for ""banquets"" since it was there in my first week of work, I had to give a girl the Heimlich maneuver. It was a big deal, that night I realized I changed the flow of history in the town I just moved to and I was also a hero for the night (until I got the corporate cya ""call 911 next time"" lecture of course). 

With all the repainted crap upstairs, it was great to go to an area of the casino where there's still theming, the buffet still looks like an archaeological ruins dig. You know, historically the luckiest part of a pyramid is deepest below the center. I'm sure there's a woman who may have kids of her own (""let me pick the chicken off the bones!"") that knows that. 

Too many memories of those days. As I walked around the casino, all I saw was what things used to be, those nights hanging out in Cleopatra's after work (not the barge up strip). I know backwards and forwards that ""changes"" are designed to bring in more money. But they're already doing that with new tenants a ""star bump"" above what was there. 

Employees used to have to park across the street behind the gas station where I met Dan Aykroyd & Donna as they rode into town on their motorcycle caravan for the opening of Mandalay Bay. Gassing our motorcycles together is probably the coolest thing to happen, until I eventually worked at House Of Blues... To get to work we walked past the sphynx which people remind, is facing the wrong (spiritual) direction.

While I imagined the past, I was adamantly reminding myself I came for the future. What is there to do now? What (conceivably) keeps people coming back here, especially the locals? The few times I went to LAX, people still talked about Ra.

On the attractions level, I missed the King Tut museum, and even the Obelisk 3 part experience, ""Don't you harm her!"" But I admit Titanic and Bodies are good replacements. How the hell they got that chunk of the ship up thru the casino to the attractions level should be a video on display itself. 

I still have a lot of Luxor stuff from my first casino employee sale haul when everything was papyrus and hieroglyphic themed. 

A big thrill when I knew someone coming to town that wasn't staying there was to take them up the inclinator to one of my favorite thinking spots. Show them the Chrysler building- yes, before the NYNY casino was built. There was a trick to get up there and I was sad that I didn't get the modern counterpart to do it last time. 

I used to go out to the pool area when that brunette sexpot from Body Shapers did their exercise show out there. I ran into Scott a few times in passing and he even recognized me when I saw him at a Cinevegas party. Guess his stage name.

While memories spike a 5, all I can give the watered down experience now a 3. Instead of painting crap corporate blue, you could find, restore and bring back the camel Sigma Derby machines. That alone would roll an easy 4. People also still complain about removing the Nile ride. You don't even have to bring it back! Mock up a boat and backdrop and let us take pics of that! That retail space by the walkways could be leased by a couple of big trends, too. (hint: downtown. No, not shoes.)

In one of the lounges I sat, had a beer and ruminated. Sometimes Vegas, believe it or not, is not EPIC. Sometimes, you just relax in a quiet lounge and think while you look around mentally playing ""She's A Hooker."" Nope, that one's just a big deal back home. She didn't ask that guy where he was staying or do the other 2 telltale things.",0,1,2

I love Egyptian art and a good deal, so this place was perfect. Honestly, you don't need to spend a ton of money on a hotel in Vegas because you barely spend any time in the room other to get ready and to sleep. 

I've heard people say that the rooms are unusual due to the fact that the hotel is a pyramid but the rooms are hard different from any other hotel room I've stayed in. The window was slightly slanted, but that's about it. 

In addition to the nice rooms, friendly bartenders and good deals, the monorail looking train goes through the Luxor so you can get on it and take it to other hotels and check out the other casinos. It is also connected to Mandalay Bay, Excalibur, and New York New York so if you want to walk over taking the train, that is always a good option. 

Side note: my only gripe with this hotel is that it's inaccurately named. As a bit of an art history buff, the great pyramids are in Giza, Egypt not Luxor. So it should be called ""The Giza"" but I guess Luxor sounded better so who cares if it's geographically correct! Ok, end of rant.

Loved the pool area.  Since it was a holiday weekend it was busy but we found spots both days with minimal problems.  Most people are interested in just laying out so there was plenty of room in the water to cool off.

First off the room was $170 a night for a room in the main pyramid room section. This was a weekday price that had been jacked up because a convention was in town. The room was maybe worth $70 a night.
In addition to the $170 they charged the $20 a night resort fee. Not sure what this was supposed to cover as the pool was closed and the wi if wasn't working. Oh, they don't have wi if. What year is this?
The furniture was all banged up, there where scratches along the walls and the blanket was thinner than the ones you are given on an airplane.
The beds are probably the original from when the hotel first opened; not comfortable at all. Ugh - those pillows. Also the most uncomfortable I have ever attempted to sleep on.
i don't think housekeeping do anymore than the basics. The clock not plugged in, the
sink plug was broken and stuck in the closed position.
The hairdryer only worked on the high setting and my hair got sucked into the fan in the back of it.
There was loud banging from 10 in the morning both days I was there. Hotels normally give their guests notice when there will be noise but the Luxor must not care at all about their guests.
I could hear showers and toilets flushing from 3am to 10am one night so I didn't get any sleep.
There was a thick, black hair with root on the face washer which was just gross.
The rooms in the main building have seen better days and the maintenance seems to be zero
Basic bathroom amenities; soap, shampoo\/ conditioner combo moisturizer and body wash. No q tips, shower cap, sewing kits or anything else.

FYI should any MGM big wigs ever get their dirty little hands on this review... You've got one of the coolest (and timeless) exteriors on the strip in the Luxor.

When we arrived the check in computers were down. We waited around and finally were told the security officer had to let us in because their key system was down as well. By the time we arrived to our room (45 minutes later) we no longer cared that we were upgraded to a suite.

The room was a smoking room. We specifically booked and asked for a non smoking room. My nose was already offended by the smells of the strip and the pumped cigar smell in the lobby. It's unbearable to breathe in the room. 

The front desk staff was less than helpful at first check in. The one who helped when our computers returned was marginally better than average but not by much. When we tried calling the front desk to request a non smoking room we were placed on hold for half an hour before giving up and burning a book of matches in the hopes it would smell better than cigarettes before bed.

We also were told at booking that we had vouchers that would pay for breakfast. When we saw our coupon book we realized that the credit was not valid for breakfast, and only the bars were open and available for redemption at this hour. 

Overall I am less than impressed and this has been a terrible first experience in Vegas.",7,0,3

I am very curious how the room looks like and how to have room in Pyramid building. Only to be disappointed when we got there. I have read reviews about the place and most reviews were it's a run down place specially Pyramid. But you know, it depends on preferences...we tried to get suite upgrade but they were fully booked...it was labor day weekend. So when we got there we got the queen deluxe tower room. I thought maybe that's good deal. Well, it was not at all!!!

1. There's a very long walk from main lobby to the elevators going up our room.

2. After the long walk going to elevator, here comes the long walk to the room. I was like its ok probably it's nice inside and quiet. Well, it wasn't

3. The room had the classic Egyptian interior design which I bet the first few years it was opened was very fabulous...but no longer today. It looks old and creepy plus walls and decorations can used some retouch

4.The hebedshits and covered are run down and old. That freaks me out so bad. I'm sorry but make me feel like it was even washed. Makes me don't want lay down, but it smells good and freshly washed though... 

5. There are 4 head pillows but so soft not fluffy type. So made my head and neck hurts every time I woke up

6. The furniture are old and really looks old., And I think we got the room one of the reviewer said, a used to be smoking room converted into non smoking room now. There's cigarette burn on on of chairs arm.

7. And, the bathroom although I bet they cleaned looks dirty. Or probably they didn't cleaned it well who knows... but I just can't bear thought of getting my skin touch any wall of shower which was very small. And never used the bathtub

8. The swimming pool area was very nice though. That ambience of swimming or dipping in pool with big pyramid background was amazing... but, the staff on pool bar was very rude...which reminded me that the front desk staff were not as customer oriented either... Nevertheless, I like their pool.

9. The buffet was fine, not too good not too bad. Or we were just hungry because we ate there night we got to Luxor? Lol... 

10.Oh the Casino, well, i like that we can bet at lesser minimum than at MGM National Harbor, but... if you're a non smoker like me, you will not like staying in Casino for long time. Few hours i can already feel i having sore throat. The dealers were very professional and nice though. The crowd was fine.

11. There is no fridge or microwave in deluxe room. There's hairdryer, clothe iron and iron board though. Plenty of space in cabinet to put clothes. Oh, and safe was dated but still function well, we never had issue about it.

The place is run down, dark, depressing and smells like old shoes. The money we saved on the hotel was spent on taxis as it is quite far from everywhere. When we checked in I asked for a room with a view of The Strip and was told ""There's no point, The Strip is too far away"". Ok then. The lifts were built in the time of the pyramids and were rickety and went up on an angle which was most unpleasant. The rooms were dark and the air conditioning must have been installed in the 1980's. Our first day at the Luxor the cable shut down and both the TV and internet did not work, meaning we had to watch Carrot Top on repeat. The pool area was perhaps the only redeeming quality however the water was akin to the cleanliness of The Nile.

First, I have to commend the hotel staff, because they were friendly, professional, and helpful. BUT...they can't make up for all the problems this hotel has. My first night there, I was happy with my room in the pyramid. I've stayed here before, so it was as I remembered it. Other than not enough blankets on the bed and no bathtub just a shower, it was a fine room for the money. It was clean and nicely decorated.  Except for the fact that at one-thirty in the morning, I started hearing water dripping in the bathroom, then splashing. It gets louder and louder, until I get up and go  look, and water is pouring through the light fixture in the ceiling. All over the vanity and onto the floor. Pouring. I call the front desk and they have someone there in five minutes. I have to pack up all of my stuff,  and they move me to another room. They tell me I'm lucky, because the room is an upgrade, with a large soaking tub. But the room is not an upgrade, it's a dump. It feels as if they put me in some out of the way, rarely used closet. There is an old fridge in the corner, that has been rolled in on wheels, with bath towels folded up under it to keep it from leaking on the floor. The light over the tub doesn't work, so you have to sit in the dark, since it's in a corner. There are stains on the toilet seat, and stains on the carpet. I was excited for the tub, until I realized the cold water won't turn on. I'm sick of moving, so I try to handle it myself, by pouring ice cubes in the tub. AND then when I walk into the weirdly shaped little dining area, my feet get wet, and I notice the ROOF IS LEAKING from the rain we are having. The carpet is soaked. I really, really, don't want to ask for another room, because I don't want to pack up and move again. But I figure I better at least tell someone. I call the manger- who has left me a voicemail asking how I like the new room- and let her know about the roof leak. Since I don't want to move she offers to comp a night. I ask if she'll comp room service instead, and she does, happily. SO, all in all, I feel terrible for the staff that is trying to do damage control for a building that is not being cared for in any way shape or form. I got the impression they are trying to squeeze every last cent out of the hotel and are just biding their time until it's time to demo it for something new. Also, along the walkways back to the elevator, I noticed what looked like black mold along the corners of the ceilings. Roof is prolly leaking everywhere. Also, the elevators are visibly falling apart in places from the stress of the sideways- it's an inclinator really, not actually an elevator. MGM owns this place, and they should be ashamed of themselves.",0,0,0

Så jag blev verkligen glatt överraskad över min vistelse på Luxor! Redan när vi kom in genom huvudentrén slogs vi av den grandiosa höjden, luftigheten och de mäktiga egyptiska figurerna. Det är rent, fräscht och mycket hög finish. Jag trodde att tiderna tand skulle slitit på stället, men så icke fallet. 

Personalen är mycket alert och trevliga. Jag hade bokat en rums variant som hette ""Run of the house"" vilket jag senare förstod innebar samma som ospecificerat. Incheckningen var mycket hjälpsam och vi fick uppgradera till Tower King rum för en billig peng. Rekommenderar Tower rum då de ligger i den svarta monoliten som är precis bredvid pyramiden. Det är fräschare och modernare rum. I tower är det sedan West side som är den lugnare sidan bort från trafiken på Strippen. Mitt rum vette mot Excalibur och bergen vilket var en trevlig utsikt.

Allt finns under ett tak här, dvs casino, butiker, shower och restauranger. Det är som Mall of Scandinavia on steroids (fast I koncentrerad version). Det betyder också att det inte finns någon dedikerad restaurang för frukost vilket jag verkligen saknade (-1 stjärna där). Det finns flera Starbucks varav den i lobbyn har 24 timmars öppet, men de mackorna var under all kritik. 

Det finns även poolområde utomhus under vajjande palmer, massage och spa, samt ett gym. Gymmet är fräscht och har flera löpband, trappmaskiner och fria vikter. De bjuder även på flaskor med vatten. 

Bredvid Luxor finns det ett garage som förvisso är öppet för allmänheten vilket gör att man får slåss om platserna (rekommenderar taket som verkar fyllas upp sist). I receptionen kan dock hämta ut ett kort för garaget som gör att man endast behöver betala 8$ per dag oavsätt antal passager (annars 8$\/passage ) 

Allt som allt rekommenderar jag varmt Luxor! Om jag skulle komma tillbaka till Vegas kan jag absolut tänka mig detta hotell igen.",1,0,0

Her bathroom had leaked (and I was hungover passed out in another bed). We had to pack up her entire room and they upgraded her to another room. The new room had no AC so we had to pack up and then moved to the West Tower. They upgraded us again and gave us a voucher for $50 good for dining within the resort. Turns out it was only good for the buffet. Thanks for nothing.

Food Court
Fine Mexican Food

Mainly because my friend gets discounted rooms (semi comp). Luxor is an interesting hotel. The rooms are basic, nothing special so not going to talk about that. The casino seems smaller then you would think for the size of it from the outside. The problem with the Luxor is they are starting to adopt the new rip off payout schedule for blackjack. Instead of paying 3:2 like normal (bet 10, get 15 back if you get a blackjack) they are doing 6:5 now on some tables. I'm not a math major but I'm sure this gives them an extra 3-4% advantage against a ""by the book"" player which means u are now looking at like a 5% disadvantage just from sitting at the table. Who wants to play with 5% against them? People who don't pay attention to the table they are sitting at.

Regarding the food, can't complain. Its decent though I still have yet to try the buffet =(. 

The pool is smaller than it looks and sometimes can get busy. The club is lame, they make you wait in line not because they are busy or it's full but because they want a huge line outside to create hype.

The rooms, even without getting a discount, are very affordable. If you went any cheaper in price you would be at a motel 6.

Overall it's a good bang for your buck. You are on the strip, at a semi-decent hotel for a reasonable price. Instead of getting an off the strip hotel and driving to the strip just stay at the luxor for around the same price and you are already on the strip!",10,10,10

For how many nights?"" We'll respond and they'll say ""Great, let me get you some free gifts."" So you stand there while they walk away for five seconds to get something (???) and come back to you and say ""Do you have anything that proves you live at the same address?"" We didn't but she was persistent and brought up every type of ID possible. We still didn't know what she was asking us about. We finally convinced her we didn't have anything with the same address on it and she told us where to check in. We assume she wanted to coerce us into a timeshare deal.

I would not recommend luxor because its kinda far from the main attractions\/strip if you're walking. You gotta go to  Mandalay bay and hop on the tram thing to get to Excalibur and then walk you'll be able to get out to the strip. That's not including street crossing and bridge navigating.

The last time I was there, it was raining and they had leaks everywhere (right in front of the Excalibur walk-alators) and it didn't help that the water was leaking onto marble or granite tiles which made it slippery as heck.

Overall, I usually stay in the pyramid since it's so different from any other Vegas room since it has the slanted window.  The rooms still don't have such a smoky smell as long as you ask for a non-smoking floor.

I find the lack of customer service skills in a 4 star resort hotel in Las Vegas absolutely appalling will not be staying in this hotel or an MGM hotel again. 

The only reason I gave this hotel 1 star is because yelp would not let me leave zero stars.

Update: Guest services reached out to me (see comments below). It appears that the Luxor did not realize how serious this situation could have been -what if I was diabetic? This was not a question nor request of convenience  -it was a matter of health.

Check-In: Even though I checked in well after the check-in time my room was not ready. The only way to get into a room at that time was to upgrade the reservation. The desk guy was very rude and seemed annoyed I was checking in at all. 
Room: If my room was an upgrade I would hate to see what a cheap room looked like. The bed was the most uncomfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. The air conditioning in the hallway was broken. Also, there is no way you can sleep through the noise at night in this place.  
Hotel: This place is very dark and confusing. It's somewhat like being in a nightmare. If you like low ceilings and a cave like atmosphere, you're in luck!
Restaurants: It is Vegas and I did expect to get shaken down in the restaurants. The Pyramid Cafe is expensive and the food is horrible.  For $20 I got some powdered eggs and greasy bacon for breakfast.
Pool: The pool area was not very well maintained. The chairs were extremely dirty and in need of a pressure wash. The reflection on the sun coming off the pyramid is a prescription for a migraine headache. 
Overall: This is a wannabe trendy place that has very little to offer people who are familiar with the Vegas experience.",2,1,1

We had to store stuff in the sink and use the shower to brush our teeth. Pretty ghetto. Sure, they gave us an ironing board and iron. WUPP-EEE, like we needed THAT! I peaked in the suites that were more expensive than the room we stayed in and they were the same, but a little larger. I would say that I would not go back to that hotel for sure.

I was looking forward to visiting the Luxor because I am a fan of ancient Egypt, which is the theme of the hotel\/casino (if the whole pyramid thing wasn't a giveaway).  Walking up to the Luxor, we saw the huge Sphinx that covers the parking and entryway. Walking into the pyramid is really cool. The interior is more hollow than you would expect making you feel like you are in a giant pyramid. The theme continues with Egyptian style statues everywhere. 

We were in the Luxor for the Criss Angel Mindfreak Live Show last Sunday (6\/26). Getting to the ticket counter was easy and the process of checking in was easy. All the staff we encountered were friendly. Our seats for the show were really great and the show itself was absolutely AMAZING! My only problem was the expensive Phantasm (Long Island Iced Tea) drink I ordered was disgusting, but they let me trade it out without question.

I am so ashamed to admit that we just returned from our stay here but I am compelled to post my review of this shit hole. 

Luxor is so lame and sooooooo past it's prime. But i guess you do get what you pay for. Seriously.

Cons:
-old nasty elevator
-wicked old carpet
-no in-room safe
-no tub!!! Boo. 
-dark room. Very bad lighting (missing light bulbs)
-old school tv set
-loose outlets 

The worst thing of all was housekeeping. The first night we had our do not disturb sign on the door. Our first morning housekeeping knocks once and enters abruptly. WTF? Ok the sign was missing. Hubs tells her to come back at 3:30. We left at 1 for an hour, returned to the room to get ready for a friends wedding and she is cleaning our room! We asked for a new DND sign. Fine. 

Then on Sunday at 9am (with the sign on our door) we get another knock at the door and the same woman enters!!! Then she shouts ""check out is at 11!"" Again, WTF!! We check out tomorrow!! I went out there and yelled at her and told her we check out tomorrow and show her the DND sign on our door. Then I called the front desk to bitch at them and advise them that I did not want service and that I did not want that woman in our room. Sure enough, at 1ish she knocks and enters again!!! I was furious! I called the front desk again and they sent the HK supervisor to our room. I was livid!!!!

With all of this said here I can find it in my heart to spare 2 positives:

-Prompt & easy valet
-A\/C unit looks like shit but works well

If you must book here...do not I repeat, do not stay in the pyramid!

Ugh. Bad. So very bad.",0,1,0

Come tutti gli alberghi presenti a Las vegas anche il luxor al suo interno ha un casino discreto se non si ha voglia di fare attraversate a piedi e si vuole buttare qualche soldo si può tranquillamente giocare nel proprio albergo.

Ottima anche la posizione all'inizio della strip lane e i collegamenti interni tra le varie strutture visto che di giorno il caldo è asfissiante è preferibile percorrere le gallerie interne agli alberghi per passare da un albergo all'altro, in particolare il Luxor è collegato al Mandalay Bay e al Exalibur.

The casino floor was clean, but the hallway on our hotel room floor was a disaster. There was garbage left in the hallway for days at a time (we stayed for a week). This was sort of surprising as we encountered our housekeeper multiple times-- she did a fantastic job with our room and was very friendly! When we first entered our room, we had burnt out lightbulbs, cabinet handles that were only halfway screwed into the cabinet doors, and only 1 of the 3 phones in the room had a dial tone. We would wake up in the mornings and our headboard would be hot, as if there was a heater behind it. Unfortunately, our AC did not work in the bedroom, only in the outer room, which was nearly unbearable in the June heat. Any time we called down to the front desk to ask about getting our AC fixed, the staff treated us like children and gave us the run around, never sending anyone to fix our AC nor find us another room.
We were also harassed by salespeople anytime we walked across the casino floor, trying to lock us into booking rooms for next year. It is difficult to remain polite towards unassuming salespeople after the 50th time you're asked to come back-- especially when you're having a terrible stay. The deal being offered made the hotel seem desperate and tacky, as if scrambling not to go broke.

Our room leaked a bit-but our friends next door had a steady stream and when they called the front desk they seemed to really not care and after 10 minutes on the phone with them the person finally stated they would send an engineer up...who we never saw! The carpet is absolutely disgusting and the place just reeks of mustiness (and a lot of pot on the 20th floor apparently).  The elevators are shaky, which I expected from reading previous reviews, but I didn't expect parts of them would be falling off!

At other hotels like the Mirage and the New York New York, they give us a free mini fridge due to health needs. The Luxor wanted to charge $25 per night! We had to do without the fridge, which was a struggle for us.

The hallways of the hotel are not kept up well, as the doors are very scratched. The hallways just scream ""old"" and ""outdated."" Also, it does not make sense that only 2 people are allowed to a room. This is impossible for parents who have children with disabilities!

Our timeshare sales rep was great, but I don't make decisions same day and what was supposed to be a 2-3 hour presentation ended up being 5 and swiping most of my day.

On to the room. They forgot to clean the room after the previous guest - hair on the toilet, dust everywhere, and residue on the nightstand. I immediately complained to the front desk, and the black chick seemed to not be hearing any of my concerns. But the room was cleaned when I got back. The room had a nice view, but they didn't clean the window at all so it is hard to see. The casino has a musty tobacco smell that the other casinos don't. I know casinos welcome smoking, but it shouldn't be concentrated like that. The buffet is a 3 out of 5 and is better than the Rio (my previous go-to spot).

1st call, not very good. the rep didn't help me at all without the guest names i had more than 10 guests. so basically they told me to find out which guests that i was calling about. ( If I knew which one, I would tell you or I didn't have to call! )

It goes like this...Mandalay Bay connects to Luxor, which connects to Excalibur which is on the intersection...you walk over the sky bridge and you're inside New York New York... across the street from that is MGM Grand...all 4 of these resorts are owned by MGM.

After I booked, I read a few of the reviews on here about the hotel, and needless to say, my expectations were very low.  

I had been to the Luxor before and gambled\/drank there and had a slightly-above-average view of the place in comparison to many of the other hotels on the strip.  This was the first time I had actually seen a room or stayed at the hotel.

Overall, I was impressed with the hotel and satisfied with my stay.  Here's a quick rundown of the like\/don't like:

Like:
1.  Room was nice size and obviously recently renovated
2.  Very nice bathroom with higher-quality towels
3.  Bed was very comfortable
4.  Room had an awesome view looking North to the rest of the strip
5.  Great price for a last-minute booking.
6.  Valet car retrieval was quick and easy
7.  Pool was pretty decent with not much difficulty finding a chair

Don't Like:
1.  Self-park garage is small and far (definitely worth it to valet)
2.  Elevators take forever
3.  Weak water pressure in the shower and took a while to get ""hot"" water (probably had to do with being on the 30th floor)
4.  Location on the strip (a matter of preference, I much prefer the northern strip to the south)

Like I said, I was pretty satisfied with the stay overall.  The big disclaimer here is that I booked this under a military discounted rate, so I don't know if they gave me some ""hookup"" with the nicer rooms that I didn't know about.  It looked as if some of the other floors might not have been renovated yet, but I can't confirm or deny that.  It's not the nicest place on the strip, but I would definitely stay there again if the price was right.",1,0,1

Uhm....yea. I'm emphatically torn with my verdict on this hotel. I can't state that I'm much of a gambler as I tend to check in to this place simply for its aesthetics, accessibility and affordability. All 3 of which are rapidly failing to meet my expectations these days.

Unlike the rest of the hotel\/casino chain, Luxor isn't located immediately within the clusterphuk of Strip traffic. It's not nearly as far down as Stratosphere or Circus Circus and parking...as I see it is easy peezy; this is star worthy.

Tackling what others have stated first however, I haven't the vaguest clue how anyone traveling to this hotel let alone any of the plethora of others could possibly have parking issues when ALL of the hotels (at least the ones located on Las Vegas Blvd specifically) offer valét parking FREE of charge.

Where does the complexity lie in pulling your car up similar to that of Jiffy Lube, stepping out, tossing your keys and grabbing a number??? I don't get it. I really don't.

What I can definitely attest to is this place going downhill faster than a spiraling turd. In the past, you used to be able to book a room using a prepaid card if not a gift card simply to secure the reservation thereon to arrive and pay in cash or using a different method.

As it appears, now it's all a bit of a PYRAMID SCAM (....see what I did there?).

Even if you book a room using the website directly or a seemingly FREE third party site, your card is debited upfront simply to ""reserve"" the room. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR ME as prices tend to fluctuate. 

How do you know if\/when you've received the best deal??? If I'm left no choice but to book the room at an already astronomical rate and take notice that prices have dropped $40-50, it goes w\/o stating that I'm going to be pissed that I can't cancel my reservation and rebook to obtain the lower rate!!!

To add sand to the hour glass, apparently, due to a fatality of some sort transpiring years ago, the jets within the hot tubs of this place's upper level high end suites are no longer even operable!!! Wtf, I ask, is the purpose of inoperable spa jets??? 

Seriously-----

If I want to soak my azz in an overpriced bucket of water I'll stay at home, take a bath and have someone grab my wallet to make it rain... That's a heck of a better option than pissing money away on this place that visibly does NOT value its patrons by correcting obvious mistakes and avoidable discrepancies. The outdated decor is just the straw that broke the camel's back (another desert reference.....)

Lord..... Don't even get me on the resort fee. Smfh. I just can't right now..... I'm much too weary. I realize it's a pretty standard fee for places like this but still.... Where is that added $25 fee being attributed?

Heaven help us here. This, as stated by Lynn T (previous reviewer) is not a cheap hotel by any means. $100+\/night isn't exactly the price of a roach motel. What this place is...., is cheap in comparison. 

As Kent M. touched on, so eloquently within his previous review, ""checking out"" is even more of a joke. The website never works for you to do so and all in all, you never really know if you're paying for an extra day or not until receiving your balance alert. I tend to just leave the keycard on the vanity and pray for the best.

In Summary: 

Luxor - GET YOUR SH!T TOGETHER! There are too many options on The Strip let alone Vega$ as an entirety for you to have missed the ball on as many occasions as you're clearly comfortable doing.  In the interim, I'm compelled to take my monies elsewhere.

We got a King suite with soaking tub, and I asked the lady at the desk ""I thought it was a jacuzzi?"" And she said ""no, they were too difficult to maintain."" Okay, cool. Is fixing a shattered lamp shade too hard to maintain? What about painting the walls or replacing the panel on the elevator sign? What about fixing the holes in the bathroom wall or wiping down the human fluid stain on the chair in the hotel room?

I wanted to bring to your attention the conditions your guest are being exposed to at your Luxor hotel Las Vegas. I came August 21, 2014 to Las Vegas to attend a family wedding accompanied by aunt, my daughter, and young niece.  I chose the Luxor based on it's reviews, ammenities, and location. I can honestly say your staff was pleasant at the reception and checking in and the pool was very nice.  I noticed upon entering my room the bathroom was lacking toiletries in which I contacted housekeeping and they promptly brought the items to the room.  The following day I made a second contact to the guest services to inform them that room sink was clogged and I was promised that a member of your staff would come to take care of the issue.  Later that evening I returned to discover the sink was still clogged and in fact their was mold in the shower on the ceiling as well as on the wall next to the mirror. This explained why my daughter's asthmas was bothering her and she was congested. I contacted the mangement as I was completely disappointed and appalled at the room condition as it initially appeared to be situable for me and my family.  Your staff was quick to waive the resort fee and part of one night, but I just don't think it was sufficient.

And now, it's actually a better value and a great hotel. 

Let me explain: first off I stayed in the Pyramid for 59 bucks. The rooms in the Pyramid are really nice and folks I talked to said that they are much nicer than the tower rooms. The rooms were big, though oddly shaped. I really enjoyed the shower, which was large and comfy. The beds were nice, and they gave enough pillows, which rarely happens to me at hotels. 

The food options were OK. The Buffet was average Vegas Strip, which has improved over the years. The bars tend to be good and don't skimp on the hooch, whcih usually happens. I thought the lobby was really nice, though I remember it being cooler when I was a teenager. 

The Casino is good, with a simple lay-out that allowed me to know that if I turned left I'd end up at a certain rack of games. The Single-Deck Blackjack pays 6-to-5 on Blackjack, whcih ain't ideal, but still works.

It was a deeply frustrating experience dealing with the customer service desk including the ""manager"" Kurk Brazillen.  On November 27th, I made a reservation for a room in the Tower premier suite and got a confirmation. 
This confirmation was good for a 3 night stay dec 26-29 in the TOWER premier suite.  No big deal right? Nice room in the TOWER.

Upon check in....I did what I usually do...I tip the check in person 20 and ask  generally for best view (usually view facing towards the north strip) and see what they can do.  Sometimes that works and if it doesn't they give me the money back......now I'm not writing about that.

I did ask for the room if possible facing the northern part of the strip.  The lady took a bit and came back and said she did....I was happy and felt she put me at the top of the tower at 29100...but I was wrong. She placed me incorrectly in the PYRAMID ""premier?"" suite.  Nice room BUT NOT what we paid nor wanted.... It shouldn't be a big deal but we dislike the slanted windows and prefer the floor to ceiling windows.  

Now, I saw those rooms available and for cheaper on the Mlife website when I booked but since I dislike the Pyramid rooms I chose the TOWER Premier Suite.  

I went back down with my wife and spoke with the same lady and she got me a supervisor...this whole time being condescending with attitude. They had the audacity to continue to imply the rooms are the same and I got what I paid for.  Can you believe that? I paid for the word and the room TOWER.  They insisted and did not budge and insisted I""M wrong.  

I asked for the manager and got KURK.  He was very smug on his arrival to the desk.  Never did look at the computer once to attempt or even make the appearance of making accommodations.  This does not logically seem like a very difficult or hard thing for them but he insisted the rooms AGAIN were the same! He kept OMITTING the first part of the room's title which is TOWER.  He never budged or even admitted to him being wrong.  He blatantly lied to my face over and over under the disguise of a patronizing condescending attitude.

Overall, were only given 3 choices: a.  stay in same slanted pyramid room entire length b. stay in same slanted pyramid room and transfer the next day to the one we originally paid for. c. stay in a TOWER suite and move to the one we paid for the next day.

We obviously chose C. because we dislike the PYRAMID and wanted the floor to ceiling windows and the pyramid is more outdated.  

  

My wife and I are very disappointed in how they handled things.  IF they would of just admitted that they are two incredibly different rooms then I could of given the first lady the benefit of the doubt that she THOUGHT  that and understood but they insisted on the same story that they still put me in what I had originally paid for.

Bad location first of all.  You have to walk miles to be where the action is.

Rooms looked like King Tut's Tomb.  Literally it looked like a tomb.  Dark and musty.  We stayed in the Pyramid part and had a slope in our room.  You leave the place with a neck cramp.

Place smells funny.  Not bad but funny.  Like clove cigarettes that somebody sprayed with cologne.  I don't know what type of scent they were going for.  Perhaps the janitor's dead body is in the vents and he was a fan of cloves and cool water.  Who knows?  My theory is as good as any.

IF YOU DO STAY HERE, THIS IS A HUGE TIP:

When you walk past the counter and toward your room you will pass this little desk.  There are these people there that usually have an accent (some may not).  They ask you ""how long are you in vegas"" or ""you want to see any shows?""  Stay away from these people.  They are located in other hotels on the strip as well (right by the entrance to the forum shops at Caesars and at the entrance to the Venetian Canal Shoppes has these scum for sure).  Do not talk to them...do not even give them the time of day.  Be rude to them if you want to.  They prey on newcomers by enticing you with a free stay etc.  What you don't know is that they ""swipe your credit card to reserve your stay"" and charge you for it.  Nice huh?  My first time in vegas I fell for it.  I got it taken off, but the last thing you want in vegas is an immediate charge to your card that you have to deal with.  Stay away from these people and hate these people.  They are worse than car salesmen.  I know they need to work etc.....but how about getting a real job?  I need to work too, but you don't see me working as the guy that unplugs life support at hospitals.  That would be a horrible job.  People would equate me with death.  I equate these ""Vacations"" people as scammers and annoyances.  They are mosquitos.  Just walk past them or you can yell back.  Either way it is good fun for everyone.

I knew I was in la-la land when the directions to our room included passing two separate full-size Starbuck's shops.  Yes, to get to my room I had to take a right at the first one and a left at the second.  

But I digress.  The West Tower rooms were decent sized and the bathroom was huge.  I won't comment on the beds as my time in one was...limited...by our strenuous bachelorette outings.  

I will, however, mention the towel situation.

Recently I stayed at this dump of a place and had THE worst Vegas experience ever.

The carpet was wet from some sort of plumbing issues and the room naturally smelled like a dead rat.  When we notified the front desk and management, all we got from them was WORTHLESS sorries.  No offer was made to switch us to a room that would have been at least bearable, and no offer to comp the room due to the unbearable stench.  

To make matters worse, at checkout their incompitant employees lost one of my bags.  When I got back to LA and realized that one of my bags were missing, I immediatly notified their management.  But even at this point, they were trying to put the blame on me.  Keep in mind that, my lost item claim was for two pairs of shoes adding up to roughly $100.  Rather than accept responsibility for their faults the stupid manager was trying to tell me that ""it was unclear at what point the shoes were lost"".  So I had to tell this dumb ass that it was EXTREMELY CLEAR where the shoes were lost.  The bell hop took all of our luggage from the room and nothing was left unpacked.  Then the bell hop delivered the luggages to the car.  Therefore are some point within that time frame is when the items were lost.  Consequently the problem happened while the shoes were in their exclusive control.  After a few hours of dealing with this annoying matter, these idiots finally stepped up and accepted responsibility.

The point is that their level of service and customer care is just as lousy as their dump of a hotel.  My advice to you folks is, avoid this place at all costs because you would be better off that way.",1,1,0

That's a personal
Preference though but just thought I'd add. Food court is okay but reminds me of a cheap mall food court and was dirty. I could get a nicer room at a la Quinta, I wasn't impressed.

My big issue with the Luxor is just that, in general, staying there is a pain in the ass. It's too big and has way too much going on. Finding your way in and out or just getting the general lay of the land seemed impossible.

That said, our rooms were both more than adequate, but very dark. I liked the pool a lot and enjoyed the views, but it was somewhat cheaply furnished unless you bought a cabana (maybe that's true of all the pools, and I do work for an outdoor furniture company, so I'm probably a bit biased on that one!).

In addition to the room, my stay there was compromised by these Timeshare sales reps who kept trying to rope us in posing as employees of the hotel offering us comps.

Got an even better room after we switched, all the way at the end of the hall with a view of the pyramid which was great at night when they turned on their beam.

I know our stay may have just been an unlucky visit.  However, so many things went wrong.  There is a big difference from a 3 star hotel, and the 4 and above.

When we got into the elevator there was an old lady trying to get to her floor.  Her card didn't work properly.  After we talked to her, she had been up and down 3 times and it kept passing her floor.  We used our card and it passed it once.  Finally it allowed us to got off on our floor.  Not sure about the old lady, because she was still on it when we left. 

The room is okay.  We stayed in the original building, not the tower.  Supposedly the tower is newer.  We wanted the feel of the original building.  The bathroom is good.  The biggest problem I had with the room was that there was a table spoon size yellow stain right on top of the sheet\/comforter.  I say sheet\/comforter, because it isn't a comforter, but thicker than a sheet.  Luckily its warm enough to not need a comforter.  Any how, if I can see a stain on the comforter when I walk in, then it should have been noticed by those cleaning the room.  

After we settled down we wanted to watch tv.  First off all hotels in Las Vegas should have a tv larger than 19 inches, and I would expect a flat screen.  Guess that's why they are not rated 4 stars.  Then again it is probably so you go out and gamble more.  We tried using the tv but that batteries didn't work.  It was too late to worry about getting batteries or using the small buttons on the tv for it to work.  

The internet is wired.  They haven't figured out technology for wireless yet.  It would cost too much to do that.  

We later used the elevators again.  Once again they didn't work properly.  Someone else was stuck on it again.  Don't follow the directions on how they tell you to use them.  It says to remove card quickly.  If you do, expect to be on there for a while.

I wasn't complaining too much. I liked the easy access to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur.. but it's way down the strip and walking in the heat towards Planet Hollywood or The Bellagio that far was the last thing I wanted to be doing. There was alot to do there.. food court, etc. The first night we had a king size bed [floor 7] but the plumbing there is AWFUL!!! READ: ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE PLUMBING! The toilet wouldn't even hardly flush! The adjoining door made us hear the loud smokers next door.. so we asked to switch rooms. The woman we talked to was beyond rude and gave us ""the only available room left"" which was a 2 queen size bed room [floor 15]... the plumbing there was no problem at all.. she acted as if she didnt realize there were plumbing issues in the hotel.. but after reading reviews.. I now see it MUST be problematic alot. The rooms were kind of bare bones... but again... under $40\/night? Not complaining!!

The pool is more of water to wade in.. and people pack in there as soon as it opens at 9am... so if you want a prime spot.. get there early and throw your stuff down! The drinks are around $10\/each there... and the same as everywhere else on the strip. 

You can tell they've done alot to update the hotel.. it wasn't bad IMO. Everyone told me before going how ghetto it was.. I didn't feel that way at all. It was decent.. just make sure you realize the $12.95\/night fee you pay at check in. 

The flat sheets vs fitted sheets on the bed were weird and I kept freaking out about my skin touching the actual mattress.. which looked fairly worn out. I did like the fact we were able to leave all our stuff with the bell-hop and not charged a mandatory fee all day while we were in Vegas [check out at 11am.. and our flight didn't leave until 845pm]

One star for everything else.

Check-in: we waited maybe 10 minutes. Not bad for a larger hotel. Probably because it was a Sunday. Front desk agent was cordial enough. We had booked a Pyramid room but I asked if any tower rooms were available. She said yes, and booked us in a Tower Suite, no charge. She also waived our resort fee. Probably had something to do with us being on our post wedding escape (aka Honeymoon).

Room: I had heard awful things about the rooms at the Luxor, but ours was actually very pleasant. I wasn't a fan of the design and general coldness of the bathroom (no door separating the toilet from the rest of the bathroom). I love my husband but there needs to be a way to do your business while the other person is blow drying their hair! Otherwise everything seemed new and clean. Comfortable bed and nice living room.

Everything Else: God I hate the staff here and the sharkish nature they emit. I feel like a minnow in a shark tank here...they are circling around the edges of this glass pyramid of a fish tank looking for their next meal. And if you try to escape, they will bite your head off. I've learned to not talk nor look at any of the staff here. For example, we asked a staff member where to find something in the casino, and he didn't want to tell us but was very rude when we indicated we did not want to listen to some sales spiel.

Check In...up to the Room

There wasn't a huge line for check-in, although when I was called up next, the check in agent couldn't have been more rude, and stuck up.  A real dick....he didn't even confirm with me what type of room I'd be staying in, but I didn't say anything because I wanted to test his customer service skills. He told me that I'd be staying in the LAST non-smoking room in the entire resort, which I thought, that's completely bull!  So grabbed the keys, and off to the room, and WTF, the room wasn't even clean at all. Towels all over the floor, empty coffee cups laying around, pillows on the floor....ummm, say what?! I called front desk right away from the room, and demanded that they give me a different room, and that I wouldn't be willing to come down to the check in desk.  They assigned me to a different room, and when i arrived at my new room, the key wouldn't work.  Again, I complained heavily, and said that this was unacceptable.  They sent some guy with the new keys, and he wouldn't be apologetic on behalf of the hotel. I told him, ""Wait, don't leave til my keys work.""  He tried to run off, and i told him, ""Don't you see that this is terrible service?""  His response, ""I'm just doing what my supervisor told me to do.""  I thought in my mind, ""You're a real loser.""

Ok, so they gave me a new room--much better...clean as expected, and double beds.

Very easy to find because it's the only one that's shaped like a pyramid and has a light beaming up the sky at night so if you're lost, just follow that light.

They also have trams that connect between those 3 hotels that you can take for free in case you get tired of walking or just trying to avoid the casino for financial purposes. Ha.

Parking garage is at the back of the hotel. You might have to drive around for a bit or might get lucky to find a parking spot near the hotel or just use the valet in the front.

My friends and I stayed in the pyramid deluxe rooms for a couple of nights. Check-in was alright. Resort fee was $22.40 and you also get a coupon book.

The room was decent, dim-lighted, and definitely worth the price we paid for. The only thing I didn't like was how the AC wasn't blowing enough cold air. It was just turned on and you can hear that it's working, but you don't feel any cold air coming out of it.

The internet access included in the resort fee is kind of useless unless you have a computer with a cord plug-in. Also, one of our key cards got demagnetized in the middle of our stay so we had to go all the way down back to the lobby from our room after coming back from a long ass walk on the strip and get a new one.

The bathroom was clean and the water temp was okay. They even have this cute little soap that's shaped like a pyramid which resembles the Luxor hotel.

The elevators were operated at a certain angle so when you're on it, you feel like you're kind of going sideways instead of going up and down the floors. Don't freak out.. it's fun though, especially seeing the reactions of drunk people you ride with.

The pool was nice. Get there early so you can get a good spot of your choice or just rent one of the cabanas if you want a little more privacy. Watch your kids though, if you have any, because some of the lifeguards were just too busy flirting with each other; even though the pool isn't deep, you just never know.

Checkout was pretty fast considering that they have a self-checkout touchpad which we used.

There's really nothing to do in the Luxor but if you're looking for a cheap stay and comfortable rooms I would choose to come here. 

The weird part of this place was their elevators of course. I was having trouble figuring which way I was going to lean since its a diagonal upwards.

I have to agree with Mark W, Luxor was ultra cool back in the day. They used to have a family\/kid friendly area upstairs, but now it's ghostland. As far as lodging goes, I've stayed for a business trip and for a vacay in the new towers. Never had a problem. Well, there was a time when I checked into a room and the carpet was damp. I thought there was a leak in the bathroom, but the front desk said they recently shampooed all the carpets on the floor I was staying on. Random, but good in a way I guess.

The tram is free and takes you right outside of Excalibur which is across from New York New York so that was also perf.

My Significant Other and I stayed here for one night with a complementary room from the Facebook game: My Vegas. To our surprise we got a room in the pyramid!

The view was exciting from both the room window and the hallway in front of the room.

The Room:
+While I have stayed at nicer and more expensive places, what you pay for an average night here is what you get for being on the strip. 
+Nothing appeared terrifying to us as the room service has been doing a good job of keeping things clean and tidy. 
+The furniture obviously is no Encore or Bellagio so don't go hating on that. However it does appear worn a bit too much on some areas.. but hey, this room has and hundreds of people using it yearly. So to keep up with touching up some pieces here and there does take a lot of work.
+ Our shower head did seem outdated from the 90's and the water pressure was no jet, but still felt quite nice.


Our only thing on why this is a 4 star is the overall feel of this room compared to a higher priced modern high end room on the strip. This room is well above a 3 star hotel and just under a 5 star due to needing some updates.

Turns out he wasn't security like he made himself out to be. He had stopped us so some guy could give us his sales pitch. That thoroughly ticked me off. Not the sales thing, but acting and dressing like security.
After that it got worse. I arrived at the registration desk to find out there was going to be an additional $20 per day ""resort fee"". So much for this place being as affordable as they made themselves out.
Then we got on the elevator. It wobbled, creaked, and did just about everything to make me think that it was going to slide off the rails and kill us.
Once we got into the room, we noticed the lack of quality everywhere. The worst part was the mattress to our bed being sunken in the middle. It should have been replaced probably years ago.
When I walked into the bathroom I was somewhat impressed. It was actually kind of nice. But of course leave it to the Luxor to get nothing right - the shower leaked. Every time you finished a shower you stepped into a cold puddle of water.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention, and we hope to have the chance to serve you again in the future.""

I had booked a non-smoking room in the tower only to find out upon check in that they did not have the room that I'd booked.

The Luxor has been around since the ""theme"" casino boom a few decades back, and was at one point a really nice Egyptian themed casino.  Sometime in mid\/late 2008, they announced that they were going to chuck the Egyptian theme to make it all hip and trendy for the next generation of clientele.

Here it is, at the beginning of 2010, and their ""grand remodeling"" thus far is underwhelming.  Not that parts of the old casino style still remain scattered here and there, because it does, and you really can't hide the fact that the casino is shaped like a giant pyramid, and is a definable part of the Vegas landscape.

The biggest disappointment is that the ""new"" style doesn't even try to outperform, or even merely substitute for the old look.  At best, the adjectives I could muster are ""bland"", ""generic"", ""undefined"", and ""unspecific"".  In a city that is designed to one-up each accomplishment with something ""bigger and better and more spectacular"".  This does the complete opposite.  Unless that was their plan to be so drastically unique that they would go against all conventions and expectations.  In that regard, it has succeeded\/failed spectacularly.

The real problem is that in trying to make it so hip and trendy to the ""bro"" and ""socialite wannabe"" crowds, they are now stuck with the impending issue of when trends will change yet again, and now they are stuck with a bunch of mediocrity instead of what was some extremely well designed architecture and artistic flair.  I'm sure in trying to further ""Un-Egypt"" themselves, they will no longer refer to the structure as a pyramid, and start calling it a ""pointed boobie"" in hopes that it will drag in some of the ""bro"" set.

I admire the want to ""grow up"" and do things differently, but there is a difference between ""growing up"" and ""maturing"".  Change some shows and restaurants as needed, but you're stuck in a giant pyramid, the ""Luxor"" name is a governing city in Egypt, and the locals can't figure out what ""Club Triangle"" is trying to do anymore.  I don't know why they would work so hard to make their casino look so boring.

Bad call, Luxor!  Bad call!

FYI: If you want to see the original ""Egypt"" part these days, the local Natural History Museum actually got a huge donation of the casino's art, so you can see what was there when Luxor had its original exhibit.

Had no idea NOT paying an extra $10 a day = unsuitable conditions.  I recently stayed at a La Quinta in a tiny town over the Christmas Holidays (because it truly was the only option it that tiny town) - the La Quinta I stayed in was AWAY nicer then the resort Luxor room I was assigned!!!

First day, checked in (didn't chose upgrade), went to room to get unpacked, once inside - there was a SMALL ceiling water leak over the TV - called hotel, they sent someone...their ""help"" was placing a hotel towel under the drip to absorb the water during the 3days we stayed.  Then as I looked around the room...it just got worse, & worse, & worse.  The TV - by the 2nd day, was not properly functioning, called hotel - they sent someone with a new remote, he couldn't get the tv nor new remote to work together either...so they brought us a new tv.

The room (#4153) is extremely aged & worn down.  Pulled open the top dresser draw to place clothes in - IT'S BROKEN off the track.
The Desk\/Dresser\/TV\/Wardrobe cabinet combo has serious worn\/water damage.  There is serious circular worn marks around the knobs of the wardrobe closet.

The bathroom - the bottom of the door was expanded from water damage.  There is rust all around the ceiling exposed white PVC piping & metal lighting box frames.  There are\/were two toilet paper holders built into sink counter, one of the side hinges was holding the roll in place was getting ready to break (barely staying attached to the metal frame), by day 2 - YUP maid broke it during cleaning & their version of fixing it was - just put the toilet paper on the counter top!  There is also no shelving in the shower, so your body\/face wash & hair items have to be placed on the shower floor...plus no ledge to use to place your foot on to shave your legs - UGH.  There's a slim hole at the bottom corner between wall & shower - that simple caulking can fix...but they DON'T!!!

The bed - itself comfy to sleep in...but to sit up to relax & watch TV - VERY uncomfortable.  The headboard was wood molding designs that are very uncomfortable to lean against & each queen bed only gets two thin pillows...not enough to support your back & head against the uncomfortable headboard design when leaning against to relax.  There is also small areas of black paint chipped off the headboards the simple touch up 2 second painting can fix - but they DON'T.

When checking out in the lobby, I told the clerk - he's answer was...if you told us, we could've moved your room.  DUH!!!  I know that, but I didn't wish to repack, go back down stairs, deal with rebooking, walk over to new room, & get unpacked AGAIN -  we had things to do while in Vegas, ain't got time for that!!!  Clerk repeated - if you chose the upgraded rooms (speech).  WHATEVER, $30 should not make that much of a difference to get a suitable hotel room!  The clerk did take off ONE DAY'S resort fees (not a free day), just the fees.

I'm highly upset with the lack of quality the MGM ownership has for the basic hotel rooms.  Even the basic hotel rooms have THEIR name behind them - BE PROUD of it...because they look AWFUL.  The pictures on their website are not factual!!!  I spent A LOT OF MONEY at their hotels to not have better quality than a small town La Quinta!!!  I left there with close to a $500 hotel bill for 3days (room charges & food charged to room) + $200 for MJ show tickets at MGM (ownership hotel), $150 tickets to Tournament of Kings at Excalibur (MGM ownership) + $150 Blue Man Group tickets (at Luxor itself) = $1000 to MGM Corp from me to them...to have a crappy hotel room.

 I'm actually staying here right now and it's my first time!! It's a long line to just check in about 20-30 mins, after we check in my husband and I went into our room which was king bed in a pyramid room. 

It was raining that day as we walked in our room there was a huge leak coming from the ceiling with a bucket underneath it.. Are you kidding me!! You knew about this and still put your guest in that room!!??? I'm not paying to be staying at the Circus Circus common now!! So I called the front desk and they said we have to come down there which is annoying we had to take our bags and travel across the casino again!! The front desk didn't offer a bellman to come get it for us for the trouble we walked into.. So we went up to the front desk to wait in another line!!! 

After 20 mins we finally got our new keys to a new room which was in the east tower, it was called a tower room? When we arrived in that room it looked better except it look like the maid didn't do all of her cleaning, there was a card that said welcome with someone else's name on it and a soap bar that was open and left in the shower eww! At this point we were done dealing with the front desk and just wanted to meet up with our friends.

 We came back to our room about midnight to go to bed and got woken up at 4:30 am by some man banging on our door and everyone else's door asking if we saw a blonde girl Maria?? This really made me mad as I didn't answer the door, I tried to lay down and go back to sleep and 30 mins later this nuckle head banging on our door again!! So I had to call the front desk again and told them if they can send someone up here.. I don't know if they did or not?

If you're planning on stuffing people into rooms, definitely consider a tower room since the pyramid is a bit smaller.

The decor is a bit older than most other hotels so it felt a bit gaudy. I'm into Egypt and all, but the alarming number of hieroglyphics on the walls scared me. Also, Carrot Top's face sprinkled all over is enough of a scare as well.

Plus, people here don't know how to party. We were chastised for being too loud by the hotel staff twice in a span of two minutes because both rooms next to us called and complained... at MIDNIGHT on FRIDAY NIGHT. wooo.... definitely tells you about the demographic of the people staying here.

Sound bizarre? I thought so too.

We opted for the latter choice, too tired and in need of a shower to argue the c**k-and-bull story (pardon the language) the guy was giving us that even though we had payed for the room online we hadn't call to confirm or something along those lines.

I have never heard of anything like this before. 

Apart from that, the room we got was nice enough, although there was no mini-fridge or safe- although there is a place close to reception you can lock up any valuables you may have with you.

The hotel has what you expect in Vegas, lots of slots and tables, as well as shops and it connects with Madalay Bay and Excalibur.
The pools were crowded (no surprise there) but pleasant to jump into.

As far as prices go it is affordable. I signed up online for their email list prior to booking and got a small discount. It's not like we spent much time in our hotel room so we didn't really care about not getting the one we originally booked- I just found their response bizarre.

The Luxor is another entry in a long list of places in Vegas I haven't set foot in in FOREVER up until recently. I did a major facepalm once I heard they were removing the Egyptian motif, however, once I walked through here (on my way to Mandalay Bay), I realized how half-assed all of it was.

On the bridge from the Excalibur to the Luxor it's still just as Egyptian as it was years ago, come into the casino, and wallah! A complete rip off of trendy, hipster places like the Palms and Planet Hollywood! However, as you walk into the lobby, the giant statue of Ramses is still there. Go to the 2nd floor, and all the decor is exactly the same. The outside facade is...... exactly the same.

The room was small - two beds and two chairs, plus the TV armoire.  The main room was okay, but very dated.  The walls were musty and discolored.  And the A\/C barely worked.  I am glad we stayed in May because the room barely stayed cool with the A\/C cranked to a minimum.  The room includes nothing: no microwave, no fridge - and that did not surprise me - but no drinkable water, no coffee, no anything.  Unless you can drink Vegas tap water without getting sick, you can't even brush your teeth without buying water from the shops downstairs.  It was a bare bones room and it was not great.  

But the bathroom was disgusting.  The shower has been repaired with huge globs of silicone caulk literally holding the shower and shower door together.  And there is black mold growing out of the caulk itself.  The bottom of the shower door was broken with jagged edges and was glued back on with more silicone caulk.  The grout in the shower was coming out in huge chunks and water was almost certainly running behind the tiles.  I have no doubt there is likely more mold growing behind the tile.  The bathtub had cigarette burns on the side of the tub itself even though this was a non-smoking room.  And laying in the bottom of the bathtub was a piece of broken glass from a previous guest that had not been cleaned out by room service.  We never used the tub, as it is separate from the shower, but it was never picked up during our entire stay.

When we saw the condition of the bathroom, we called the front desk and asked to be moved.  We were told the only rooms available would be at an upgrade cost.  I asked to speak to a manager and was flatly declined.  Funny thing is I logged onto multiple travel sites and found plenty of Tower rooms available for immediate booking.  We really had little choice but to just deal with it and stay.

And for this run down old hotel, they charge a fortune for everything.  It was ridiculous.  The gouging started at check-in.  I was traveling for an IT conference and was booked under a government GSA approved room rate.  GSA rates are required to allow the quest to decline resort services and to waive resort fees, but the Luxor openly refused.  And when they charged the resort fee, the clerk tried to charge me $40 per night.  The conference had a pre-negotiated resort fee of only $20 per night and I had to stand and debate with the clerk for 30 minutes even though I had it in writing.  She kept telling me it was taxes.  Hotel taxes in Vegas are 12%, not $20 on a $20 resort fee. We finally got that straight, but I had to pay the resort fee out of pocket.

Then I needed to buy one bottle of water for the room so I could brush my teeth.  $5.50 for a bottle of water that was only $1 at any shop on the strip.  Come on Luxor.  That's literal price gouging.  And every price in the Luxor was that outrageous.  They wanted $6 for a can of domestic beer.  The only night we had a cocktail at the center bar, it cost $31 before tip for a vodka martini and a scotch - both with well booze.  We could walk to the Mandalay Bay or Excalibur and save 20% to 30% on the cost of everything if not drastically more.  We did not see one place on the strip during out entire trip with prices as high as the Luxor shops, bars and restaurants.

I remember seeing it as a kid and always wanting to stay there. I mean.. it's LUXOR! All mysterious looking with that huge light beaming straight into the sky.... 

We got our chance when we spontaneously decided to stay an extra Sunday night after the Las Vegas rock n roll marathon. It was $55\/nt -- apparently, it clears out on Sundays.

+Parking is free .. but it's in a small semi covered lot. No security manning the area
+Bed is firm and comfortable, sheets were clean and relatively soft
+Bathroom is in decent shape
+Some okay views of the strip
+Free access to their nightclub

BUT ... the cons: 
- NO WI-FI... 
-There is a $16 resort fee 
-Elevators take forever
-Elevators can make you feel vertigo since it goes sideways *instead of up & down* in the Pyramid section.

We arrived at check-in time, 3 pm and I was glad that there was room in Valet this visit.  Check in line was long but it moved.  Our room was in the pyramid on the 27th floor which required long elevator rides.  Room service was just finishing the room and she was very nice.  The room was spacious and clean with no strange odors.  Nothing fancy but accomodating with what we needed.  There were two negatives; no bathtub (just a large shower) and an old fashioned cooling system similar to a fan.  It got a tad bit warm in the afternoon in the room with this unit blasting on high.  The decor of the rooms is uniquely themed in keeping with a pyramid.  The bed was comfortable including the pillows.  Our full day there we left the room around 11:30 to find some lunch and 1.5 hours later upon returning our room had been cleaned which was impressive.  We got a great price on the room which was offered in an e-mail through some notification program I signed up for.  There wasn't a lot for us to do in the hotel since we had already seen Chris Angel but there were in-door walk ways to the Excaliber and Mandalay Bay which was great.  We visited the pool once at about 3:30 pm and walked around and around not able to locate seating which was sad.  There is nothing special about the pool or the pool area and was a bit shocked the life guards allowed some patrons to throw footballs back and forth in the area we settled in.  Had to watch out for this torpedo and almost got hit with it several times.  There was a 3rd pool that was less crowded but we were told it is a ""paid"" pool?  My recommendation would be to open that 3rd pool to the hotel patrons and stop being so greedy.   The water temperature of the pool was nice.  On the walk back to the room I noticed a strange smell on me from the pool water which wasn't pleasant.  I didn't notice the pool being dirty or smelling bad?  Couldn't shower fast enough.  Really, I'm not a big fan of public pools in the first place and probably spoiled by the fact we have our own at home.  There did seem to be plenty of lifeguards.  The restaurants in the casino are very expensive but there is a food court which is also more expensive than normal.  I do recommend their buffet and I'll do a separate review on that.

When I responded, ""The Luxor"" I must have gotten the most mixed responses ever- some people made awful faces, some people said they loved it and others were not familiar. As this was my second trip to the Luxor, I know its not a 5 star hotel - and that was OK with me. I'm only there for work, and I'll be at a conference all day and only in my room to sleep was often my response to any naysayers. But I have changed my tune... I will try my hardest to tell my boss to upgrade me to the much more suitable Mandalay Bay next year. 

Upon my arrival, I was prepared for the typical pyramid room with 2 double beds and a tempting view of the pool which I wouldn't have time to use. I was actually surprised when they offered me a free upgrade to the Tower Suites, which was a larger room, larger bathroom and most importantly a nice King Size bed for me to sleep smack dab in the middle of. I checked in and was happy to have gotten the upgrade... until it was actually time for me to be in my room. 

First problem was the thermostat. I like a nice cold room when I sleep and the Luxor could not provide. My fan never seemed to kick on and it was like a hot box in that place. Not the end of the world, until you combine that with the fact that the walls were so thin, I heard every footstep in the hallway, every door shut and most disturbing, even my next door neighbor blowing his or her nose in the shower every morning (luckily that's the only blowing I Heard). The carpet was dirty, the bathroom had tiles missing and the lighting is pretty poor in the room. 

I know people don't necessarily go to Vegas to get a good nights rest, but when you are traveling for work, the days can be VERY long, and at the end of the day, all I wanted to do was get a good nights rest and be prepared for the following day at the conference. I was so sleep deprived and miserable, I actually ended up catching the flu on my last day, which made my boss really, REALLY happy (Sarcasm). 

If you are looking for a cheap place to stay and that is all you care about then the Luxor is the right place for you. But I would be warned of the tower rooms, they are not really all that much of an upgrade. I was much more comfortable and cooler in the quieter yet smaller pyramid rooms last year.",3,5,2

First, when you walk into the hotel, it has a particular perfume odor coming from the vents (I assume) to mask the smell of smoke in the casino area. It gave me a headache after awhile. If you have asthma or are sensitive to strong scents, don't stay at this hotel.

My experience started positively with the bellmen being very helpful with storing our luggages so we had a chance to walk around the Strip before checking in. Once we did check in, our magnetized room keys did NOT work, so we had to call security to open the door for us and we were informed to have our keys changed... but that meant we had to go all the way back downstairs (mind you that this hotel has about 30+ floors)... and I had to tell the front desk person to give me new ones. She said that there must be something wrong with the door and the batteries were running low... however, she proceeded to give me new keys and were pretty sure this time, it would work! I didn't understand that if the problem was the door itself, why replace the room keys?! Anyway, I didn't want to question it any more so it ended up working... the FIRST (and LAST time). We ended up being late to our event, by the way...only if this did not happen, we wouldn't have been!

Sooo when we came back late at night from our event, we found that our room keys were NOT working AGAIN!!!! At this time, I was just very upset because it was late and all we wanted was to go to bed... and now we have to go all the way back downstairs to the front desk b\/c the security were taking their time to arrive and open the door for us (the second time). We were told we had to line up in the looooong line of 20+ people again - which was ridiculous! None of this should've happened!

After 20+ minutes, we finally got to the front desk person and told her that this is the SECOND time it happened and we just want a different room! She ended up putting us on the 14th floor... so we had to move ALL our things from the 3rd to the 14th floor all by ourselves..no assistance..... They even had security arrive and make sure we weren't too upset with the move. 

What was worse was that we requested a non-smoking floor and it was very clear that a few rooms next to us, the room reeked of smoke!!! We even informed the security guard and he just shrugged it off and said ""it happens sometimes... but there's nothing much we can do if we don't catch it..."" I was so livid because it seemed like they just didn't care about their guests' concerns and didn't live up the standards of their hotel!

Don't get me wrong.. if it wasn't for the room key ordeal and how it was handled, perhaps we would have had a better experience. After all, their food courts and bars were pretty nice and had a fair set of options... BUT the customer service was horrible. I ended up asking to speak with the manager at the end of my stay because I was so unsatisfied with how the front desk and security were handling the problems. He ended up  giving me a discount and took off my resort fees; I wasn't expecting them to but I'm glad I got that because it was a chore going back and forth all the time to front desk to solve the situation. I just didn't understand why they just didn't send someone to our room the first (and second time) to take care of this! They had to wait until I really told them how upset I was enough to talk with the manager!

Save your money and do not stay in this hotel! It's okay to visit but not to stay in! The rooms are not even that great... It just looks good on the outside but the inside of the rooms is very plain looking. The prices they offer don't even do justice to how much this hotel stay is really worth....

The casino is right smack in the middle of the pyramid- Cool, if that's your thing & cigarrete odor permeates the entire structure- Big sad face for me. I guess we were so excited to check in I gave this no real thought & went with a pyramid room rather than a tower room because it just sounds cooler to stay in the pyramid. Then it hits you- the minute you step out of your room the cigarette odor attaches itself to your hair and clothes. No matter how fast you run to the exit. Though I am NOT pleased with this I can't give a bad rating as a result of my decision. I speculate that  this is not an issue at the tower since they are apart from the casino.

Start off with a ""pyramid deluxe king"" room...what was deluxe about it? The mold and mildew on the window curtains and valance, I suppose. My throat started to hurt immediately--psychosomatic? Yes, but had we stayed an entire night in that musty dungeon, we would have literally been inhaling far too many toxic fumes and mold spores--yes, even for two smokers.

Having waited 30 minutes in the line to check-in (this at 3:00 pm, THE check-in time, with only one person behind the 15-yard long counter), then walked with our bags across the entire casino to get to the specified elevator for the area we were to stay in, then walking about half as far down the hall to our room, all we were looking forward to was a clean room (and perhaps a bottle of champagne). So imagine our surprise, ahem, disgust, when we entered our room. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the room was muggy and probably about 80 degrees or so--with the aircon on high--the bedspreads were dingy and aged; there was no minibar or mini fridge; so on...THEN we noticed the still-wet mildew stains on the window curtains and valance. Then noticed the mold...wow, this was unacceptable. I'm not one of the overly-picky bitches of the world, but when it comes to the service industry, I expect and demand to be treated accordingly to my money spent, and simply for being a patron.

I telephoned the front desk with my complaint, and made it absolutely clear that the room was in deplorable condition. I was advised to return to the front desk to discuss the matter with the proper managerial staff.  No problem, really, other than the retracing of steps all the way back to the counter--a walk of about 10 minutes, literally.  After being redirected from one desk to another, a floor manager approached me and escorted me to the proper location and person to speak with.  In less than five minutes, the front desk manager apologized for the condition of the room, upgraded us to a deluxe tower king suite, and waved all fees for upgrading--hell if I was about to pay a CENT for an upgrade! 

So, not all was lost in the first evening at the Luxor. Our new room was beautiful, with a great view and much, MUCH more luxurious digs. We even got the special secret-back-way tour\/short-cut from our previous room to the new one, which was pretty fun as we got the inside scoop on where celebrities stay, how they get past paparazzi, etc.

The rest of our stay at the Luxor was great. The room service was always on time and always good; the in-house bars and restaurants were impeccable.  Had the first afternoon's events never occurred, I would be rating the Luxor a much higher 4 stars, probably. And after demanding improvement, the quickness with which my needs were met was commendable.  However, guests should NEVER, ever, have to demand results when they are promised ahead of time.  This is a reflection of a careless and sub-par management, in my opinion.  But because they were quick to make up for their mistakes, I give the Luxor a bit more credit.",0,0,0

 The hotel isn't maintained to the best standards, either. It feels kind of like somewhere that has had it's day and it's getting a bit tired.

The casino has tons of places to eat, shop and game. It connects directly to both Excalibur and Mandalay bay via walking tunnels as well as a tram that runs all day every day between the two until 11pm or so.

Yes, the sheets on the bed were quite thin and the room gets cold, but you can easily adjust the temperature of the room to your liking since you'll have access to the air\/heater. 
They do charge an automatic $18 fee per day for having access to wifi, the gym, pool, 2 free drinks and a coupon book. 
Yes, the walls are quite paper thin. I could hear people flushing toilets, and housekeepers vacuuming. I could also hear people's conversation if they were outside my door. 
I am not a light sleeper though so I slept pretty good. Traffic noise didnt really bother me either.

Two things worth seeing at the Luxor:
Fantasy (I have a review for that!), and Bodies : The Exhibition. 
We saw Criss Angel too, but it wasn't that great.

Overall I would stay at this hotel again. I assume the negative reviews are pertaining to the older rooms\/ sections of the hotel. If you want to stay at the newly renovated rooms, try to go for the tower rooms.",1,0,0

Booked two rooms and both of them leaked where there's the slanted window.  Called to complain and nothing was done or compensated.  Since it happened in 2\/2 rooms, I'm going to assume it's a lot of the rooms.  BS!

Elevators are janky!

Pricing for luxor is the only benefit; if you really don't care about your room since you barely are in there, then it's economical to stay here.  But if you count cab fares (since its at the end of strip instead of middle), then you may want to reconsider depending on where you're going on the strip.

And for a cheap casino, there aren't many or any $5 tables on the weekends.",4,1,2

Last night we went to our room at 2:30 am and found a stain that looked like blood on our sheets. It was gross and I slept on the couch. When we talked to the day manager his only response  was to talk to his cleaning team. Even though we gave him the sheet showing the stain. It was no big deal or suprised of the stain. 

The only good part of the visit was Jason, the baggage guy. He is amazing  employee, but I do not think we would stay at the Luxor again. It is a bad enough stay that I am writing  a complaint with the MGM company. 

What makes me angry was the lack of care and professionalism  concering our experience. Not because we were unhappy or because we were nitpicking but because they mislead us as customers. Our complaint was about the Luxor errors.

When we booked our room we talked to about five diffrent  people on the phone and asked questions from the size of the hot tub and the view. We did expect the room to look like the pictures online, but they do not match the actual rooms.

 I will not say do not stay at the Luxor just be prepared to not have a caring staff and know that your room may have stained floors and watch the bedding. No matter the price, it was disappointing  and I would not recommend  to stay there.

My husband and I booked our 10 year wedding anniversary at the Luxor because it was a great price and the pictures looked good. I read the reviews and thought that it may be people being picky. When we arrived, we found out that the room we booked 6 months ago was not what we booked. Las Vegas no longer allows hot tubs in rooms and the pyramid does not have any type of strip view. We were told the opposite. The hot tub is out of the hotels control and I understand that. However, when we booked our room we were assured that we would have a strip view. When I booked the hotel we explained that it was our 10 year wedding anniversary and we wanted a romantic room, it was confirmed that we had one of the nicest. The room we were assigned to get was on the upper floor overlooking the airport. 

I went to the manager and spoke to Brook,s he was accommodating and explained that there are no hot tubs on the strip and explained that there is no rooms in the hotel that has strip views. After a little back and forth, we settled on a tower suite that is actually pretty nice. It is outdated, but it is nice. we have a view that shows the MGM and it is pretty with the two wall to ceiling windows. The down side is that the neighbors in the next room has screaming kids and it sounds like they are in the room with us. THIN WALLS. The Shower has a shower head like a camping sight, good pressure, but not romantic. Overall, it is a nice room, just not romantic when you can hear your neighbors open and shut their door. It is just thin walls and feels like no privacy.

I loved all the hieroglyphics carved into the walls (if you haven't figured it out I'm a big nerd... I got teased for wanting to be an Egyptologist instead of a teacher or fireman like a lot of other kids) and the rooms in the west tower were large and  nicely decorated with very large bathrooms and tubs. The hotel itself is beautiful but it has a LOT less going on inside than the other hotels and my family and I ended up spending a lot more time at the Excalibur and New York New York than our own hotel. 

I will say that I was really impressed by their Pyramid Cafe's food and the Pharoah's Pheast Buffet. The food was really tasty and much better than the other Vegas buffets I had eaten at. The pizza at Pyramid Cafe is made to order and very fresh. SOOOO good... it was a very pleasant surprise.

I was disappointed that check-in doesn't begin until 11:30am... c'mon, it's Vegas! People are coming in at all hours of the day and making a ton of people wait until 11:30 and then having them all bum-rush the counter resulting in a VERY VERY long line is a system that does not work very well. 

Suzanne B. is NOT lying when she talks about the towels being tiny and feeling like sandpaper because as soon as I grabbed one the word ""sandpaper"" instantly popped into my mind. The hotel bed comforter was not much better. Very thin, stif and scratchy. Disappointing.

 I also expected that a big hotel would offer free wi-fi to it's guests in their rooms but instead I saw people in the hallways leading to the west tower walking around with their laptops trying to find a connection. Last but not least, I didn't like that microwaves and refrigerators weren't provided in the rooms. My dad is diabetic and needs to refrigerate his insulin and we had to call the front desk and have them deliver a bulky mobile one to his room. Also... I thought that maid service usually happened at a decent hour like noon  ;p  ... however, we were sorely mistaken when the maid walked into our room at 9am after a long long long night of drinking and gambling.",1,1,1

My hubby and I have been to Vegas many many times and we have stayed all over the strip from the suites at Bellagio to the budget friendly Tropicana. In my opinion Luxor is barely a step above Tropicana or Hooters. 

To keep this a short and simple read I'll just say the room wasn't very clean (i.e. the tables were dusty and sticky, the closet stunk and the floors were dirty... various shoe prints all over the bathroom floor). The sheets had stains & tears and the pool has absolutely no shade. Its just a lot of hot concrete, other hotels at least make at effort at landscaping. Lastly, the parking is a nightmare!

In addition to all of that, the customer service is terrible. I have daily medication that needs to be refrigerated. At check in I asked for a small refrigerator and I was told it would cost an extra $25 a day. I even showed them the meds that I had in a small cooler, and I was told to either pay the $25 or go and get a Ziploc bag and put my meds on ice. I have NEVER stayed in a hotel that refused to make accommodations for medicine, NEVER!!! It is ridiculous that just because I have medication that needs to be kept cool I had to pay $25 more per night that any other ordinary guest. There has to be some kind of law against that...

As we approached our pyramid room I noticed how dark and dusty everything was.  The room itself smelled horribly of distance I have yet to stop coughing.  I called down to the front desk to try and move away from whatever air creation is right or side our room and was told I needed to go to the lobby.
I decided to go down to the lobby after trying a nap hoping I would get used to the dust.  When. I went down to the lobby to request this move I was rudely told that you get what you pay for.  I realize that by I also realize the dust should not be making you sick.  Anyway tired of the argument we have stayed in our room where I continue to cough.

BEWARE of GrandView working as a promotional third party company looking to take advantage of you in order to get you to take a tour of their timeshares. We were approached as soon as we entered Luxor by a gentleman named Noel who basically led us over to this counter in the middle of the lobby. NOTE they wear the exact same uniform as the staff who actually works for the hotel. There was no sign on the counter or anywhere to suggest there was a third party involved. We believed we were being greeted and led to a counter to be checked in. Rico behind the desk, basically offered us what we heard as free shows that got turned into requirements that weren't fully disclosed such as paying $50 and going to a 5 hour time share meeting with only their transportation etc. We were scammed. Sherri was the only kind one. I assumed she was the manager. We were told to go to another counter to get our refund cause her booth had no cash.

So the room ended being about $70 for two queen beds. My high rating isn't to say that this is the best, or (certainly) the classiest hotel ever, but for the price, it was a great experience.

The staff was friendly and accommodating: I had to leave right after check-in so a friend waited for me in his car downstairs as I sorted that out and ran up to my room to get changed. The security guy downstairs gave him no hassle and let him pull into a clearly marked No Parking zone for as long as it took, despite the fact that they were busy. The front desk clerk was great at check-in, as was the clerk at check-out. In fact, every employee I encountered had a great attitude, a sense of humor and did their work with a smile. The front desk also gladly offered me a late checkout when I called down about checkout times.

I flew out the next evening and the bell desk safely held my luggage at no charge for the several hours I had to kill before leaving for the airport. They want you to stick around and spend money, of course, but it's still very nice. 

The room itself was nothing to write home about, but it was clean, comfortable, well-maintained and quiet (except for the faint, ever present  din of the casino coming from the atrium outside the door) and that's plenty good for me.

They do somehow manage to pack a seemingly impossible volume of unhip shows into their hotel\/casino, which I actually found charming in a strange way, but I'm kind of a messed up dude. 

I mean, where else can you find Criss Angel, Carrot Top, Menopause (The Musical!) and ""JABBAWOCKEEZ"" all under one roof? Nowhere. Because, well, they're all at the Luxor and...Jesus, why!? 

Don't get me wrong: I like Carrot Top. People bag on the poor guy, but he was great as the secret guest commentary on the ""Rules Of Attraction"" DVD and his Reno 911 appearance was priceless. I'll bet he puts on a damn good show too and maybe I'll even go see it next time and get a picture with him after.

I also took a dip in the pool, which was fine, except it seemed to be 3 1\/2 feet deep everywhere. I walked over to the pool next to it that appeared to actually be made for adults and there was only one person there sitting on the edge dangling their feet in it. Then I noticed the signs declaring that it was an extra fee to use this pool which I thought was incredibly lame. For that, I'm taking a star off.

It's further down the strip so if you want to get to the more central part of the strip (Caesar's, Bellagio, MGM) you have either walk 30 minutes, which in the Las Vegas heat is not always desirable, or spend $30 to take a cab there and back. And at busy times (Friday\/Saturday night) you'll have to wait in a 20 minute line for a cab. All of this effort isn't really worth it for an ""okay"" hotel.

The second big annoyance with this hotel is the elevators. They take FOREVER. I think we waited 5-6 minutes at one point.

The room my friends and I stayed in was fine, but our friends' room had wallpaper coming off the walls right above the bed, it looked like there had been something hanging there but it was ripped off. Definitely noticeable and unsightly. Also note if you are going with a big group and staying in separate rooms, make sure you get rooms on the same floor or at least in the same wing\/section! There's different elevators for different floors and you need your key to use the elevator, so it's quite a challenge to go to your friends' room if you're on different elevators.

I'd recommend the Tacos and Tequila restaurant that's on the second floor, really good food\/drinks. The drink stand, however, I would not recommend. My friends and I all got yard sizes of the frozen drinks offered there and we all felt really sick after. They're definitely too sugary and you can definitely get better elsewhere in Vegas.

Of course not, but they did a dang good job if you ask me.  First off on a personal note, I don't like Criss Angel or Carrot Top and they are the Luxor poster children right now so it was a little obnoxious seeing ads for them at every turn, but hey... there are worse things in life.

There are like three Starbucks locations here which was freakin awesome.  I really liked that the rooms are not a super huge hike from the Casino floor.

I'm glad I kept the reservation. They gave us a tower room because I told them my husband was allergic to smoke.
 We had no problems what so ever. Our room was clean and smelled fresh. The bed was comfy and the staff came in and made the bed and cleaned up every day. Even when we slept till noon we would still come back to a clean room with fresh towels.
The only thing I saw in the bathroom was a little hard water around the edges of the shower door. I am from Oklahoma and I know all about hard water. No big deal!
There was also no wifi which was pretty weird but there was an ethernet cable for the laptop and it reached anywhere in the room.
I would stay here again if the price is right!",0,0,0

I recently stayed here Oct 1st week for a Dermatology conference (I'm a dermatologist physician) that was being held in Mandalay Bay next door. I got a good deal and didn't realize before I got there how seriously the rooms were in need of renovations. They look outdated as if they hadn't been changed since 80's, but that didn't bother me as much as what happened next. I woke up the first morning with a very large red bump on the side of my face but was so busy that day, I didn't even have time to give thought to it. The 2nd morning upon awakening in their bed I found three large red welts on my right arm, and realized I had been infested by bed bugs. I have posted a picture of my bites. I showed it to several of my derm colleagues as well whom agreed I had been bitten by bed bugs. I contacted the hotel front desk and told them about my bug situation and they switched me to another room, where thankfully I didn't wake with more bed bug bites the rest of the stay. However, I will tell you 3 months later I still have marks left on me from where I had the bug bites and they actually still itch time to time. 

I sent Luxor hotel an email detailing my situation when I got home but never even received a response back apologizing. I would have expected a discounted stay, free meal, or something along those lines to say sorry. After returning home, I searched online and found TONS of reports of bed bugs online. So just beware people, you may be making unwanted friends while staying here, and as a doc who sees these all the time, they tend to come home with you and are very hard to get rid of.",0,0,0

So it was with some nostalgia that I returned here this past weekend after getting a room for $66 on Priceline. Following a long flight from New York (that was delayed over three hours) all I wanted was a shower and a nap. But that was not to be at the Luxor, at least not very quickly. A long line loomed at check-in which I found only after being accosted by employees trying to get me to buy show tickets. Their opening line ""Where are you from?!"" left me nonplussed.

Once I finally had a room key in hand I trudged up to my room only to find it either occupied or unclean - possibly both. The bed was unmade and it wasn't clear if someone was still in it. And a half full cocktail sat on the desk.

I quickly closed the door.

I was then treated to another journey downstairs on the impossibly slow elevators to fetch keys to a new room. At long last I made it to my room in the tower. This was apparently an upgrade.

All told, staying at the Luxor is not an experience I'd like to have again soon. But if you're simply looking for a decently clean place to crash in between trips to da club and\/or the slots, it's passable.",14,11,11

It was a surprise for hubby, which I have been planning for 2 years.  Hubby and I first walked through Luxor in 2001 while visiting Vegas and he always wanted to stay there.  When I booked the trip, I was glad we got a good rate on the room, but then I read all of the bad reviews on Yelp and I got really nervous.  I paid $320 for 3 nights, which included the resort fee and taxes.  Hubby and I would survive if the room was bad, but we had 8 friends joining us from all over the US and I did not want them to have a shitty hotel experience because I insisted we stay there.

Our experience at Luxor surpassed all expectations.  Yes, it is an older hotel, out of the way on the Strip and not as nice as the newer Strip hotels, but we really liked this hotel.  We were able to check-in early soon after our flight landed at noon.  The elevator is really old, sounded like it would crash any minute and showed a lot of wear and tear, but our room was just 2 doors down from it and we never waited more than a couple of minutes for one, so no worries.  We stayed in the Pyramid Deluxe room,  which had a view of Mandalay Bay and we could see the airport.  The room was huge, really clean and tastefully decorated.  The bathroom was clean and the shower was a good size walk-in with excellent water pressure.  Everyone in our group said the beds were super comfortable and they all liked their rooms.  Our room did not smell like smoke as a lot of other Yelpers posted.

Yes, we got harassed by the timeshare people, but we barely spent any time at the hotel, other than sleeping, so it was not that bad and if you just ignore them, they leave you alone.  Yes, they have the Ethernet cable and not wifi, but we only slept in our room and never needed to use the computer because we were enjoying Vegas.

Our maid, Maria, took excellent care of our room ... with fresh towels and turn down service every day.  Hubby and friends hit the blackjack tables after midnight every night we returned to the hotel after hanging elsewhere on the Strip and had a little luck.  

Would I stay here again ... yes, because the price is right and the hotel was pretty decent compared to our 2001 visit to Imperial Palace, which was a dump.  After visiting the other hotels, like Cosmopolitan and Bellagio, the crowd at Luxor is definitely more downscale, but the price at Luxor is really good and truly can't be beat.

So, I had to repack and move to another room. To add insult to injury, I asked if I can have a show ticket or spa treatment comp'd instead of the food voucher.

Spacious room with a large, gorgeous marble bathroom. No noise complaints, but that's always dependent upon neighbors. Housekeeping was great and we enjoyed ourselves at the pool,

If I stayed at a motel I most likely would've enjoyed it more. I paid almost $400 for a two day stay at this crappy establishment. I decided to go the the LAX club that is located in the Luxor with 5 of my friends who were also staying at the hotel (all girls). I entered the club with them at around 10:30 pm. I had bought two drinks one for myself and one for my girlfriend and then proceeded to hang out with her and our friends. All I managed to do while I was in the club was take a picture of the girls and talk for about 15 minutes. Immediately a security guard from the club came up to me and asked me to speak with him and I agreed. He started to shove  me roughly and I asked what I did. He didn't answer instead just said c'mon. He now tried to drag me into a room and I said I wouldn't go anywhere unless he told me what I did. At this point he put me in a chokehold and threw me out of the club on the floor straight on my face. He tried to grab me again so I pushed him away and angrily rushed back to my room. 
         
Now afterwards about an hour later I went to the help desk and asked to speak to the manager to complain. He was no help and didn't care about what I had to say. Instead he tried to blame me and kick me out. To say the least this place was shit and anywhere else you decide to stay in Las Vegas is guaranteed to be better.

We saw hotels closer to the middle of the strip that were priced the same so it was not a ""you pay for what you get for"" situation. Things I didn't like were:

1) Parking is $8 per night even for hotel guests
2) They charge an extra $25 to check out past 11am
3) Clientele is something to be desired. 
4) Lines to check-in and check-out were very long. 
5) The location was really bad and away from everything 
6) Food prices were way more expensive than other areas on the strip. Starbucks was almost double for what you would pay off the strip.

Wir hatten hier kurz nach der Eröffnung im Jahre 1993 dort mal übernachtet und damals war dieses Hotel in Form einer schwarzen Glaspyramide eine Sensation.

Hinter dem Hotel steht ein Parkhaus mit kostenfreien Parkplätzen zur Verfügung. Vom Durchgang in das Kasino konnte man die schöne und große Poolanlage bewundern. Als wir damals dort übernachtet hatten, gab es im Inneren einen Fluß mit Fähren, die die Gäste zu den Aufzügen fuhren. Dieser Service  wurde aber mittlerweile eingestellt, da sich dies in der Praxis als nicht so zweckmäßig erwiesen hat.

Das Luxor wurde in 18 Monaten gebaut mit einem Budget von 400 Millionen Dollar. 1998 kamen zur 107 Meter hohen Pyramide dann noch 2 Tower dazu, um die Bettenkapazität zu erhöhen. Es hat mittlerweile 4.400 Betten und hat es damit in die Top Ten der größten Hotels geschafft. Vom Strip ausgesehen, kann man den Nachbau der Großen Sphinx von Gizeh im Maßstab 1:2 bewundern.

Das große Casino mit 11.000 m² verfügt über 106 Spieltische mit Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, Baccarat, Poker, Pai Gow Poker, Sportsbook und mehr als 2.000 Slots, Videopoker- und Videokenogeräte. Darüber hinaus gibt es für die reicheren Gäste einen Players Club den sogenannten ""M life Players Club"".

Das Interieur ist im Hotel natürlich dem Thema Ägypten gewidmet. Im Hotel gibt es diverse Shows, Restaurants, Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und vieles mehr. Von der Pyramidenspitze leuchtet ein kräftiger Lichtstrahl senkrecht in den Himmel. Das Hotel ist mit dem Mandalay Bay und dem Excalibur mit einer kostenfreien Monorail verbunden.

I was really excited to stay here because the last time I stayed here was when I was 9 (14 years ago 2001) and I had SO many memories and it was nice. I guess after 14 years of not giving a sh!t can ruin a once awesome place!

A LOT of the Egyptian theming is gone but it's still there still somewhere behind all of the shows and exhibits they offer. The casino is VERY small and it felt very low too. I know all of this is true because I have pictures in a photo album next to the casino and it's pretty much gone from those years. 
The smell of the place is....interesting. The entire place smelly like a scented candle and it lingered on my clothes even after leaving downtown (lot of smokers there).

Now the rooms....disappointing as well! It looks as if the  management has given up on here. I mean, come on you can take some extra time and give it a refreshing look! The beds weren't very comfortable, the shower sucked, the stuff\/furniture needs to be fixed up a little, wired internet is a joke; I could keep going on about how the room is but I think you got the hint.

The decor is nice (whatever is left of it) but the obelisk outside is just...vandalized per se with the gum and writing on it :\/

This place is just bad. I regret coming here and wasting my money on something that ruined my nostalgic memories. If they redo the entire place and bring back some Egyptian theming, I may stay here again, but so far all of that seems to look very bleak.

During the last weekend in January, when I was in yet another destination wedding, I finally got to!  I would come here again, on a lighter schedule, and remember to communicate to management if the room smells. And smell our room did. Like musty old towels, and possibly as if someone had smoked then tried to cover it up with too much grandma perfume. 

Not ten minutes after we had entered our room and noticed it smelled funky, a maintenance guy came into the room to say he had received a complaint about wet carpet. Well, it smelled that way, but as far as we could tell it wasn't wet. It also said something about their turnaround time, if it took him that long to check. Or perhaps they should have done a more thorough job in between the last guests leaving and our arrival? He checked some stuff and took our complaint, and we figured it would go away on its own if the carpet just needed to dry. We opened the slanted windows and turned on the A\/C to attempt to air it out. 

We had an incredibly full schedule, as a bridesmaid in a Vegas wedding's duties are never done, so every time I left I forgot to complain again about the smell, and every time I came back into the room the reminder of the smell hit me like a truck. Then, after a few minutes the smell would go away. And on and on the cycle went for three days. I know I should have complained again but I had so much to do I just forgot about it, then after a day or so, I figured it would be too late. Sigh. I also noticed that some of the fixtures, carpet, and walls seemed to be a little worn, but the décor is so fun that I feel  it was a good compromise. Nothing was visibly dirty in the slightest. Well, ok the outside of the windows when the sun hit them just right.

The Luxor is fairly inexpensive for Vegas, and we got a much better deal than other guests that elected to stay in the attached Mandalay Bay, where the wedding was to take place. I of course enjoyed the hell out of the theme. I am pretty sure there was a mummy in our closet. The architectural style of the Luxor is unique as well. It is not your imagination. The elevators move sideways! There's plenty to do and see here, including exploring Bodies or perhaps Titanic artifacts. The More Buffet had a comprehensive breakfast spread, though I'm not sure how I feel about Anubis watching me eat. Could be silently hoping for me to choke? 

All in all, we were satisfied but really put off by the weird room smell. I would consider staying here again. You can't beat staying the night inside a pyramid.

Footnotes: 
1.Use your Do Not Disturb sign until you are ready to go out. The cleaning folks are super aggressive. I got almost barged in on twice while in The Nude. They knock, then don't wait very long for an answer. Twice they tried to come in even though we were both shouting NOT YET. Like some kind of sitcom, I swear. If this place wasn't a giant mothertruckin' pyramid I would probably rate it lower.
2. Check out the shops between Luxor and Mandalay. Amazing! There's a Lush! Hussong's is yummy, and the Guinness Store and Ri Ra Pub is the only place you can visit a piece of the Guinness factory outside of Dublin.",29,24,20

After I inquired about a room and they added it all up...it was $505.00 for the weekend. 
Got the keys and then went back to the car to get some belongings....and then started the LONNNNGGGGG walk to elevator 1B. 

The parking is just ferocious if you ask me. There are 2 main areas to park....and both areas are way to far to have to walk to your room. 

There is a roof-top type parking area....right by the elevator and the long aisle way with the pool view on both sides~~ leading to the front doors. ---OR--- street level behind the pool area...which is even LONGER.

They have a night club inside called LAX (Didn't go). 
They have a nice open area type bar....and they also have 3 stripper type dancers dancing on a Lil stage next to the casino floor. 

Starbucks inside the Luxor is crazy expensive. 

The room itself has terrible lighting....There is not even 1 bright light anywhere 8((

Ashley, a front desk\/check-in receptionist is outrageously rude.  I'm sorry for anyone who encounters her.  She's young, long dark hair... rolls her eyes a lot and gives answers like, ""I don't know, I don't work in house keeping"" when you ask her when your room might be available to check in.

Perry, a manager at the front, is also entirely useless.  We came at 3:00 to check in, as that's the designated check-in time, and our room was not ready.  He apparently could not find out at all when it might be ready.  Last I checked, housekeeping has walkie talkies on them and can easily be reached.  He told us the room could be ready in 5 minutes or as late as 10:00pm, that there was no guarantee on check-in time.  F that.  That is unacceptable.  We booked a suite, check-in is at 3.

My only complaints... the bed was a little bit hard for my liking. However, we were tired both nights so once I actually laid down to sleep, this was a non issue. Also, the walls are a little thin, but I feel like this is the case in most hotels-- it didn't keep us from sleeping or wake us up, but I could hear things in the morning; mostly the maid singing while she cleaned the room next door.

What I liked-- The price was right, the room was clean, everything was as expected. I like that it's connected to a few other hotel\/casinos so that you can explore without going out.

I have traveled to the city over a dozen times now and I have never experienced such a blatant lack of customer service in my life. Upon check-in we were informed of a 13$ per day room fee that neither my boyfriend or I ever recall being informed of. This fee was for two 4oz bottles of water and internet, daily. I had my laptop, so I figured, why not? Well because the ethernet cord (yes, it's NOT wireless) is fashioned behind the TV in a way that you have to drag a chair over to the stand and sit snuggled up to your TV to use it. Ironically the room has a desk, that you can't use if you want to also use the internet. 

The second disaster was my best friend's bachelor party  which we started off at the Cat House. At first the atmosphere was enjoyable but after buying an overpriced round of drinks I inquired about renting out a hookah. I was first told 38$ an hour and I said SURE! Then I was told it was that PLUS each one of the four of us had to drink up a 30$ tab AND that the 60$ in drinks I just bought, didn't count. The waitress then said she was going to ask her manager if we could make an exception and she disappeared. Long story short, we left. (Meanwhile, the bride had her own disaster at LAX when she was told that her and her friends weren't showing enough skin to dance in certain areas of the club.)

The pool area was again lacking and nothing special, very dated. Two out of the five nights, I don't think our room got cleaned. We never got refills on shampoo, I had to wash my hair with body wash at one point. And the shower was HORRIBLE, no places to set anything down, or shave or really anything for that matter. The TV remote was dead and we got two queens instead of the king we requested. There was also no safe in the room, which after all this great service made me a little sketch. 

The day of the wedding I ordered champaign to the room and on top of the bottle which cost about 38$ for a 10$ champaign, that I would have to pay an additional 4.50 for each person who wanted to drink it. I agreed and when they came to the room it was cash only! No room bill or credit\/debit. Just cash. Again, pretty sketchy if you ask me. I was not prepared so the bride had to pay for it.

The Luxor cafe, the inexpensive breakfast? Cost me 20 bucks for an omelet & orange juice. I would've eaten McDonald's but they hid that on the second floor with very little signage to remind you it's there.

First off I like the whole Egyptian theme and the fact that the hotel looks like a pyramid. Our flight got in early (7:30 AM) so I knew our room probably wouldn't be ready or if it was i don't want to pay an early check in fee. So when we arrived at the hotel the bell man was very friendly and offered to take our luggage so we left it with him and went exploring until check in time. 

Check In: Got back a little after 3:00 PM to check in and the check in line wasn't too long. I do have a Mlife Pearl card so they have a separate line to check in and I didn't have to wait in line. The front desk staff was friendly and accommodating. He upgraded us to a Deluxe King strip view on the 12th floor and threw in a fridge. Parking has a fee but since I have a Pearl Mlife card self parking is free. Just need to use your Mlife card at the gate. Parking was not a problem to find.

The Room: is a little outdated as most the reviews say, but it was clean and comfortable. Because the Luxor is on the South end of the strip there's not much to see other than the airport lol, Madalay Bay and Tropicana. Room was nice with a tub near the window. A\/C was nice and cold. Read some other reviews about bad a\/c, but I guess we got a good one. Noise was non existent even though our room was by the elevator and away from the open walkways over the casino area.  

Check Out: was easy and fast. The staff was very friendly.  I had some credit left from my free $50 resort credit and the front desk lady asked if I wanted to use it up before I checked out so I said ok and went to Blizz Frozen Yogurt (Don't go here, very poor service). They said I can't use my resort credit there so I went back to the front desk and she told me that I should be able to use it there, if not just charge it to my room and she'll waive it. So I went back to Blizz and the ""manager lady"" told me her ""system was down"" and I would have to pay with credit card or cash. I just paid with my credit card and took my receipt to the front desk afterward. Front desk told me they couldn't reimburse me n my card but offered to comp the resort fee because of the trouble I had at Blizz.

We stayed in East Tower 17th floor and let me tell you, stay in a tower rather than a pyramid! First off the view! Second not a lot of noise, third you are right next to the walk way to the Excalibur and strip. The hotel needs to be badly remodeled, for the amount I had paid if I would pay a bit more I could have went to MGM or Paris. The Room furnishings are falling apart, sofas, dresser, tables, drawers, bathroom shower and tub. I have been staying at the Luxor for about 10 years and it's really beginning to age. The room side of things brings their scored from a 5 to a 3. Now let's get started with casino and dinning. The casino is one of the best, friendly people, waitress was very nice and games are fun. So no problem there! The buffet at the Luxor although is something else, for the past 10 years it has been the same crap. Their selection sucks! And the food is nothing but chicken, and the desserts are awful. 80-90% of the time the only good dessert, which is the ice cream machine is down! With how much each person is paying whether a day pass or one time charge, it is definitely not worth what you pay. This made our stay not as enjoyable! My conclusion is, the Luxor in my opinion was one of the best! The theme, the hotel itself is a place to be with the body and titanic museum, not to include the casino, but the room and food, is one of the worst now! I don't think I will be coming back, which is a surprise as I always choose the lux life. Although next year might be a time to sleep and dine somewhere that my money will be worth the spending. With the strip and a majority of Las Vegas being more of an attraction to children and tourists, the hotel should be a place for adult to sleep and enjoy their stay.",0,0,0

I did not stay at the hotel. I own a second home in Las Vegas. This is just a personal opinion: I understand why the resort might want to charge parking for those visitors who do not spend money on the property. However, I dined at one of the restaurants, and watched a performance of the ""Blue Man Group"". Between those two activities, I alone, spent over $200.00.

Each spa suite is located at the corners of the pyramid, and there are 4 sets of elevators in each corner with each corner only going to a specific set of floors. As luck would have it, our suite was on the opposite side of the pyramid from the elevators that serviced our floor, so the walk to get to and from the room was quite exhausting. Anyone booking one of these suites should ask at check in where their room is in relation to the elevators for their floor. After walking all day long, the last thing we want is more walking back at our hotel.

The elevators (inclinators) in the pyramid are fun. Every day you will see drunk people almost fall over as they go up sideways, not straight up and down like normal elevators. Also, they added a security measure where someone on the elevator needs to insert a room key for a room on that floor in order for the button for that floor to light up. Always good for some fun watching people repeatedly press the button for their floor, wondering why it won't light up, and then getting upset when it passes their floor.

There is no wifi. An ethernet cable is provided, but my husband had to dig around behind the TV to restart the router in order to get it to work. Our shower was clogged.

We really enjoyed our room.  It was kind of on a corner, so we had a large tub in a tiled area under the window\/slanted pyramid wall.  The interior of the rooms wasn't overly Egyptian; just some hieroglyphics on the wardrobe and a large stone-type ""artifact"" on the wall.  Other than the slanted walls near the windows, it could have been a typical hotel room anywhere.  The room was very clean and had lots of storage space as well as plenty of furniture (couch, chairs, tables, extra sitting room).  

The casino was always moderately busy, but I never had trouble finding a machine in the denomination I wanted (given I was there during the week, I wasn't surprised).   We did dislike Centro Bar and Helen, the incredibly crabby bartender who treated us like absolute dirt... and we were paying cash, not using a coupon.  Sorry we bothered you, Helen.  

We ate at Rice & Company and absolutely loved our food.  He had the shrimp fried rice, and I had the ahi tuna salad and some salmon rolls.  Excellent quality and service.   

We also were married at the Chapel at Luxor.  They have a variety of packages and were happy to accomodate us midweek (when they're not that booked).  It was incredibly easy coordinating the ceremony and my salon services at Nurture.  Thanks to Darcy, Thong, Laura, and Maria @ Nurture for your help making me look great!  :)",0,0,0

The Mexican restaurant upstairs  (T&T) is good (casual), and the Public House is good (casual).  

The pyramid rooms are just plain old.  The newer tower has better quality rooms.  The kicker about this place - No WiFi for guests.

We arrived about 5 hours before check in and planned on dropping our bags off at the front desk and to then hit the town. When we got to the check in desk we were told the hotel were doing early check ins as a courtesy! As we walked through the casino someone approached us asking if we were single and if they could give us a voucher. Neither one of us (my friend and I) are, so we said no thanks and went on our way. We stayed on floor 20 and the elevator may make you somewhat uneasy since its going up sideways because of the pyramid shape of the hotel.  Our room was spacious with a lovely view of the pool and the mountains. We had a shower with absolutely no shelving for our bath products, which was a hassle. There was no mini fridge, coffee pot, or microwave. 

The view from the hallway was of the mezzanine, which was pretty cool. There are endless slushie stops, a food court, and a few restaurants inside the hotel. Oh, and three Starbucks! There are a few 24 hour convenient shops that will attempt to rob you blind charging $11 for a bottle of Advil. I would recommend stopping by one of the Walgreen's on the strip if you're needing anything like that.

My friend and I were harassed every time we attempted to pass through the hotel. I'm not sure who these people even work for but they're wearing suits and they stand at different parts of the hotel (mainly around the casino) and attack any innocent passerby with, ""Where are you ladies from?"" ""Are you ladies single?"" By the end of the trip we had been approached by so many of these people I was just looking at them and shaking my head no as soon as they would open their mouths.

The pool closes as 7:00 pm which is a huge bummer, since we were usually out on the strip later than that. The pool was relatively small with some chained off areas which I'm assuming are for private parties. We only made it to the pool once and for 30 minutes.

Overall it was a pleasant experience, but I most likely wouldn't stay here again because of the location. It is at the end of the strip, so walking anywhere takes quite a while.",1,0,0

I arrived to check-in around 11pm after a night of hanging out around Vegas. I had booked a double queen bedroom hotel room and got my keys to a room all the way on the other end of the casino. So far I would've rated the place a 3 or 4 stars because it is a bit old for a casino hotel on the Strip, but the staff felt nice and a lot of people seem to be enjoying themselves. 

As I got to the room the keys would not work! I had to walk all the way back to the check-in and the staff told me he had given me a room that was already occupied, he then changed the room to the one next door (so I would not be lost). My girlfriend had to remind the staff to re-program the keys to the new room. After the staff assured me everything would be OKAY now I walk back to the room to find out it is a 1 king size bed room and not the double queen size bed room I had reserved. So I had to walk all the way back to the check-in again. When I ask the staff that I had order a double queen bed room he told me that it was more like a request but the type of room is not guaranteed! I have never heard that before! After arguing for a bit they agreed to provide a roller-bed for free. After another walk back to the room I found a big wet spot on the floor, by then I wasn't going to walk back and decided to call it a night. The room was pretty big but it was offset by the tilted walls, makes the room feel odd. Normally I would've probably given the hotel 2-3 stars.",3,1,0

It is clean and looks good, but when you look closely at the bathroom remodel you can see bubbling on the inside of the bathroom door that was painted over, the shower door was not square and did not shut properly and a gap in the tile base by the tub. It may sound picky but that's something I would expect at a hole in the wall place. I was glad to see low-flow toilet, though.

I was here for a convention from Jan 17th thru Jan 20th. I checked in on the 17th I didn't realize my room was not paid in full. I was told a deposit was made. I was shock thinking to myself I will deal with this later. The front desk had said ""in order to check in we must collect $150 and the rest of the balance will be charged to the card on file or you can on a different card if you wish"" ""This will only be a hold"". I said that's fine. The very next day I got a charge for $65 WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION! So I called the front desk and asked and all I heard was their BULLSHIT. So I let it go. 

Thursday night my coworker and I came down stairs to pay for the renaming balance on his card so by Friday I can just leave. I checked my account Friday and both hold transactions of $150 and $65 was released.
 
Saturday comes around and I got charged for $150 plus $65. I called the front desk and I told her what had happened and she said ""it's the system, we have nothing to do with it"" ""the money will be refunded in 7 to 10 business days"".

I'm thinking to myself what the hell is going on here! 
First, you put 2 holds on my account. Secondly, I came in to pay for the remaining balance. Third, you released the hold. Fourth, you charged my account again after the hold was released. Am I the only one who is confused?!

To top it off, staying at Luxor is like staying at Flamingo or Circus Circus. Everything in the room looks old and dingy. This hotel need to be moved to the end of the strip.

The first thing a visitor should know is that the Luxor is at the ass south end of the Strip.  The only thing it's nearby that's really great for restaurants and nightlife is the Manadalay Bay.  You've got quite a hike from here to the Bellagio, Caesar's, Wynn, etc.  You will probably end up cabbing it a lot if you don't drive in.  So, the location is crap.

The place has always given me the creeps.  That's just me, but it's true.  It's a creepy place.  It's a big glorified faux-tomb.  Creep-tastic.  The walk from the parking garage to the casino is ridiculous and turns into a freezing wind tunnel in the winters.  The cafe is not good.  It's a little tricky to navigate.

Needless to say we were upset, but when we called the front desk, they told us that ALL of the spas in the hotel were out of order. WTF? Really? And yet they neglected to tell us this when we booked, or while we were checking in. I was so frustrated. The only reason we booked the SPA SUITE was because of the spa! Duh! We would have switched our type of room when we checked in if we had been told the jets were broken.

Unfortunately that was in the 90's and I didn't think that they hadn't updated, fixed or properly maintained anything since the last time I was there! I had no idea, I wish I came here first. You know that show, Life After People? Yeah, that's what it looks like here. It seems like nothing had been changed or fixed since this place was first built, it's actually really sad! 

Good:
Hmm I can't really think of anything... I'd say my memories of this place

Bad:
Parking garage SUCKS! We parked at Mandalay Bay because the parking garage at the Luxor is so small and awkward. If you don't care if you get a door ding and you can find a spot then it's fine I guess

The layout of this place is so hard to navigate, every time we left the room we got lost.

The customer service here was just ok, we tried to do early check in and were told we would be called when the room was ready -- we never got a call.

The hallways were dirty and had what looked like mold along the top of the ceiling and in cracks where the wall was attached to the railing.

The elevator was so sketchy and rickety, the panels and the door were shaking and flopping around literally! That was the scariest elevator I've ever been in. If you're not going to update your hotel rooms you can at the very least update the elevators! Also, you can't even tell that you have to put your room key in to make it go!

The room was pretty bad. 
- The ""non-smoking"" room had cigarette burns in the chairs, on the wall and on the velor blanket. 
- The wall paper was peeling off in the bathroom and was mis-matched & stained in the rest of the room.
- The beds were hard, springy and bowed after years and years of use. 
- The chair cushion was stained and worn down.
- The varnish on the armor and on other drawers was worn off where the knobs were.
- The ""comforter"" was like a thin sheet which didn't cover the stained bottom mattress.
- The carpet seemed newer than other things in the room however it was still stained and dirty
- The AC only worked well when the blinds were closed, in the other room we got it barely worked.
- The TV was fuzzy\/had bad reception
- The paint on the bottom of the bathroom door had water damage and the paint was all bubbled, actually the entire door and door frame was really gross, it was dirty and stained as well. 
- The pillows had random stains and one didn't even have a pillowcase!


So because everything was so gross we refused to get into the bed and froze our asses off all night long. Didn't take a shower there because I would probably end up dirtier. I keep reading about free water, not in my room! However there was a Las Vegas Photo book that the last guest left! 

So overall this used to be a really nice place but it's definitely been neglected and has become just downright disgusting. I would say you get what you pay for but I would never pay to have to stay in a place like that. Unfortunately that's the last time I'll be staying at the Luxor.",2,0,0

Location: **I've stayed at the bellagio and bally's in my past stays in vegas. They were prime locations, right smack dead in the center of the strip. The Luxor is on the wayside of the strip. Don't want a costly hotel bill? Well think again because your taxi expense will shoot straight up faster than you can say, damn shit luxor you screwed me over. mhm. 

Service: 

**Checking in was a complete pain. The service agent was rude, impatient and a bit condescending. Well lady, screw you. ( i know i'm chicken shit, since i can't say it in front of her face... -__-)

**Me and my friends requested extra towels and they remarkably arrived at 11pm, mind you we ordered them around 4pm. Luckily we were already trashed as shit and tired from the lack of sleep the night before.

**Our room keys were somehow left inside our room, which was extremely frustrating esp. when it's @ 4am after a night of raging. The front desk was no help, they directed us to wait by the elevator for security, we waited 30 minutes and no one came. So we went back to the front desk, and some pleasant worker was able to provide us with new room keys. 

Room: **we had a room in the pyramid and it was pretty cool. Typical hotel room. Clean and spacious. Although, these rooms are like an oven. With the exterior of the building being all black and slanted, the head permeates though the glass and is trapped in your room. If you're there in the summer, blast the AC, and close the curtins, or you'll bake.. -____-

Pool:** Nice a sunny, no buildings casting a shadow over my GTL time. Huge area with a lot of seating to accommodate their other foolish guests.

Attractions:

Titanic Exhibit and Bodies Exhibit were stationed here during my visit. It def. an unforgettable experience, and a must see to everyone who is in vegas. (plus 1star)

I mean it's no Imperial Palace or Tropicana, but it certainly ain't no Mandalay Bay or Venetian!  The lobby is nice as noted by Artist Formerly Known As Stve X., but it is nothing like checking into the Bellagio.  They try to suck you into believing it's as nice as some of the hotels but it's a big giant Sphinx facade.  Take 2 steps past the lobby and all the intrigue gives way to an average hotel and casino.  A very dark, is there really such a thing as daylight outside kind of place.  

Unlike Stephy S., we did not stay in a suite, we stayed in a regular pyramid room.  Which had no suitcase stand by the way.  And no real closet and no full length mirror.  WTF?  The room looks big because it has no furniture.  King size bed.  Check.  2 bedside tables.  Check.  Tiny side table surrounded by 2 tiny chairs.  Check.  A tiny hallway table to throw your crap on.  Check.  A gigantic Egyptian decked out armoir containing, TV, drawers, closet, ironing board and 6 measly hangers.  Check.  

The bathroom was ok.  Except for the part where they provided bath rug...not a bath mat, but a bath rug.  Not even a soft one.   A crappy synthetic scratchy one that too many other people have stepped on.  And just cause they came out of the shower, doesn't mean they're clean.  These are not the type of rugs that can go through the washer on a daily basis.  I decided to forgo the rug in favor of one of the 3 measly bath towels they provided.  

I called for 2 extra pillows because between hubby and I we need 6 (don't ask...).  Guess what?  They were out of pillows???  Really?  How could they be out of pillows?  Perhaps they were all stashed up in one of their really fancy suites!  Ok, I'm just getting bitter now.

On a positive note, the bar near the registration desk is actually pretty nice...modern decor with comfy chairs. The pool area was my favorite place...mostly because of all the fresh air available out there.  They cheaped out and closed off at least one section of the pool each day because of lack of life guards I guess.  Also they didn't think they needed to bother with putting the canvas coverings over the frame like structures that were designed to actually provide some protection from the scorching desert sun.  

Back to the negative note...oh wait, the previous positive note, actually turned into negative note.  The one restaurant we ate at, Pyramid Cafe...mediocre.  $40 bucks for a breakfast, a burger and 2 sodas.  

Although kudos to the good old standard Mickey Dee's that fed me at 2 am and helped soak up some of that alcohol.  Also Swenson's ice cream treated me to one of my all time favorite ice cream treats, a scoop of Swiss Orange Chip (chocolate ice cream with orange accent and bits of chocolate chips).  Did I mention there are 3 Starbucks in here?  In case you change your mind after you pass the first 2?  I must say I don't get the whole Starbucks phenomenon.

Though I wasn't thrilled by the Luxor, I was happy it provided easy access to Mandalay Bay and New York New York (via Excalibur).  Krispy Cremes towards NY NY and Burger Bar towards Mandalay.  Mmmm...burgers and donuts.

I have been to Vegas 15 + times over the years. Always have a good time and this trip was no exception. First time at the Luxor and I have to say that while the hotel was ""nice"" overall, it was nothing special. 

We were in an accessible room on the second floor. Room was okay, but looking a bit worn. I have to say the room was sound proof! Even being close to the casino we heard nothing when the doors were closed! 

Check in was a breeze! Staff was overall helpful and friendly. Walkways between Luxor and Mandalay Bay and also between Luxor and Excalibur. This was nice for getting around. 

I guess when I try to put my finger on why the average rating, it comes down to there was just nothing special about the hotel. It wasn't one of the new nicer hotels. It wasn't a dive hotel where you couldn't expect much. It was just middle of the road. 

Restaurants were okay, but nothing to write home about. Casino seemed a little on the small side. Didn't use the pool or spa, so no opinion there. Lines on the weekend to get into the nightclub LAX suggest it is a hip spot to be, but we never stopped by.

Luxor is 20 years old and has not been treated kindly, so yes, there is wear and tear obvious in many spots, the room had an older hotel smell, and the ""inclinators"" are shaky and not aging well.

We filed a report of course as the valets were the ONLY ones who had the keys and we had not used the car during our stay.

I can't imagine what they paid for it, but really no price would be a good price for this place. I could write a book about what was wrong with it but I'm just going to limit myself to a few aspects that stood out: 

1) They gave me a room in the pyramid after the company paid for a room in another part of the hotel and told me it's the same price - definitely not and there is no window...or not a flat against the wall window. So the window is slanted against the ceiling in a weird angle at which there is no real view and the sun doesn't shine in. WOW. No. It' can you make feel CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

2) NO ROOM SERVICE AFTER 2PM??!?! And very limited places to eat in this hotel. WOW. If you like junk food (fried chicken, nathans) then go ahead...of course, it's a nice quick walk to the Mandalay bay but there's nothing around here. 

3) Just an old spot - which is fun for about 5 minutes if you want to reminisce about old school Vegas and then move on. They need to renovate A LOT.

4) No one helps with bags or luggage.

5) Rooms don't feel clean at all...shower is pretty gross and looks like it was built in 1962. 

6) One decent bar as the other that I went through closed at 10PM on a Saturday.

Overall, I am not too picky about my hotels when travelling for work because I'm in and out but this is the type of place that you don't want to be in at all. Our company booked over 20 rooms and everyone complained. (The sushi restaurant was the one shining spot...until a HUGE piece of dust fell in my food...check the other review). 

Never again. I'd rather book my own room somewhere else and pay the difference.

Priceline needs to change their rating as The Luxor IS NOT a 4 star. The room we got (in the pyramid) was: dingy, dank smelling, moldy bathrooms, dark, and you could literally see the beds were concave they were so worn out! We got moved to a newer room in an adjacent tower but had to  stand our ground as they wanted us to pay an extra $20 a night for the newer room. Yes, they actually wanted us to pay them more for a room that was nothing more than newer and thereby cleaner! Everything else about the room was basically the same: size, décor, beds, etc.
Complaint #2: their premiere club (LAX) was closed both nights we were there - no explanation as to why. There was ZERO buzz about any other things to do there, not a single live band playing anywhere, the casino atmosphere completely lacking in excitement (and dark - trust me, this hotel\/casino is all around dark!).
Apparently The Luxor is going through some changes to update themselves. The direction of their change is not apparent and there are long stretches of walks down dark empty hallways that are a bit eerie.
We hoped that the all day buffet for thirty dollars would be a bright point. Breakfast and lunch were good and had all your standard buffet foods - although nothing that made you say ""wow!"" Dinner was nothing more than all the same food from lunch, which had been sitting out for hours and hours and was dried out.
In conclusion: The Luxor was a severe disappointment. It is FAR FROM a 4 star hotel and I'm not exaggerating that the rooms in the pyramid are more like a 2 star Best Western. The casino is dark and overly subdued, consequently visitors seem to be trudging around like zombie mummies  or sitting at slot machines; like pale and frustrated vampires dying for a Bloody Mary from a rarely seen cocktail waitress- no excitement.

My husband and I stayed here for a few nights (his choice) for our wedding weekend. We also got married at the Luxor Chapel because I wanted an easy stress free wedding. We only had about 30 people with us, but we brought 30 people's business to them. The chapel was nice and professional. I felt no stress having it there. However, they were not accommodating, and tried to get more money for every little thing. I am giving 3 stars because this hotel was a cool hotel to stay at, and because our suite was pretty large. They also upgraded our suite at no additional charge. However, the room was not in good condition to me. I have OCD I am sure, but seriously, a hotel should be clean and pristine--period. The shower and fridge had issues and the furniture was not being well maintained. Basically, I prefer to stay at other hotel suites for the same cost. Luxor is lucky that we were just so happy we were newlyweds that we didn't bitch, because we are both bitchers. All the business we brought them, should have resulted in more bang for our buck. Also, I really dislike their dining situation! 
I wanted to be even lazier, and have the dinner at Luxor too, but it was such a mission, and they up charged everything. You have to go through an event planner instead of going direct to the restaurant, and getting same prices as everyone else. I felt like large parties were just not wanted, and they def. did a good job of steering us away. Luckily, Mandalay Bay is just a tram away. My husband did the dinner (reception) planning and it was a very simple process thanks to the restaurant he was able to go direct to. Crossroads House of Blues was so accommodating. They did seating chart, our name tags and created the menu of the meals we chose for our guests--at no additional cost! We even got a nice private room. All we paid for was dinner, tax and tip! We were wanted there. They were easy to deal with and very professional; consequently, I recommend all large parties to just go there. Oh and the food is diverse and yummy. 
Luxor doesn't have a good lounging experience either, so we stayed at Mandalay Bay, and went to eye candy. We both really enjoyed it there. We could sit and listen to good music, and we even danced; that is a home run for me!

That's about it though.

There's not much to do in the hotel outside gambling (granted, this is Vegas).  LAX is just meh, the atrium area is pretty boring, and there's only 1 inclinator that you can take from your floor to the lobby.  

Knowing my luck, I wasn't too surprised to find out that our room was from the furthest point from the inclinator on our floor (ie. in the opposite corner).

The hotel architecture and grounds are impressive (as are most LV hotels).  There is much attention to detail to make this beautiful to look at.

Check-in\/out was easy.  Guest services were helpful in providing entertainment ideas, including entertainment out of the Luxor.  They were courteous, and called back to find out how our evenings went.

Guest services provided VIP\/free tickets to the LAX nightclub, that is located in the building and on several of the nightime party bus tours, It advertised ""Throwback Thursdays,"" which we thought might mean music from The 80s. It definitely wasn't Throwback music, but was still fun!  Also received two free drinks with admission.

The rooms are dated; somewhat clean (there was an empty tube of toothpaste on the floor from a previous guest that was never picked up in four days).  Definitely aged and needs updated.  Electrical outlets all need replaced as most didn't keep prongs plugged in.  Elevators were fast, and it was quiet in the hallways. 

The main reason I gave the rating of 2\/5 was due to the service in the casino area.  I would have given a 1\/5, but had to bump it up due to outstanding guest services. 

The service in the casino was TERRIBLE.  We spend several hours on the slot machines.   Three different occasions we were there well over two hours, with NO service of drinks offered.  Others in my party went to the various bars to ask for service, and was told a waitstaff would be sent; however they still did not show up.  There were times waitresses would walk right by, and never stop.   When we asked for just pop to drink because we were not being served, they wanted to charge us $12 for three cups of pop.  We declined, especially since the drinks are supposed to be free when gambling. 

We also gambled at Mandalay Bay, Harrahs, Flaminto, Four Queens, NYNY, and ExCalibur casinos and NEVER had this problem.  In each of these casinos, within 20 minutes, we got drinks served.  We talked to other guests staying at The Luxor, and they suggested the tram or short walk over to Mandalay bay to do any gambling because the service in the casino was so much better.",0,0,0

Simple because we met some very nice people who worked at the hotel, but the management is horrible. When we checked in we were prepared the pay for the restore fee (which we didn't see or were aware of until I looked at the fine print of my printed hotel invoice). We asked the lady at the the check-in counter what if would never use any of the amenities listed in the restore fees and she replied in a matter-of-fact attitude that it was mandatory. I told her that the prices for the luxor online are deceiving, because the restore fees aren't listed in the total price. I barely got to speak before she started huffing and puffing and walked away. She then came back with the manager who was courteous, but again told us that there was nothing that he could do. In the end it was some 85 dollars (they put tax ON TOP of the resort fee). We were tired and went to our rooms which were clean and spacious. 

The first thing we did was try to connect to wifi and after some 5 minutes of confusing we called downstairs and found they have a hotline devoted to just helping confused customers to connect to internet. 

This next part is why I really want to rate Luxor a 1. There is no Wifi. Instead there is a mile long ethernet cord that comes out from the dresser that you have to use! 

Just reading the resort fee ""amenities"" sheet makes me so frustrated. They give you free local calls (greeaat...so why is it listed in the resort fees?) free use of their fax machine, internet and access to the pool. I just don't understand the Luxor's business tactic? Why not just elevate the price of the rooms, instead of tagging on these extras at the end? Why do they want to piss off customers by adding a mandatory fee of things that should be included? 

What made our Luxor experience were the kind workers (the lady who cleaned our rooms was like our mama and went out of her way to always excitedly greet us whenever she saw us in the halls). The team that works the Valet outside are also troopers and all so extremely kind, getting you your car always in around 5 minutes (even when it's packed).

The deluxe rooms in the East Towers that we booked were large, clean and comfortable.  There was plenty of dining options from the food court to the fine dining areas.  While I didn't partake in any of their entertainment options which include Carrot Top and the Bodies Exhibit, I did enjoy their casino floor, which I did well in!

it was nice to stay on the strip but since we were on one end of it, my feet were sore after walking anywhere. parking is somewhat difficult to find, it was always full for some reason. maybe because they don't make validation mandatory. so anyone can park there.

It's not even long enough to kick back on the bed where we all like to use our laptops, right? No coffee machines in the room make it so you have to trudge down to the Starbucks below and shell out the $10 for a couple coffees in the morning, grumble grumble. The tv sets are these crappy maybe 26"" numbers from the 90s. Don't these places know there has been a flat screen revolution? Why every room doesn't have a 36""- 40"" flat screen is beyond me. Why would I want to order any PPV channels to watch on a screen that's crappier than the TV I had in college and not half as good as the one I have at home?? Also, the Pacquio fight was on, but it couldn't even be ordered to the room? You're kidding me? In Vegas?
The saving grace is the casino is pretty nice and not overly smokey. The grounds outside by the pool are nice (though the pool area was shut down when we were there because maybe the weather was cooler? Weird, because the pools at Cesar's and other places were open), and the pyramid shape is always intriguing. The location on the Strip near the end makes for some nice views for some rooms.

It looked nice online and had a very reasonable price, but I had heard bad reviews from friends who have stayed there. The one bit of advice I was given was to make sure our room was in the tower versus the pyramid. 

The day before we arrived I called to make sure we were booked to stay in the tower. We were not, but the lady said it was only $20 per night to upgrade. That seemed reasonable to me so I went ahead and paid the upgrade fee.

Overall our stay at the Luxor was very pleasant. I would definitely stay here again. Our room was very nice and CLEAN!! Clean is the biggest issue for me so I was very happy. With our room we got two free drinks, special deals for Luxor shows, and free wired Internet access. The only downside was that the Luxor is not in the center of the strip. We didn't mind though.

Coffee!!! They did not have coffee available in our room. They said it was a fire hazard, and it made me wonder about if I should plug in my flat iron.

1 - There were no bell men at the airport drop off point. We had to schlep the luggage ourselves.
2 - To compound yhe above problem the registration desk was very far from the unattended drop off.
3 - Everything is widely separated. After recent major surgery I have to use a walker and the very plush carpet offers BIGLY rolling friction.
4 - Every easily accessible restaurant is very expensive. The food was uniformly good and inline with other fare in town. On our last day we found a remote corner on the Atrium level where a handful of fast food joints offered affordable fare. Nathan's, New York Pizza, Original Chicken Tenders, a sandwich place and another.
5 - Some of the fixtures, the towel hook and shower drain, in the bathroom were barely attached.

We went to The Blue Man Group and Chriss Angel shows. Both were excellent and worth the money. If you're in town make an effort to see them.

The hotel is adjacent to the Mandalay Bay hotel\/casino. It's a reminder every time you go outside. This is of course not the fault of Luxor, but if like my wife you are a very emotional person you should probably choose another place.

B - Who thought the herky-jerky inclinator was a good idea?  Also only one inclinator bay per floor?  My room was fifty-two miles away from the inclinator.

C - Loud.  the pyramid focuses every inner and outer noise through the cheapass doors and uncaulked exterior windows into you eardrums at 3:30am.  Bring your ear plugs.

D - Smokey in my room, in which I never smoked.  No hvac to speak of.

E - Since I was there for work...I needed internet access.  I was never able to get online even though I broke down and I was ready to pay the wired line connection (which mysteriously come from behind the TV) of $13 bucks a day.  The desk was no help and kept telling me I was spelling my own name wrong...What in hyroglyphics?!

This time I was charged extra money each night I was there for this ""resort fee."" When I asked what this was for, I was told it included newspapers downstairs, pool\/gym\/spa upkeep\/and internet. Well, the internet only worked if I actually HELD the cord in my computer and the speed was super slow. Not to mention the fact that it was an Ethernet cord -- why have we not moved into the 21st century and switched to WiFi? As far as the pool\/spa\/gym upkeep? The pool was closed because it was winter and well, the spa should be kept up via the spa prices. The gym is super small and has out of date equipment so aside from paying for a surly person to stay at the front desk and people to clean it while leering at you, what upkeep do you need to pay for? Also, $25\/night for a fridge seems a bit steep. Not to mention the lack of a coffee maker in the room. That's a new one to me.

When we first got there the internet didn't work at all and I had to wait almost an hour for someone to come and fix it. The only reason they ended up showing up was because I called down a second time and was greeted with, ""Are you sure you haven't left the room at all"" Yes thank you. I'm not a moron. I would remember leaving the room. After arguing with her that yes I was plugging in the internet the right way and yes my computer is on, she huffily said she'd send someone, ""again."" They showed up, and said ""Oh, I went to the wrong room!"" Of course you did. Even after they fixed it, it still barely worked and the only way I could use it was if I had the cord extend to the bed since the cord wouldn't even reach the table. This made it rather annoying when it was in use as the other person had to step over the cord in order to get to another part of the room.

The other thing that rubbed me the wrong way were the pushy people who greet you as soon as you walk in asking if you want to buy this entertainment package or that entertainment package. No, my companion and I are not married, we are a couple. No we cannot ""prove it"" and no, I definitely will NOT log on to my laptop and show you our bank statements online to prove we live together. 

The rooms themselves were also lackluster. For a desert and otherwise dry city, our room at the Luxor was EXTREMELY dank and kind of smelled. The only thing that fixed it was if we turned the AC on. Also, there was some red stain that looked like blood that was on the sheet. We didn't notice it until the second day and when I called about it was I was asked if I was sure it was there before (implying one of us somehow caused the stain). Umm...no. So we just switched beds since they ignored my request for a king size bed and gave us two doubles. At least their poor attention to detail paid off once. Oh happy day.

I didn't spend much time in the casino but each time we walked through to get to our car rental, I was astonished at how poor the air circulation was and how much everywhere reeked of smoke. I've spent large amounts of time in several of the casinos over the past few years -- PH, Bellagio, and Caesar's Palace to mention a few -- and they have all managed to not reek of smoke despite smoking being allowed. Why can the Luxor not manage to do this as well?

Suffice it to say, I'll never stay here again. The only saving grace of our stay was that it was near the highway which made it easy for us to get to other locations we were going to outside of Vegas.",2,1,0

The room was decent.  It didn't look run down like some of the other places I've stayed at.  It had a nice shower.  The only thing negative about this room was that the door knob was coming off; it was loose.  The house-keeping worker was awesome.  She was persistent to clean our room, but of course she was trying to work for a tip. lol

For those who don't know, you must have a room key to self-park.  So you must park in the 15 min parking to get your key upon first arrival at the hotel for check-in.  This would suck if the line is really long.  This makes it very inconvenient if you're rushing to go somewhere especially when you arrive late.  That's what happened to us!",6,1,0

After paying our resort fee we got a near worthless coupon booklet.  I don't mind paying a resort fee if you get something for it. All the pools were closed and drained for cleaning. The so called fitness area was closed as well. The Internet in the rooms is wired only. No WIFI. Makes it hard to hook up your IPad ect. so for the Resort fee you get nothing what so ever at this place. The room we got was old and beat down. We thought staying in the glass pyramid would give a great view. The outside of the windows were so dirty you were looking through a deep haze. We got this room free through My Vegas games and will never return. Free and paying a resort fee was way over paying. As for the casino it's ok.

I called front desk and talked to a rep named Alex to inform him that the reason we upgraded was for the spa. He said he could not do anything about it and the jets were non functional. I asked to speak to a manager and transferred me to a guy named Peter. Peter challenged me on every aspect of my call with a very rude tone telling me he could not do anything for me and I had to call Vegas.com. After 45 minutes of him arguing with me he told me a different story about the jets not functioning than house keeping so to me this was not very clear and felt cheated and lied to.

To top it off the room was not clean. There were sunflower seeds scattered all over carpet. The curtains by the spa tub were splashed with wine, ketchup, or blood. I didn't know what it was but was disgusting to look at. The tub was full of hair and some sandy substance and we felt highly disappointed to think this was considered a 4 star hotel. 

The reason we were there is to check out the chapel to have our wedding there and invite all of our friends and family to stay at the Luxor but we decided that with our bad experience with Peter and cleanliness of the room that we would not be coming back ever to this hotel or any affiliated hotel. I mentioned this to Peter that he just lost a huge amount of business for the hotel and he didn't care less of anything I was saying and continued to be as rude as he could be.

We finally get to the front and there was a problem with their credit card machine understandable but this lady didn't say anything not a thanks for waiting or a heads up about what was taking long.I already got the vibe that this hotel was going to suck balls. Luckily we weren't in the actually pyramid which I don't even know how people stay in those rooms with the casino RIGHT below them.
We got to our room and our bathroom smelled like the maid had double deckered our toliet ( this is when someone shits in the tank and leaves it there so it permantely smells like shit) we even checked to see if one was in there. It was horrible but knowing how shitty there service was we didn't even bother to call to change rooms. Next thing we notice our beds have blood spots on them not just one a HANDFUL visibly on top. I mean at least try to hide that shit. We called for them to change the sheets and they did thanksfully..(costing us 5 for the tip)
We had a friend staying with us so we called down for a roll away but once again we had to be inconvienced. They said we had to come down to give our credit card info.. what is this 1998? So our friend had to wait in the long ass line just to ask for a rollaway. The rollaway came 3 hours later. They said we wouldn't be charge, wow finally a break from the shittiness.When we were done with it the next day we called to get it picked up and NO ONE came. We decided to leave it in the hallway but then this ended up costing us a 100 dollars (not so free afterall). Thankfully they removed the charge or I would have gone ape shit.The last thing that really was a pain in the ass about this hotel is the parking. It was an absolute joke it was as if they built it last minute thinking "" O wait we have to have somewhere for our guests to park"", It is small, most of the time we were crossing our fingers for a spot. Also it is a journey to the casino and when it is hot as hell out that really pisses you off.They basically don't care here and have no hospitality for their guests. I get it your rooms are cheap but I mean if you want return customers you have to do your job and be nice to us. This hotel also had a weird vibe in it I really wouldn't doubt it being curse.

This was quite possibly the worst Vegas hotel experience that I have had in all my adult years.  Let's see. Where do I begin?  For starters, the first room that I was checked into, it's AC wasn't working and it was a blazing 100+ degrees.  And as you know, these rooms can get hot!  So, that was a big problem. Next, still in this first room, it was near the ice maker and by the time that I'd left the room to get ice, someone had thrown up in the basin just below the dispenser. Gee, that's one reason it stunk so much near my room.  The other thing, it smelled of burnt rubber but I had no idea why.   I called to notify the front desk.  There wasn't much that they were able to do about it except to not charge me the resort fee for the night.  I was so tired from the day's trip that I just KTFO and had to deal with it in the morning. In the morning, that is when I was moved to the 2nd room.  In the 2nd room, it reeked of stale mary jane. Not only that but the outlets didn't all work and the prongs didn't always stay in the sockets. Oh dear. A girlfriend came to join me in Vegas on the 2nd night.  She got sick immediately when she walked into the room.  I had tried to air out the room by blasting the AC but that didn't work.  So, I asked for a different room.  The 3rd room was much better than the first two but it was really becoming a hassle to have to change rooms all the time. I discussed all this with the front desk. They comped me breakfast the following morning and adjusted my bill, but it still didn't make up for the horrible experience. The last room that we were in was decent.  The outlets worked. The AC worked. It didn't smell of stale mary jane. It did smell mildly like marlborough lights but that was a very faint odor.  At least it wasn't making me or my girlfriend sick. We stayed there and still had more problems.  We asked for house keeping to come and change our linens, replace towels and to remove the trash.  They didn't do that. So, I had to call and ask for towels, new linens and trash bags.  I'm sorry but WTF kinda service is that? I should have tipped myself for that.

Also you can't use all the elevators they won't go to your floor but they will tell you this all later. The wallpaper needs some upgrades for sure !

We were booked for two days. They overbooked and we had no choice but to stay in a room on the first floor. That was pretty accessible to go in and out of and not take any elevators. The room was very clean. The only downfall was that tons of kids running up and down the halls rapping something that was loud. I called security. We went to sleep with this rapping and woke up in the morning with the rapping kids again. When we came back in the evening, housekeeping did not clean our room. I called the front desk for housekeeping and they said they were gone for the night. The front desk said to come and they will give us an upgrade, free for the inconvenience. We had a comp room anyhow from M Life. We get to the front desk, they said they are overbooked and have no more rooms. We told the manager we were gonna check out because it was crazy to promise something and then re-nig on it. The room was not made and the noise of he rapping kids was insane. So we got ready to check out. We talk to Nate the mgr. on duty. He apologized sincerely that they overbooked and did not clean the rooms. He said there was man at the other side of the counter and he booked a room and they couldn't give him one because there wasn't any. Now mind you, this is about 1am. I told Nate we were leaving and show tickets etc... could not keep us there. I told Nate to call housekeeping and give the gentleman my room so he won't be homeless for the night. Nate said that housekeeping was not there. I said are you kidding me, 24 hour hotel with no housekeeping. I said, give me the sheets and towels and I will change the linen myself. I said, you have to give him my room, because you have a room to rent now. You can't say you don't have any rooms. I was talking loud enough so I hope the gentlemen overheard. We left and went to Caesars, no problem. Our whole envision was to stay in the pyramid which didn't happen and probably will never happen. We will stay from now on at Caesar's or Harrah's property.

The rooms were very clean and the housekeeping staff was very sweet and friendly. It would have been nice to have been provided with additional towels from the get-go. We reserved the room for 4 people but were only given 3 towels every time our room was cleaned. But the housekeeping staff was always around and would give us as many towels as we needed. So no big deal. 

The casino wasn't as lively as others on the strip, but that was a good thing when you come home and you're ready to get to sleep.

Proximity to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay was awesome. Lots of food and entertainment options. I read that many guests were hassled to buy tickets to Criss Angel, but we never encountered that. 

The pool was huge and gorgeous and although it was crowded, we were always able to find lounge chairs. I did slip and bust my butt on the wet concrete, it's slick! Be careful. Bartenders at the pool were friendly and would give cups of ice water for free. 

The only negative was the woman who checked us in. When we asked about any free upgrades available or any additional discounts or services, she replied with a short ""no"" each time. (The couple next to us got their early check-in fee waived when they asked...) She was not very welcoming or friendly, I don't think she smiled once.

I was probably 9 or 10 the last time I was at the Luxor, and by the looks of things, NOTHING has changed since then. By that I mean everything looks incredibly run down, dirty, worn, and just plain disgusting. 

The call buttons for the elevators are loose and the whole thing looks like it's been beaten with a bat. The wait for the elevator takes about a year because from what I could see, only two of them actually work. The ride itself is shaky and feels borderline dangerous. 

It took me about 5 minutes to get into the room because the reader on the door wouldn't read the card (same thing happened in the elevator, which needs your key to operate). I finally got in and WOW, the room was SO disappointing!!! Everything was so old and noticeably worn; colors on the closet door was fading, surface of the bathroom door was chipping, and the walls were damaged and dirty. Worst of all - the pillowcases were stained. *shudder* Luckily I always bring my own pillow on vacation.

The next morning, we were woken up because the toilet had somehow malfunctioned and wouldn't stop making noises. Geez, can it get any worse? YES. YES IT CAN. 
I went to turn on the light next to my table and it wouldn't turn on. Why? Because the lightbulb was broken in half. Ugh, how does that even happen? Then while one of my girl friends was using the hairdryer, it blows up on her! fl;kjasdfjsdfjlkas ... we were frustrated beyond words.

After we complained, the manager moved us from the pyramid to a tower room instead, promising us that it would be nicer. To our relief, the tower was much newer and looked neat and clean. But just as I was about to change my opinion of the hotel, I spot not one, not two, but THREE MOTHS around the room! DISGUSTING!!! 

Needless to say, I spent most of the trip outside the hotel. I cannot believe the level of neglect this place has suffered. I would not recommend this place to ANYONE. I'm sure you could find a local motel better than this dump. STAY AWAY!",7,6,3

The available entertainment is alright, but you're attached to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur, so you're able to roam other casinos (including NewYork NewYork, Mante Carlo, and MGM within walking distance). But the Egyptian theme is out now and the theme of the hotel is kinda lost. The atmosphere is seems somewhat boring compared to a bumping MGM, Planet Hollywood, or Ceasar's.

They just booked a hotel, didn't try to learn from the information provided by other reviewers, didn't read the fine print or ask about ""any additional fees,"" and didn't call the hotel and ask ""what will be my total due at check-out with all applicable taxes and fees?""  I imagine that most of the dissatisfied reviewers simply did not do their due diligence & research before choosing a hotel.

That said, I'm a planner...in addition to being cheap.  And Luxor had one of the best rates on the strip.  And I wanted to experience the architecture by staying in the pyramid.  Now granted, we were at the south end of the strip, but between Luxor, Mandalay Bay, Excalibur, New York-New York and the MGM Grand, my friends had and I had one hell of a time in Vegas.  

THE RATE:  The best rate you will ever get for an MGM property, including Luxor, will not come from Travelocity, Kayak, Vegas.com or even Luxor's own website.  No.  If you're interested in staying at an MGM property, from the most affordable Excalibur to the high-end Aria, you want to start by becoming an ""M-Life"" member.  This is MGM's loyalty, comps & rewards program, and it is FREE to join.  I originally booked directly through Luxor's website and got a rate of $40\/night with a $30 food & beverage credit.  I READ THE REVIEWS HERE about the extra $18-20 daily resort fee and anticipated that my total for the stay was going to be about $200 for my THREE night stay which I was okay with.  Then I figured, since I'm going to stay at an MGM property, I should look into their Mlife program.  After joining, I saw that you could book a room directly through the program and found a rate for Luxor for $29 per night!!!  Since MGM properties let you cancel with no fees or penalties, and as long as you are not within 48 hours of arrival, I canceled my old reservation and booked through Mlife.  My new total for the trip, after all taxes & fees, was now $160!!!  Now...there was no food & beverage credit with the new rate (but keep reading below about the coupon book), and you might think it would be a wash since the $11 per night that I'm saving would work out to $33 total.  But keep in mind that now I would saving a bit more money because now I'm only paying taxes on $29 per night as oppose to $40 - and those savings come out to about the cost of a drink at the hotel bar.

CHECK IN:  Being the planner that I am and having read the reviews, I saw that everyone was talking about how hot their hotel room was because it's 105-110 degrees outside.....

My king suite smelled like a very dirty old ashtray.  It was on the 25 top floor and the pyramid made for rising smoke to be sucked into the rooms and stagnant for 20 years.  Bath room had old fluorescent light fixture that was broken and this the shower stall was very dark.  It was clean however.  Soaker tub in the bedroom was interesting but treacherous to use, wet tiles under a sloped window, but the view was amazing.

The BLEH & MEH:

When my friend booked our rooms, the description said there would be two queen beds and a pullaway bed on the couch. LIES :( There were two full size beds and the couch definitely did not pull out... Also, the website and front desk made it seem as if the Tower suites only have king size beds. We found out later that there are indeed queen size beds in the Tower suites.. sigh..

The casino was just meh to me. The dealers on the tables we played weren't very enthusiastic or anything. Thankfully, the Luxor is connected to Mandalay Bay, either through the tram or the Shoppes at Mandalay. I definitely preferred the casino and dealers over there.

Location-wise, it's located kind of far from the main strip where all of the popular clubs are. But we managed with taxis  and limos. 

OMG THE ELEVATORS ARE CRAY IF YOU STAY IN THE PYRAMID. THEY MOVE SLANTED UP AND DOWN! Be prepared for motion sickness by elevator motion. Definitely not good when you have a good buzz going on... merrrr

The YAY & OH HAY:

24 Hour McDonalds IN the hotel?! CHECK! We definitely made several trips here at ungodly hours when we stayed here.

Convenient tram to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur.

Free self-parking and valet! Which is standard for most hotels I believe? But you just tip the valets so holllller. 

Cheap. Can't complain about the price honestly. 

That's it. Bye bye Luxor. We may or may not meet again. Probably the latter. :X",3,4,3

It truly is an example of...you get what you pay for.  Sure there are more upscale, pricier hotels that are probably ""better.""  But that is like comparing apples to oranges, it is not really fair.

Overall, I would say the place (the main entrance, casino, etc). looks a lot better than I expected.  They have definitely put in some work to modernize it.  The check in area, the casino area, all look pretty great.  You wouldn't think you were at the luxor if you were in it.  Also, I honestly enjoy the feeling of being inside a pyramid. I'm not sure if that's just me though...

The luxor is conveniently on the strip, next to some other great MGM hotels, and can conveniently walk to the other hotels through indoor walkways, so when it is hot you don't even have to step outside!  They have a decent selection of restaurants and bars as well, though this review is not on the restaurants themselves.

I guess the place where there needs the most work is the rooms.  It is a good room, but like I said you get what you pay for.  The rooms are all functional, fairly clean. They are just not as modern as I am sure some hope they would be.  I feel like the pictures posted here represent the rooms fairly.  In my opinion though, you should only take into consideration on how much time you spend in the room.  Me personally, I do not spend that much time, so the décor does bother me.  It is a functioning room ahaha.

Overall, a great budget friendly on the strip place to stay!  Don't be so quick to judge.",2,0,0

The rooms are clean and relatively roomy, though modestly furnished. It's sort of cool to have a room in the pyramid with the tinted glass wall, but be sure to request a room in the pyramid or you may get a room in a tower. Staff tends to be hit or miss here too.

1. Check-in- Giant cluster Fu$# 2-4 hrs ( no joke ). 
2. This hotel smells awful, in an effort to combat it they spray a really nasty cologne smell in     the foyers as you walk in, its so strong you can actually taste it. Sort of like a decaying Avon lady its that bad. 
3. Bell hop-  They don't let guests use a valet cart so you have to have a hotel bell boy get your luggage,  the parking lot is in another zip code so don't even try it.  45 -2hrs to get them to get your things. 
4. Rooms are awful, outdated, smelly, cheap, lacking basic amenities, no fridge, etc.  The Days in we stayed in on our way back was far better than this dive. No cable TV you have to pay extra for everything unless you enjoy watching Carrot Top and his retarded video over and over on the TV.
5.  Throngs of people this hotel is extremely unorganized and poorly run, it also seems to attract a very unpleasant sort of guest.
6.  The elevators are insane sometimes 20+ min to get one to take you down and it will certainly be full once it gets to you. We spent 5 days in this $hitole and prolly 4 hrs just waiting on the elevators. 
7. For the love of god don't eat at the buffet whatever you do, you will spend an hour on the toilet expelling whatever stale, bacteria infested food you just consumed out. 
8.  The food court is awesome if you enjoy mall food, no kidding they actually have a mall food court, replete with a McDonalds etc. so you can go to Vegas to eat at the mall foodcourt!

Maids did not replace shampoo, soap or tissues as needed.

Extras were an iron, ironing board and hair dryer.  That is it.

Room AC\/heating system had two settings, too hot and too cold.

Cheapest lighting I have ever seen.   If they only want 25 watt bulbs they could at least go with compact fluros so you can see.

They LIE about room charges.  If a particular charged is REQUIRED then it needs to be added to the price listed for the room,  not tacked on after you check in.  YOU  had better figure on an additional $10 per night regardless of the rate you get quoted.

No bathtub in my room.  But on the flip side the shower drain was partially plugged so did get a three inch bath for the feet.

Antique pre-HIDEF television sets with unreliable cable.  Nothing like watching MONK and having the TV cut out just as he starts explaining the crime.

No WIFI.  You actually have to connect with a cable.  Ever try to do that with an IPAD?  My wife had her laptop so was happy but I had to use my own WIFI for my IPAD.  Hotels in Winnemucca  are more cutting edge. 

Crappy toilets.  (Pun intended.)  The bowl is so shallow you have to flush two or more times to get the toilet paper to go down.
 
They do not have a pool.  They got a three foot deep wading pool fit for four year olds.  If you like to swim, go somewhere else.

My wife and I played $1000 on the dollar video poker and only got ONE  four of a kind.  That means the money went fast and we only gambled two nights out of seven.  The comps suck on top of the bad pay offs.

Pros:
-Price (I liked them on Facebook and within 30 minutes I got a 20% off coupon which covered the resort fees and early check in costs) so it ended up being cheaper to book through their website than Kayak\/Booking\/etc. 
-I requested a higher up room and got one on the 27th floor overlooking the pool area. It was quiet and clean. You have to log into the wifi via web browser and it is included in your room. It even reached out to the pool deck!
-Super nice dealers. This was my first time in a casino. I was told to buy a $2 Black Jack strategy card (available in the gift shops). I went from losing $60 the first time to not only winning it back, but tripling it. 
-Pool. Get there early! Frozen beverages served on deck and if you buy a souvenir cup you can fill it up cheap at any MGM frozen drink bar (they are everywhere!
-Express check out: all on iPads! Emailed my receipt and I was checked out in 5 minutes versus the longer line. 
-Cute Egyptian theme. Lots of sphinxes and pharaohs adorn the hotel, so plenty of awesome photo ops! Everything down to the headboards in the rooms have hieroglyphics on them. 
-Bodies exhibit. Discount coupon in check in booklet. Do it. 
-3 Starbucks on site. 

Cons:
-Shower had low water pressure
-I actually read a review on Yelp before saying to bring my own toilet paper...and I'm glad I did! One ply tissue paper is more like it. Not a deal breaker but just a heads up

We were starving while touristing the strip and decided ""well, one buffet is a good as the next, right?""  We found out not true.  Our experience of this lunch buffet was NOT GOOD.   

First off there were a lot of empty bins which seemed to indicate that they didn't stock the buffet entirely.  And at noon they still had breakfast stuff out, even though that part of the buffet menu clearly read Mexican food.  As the guy was switching out the food I had to wait for him to realize I wasn't partaking of the food because there were no serving tongs out and he didn't seem to understand my English or my pantomimes for ""serving spoon.""  Once I finally got my ""carnitas"" with tortillas and toppings I found it completely bland, no seasonings or spices in anything. In fact I found most items to be tasteless or mediocre at best.  The only great thing was the wild mushroom bisque - so I had 3 bowls.  But still not worth the $20 we spent.

The Luxor is on the south end of the strip, but as long as you don't mind walking everything is pretty accessible; one day we walked up to the Trump hotel and back, and we made a lot of other smaller trips out.  But keep in mind that I wouldn't even consider attempting this during the summer.

We made full use of the gym (small, but never very crowded) and the pool area.  The Luxor restaurants we tried (T&T and the Pyramid) were slightly below average, but served their purpose just fine.   The casino had plenty of $10 tables, and the employees were all extremely friendly and helpful.

We stayed in the tower, tut took the elevators in the pyramid for a ride anyway because they are said to travel at an angle.  It actually goes vertical a few feet, then horizontal a few feet, and it's super slow!  It gave me a glimpse at the pyramid experience; which had a funky smell, was dingy and the hallways cried for a makeover.  The tower is MUCH nicer looking than the halls I spied in the pyramid.  

Cons:
-The shower head is positioned very low.  Anyone over 5'5"" might have to duck to wash their hair.
-The shower seemed to always clog if a shower went longer than 10 minutes...nasty, I don't even want to know what's causing that.
-There was no vent in our bathroom...it becomes a steam room when someone showers or like a natural disaster hit after a trip to the casino buffets. 
-The ""free"" Internet is cable only...what century are we in?
-Room service was ridiculously slow...it is a big hotel with slow elevators so I suppose I should cut some slack.
-No good shows or nightlife at this place...seek elsewhere!  Carrot Top, really?  That's your headliner?  And the LAX nightclub was a meat market...seriously nothing but dudes, not that I'm shopping...just struck me as odd.

To end on a good note, Pros:
-Classic theme that's not cheesy or dated (*cough-cough*Excalibur*excuse me*)
-Gym with lots of equipment.  I was surprised how many people use the gym at any given time of day.
-Decent variety of dining options from quick and causal to the fancy schmancy steaks and stilettos atmosphere.  Plus, Starbucks (two of 'em).  And they definitely got my attention with a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, Blizz, right outside the West tower elevators.
-Very affordable.  Compared to other hotels on the strip, this was on the lower end.

The bad news: 

The rooms are badly in need of a remodel. The air conditioning simply DOES NOT work regardless of being on the coldest setting & fan on high.

No wireless internet. ""Go downstairs to Starbucks"" Really??

The room service menus in the rooms are outdated. Housekeeping made two attempts to get us the right menu, but were obviously unaware of the change. Once we got the right menu, the food was good and was served hot.

We tried to review our bill in response to an email from the hotel, and received a message ""no data available"" I then clicked on express check out hoping I'd get an approval page, and received a ""you are checked out"" message without ever seeing the bill.

Every day our phone flashed a red light indicating a voice mail. The ""message"" was from the Luxor hustling us to go to the spa or some show or restaurant. I stopped listening after the first one. Please don't try to upsell once we're already guest. Tacky.

Overall, the Luxor could be a nice Vegas destination. While I have little experience in lodging & hospitality industry my 25+ years of business experience tells me that a change in management should be considered.

We were situated in the west tower, and on the 15th floor. Got a lovely view of the back parking lot and not much else. Fantastic.

Past that, we ended up in a room that had a shower that overflowed. Almost every time we took a shower, it ended up overflowing.

Additionally, it was noisy as hell! I mean the entire floor! You'd think that all the bad guests get sent to the 15th floor with how much racket there was. It sounded like pipes banging and people thumping around. Not very restful.

My biggest gripe though is the fact that room service has absolutely ridiculous hours! Most nice hotels I've been to offer room service 24\/7, but at the Luxor, you can only get it from about 6am to 2pm. Who the hell does that??? ""Lux"" my ass. I want chicken strips at 4AM.

To be perfectly honest, this isn't a very exciting hotel of all the choices in Vegas. We were looking for a less expensive place to stay, hang out, gamble, so we could spend bigger dollars on dining and entertainment elsewhere. 
The rooms were decent (Tower Rooms) We loved the oversized shower, but the adjacent spa tub was a little on the small side. The bed was awful!!!! We were on vacation, looking forward to getting plenty of rest and relaxation. Instead we had sore bodies and restless nights. I do not recommend staying here until Luxor upgrades the matresses to pillowtops to say the least. Also, the pillows were flatter than any I've ever slept on! Using two seemed to just make it worse. 
The pool was nice, never really crowded. Actually I think we got more sleep outside at the pool, than in our room. 

The walkway through Mandalay Place to Mandalay Bay was a real treat considering we spent more time at M.B. than we did at Luxor. Now thats a resort.

The reviews looked decent, and we figured we wouldn't spend much time in the room anyway. Long story short, in the course of the two nights we stayed at the Luxor, we saw AT LEAST 15 cockroaches. COCKROACHES. Something I have never encountered at a hotel in my entire life. There were dead ones, live ones, and I even found one in my bag. Aside from this, the hotel itself is pretty run down, and you can spot trash lining the tops of the artificial buildings through out the hotel. I can almost guarantee that is what attracts many of the cockroaches. Ultimately, we did not stay the last night and were refunded the full amount of our stay. When we told the front desk, it was as if they were used to hearing people complain about cockroaches in the room.

Their giant arcade is now the bodies exhibit. Now the entire bottom is gutted and with bars and casinos only. 

The rooms are whatever. The most important thing to me in a room is the bed. However, I crashed into mine about 5am and in the shower before 9am so i didn't really care. I should ding them more because my friend requested a king and he got 2 queens and another friend reserved 2 rooms and only got one because they couldn't find the deposit for one room even though they were both booked at the same time with the same card.

what I really didn't like was the stupid key card access to the rooms. Man those sensors suck and I had to swipe like a million times.

On the plus, its in a pretty active area of the strip. Its conveniently connected to Mandalay Bay and close to a lot other nice hotels\/casinos. 

The rooms were pretty up-to-date. However, two downsides to the room: 
(1) The air conditioning was pretty blah. Granted, it was 110 outside so maybe that had something to do with it. The problem is that the room never got as cool as I'd like. 
 
(2) The other problem was that anytime you flushed the toilet the room would smell like fart for a few moments. Obviously there was a sewage problem. My philosophy on that is if my room must smell like fart, I'd like to be doing the farting and not the sewage pipes. Its just common courtesy.

Our friends had picked the Mandalay Bay and we picked the Luxor since it was about half the price and connected to the Mandalay Bay via a shopping arcade. I suppose you get what you pay for.

First the mandatory resort fee: $18\/day for wired internet access (who still travels with wired devices???) that we couldn't use, use of the fitness center (ok, we could have used that) and use of the pool (which was under renovation and given that it was February not useful anyway). That FCC ruling can't come early enough to abolish those practices...

Anyway we checked in a bit after midnight and had to wait about 20 minutes in line. Really? Then we got a handicapped room next to the nightclub on the 2nd floor. Good thing we were so wiped from the flight that we slept anyway. The next morning I was about ready to check out and find another place.

Luckily when we checked back with the front desk we found a really nice associate who put us into a proper room on the 23rd floor. What a difference location makes! The room was the same tired décor (peeling, dirty wallpaper, chairs with almost torn fabric that I wouldn't want to sit on) but having a proper shower and quiet location made all the difference.

So while in the end our stay was OK we'll probably book something else if we ever go back to Vegas on vacation (which is doubtful in itself).",5,2,1

We barely made it through the front doors before being bombarded with a friendly woman in a uniform welcoming us and asking us if we were celebrating anything special.  We said yes, we were celebrating our honeymoon.  She proceeded to ask us if we would like free show tickets, and we make the mistake of saying yes!  It was 8pm, we were a little blinded by the lights of the strip, and maybe still a bit in a surreal state of ""oh, hey, we're married now!""  We picked out which show we'd like to see, and then, of course the old bait and switch...oh great, now you'll just have to sit through a time-share presentation.  We, for whatever reason, paid the $50 deposit, and decided to do it.  Luckily, by the next morning we'd come to our senses and decided we didn't want to waste Vegas time by listening to a dumb presentation, and those people (who, by the way, are NOT actually affiliated with Luxor) were easygoing and gave us our deposit back.

When we went to check in, it was confirmed that we'd reserved a Pyramid Deluxe room.  The concierge asked us if a smoking room was ok.  Neither of us smoke nor do we like the smell of it, so we weren't about to give ourselves migraines by smelling it all weekend.  He then offered us an upgrade to a Tower Deluxe room, but when we were hesitant to accept, he asked us if we wanted to stay in the Pyramid.  when we said we did, he offered us a free upgrade to a Pyramid Suite, complete with a card-table area and a soaking tub!

I enjoyed the hotel.  It's not brand new, it's not world class, but it is clean and comfortable (and we really did enjoy the soaking tub!)  Even though our suite was right next to the elevator, we never heard it.  Two beefs I had with the room: the air conditioner leaked, leaving a wet spot on the floor and the toilet was weirdly oblong...so if you stay here, make sure you throw your toilet paper toward the back, otherwise it will get stuck in the front...annoying!!

The pool was nice enough.  I was sad that it rained most of our honeymoon (we're from Oregon...we get plenty of that stuff) and irritated that the pool closed when there were just sprinkles.  'Cause we wouldn't want guests getting wet when they were swimming, right?  That said, I do think I would have enjoyed it more if it were warmer out.

I really loved the layout of the whole hotel.  It was easier to navigate than most Vegas hotel\/casinos.  The rooms line the outer walls, and the inner area is called the Atrium, with the casino, multiple restaurants, a fast food food court, and auditoriums for the shows.  Plus shops, and the Titanic and Bodies exhibits.  Plenty to do!  Husband and I remarked that we probably could have made an entire vacation just out of the Luxor and the adjoining Mandalay Bay and The Excalibur.

I would go back!  It was comfortable, had a cool theme, and relatively affordable!",2,0,1

I wish i hadn't stayed here and wasted my money. 

We originally booked the pyramid standard non smoking room but when we walked in it smelled like a dirty hole in the wall bar!

Also the bed comforter had holes in it and the carpets were filthy!! This room looked so nasty and old totally UNACCEPTABLE! So I called down to the front desk to complain after being transferred a million times I got a rude women who hated her job obviously and said there were no more pyramid standard rooms available. If we wanted to switch rooms we would have to upgrade to a tower suite for an additional $50 dollars no comp upgrade! 

I said alright whatever I will pay it as is worth it to get out of this nasty diseased looking and smelling room! So we go to the check in desk all the way on the other side in their tower and the front desk lady is a complete b**** OMG! 

Wow just completely rude and miserable i guess she was pms'ing that day or something. So we finally get checked into the ""Tower Suite"" SUITE REALLY? YUCKO It was just an over sized dump! Nice sized living room I'll give them that bedroom was very small and the ""spa tub"" was the size of a regular tub just with jets in it! This room was just as dumpy as the first just bigger. 

Overall I was so disappointed with the room and even more disappointed with the service or lack of good customer service! The only thing good about this hotel is there shows Carrot Top is a riot and i heard Fantasy is amazing.

On my rescent trip there I ended up at the last minute needing a room in vegas for work, so I figured Id go here since it had been about a year and when I was last there they were in the middle of a re-model so I figured id give it a shot - and I was able to find rooms pretty cheap for a weekend stay.

Most of the remodel was done the lounges in the main pyramid were finished and looking nice but they were still lacking in what other casino lounges offer - seating was crowded and service was bad, even on Thursday night when it was slow - prices for drinks were pretty high for a casino that is on the south end of the strip 

Your key cards that gets you into your room is also used to get the elevator moving - basically so noone can just go up the sideways moving elevator - heres the catch ...the key cards dont always work well, one time it took so long to get the card to respond in the elevator the lights inside turned off ....once it finally responded to my random button pushing the lights turned on ...but definatly a pain when your hands are full and you have to dig out your room card 

Here is another fun one -since the key cards didnt work well in the elevator....they didnt work well when trying to get into my room either I think I stood there for at least 5 mintues one night trying to get in ...and it wasnt cause I had been drinking over priced drinks in the bar 

My basic room was ok - a very typical cheap hotel room in Vegas..my TV was small and had no remote controll - so I had to get up to change the channel every time I wanted to watch something else - which was a real pain. I brought my lap top with me to be able to do some work with my down time in my room but the internet access was absolute crap the wireless couldnt link up at all and it was a big waste of time. So why is there an additional $12 resort fee a day with this place if you cant use the dam internet at least, and not everyone is going to spend their day at the pool. Oh the 12 bucks does include 2 bottles of very cheap and small bottles of water in your room everyday.

No bathtub in my room just a shower no big deal for me but others may want to relax a bit more than just standing there. 

The sports book is lacking to say the least-it still looks the same from when it first opened, its almost like the Luxor is a bit 50-50 with its remodel and the way the rest of the casino is looking. 

The buffett there which I alwasy thought was one of the best in Vegas is dam near 30 bucks a person ! What ever happened to the cheap buffett's in Vegas?

About the only good thing is the Luxor has quick access to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur, but I wonder if the Luxor is like this - how bad is Excalibur and Mandalay ?",1,1,1

Gross. Nothing is clean here. Even after the maid comes, the entire room still feels dingy. Maybe because this resort is a million years old... maybe because of the bad low lighting. But between the sketchy bathrooms, paper thin walls and broke kids that pay their $39\/night and smash 15 people into their rooms while getting s-faced on their brought-from-home liquor (you know, because they're too cheap to afford the drinks in Vegas) - the Luxor is a nightmare.

Expanding on that point, there seems to be 2 types of people that come to the Luxor: 18-21 year olds and the Elderly. Which always makes for such a fun experience particularly when you're here on business. Honestly though, if you need an affordable place to stay on strip, try TI.

Nevada has a dumb law about not having to actually reserve a room for a reservation, so you usually won't get what you booked on the first night, but if you get on the waiting list you will the second night, remember that. 

There were just the two of us and they put us in a room with two full size beds. We wanted a king and the second day they moved us to the Pyramid where the room, compared to the previous one, was much nicer themed. The only drawback to the Pyramid room was no bathtub, but what we really wanted was the king size bed so it was worth it.

Unlike some other folks, we found both our rooms very clean and well kept. Room service came every day and fixed our beds, brought new towels (if we wanted them), cleaned the bathroom and gave us new mini shampoo and soap.

I agree with Lauren R. about having Carrot Top pictures everywhere. That was some serious buzzkill. I also agree with her about the stupid blinking light on the telephone, it was just a lot of SPAM voicemails really. 

I really liked the Pyramid on a whole compared to other hotel-casinos. It ranked about 3rd compared to Paris which was my favorite to see.

If you are looking for a nice but competitively priced hotel to stay at, look into Luxor as that option. One drawback is that it's at the end of the strip, but we always walked down the strip in the morning and took a cab back at night. If you are less into taking cabs then staying at a hotel in the middle of the strip might be a better option for you.

Not impressived by furniture with holes in the fabric and other worn out furniture - regardless of the price.  The elevators and public areas were also noticeably in need of repair and update.  I saw some work being done in the lobby - perhaps the rooms should become a priority.

I don't understand why the Luxor really has very little in the way of restaraunts and bars.  You have to go to one of the adjoining hotels for those amenities.

The timeshare people are very disruptive and annoying - but given the number of complaints, the management really must not care about that.

This place isn't going to be Caesar Palace or the Venetian, because you're not paying for Caesar's Palace or the Venetian. But if you're like me, you want a clean room to sleep and shower in, and not much else. Why? Because I'm in Vegas to drink, eat, shop, and gamble; not to sit in my room and admire the furniture.

And that's what you get. Our room was just fine and bathroom was really nice. After being exhausted from walking up and down the Strip I bought episom salt and took a nice bath, the tub was super.

We stayed in the tower because, if I heard right, the pyramid itself is smoking. Some reviews have complained about the walk to the towers but it really wasn't that bad. As fun as Vegas is, I'd prefer to have some distance from the casino anyway.

Lines for check in can be long, even late at night when we arrived. But I have to give serious credit to the Luxor because we were a day late on our reservation due to a freak snow storm in Seattle. Even though we booked the hotel online there was no trouble refunding the night we didn't stay here. We did call as soon as our flight was canceled, and it worked in our favor.

I am here for a conference and the food is wonderful!  The workers were also great and attentive. The only thing I am disappointed in is the condition of the rooms, but hey what do I expect from a hotel that's one of the first hotels on the very end of the strip way back when.?

Hubby and I recently stayed here for a few days, as we got a phenomenal nightly rate (I think on Groupon). I didn't expect much, but was pleasantly surprised as our experience here was pretty darn good!

Check in was smooth and didn't take too long. The line was super long but it moved briskly and there were many check-in counters open. The lady who checked us in offered us an upgrade to a room in the east tower at no additional cost; we'd miss out on the ""pyramidal"" room experience, but we'd gain a larger room and bathroom. So we took it. And it was great! Super clean and large with a lovely bathroom with tub and adjacent walk-in glass-walled shower. All amenities and fixtures worked perfectly. Ample storage. Easily adjusted temp via thermostat. And super comfortable bed and pillows! No smell of cigarette smoke in our room or hallway (bonus!). All in all, the room was way better than I had expected. I even got a kick out of the pyramid shaped soaps.

As for the hotel and casino itself... the main casino was smokier than others on the Strip, with more kids running down the hallways and main walkway thoroughfares than most other casino-hotels (with perhaps the exception of Circus,Circus and Excaliber). Not a problem so much on the main floor but, yes, a problem when one is trying to get to sleep at midnight and kids are loud and, well, just being kids. 

We got a coupon book upon checking in with a $20 dining credit; the problem was, this was only applicable to 2 on-site restaurants and 2 bars, and not for lunch at all. The restaurants were not open late so we were unable to use them for a light meal after our shows, so we resorted to using them at Flight bar (on the main casino floor). It was late and we sat at a table which was dirty and no servers came to take our order so we went to the bar to get our own drinks. It wasn't an upscale experience, in any way. But hey, the drinks were decent and there was no problem using the coupon at least. (We weren't able to use any of the other coupons in the book at all). 

We had wanted to see the Titanic exhibit, but for $35\/person to walk around a small exhibit room, it didn't seem worth it. (I think the coupon book had a $5 off\/ticket deal. Still too pricey for the two of us for an hour's self-guided tour).

I didn't like how, on all the walkways exiting the casino (through the Luxor, to the Excalibur, to the Strip proper), there were so many vendors shoving things in our faces, boldly violating our person space, soliciting for our business for show tickets, face creams, nail art and oxygen bars and more. C'mon people! This approach is SUCH a turn-off!

Despite being the dead of summer and the fact that the Vegas temperature is hotter than the surface of the sun, the Luxor pool is only open from 9am-7pm. Are you kidding me? I don't understand not having extended hours in the summertime. We weren't able to use the pool at all. 

There are no water fountains around if you need water, and even the Starbucks here will charge you $1 to fill up a glass with water. 

What I was most impressed with was the ease of check-out. More so than any other hotel, check-out was soooo easy: they gave you the choice of check-out via email or tv or ""express"" check-out (dropping a completed form in boxes situated about) or old-time going to the front desk. I LOVED receiving both a text (with a link to click, to check out), and an email (to reply to, to check out). I checked out in literally 30 seconds via the link on the text. It was the smoothest, easiest check-out ever, anywhere. And they emailed me immediately a confirmation and statement for my records. This whole process was phenomenal! 

For the most part, I was impressed with this hotel, as it was clean and our room was great and it provided a fantastic value for our money. But if you're looking for a plush and swanky experience, keep looking as this ain't the place. It's kitchy and campy (which has its place. This is Vegas, after all!), and the tower rooms are great (I can't speak for the pyramid rooms), but the overall hotel experience is loud and crowded.",6,1,2

I feel like my experience was actually somewhat typical. 

My friend booked this for room because it was well-priced. My friends got a pretty nice suite room that was spacious. Our room was suppose to also be a non-smoking suite, but they instead gave us a ""regular"" sized room instead, which was quite small (I didn't mind the size since we were only staying a single night and just sleeping)  and worse was that the room had the worse smoke odor I've ever experienced. Now I would stay I've stayed in a decently number of hotels over the years (many of them were the cheapest we could find) and occasionally I've noticed a little bit of a smell in a smoking hotel room - but this was worse I've ever been in after about 5 mins and your eyes start to hurt.

We went back to change the room and they ""explanation"" was that when we first checked in... they didn't have a suite, OR a non-smoking room available - so they silently gave us a smoking regular sized room instead. There were some separate issues (which could have been unfortunate coincidences and I'll skip over) but basically it took us an hour (they called for someone to assist, but that person didn't show up, so they had to call someone else) and a talk to the manager before we could change our rooms to at least a non-smoking regular sized room.",2,0,0

Once i got to my room there was a big bathtub next to my bed that took up half the room (i don't mean a jacuzzi tub i mean a regular tub just very big) i turned on both air conditioners that wore old and not very strong took 2 hour and 33 minutes to cool down the room (i brought a temperature gauge) the carpet was stained with red spots all over and the refrigerator froze everything on low. The room came with two TVs one for the bedroom and one for the living area, the tv in the living area was picture perfect but the tv in the bed room was fuzzy. I went down to the front desk to see if the can have someone look at the tv to try and fix it and women there just said to wiggle the wire in the connection box.

PLUSES:
-GREAT prices...they are always having specials.
-Friendly staff.
-Quick & easy check-in...we even got to check-in two hours early with zero hassle.
-Room was clean and didn't smell of smoke...as promised for a non-smoking room.
-Casino level is nice and has a cool, low-key poker area.
-Carrot Top show is here. (separate review to come)
-Pool area is fun...complete with a bar and DJ.
-Convenient walking bridge and tram to get over to Mandalay Bay (NICE hotel) and Excalibur (NOT so nice hotel).


MINUSES:
-Rooms and décor could use a bit of a facelift.  The first time I stayed here in 2004 the room was in great shape...this time, not quite as much...have a feeling some are a little better than others.  Both times were still fine for us, though.
-Flat, small pillows.
-MORE buffet...gross....(separate review to come)
-Location at one far end of the strip makes getting places more difficult and expensive.
-SUPER ANNOYING time-share salespeople EVERYWHERE bugging you...expect more of these over at Mandalay Bay and Excalibur, too...there must be a new related property opening up.  Just ignore them and you will be fine...you'll quickly catch on to who they are after they approach you a time or two.
-No special little touches or upgrades for anniversary or special occasion...at least not for us!  : (

I would definitely recommend Luxor to travelers on a budget in Vegas.  As long as you aren't expecting anything beyond a clean room and a few places to eat\/shop\/play in a pretty decent hotel you should be fine.

Also, I'm not sure what the issue was but alarms kept going off on our floor and then our elevator was out of service for a while so we had to use the stairs which thankfully was not a big deal since we were on the 3rd floor.

We showed up honestly  a few hours early and waited in line and the lady rolled her eyes when she heard we had a free room through the game. We explained we had an email for 40$ for an upgrade to a suite and she scuffed at it and offered there original offer of 50$ not offering any sort of deal (we heard people had gotten a discount without asking). We rejected and asked for just the free room and she wanted to charge 20$ for early check in. We rejected and waited the many hours. We came back and waited in line again hours later, and had gotten the same exact lady who was so rude to us before, upon hearing her rude tone again (she remembered us and told is it wasn't 3 yet) we walked away (thinking she would put us in the worst room ever) and came back again well after 3pm.

The Husband and I stayed here for a few days while he was on business. There are good and bad things about the Luxor, and I think it's right in the middle of the hotel options on the Las Vegas strip.

Pros:
- The Titanic and Bodies Exhibits right in the lobby.
- A Starbucks by each of the elevators.
- A walking bridge to the Excalibur which leads to a walking bridge to the MGM Grand and Tropicana so you don't have to hit the strip to go to other hotels.
- Connected to the Mandalay Bay by tram or indoor shopping center.
- Cheap rates (most of the time).
- Free wifi.
- Close to the airport which cuts down on taxi\/lyft\/uber fares.

Cons:
- Other than the Pyramid and the Sphinx out front, no ""theme"" or cool Egyptian things inside of the hotel. Just a bunch of slot machines.
- Very minimal restaurant options. There is one or two restaurants and that's it. The closest places to eat are in the shops on the way to the Mandalay Bay or the Excalibur Food Court.   
- The restaurants they do have aren't notable, good or famous in any way.
- Rooms are very basic. Our carpet in our room was damaged, the light in the closet wouldn't go off, and the shower had no pressure.
- Electrical outlets in the rooms are very limited.

I have stayed at the Luxor now twice and would come back here to stay again. Rooms are just fine and I LOVE the Titanic and the Bodies Exhibits. I also like how it's attached to a few other hotels so I don't always have to go out on the strip to walk around.",21,8,16

First off, it's too far away to walk to the other hotels, so you always have to take transportation to get anywhere,

The bathroom had large pieces missing from the tiles - I'm sure it's been that way for years. The a\/c wasn't working when we checked in, so the engineer came up and fixed it.

We had a tower king room and it was in rough shape.  The carpet was ripped, the furniture was damaged (chunks of wood missing), the sheets had HOLES in them, and the chairs and carpet were stained.  There was no full length mirror.  The bathroom was all tiled so any noise (ahem) in there reverberated throughout the whole room and probably into the hallway.  The shower was a normal sized shower (unless that is ""over-sized"" to the Las Vegas market?) and there was a huge bathtub.  The toilet paper was the worst I've ever used. The walls are paper thin so you can hear your neighbors.  No micro\/fridge (I believe you can pay a fee for a fridge).  There was a room safe.  The bed was okay, with four pillows (firm and soft). The AC was good, but there was only on\/off and then low\/med\/high.  No way to really normalize the temperature and there was no ""fan only"" option, which sucks for people who want some white noise to sleep without freezing by running the AC all night. We slept with the TV on to drown out the neighbors who were loud.

The hotel itself is huge.  You get lost and must follow the signage.  The timeshare folks that stop you while you are walking are terrible and if I owned the Luxor I'd get rid of them immediately.

They make you think they are working for the hotel (if you are a newbie walking in) and so you give them a few minutes and then you realize it's a timeshare\/""free gift"" b.s.  

There were I think 3 Starbucks in the place.  Lots of food options.  Casino with lots of slot machines and then a few blackjack\/poker tables.  The More buffet was excellent food.  The couple bars in the place seemed nice.  Everything is expensive.  There is a little convenience store where you can buy snacks and other essential items, but it's not cheap!

All the service employees are incredibly friendly.  The hotel workers were average.

There is a helicopter tour nearby that will start buzzing by at 8:50 AM every morning, at least in the east tower where we were. It goes all day and is a little bothersome because it's loud.

The self-parking area is big enough, no need to do valet.  Just follow the signs!

There is a walkway that connects the Luxor to Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur.  There's also a tram.

The hallways to the tower rooms are a bit unnerving - narrow and kind of creepy. After a few days I felt okay, but walking alone made me feel unsafe.

I wouldn't stay here again.",1,0,0

The rooms are poorly maintained and should be priced lower. It feels like a motel 8 upgraded with cool building shape. The interior looks great, but the interior of the rooms are not so.

It turned out to be an ADA room.

It had a weird, creepy bathroom... no bathtub... hardly any light... foam chair in the shower and on a little table. It just gave me the creeps. Like looking at an iron lung or something.

I called downstairs and requested another room. ""We are all sold out."" I said then I hope there isn't a riot because there were about 100 people standing in line when I left.

Anyway, the next day we were given a nice quite room. In the OTHER tower (why they couldn't just move us to a different room in the same tower I'll never know). 

The new room was quite. Whew!

But the room was about 20F hotter than the hallway. I looked at the thermostat, it was on high and turned all the way down. (The ADA room on the other hand was freezing, even on low.)

Anyway, I didn't want to move again so I called maintenance. About 45 minutes later a guy shows up. The guy said to keep the drapes and bathroom door closed all week. Really? That's your solution?

When we first got to the room, the bedroom and master bath smelled like fresh cigarette smoke. We thought it was the previous person and dismissed it. However every morning the master bedroom and bath regained the smell of cigarette smoke, so of course with my asthma I woke each morning short of breath and sneezing.

Secondly they seem to have the largest number of per visitor timeshare creeps I've ever seen. You can't exit or enter the place with out getting bombarded at least twice. They were even pandering to my 5 year old, telling him to get mommy and daddy to take him to a free show. The same thing happened with their flying carpet video thing. My son was a step or two behind me, although still in my peripheral vision, and one of the workers in the booth walked over and asked if he wanted a ride.

Now the positive stuff. 

The room was beautiful. We had a view of the backside of the pyramid out our window and we were placed at the end of the corridor so not only was it quiet, we didn't have to reign our son in as much as in another room. That being said..CRTs? If you aren't going to modernize your electronics, stop using wide-screen feeds.

The interior of the pyramid itself is great, albeit period incorrect. It's supposed to be Egyptian, but the food court was Tuscan and the MORE buffet was more Grecian ruin style. Pick one and stick to it.

The valet people were great. Despite the rain, they were prompt, courteous and friendly. The same can be said for the staff in their 24hr cafe and the buffet. In fact they were the best I've experienced while in Vegas (outside of a 4 star restaurant) in a long time.

We'll probably return for exhibits, but we won't be staying there again.

Pulled up to the valet, they were friendly & efficient as were the gentlemen at the bell desk. 
It all went down hill from there.
We did not even make it to the check in desk before we were accosted by two women asking us if we were checking in before directing us to go to this desk to get our ""free gift"". Free gift? Sounds too good to be true, and it is. The people at the sales desk weren't overly pushy, but seriously, we'd been on the road for 5 hours, we just wanted to check in, rest & refresh, not bargain for tickets to a show.
Check in was...eh. The woman who checked us in was a little abrupt, but whatever, we were ready to get to our room.
The hotel room was clean, but a little run down and sparse. No biggie, we knew the Luxor wasn't a new sparkly hotel, so that didn't bother us. 
What did bother us was that there was no hot water in our room. None. My husband called the front desk & was told they would send an engineer right up to fix the problem. Thirty minutes later he called again and was told that this was happening in several rooms and no one could say when it would be fixed. We were offered a $30 dining credit after my husband started asking more questions. 20 minutes later my husband called again and spoke to a manager who said the problem would be fixed within minutes but would not give us an idea of how many minutes until my husband pushed for a specific time frame. 
By this time, we had had enough. We spend enough time at home fighting with people over things like this. We go on vacation so we don't have to worry about things like whether there's hot water, or being  coerced into watching sales presentations.
Not once did anyone offer even a token apology for the inconvenience of not having hot water in our room. No one checked back with us to make sure we were comfortable, or to make sure that the problem had been resolved. No one seemed inclined to give any kind of customer service at all.

We had to park at Mandolin Bay, which has a much larger parking garage, and walk back to Luxor, and over the bridge, which was another f-ing mile. The bridge to the hotel is not air conditioned, so if you didn't opt for the free valet, prepare to sweat. Seriously, y'all need to figure that shit out. We were assigned a room in Luxor's East Tower, a building that resembles an office building from the 1980s. The entrance to the towers finds you weaving through what resembles the narrow employee corridor of the back of the hotel to get to the elevators. It's sparsely populated with no windows and few doors, so it's a little scary for women travelling alone. Apparently, the rooms in the pyramid itself are reserved for high-faluting suite folk. We usually book those types of rooms, but in the wisdom of my old age, I realized I spend very little time in a hotel room, so i diverted hotel funds to see Rod Stewart at Caesars with a VIP package. Totally worth it. Anyway, the room was plain Jane with a view of other towers and a roof with air conditioners. Meh. The bathroom was clean, although signs of wear and tear are evident in the small mold spots growing between the tiles in the shower and the oxidation of the gaudy brass enclosure outside the shower. Ample hot water, good pressure. Flat screen tv, free wifi. If hotel experiences are important, you might want to opt for the newer hotels next door. It's one of the closest hotels to the airport, so you can avoid driving down the ridiculously crowded strip. Been there done that. The pool area is still outstanding. The water is clear, towels are clean, and it's got enough room to be comfortable.",0,0,0

The buffet doesnt compare to the Bellagio, Ceasars, or the M and neither does the price. Most of these reviews with 1 and 2 stars must be from people that want something for nothing.

We stayed in the East Tower-let me say...the tub\/shower combo is AMAZING! That bathtub is fabulous... :) The king size bed in our room was incredibly comfy and the room was very clean. 

We did not hear noise and at times even wondered if other people were even staying on our floor...haha. We talked to a couple of guests that were on the airport side and said they had trouble sleeping, but we never had trouble at all. 

After being really busy out and about on Mon. & Tues., we decided to have a ""rest day"" on Weds. We hung out in Luxor and did the Score! museum. Lots of fun! We also went to Fantasy & the show was pretty awesome. :) We went to the More buffet for lunch and thought it was tasty-definitely filled us up! 

The only thing that is annoying is the time share folks. You learn to avoid them pretty quickly, but it'd be nice not to be accosted EVERY single time you walk by-even if you just walked by them 10 minutes ago!

We really liked having Mandalay Place (Burger Bar is incredible, as is the pizza shop up there!) and the food court in our hotel-the chicken tender place is fabulous. We also went over to Excalibur a lot and it was convenient.

Yes we booked on one of those cheap travel sites. Yes we ended up in a 5th floor room with a view of a maintenance area out our room door and view of a tower blocking the sun out the window. But we dont go to Vegas to stay in the room. I knew the pyramid was older. It is a shame that they havent been able to maintain it to a higher standard. Yes I've seen Courtyard and LaQuintas in much better shape. But everything worked and was clean. The showerhead was updated and the water was really hot.  And we slept well. Absolutely no noise from the hallways at night. Zero. And no smell of smoke in the room. So if you got a decent rate its fine. And its connected to Excalibur & Mandalay Bay with New York New York a few easy steps away. 

The downside:
1. Its second last on the Strip. So you are going to be able to walk about 1\/3 of the strip. Further than that, take a cab because you'll be tired and still need to walk back.
2. We visited 20 casinos on the Strip & Fulton. The Luxor casino must have either no smoke filtration system or an old one. It was the only casino that reaked of smoke on the casino floor. My allergies kicked in and I had a headache within 10 minutes each time we walked thru the casino floor.
3. In room service. We didn't get any. But whoever is in charge of it needs a swift kick in the rear. Dirty trays, piles of dirty plates and old food sitting in the hallway for 4 days straight. This person Lori P. who keeps responding to Yelp posts says she'll notify someone. Clearly they didn't get the message or care. They know what room they serviced. If the guest doesn't call for pickup, go get it the next day. How hard is that?
4. No in room fridges in regular pyramid rooms. Which would be nice. But we managed. Maybe when they update this grand old lady some day.
5. The inclinators on floors 6 and above are old. The wheels on the track squeak and could use some grease. Remember that these were innovative back in the day. If you feel like inclining as you ascend to your room would be weird, read up on it before you book and request a room on floors 2-5 instead that use regular elevators.",0,0,0

With that being said, to the other reviewers who complain about the rooms being outdated and boring, you should just lay out those credit cards and upgrade to the Tower room, which is the Luxor's newer building. Or, better yet, book somewhere else in the nicer hotels in the middle of the strip!

Check-in: Wow, the lines were huge! It seemed that every guest that was trying to check-in was having some sort of problem. It took a good 45 minutes to just get to the front desk. I had asked for a Tower room but, all they had left was the Pyramid Rooms.

Room: Not bad, it was large enough for 2 of us. I didn't have any type of view to speak of though. The air conditioning was not working. Yes, imagine staying in Vegas with no AC. We called downstairs and they were not able to move us or have it fixed anytime soon. Rather than staying in the room we all went outside hoping it would be fixed by the time we got back. Unfortunately, when we got back 4 hours later the maintenance guy still hadn't gotten there to our room. Another 50 minutes later he finally arrived and fixed the AC. We did get some comps for this incident but, honestly the negatives outweighed the positives in this case.

Food: We did order room service which to my surprise was really not too bad. Nice sized portions and after a day of coaching basketball I didn't feel like going out to eat and this was a nice alternative. I did get a chance to check out the other restaurants inside the hotel and I wasn't really impressed with any one in particular. 

Pool: I only got to go here twice and both times I found it a great way to relax. I was able to find a place to lay out and just veg. I loved being able to drink in the pool because the combination of cool water and an adult beverage was sheer bliss on a 100+ degree day.

Check-out: Read above comment of the check-in process. Awful!!!

We went there in February for a friends birthday. It was just 3 of us girls and we drove. We didnt get in until 12am and the valet line took over an hour. For guests checking in that seemed a little ridiculous. Especially when we checked in and there was NOBODY in line. That should have been the first clue. 

The lobby is dirty and smells. There was construction everywhere- some areas were covered in black tarps and you had to walk around the casino to get the the elevators. O, and the pool was closed--so why were we forced to pay the $15 resort fee??? That's horrible customer service to make your guest pay for something they cant use.

Customer Service sucked. It was like they didn't have enough employees and the ones they had couldn't care less about you. 

When we got to the room (about a half mile walk) I sat down to relax before getting ready. The chair was soaking wet-- gross! What was it? who knows-- its Vegas it could have been anything. ANYTHING

Its the farthest casino on that end and tucked behind the Excalibur, I'm forced to stay there again this weekend and called ahead to try and get a good room-- with some sort of view. The lady on the phone said that there aren't any really good views because its not right on the strip. She said the best view is of the pool. I had that room in February. You see the loading dock and the windows were filthy. If that's the best room that's pathetic. 

They need new management and tons of money to fix that hotel. The theme has potential. But fire everyone and start over.

I am not a diffiicult to please type person - I can do it ""up"" or I am can be fine in a motel BUT I am a stickler for nice service!! I just think the whole HOTEL needs a staff makeover!  Here is why:

1)  Upon check in not so much as a greeting - treated like CATTLE and worse an INCONVENIENCE to the front desk staff.  It was like pulling teeth to ask a question about where to get tickets for Carrot Top - They were just short of rude. Was checked in without so much as a glance.

2)  My friend and I were walking around and yes bad girl I am ocassionally have a cigarette - smoking is not everywhere in this hotel!  As I ABRUPTLY found out!  (Although a LOT of people were smoking in the area I was in by the giftshop upstairs). This 350 woman with a BAD dyejob actually YELLED at me to ""extinguish"" my cigarette - rather than argue I said ""sorry about that"" and proceeded to put it out.  Well this was not ""good enough"" for this scary looking SLOB who apparently ""worked"" at the giftshop.  She then YELLED at me (everyone looked) and shrieked ""I said NOW RIGHT NOW !!!"" - well I yelled something back and yelled at HER ""WHO ARE YOU SPEAKING TO YOU MISERABLE BITCH???"" She then raced back into her ""store"" probably to woof down the rest of a bag of chips or some more ""anger"" pills.  Again THIS was not necessary - ESPECIALLY since others were smoking as well.  I was three feet off the ground after this!!

3)  Starbucks in the lobby - lined up and a red headed kid that was ""jacked up"" on goodness knows WHAT was making a mockery out of saying (loudly) to every customer ""hey hey hey how are YOU today?"" and what costs 1.79 in my home city was 4.20 there for the EXACT same thing a joke its funny a nice older gentleman from Minneapolis simply blurts out ""I HATE THIS PLACE"" I grabbed his arm and said ""They won't be seeing ME back HERE ever again!  THIS place treats you like cattle its a disgrace!"" he wholeheartedly agreed!

4)  The ""Spa"" is a joke and a rip off! Was greeted (in all fairness) by NICE front desk ladies - went into the back for my half hour massage only to be greeted by a jacked up very HYPER 60 + year old woman (too much overpriced Starbucks in the lobby?  Methamphetamines perhaps?? This woman was jumpy AND hyper!!) who SWORE there was no ""available"" masseuses - it was 8:00 AM I pointed out to her - she FINALLY begrudgingly said she had one ""available"" but (horror and shock her) was a MAN!!  I said ""I do not care"".  Well they did not even have a shower cap for me - she handed me an empty BOX then when I said to her it was empty she looked at me like I was crazy.  She then tells me to get into the hot pool then barks at me to ""get out there is no time to shower""  (and I am paying 75 + bucks for THIS?) Well I get the massage and the guy rips me off by EIGHT minutes because I did not ""opt"" for the ""hour for an additional 45 dollars!!"" Was I pissed off?  You bet! and of COURSE they all have their flipping hand out  - literally - for that ""precious tip"".  If I would have looked at the time I would have marched up to that ""front desk"" for a REFUND! Just disgusted at this point - what are they running there?  Who knows I will NOT be back! The woman was a hyper unprofessional pain in the ASS !!  Save your money !        

5)  ahhh last but not least the ""hotel bar"".  My friends flight got cancelled and she joined me for a drink - well the bartender should be out out to ""pasture"" as clearly he is too old and his customer service skills have lonGONE!  We sat down at the bar and he (bartender) pulls a single dollar bill out of glass likes its the anecdote for rabies and stashes it behind the bar.  We order our drinks and pay with a 20 dollar bill and he is actually WAITING  to see what I ""tip"" as he puts my change down and WAITS !!  I simply ignore this asshole and LEAVE the ""change"" in front of me.  Well he is ""watching"" the ""change""  I have in front of me and never asks us if we'd like another as his beady eyes are on the ""money"" in front of me the whole time - never mind asking us ladies if we'd like another or even bother to empty our ashtray the whole time we were there.  I have NEVER not ""tipped"" but I tell you as he was still ""looking"" at my ""change"" I scooped up every cent and threw it in my handbag and blurted ""you get what you PAY for!!""  I thought his eyes were going to pop out and he was going to lunge at me over the bar!! Lesson learned do NOT drink at the lobby bar!  The old bartender is desperate and greedy who has no concern (or business for that matter) in a ""service"" job of that magnitude! 

6) They do NOT change your sheets either!!! Paying top dollar to stay in this dump and they cannot even do their JOB!

7) Some woman down the hall was yelling and screaming at someone late at night - obviously upset at her husband....or maybe it was the same ""experience"" I had had at this lovely dump!  I sure didn't need to hear THAT!",3,3,1

Pros:
- SO affordable. I'm talking $35 a night affordable. 
- clean rooms and super friendly staff everywhere 
- fun casino for its size 

Cons: 
- the rooms are all pretty small, even the mega suite option I saw once. Try anything you can to get upgraded out of the pyramid because the wall is slanted and it feels claustrophobic. 
- last week we were staying there during a thunderstorm and our roof leaked pretty dramatically. Got our resort fee taken off which was great service, though. 
- the nightclub, LAX, is sad. 

Neutral\/""make what you want of this"":
- on the south end of the strip, across from MGM. Perfect if your club options include Hakkasan\/Light but expect a pretty hefty taxi fee for getting to mid strip.

I remember when this hotel was first built, and in my younger days, I wanted to come and visit because of the Egyptian motif. This weekend I found myself in town for UFC 191 and wanted to stay somewhere relatively close to the MGM, but without the MGM prices  (note to self: pay extra next time...it doesn't help to be cheap in Vegas). I'll keep my observations to a minimum:

1) The decor is sorely outdated. Egyptian motif notwithstanding, I've seen Courtyards more up to date than the Luxor.

2) Wayne's World!!!! At least, that's what I wanted to scream when I got into the elevator. The elevators angle at 33 degrees when going up or down,  so if you're not prepared for it, it can be a slightly unnerving experience. Speaking of elevators, they were filthy and decrepit...no other way of saying it. 

3) Unimpressed by the room. I stayed in a Pyramid Room. Chipped paint, dust, worn furniture...again, I've seen nicer Courtyards...

4) The valet team was on point, even offering me a Gatorade for the road, as well as offering to dispose of some miscellaneous trash in my car. Good customer service.

5) Checkout was painless. Check in wasnt, but it is was a holiday weekend, so I can't fault them for that. 

Overall, the Luxor strikes me as a place where you really don't want to get too comfortable and fall asleep, which is ironic because I slept like a baby. Would not repeat,  however.",3,0,0

We stayed from 12\/26-12\/29 and I did not like the hotel at all. 

There is no Wifi in the hotel, which I was totally bummed about because I don't have unlimited data; also the bathroom shower smelled like bleach or cleaning product the whole time- that's not an amusing smell. 

We also upgraded to the tower and in the description it said ""stunning views,"" well we did not have that. We were on the 4th floor and directly out of our window, we were looking at some type of concrete structure (parking structure, maybe?) I couldn't tell what it was. We went down to the front desk and asked to change rooms and they said it was not possible because of all the people staying there, blah blah blah, and we could try the next day. 

The only somewhat nice thing about this hotel was the cub, L A X, they played good music but the dance floor was a bit oddly shaped.

Parking is a little complicated here because it's not connected and the garage is really small. We ended up finding a space on the 2nd level and walked up to the registration and had our keys within 10 minutes. 

We stayed in the Pyramid which is the original part of the hotel. The elevators go sideways which is creepy (and loads of fun when you are drunk haha). The rooms are old fashioned and egyptian, but VERY clean. I wish they'd get an update like the casino and lobby did. My biggest complaint is the rooms are really dim! We had all 5 lights on and I still didn't have enough light to do my makeup haha. It's just drab being so dark in there. But over all the rooms are good, spacious and clean. 

Did some gambling here, they have a good spacious casino, not all the newest machines, but it's fine. Also I love that they have a food park. I know that's ghetto but sometimes I just want McDonalds or Starbucks for breakfast not a big fancy $50 breakfast.

I'd recommend this hotel, it's always very cheap, check Twitter for deals, you can always stay here for 100 or less. It's also far nicer than Excalibur for the price. It's kinda boring, but the rooms are fine to sleep and it's in a great location with an easy walk to Mandalay Bay.",3,0,0

Went onto Yelp and other websites to check reviews and was a little worried because they were so awful, but I figured, eh, we're only staying one night.

Hotel:
Considering we only paid $50 for the room, it was really good!  Our room was clean.  Check in was quick and easy.  Although check in was a 3pm, we were early (about 1pm) and we were able to get into the room right away. Which was great! (We stayed at Monte Carlo a couple of years before and didn't get a room until 6pm, even though we arrived at 11am).  

The bell desk brought up our bags quickly and efficiently.  Housekeeping also quickly brought up extra supplies for us.

The beds were a little on the soft side, could have been better, but again, we only paid $50 for the room.

The casino was not smoky and\/or crowded.

Pool Area:
The pool area was nice. It was clean and not crowded at all (during the summer the pools get bad). There weren't enough chairs to go around, but oh well.  The majority of the people were tanning, (that is why the pool wasn't crowded).  You do have to show your room key, just flashing the key to the attendant was enough.

New York-New York, MGM Grand, Planet Hollywood, and a couple other hotels had free wi-fi available in the public areas.

The room was okay. Decor was dated and not in an Egyptian way. The cigarette burn hole in the bedspread set the mood.

LOVE the shower...and I'm a man who enjoys a good shower. Hot water, the much needed spout high on the wall (I'm 6 foot, 4 inches), and a comfy bed. Setting the room temperature takes some doing as it's an old fashion two-knob heating\/cooling unit. 

If you stay in the pyramid, remember the elevators follow the building's structure. Several guests commented it felt weird (sea sick?) riding the elevator.

The property is right next to Mandalay Bay, so parking was a little confusing, but we got the hang of it.

WORD TO THE WISE: Please suggest a room near the elevator! My room was quite a trek from the elevator, and having to carry things made it even longer!
The room was clean, smelled clean. The bathroom did not make me want to crawl and we had an amazing view of the Sphinx, Las Vegas Blvd and MGM Grand, on midnight Friday night I was able to view a fantastic 10 minute firework show happening above MGM Grand. I exhausted my search online to find the reason of this show and the only thing I could find was the grand opening of Rose.Rabbit.Lie, an entertainment, dinner show, bar, mash up of some sort, Anyway the view was amazing.

Upon arrival we checked in rather painlessly (it was a bit hectic w\/ tons of people but there were many employees checking people in so it went quickly)  

Once we got to our room in the pyramid we found it had 2 queen beds when we reserved 1 king. The room was also extremely dark & dingy even w\/ all the lights on and very musty. The television was probably made in 1980 and the remote didn't even work.  We called the front desk and let them know the error of the 2 queens vs. 1 king and they offered us a room in the tower which we gladly accepted.  

A few minutes later a rude employee showed up at our room to show us to our new tower room.  On the walk there, he was practically running and my husband and I struggled to keep up w\/ him and our bags without breaking into a jog.  Once we got to the new room we took our bags and said ""thanks"".  The guy stood there expecting us to TIP him for showing us to our new room which was THEIR mistake!! I was appalled! If anything, he should've apologized again on behalf of the Luxor for the room mix up but instead he stood there like an idiot expecting us to give him money.  What a joke.  When we said ""thanks have a good night"" again he stormed out of there muttering loud enough for us to hear him.  What a douche of an employee...he must not realize he represents well-known resort in Las Vegas.  Anyways, our stay after that was fine and we didn't have any more issues.  The tower room was lavish compared to the pyramid room. Huge flat screen TV, bright lighting, new furniture. It was night\/day difference from our first room. 

The pool was ridiculously crowded at all times of the day.  There were almost NO lawn chairs available, mostly because they had 1\/2 of the pool closed off for no apparent reason.

Had a room in the pyramid, but on a low floor so there wasn't much slant to the walls.  Room was clean, housekeeping was fine. They accommodated my special towel request.  Rooms are a little beat-up, but who cares because you're only there to sleep. Note the rooms lack refrigerators, microwaves, even coffee makers. They do have irons and hair dryers.  Also note the elevators are miles away from the lobby.  The lobby seems small when the hotel is bustling and there's a big line for check-in or check-out. 

Get an M-Life card so you get  rewards credit (such as it is) for all your purchases at any MGM hotel.  Note that having this card doesn't entitle you to use the shorter MLife check-line; that's only for those who reserved something in the casino (or maybe the high rollers.)
Oddity is that charging meals and purchases to your room is not the default and requires a little extra effort.

All restaurants in Vegas are pricey, deal with it.  Within the Luxor, the Cafe is decent, the Rice is good, the Taco & Tequila is very good. The buffet is, well, a buffet. 
Plus, the hotel is connected to the Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur, which expands your restaurant and shopping choices. 

I was impressed that the clerk in one of the stores went out of her way to contact the other (same owner) stores in the hotel to get us another article of clothing in order to get the sale price.   All the staff was courteous.

We went to the Titanic exhibit and found it more interesting than we had thought it would be. 

Hotel has the usual stuff on tv to check your bill, express check-out, etc., but nobody tells you this and it's not written anywhere.

We were not dressed and preceded to get dressed and telling security to please hold on. The phone rang and it was the front desk telling me to open the door and security was outside. I said. ""yes, i know, but we are not decent and are getting dressed. Upon opening the door there were 10-12 men outside of our room. They then stated ""we have a domestic violence complaint, whats going on, are you ok in here"". I WAS COMPLETELY SHOCKED!!! My adrenaline was pumping and i was completely outraged by not only this accusation but by the protocol of this hotel. My spouse and I are both a loving couple and could not believe this. One of the 12 security officers then, without permission, barged through me and into the room and said he needed to look around. He then said ""ok, everything looks fine"" and they shut our door and left us feeling violated, and extremely emotionally upset. This was completely hostile and inappropriate.  Apparently the neighbor had made a noise complaint. We were outraged and were left with no apology or explanation of such radical behavior. This is suppose to be our vacation away from home, that cost us a lot of money, we did not pay to get harassed on our trip. We then called the front desk to speak with a manager. It took them 25 minutes to get a manager up to our room and it was the security manager who brought up with him the same hostile man who barged into are room and continued to make accusations saying ""when i knocked it got quiet, we thought your spouse had his hand over your mouth"". Our television was still on at the time they came so this was not true. I again, was so upset he was continuing to make us feel uncomfortable and make statements and assumptions about what we were doing. They stated that was their policy and protocol and that the hotel has a lot of complaints and situations that require security to come up in that way. I then stated ""so this hotel then doesn't seem very safe if you are having these kinds of issues with domestic violence and reason to bring up 10 security officers for a noise complaint on a television. He just said sorry and left with no resolution or wanting to compensate us or help us out. Still feeling unsettled we then went down to the front desk manager who apologized and said that is their protocol for security. I asked him to please compensate us for our night as it was now 2:30am and we should not have to pay to be harassed by your security. He said he would only take off a couple resort fees and we would have to contact our second party booking agent vegas.com. We would never recommend this hotel, they are insensitive, unprofessional and create hostile situations with no apology or appropriate means of reconciliation. We should not have to go out of our way to call a second party or go down stairs to try to resolve such issues. As it stands, after calling vegas.com, they refused to pay for our first night stay after experiencing all of that. As a woman it was truly traumatic and left me feeling very uncomfortable and unappreciated as a customer.",0,0,0

Check In: Goes pretty smoothly. The line can be long, but it moves quickly. If you want room charging privileges you will have to have a $50 per night deposit on your credit card plus your room charges. This can be waived, but you cannot charge anything to your room.

Room: The rooms are small and simple. I was in a players room which is a step above the standard room. It included a safe, a tub and shower, and a fridge, but no microwave. The room was clean, but many of the furnishings were dated and in need of repair. The bed stands were chipped and missing paint and the couch had a hole in it and looked like it belonged in a college frat house. Bathroom was nice and well lit. 

Casino: The Casino isn't very large or have the same variety of slot machines that others do, but the table games are plentiful with good dealers and cocktail service. Never really waited for anything at the casino cage. The MLIFE desk line can get long and they usually only have 1 or 2 working the desk which can make for a long delay. 

Food: The buffet is average. Good dessert area, but the food is just average. Rice & Company is honestly awful. Slow service, undercooked food, and way overpriced sushi ($15 California Roll !!!). Tender steakhouse was excellent. The food court has a McDonalds and other fast food places that you can eat for cheap. 

Entertainment: Bodies Exhibit was interesting and informative. Titantic was really cool as they have an incredible amount of artifacts and a huge piece of the ship recovered from the wreckage site. I recommend going to the box office and buying the package deal with both of them to save money (more so than buying them separately even with the coupon). Carrot Top is great, really you need to see him unless you're easily offended. Did not see Menopause or the striptease show. 

Tips: The coupon book they give you is not that great of a deal. many times you can get a better deal for the show and food discounts by going to box office or tix4tongiht. The tram that runs from Mandalay Bay to Excalbur runs weirdly. Pay attention. You will walk a long way while in vegas if you want to see other hotels, so plan accordingly.

*The bar tender at Flight Bar made me a Raspberry lemonade martini with a pink sugar rim fresh squeezed raspberrys and it was good!!

For you Starbucks members, don't expect to get rewards or anything here. The first time I came here, they said that they couldn't give us the free drink (every 12th drink for a gold member is free) and they didn't give a good explanation. Finally, they said that they're not a part of the actual starbucks. OKAY. The second time I came here, I wanted to reload my card. They can't do that here either! The barista was not friendly at all when she informed me about this. I ordered a grande iced hazelnut macchiato. Disgusting. She put in way too much hazelnut and the espresso tasted burnt. I was too lazy to go back so I tried to bear with it but ended up throwing it away. This happened at the one downstairs next to Blizz(?). 

There's another one upstairs at the food court. My friend goes to ask for a refill, as gold card members can. Again, they say that they can't. She asks for a cup of water and they gave her a small sample paper cup and said that they can't give her more than that. What the heck? 

I'm not planning on coming here again. Sucks for gold card members and their baristas are rude and suck. There's plenty of other Starbucks around in Vegas so go check out one of those.",1,1,1

Went to Vegas for a wedding and 4-day weekend. I've been before but never to Luxor. My wife selected the accommodations, and we were looking to go on a budget. From a price-point, this fit the bill. We were on the 8th floor of the West Tower. I THINK the room might have been one of the renovated ones (it had a wet bar and mini-fridge), but I'm not 100% certain. Regardless, it still came across as a bit dated. It seemed clean, and the bed was fairly comfortable. But let me back up a second. Our Lyft driver dropped us off at the West Tower main entrance. Upon walking in, we were greeted by a sign that said the tower check-in desk was closed, and that we'd have to haul our luggage through the pyramid to the main check-in desk. Not a good start. It was 10 pm at night, and we were weary travelers by that point, but thankfully the line was short. BTW, the tower desk was NEVER opened our entire stay. We were never offered to have the hotel handle our bags. I'm not sure that is something they offer.

I already covered the room. Comfortably average. One strike is that out of 3 nights, housekeeping chose to skip our room one day. We had to call down, wait about an hour, and then they came to clean. 2 days, they did not leave wash clothes. We had to call down for those and use hand towels to wash with in the meanwhile. After the room was serviced, it did seem clean though. Just no wash clothes.

My biggest complaint was noise. Since they ARE doing room renos, it seemed like they began the day's work around 4 or 5 am. So needless to say, as sound travels through marble hallways and multiple elevator shafts, I was awoken every day around 5 am.

Compared to many other strip hotels, Luxor is small. It does not take very long to walk to where you need to go within the hotel. If you plan to walk to other destinations, being at the end of the strip, it takes a while on foot.

This was my 3rd trip to Vegas and my 3rd hotel. I probably would not come back to Luxor. There are others in the same price range that I'd try next time.",0,0,0

All of the rooms in the towers are exactly the same, EXACTLY, and their security teams are super rude.

The place smells more than other casinos and the video slot machines aren't as good as a lot of the others further down the strip, or even at their sister casino MGM. LAX (the club) is poorly designed (check out my review) and their dress code is way to strict for a place that's average room stay cost $45. Walk to Mandalay and check out the clubs there, much better. 

If you're looking for a cheap place to stay, move closer to the middle of the strip OR go further off strip, just not here.

In Las Venase all the time remaining on the rise and some feel unbridled joy, once inside, all went with their mouths open, designers tried their best.
Inside the pyramid is hollow. It is the world's largest atrium. Inside the statues of pharaohs and skupturki Anubis. On the dais split a mini-city in the Egyptian style. We go up the escalator and walk between the houses, which are located in the shops. Upstairs balcony - is included. That is built at an angle, each upper floor above the bottom. In the photo, like anything special, but when you're standing and is seen in the real world is very impressive.
In the lobby of the constant movement, still, in this building 2,500 rooms! People inhabit, are evicted, to the front desk someone always comes up with suitcases, plus like we hang around the hotel with huge eyes and cameras at the ready.

I didn't want to book Luxor again (for obvious reasons) but there were so many events\/conventions that were happening that weekend and this was the lowest priced on the strip. After I had booked it had gone down $50, so I called and spoke to an amazing woman on the phone (I think her name was Karen?) and we rebooked for the lower price, plus she noted on the account that we were there celebrating my mother's 60th birthday. So far, so good. Between all of that I was getting e-mails from Luxor saying I could upgrade my room to $39 a night. I decided to skip since I wasn't paying any more money and I would try my luck at the front desk.

We arrived in Vegas around the afternoon and although the line was long, it went faster than expected. The woman at the desk was super friendly and I asked if there were any free upgrades due to my mom's birthday. She upgraded me to the Tower Room, and threw in some extra coupons for her to use. 

The Tower Room is about one step above from the standard rooms, but it's well worth it. What I really liked is that the windows are flat since you're not on a the slanted part of the hotel.

This was my mother's first time in Vegas and she loved the room as well; she also liked that Luxor is easily connected to Mandalay Bay. And my mom is a tough critic, so that's saying something.

You could tell that the hotel was aged but I liked the shower since the walls were actually textured.

The waitress came by and told me that no food would be served until 11:00 a.m. Let me also say that there was also a sign at the entry that stated ""No food or drink from the outside was allowed"". I bit my lip until the following occurred. Finally 11:00 arrived, I ordered two sandwiches for my GF and myself. Twenty five minutes later the food server came back to tell us that the snack bar had no meat, lettuce, tomatoes. She was so embarrassed to tell me this information. I told her that I wanted to speak to a manager, twenty minutes later a manager arrived and I told her all of my complaints and concerns. Her answer to my concerns was she would comp my lunch. I told her that I could care less about my lunch being comped, I was hoping to hear that she would take care of the problem........I could go on and on about the Luxor. The employees or the one's that i met only cared about one thing, that they had a job and got paid on payday.  This is my first and last time at the Luxor and hope that others will read this.",0,0,0

I was there for my bachelorette party June 11th and 12th, 2011 with a group of about twenty people with several different reservations made. The main problem was the lack of customer service on our visit due to a problem with the elevators. When we arrived on Saturday, the elevators were taking unusually long because only two of the four elevators that serviced the nineteenth floor were in working order. We therefore waited over an hour for the bellboy to get to our room. We were told we could not leave the room until he got there. So, here we are anxiously awaiting the bellboy to get there so we can start our weekend. Every time we wanted to use the elevator we would wait for about half an hour, without exaggeration. We figured out after a few runs that we would rather walk down three or four floors to get to the different set of elevators. When we got back to the hotel at two o'clock in the morning on Sunday we were tired and there were about thirty people waiting to use the elevators. After continuously waiting, we all came to the conclusion that NONE of the elevators were working. There was nobody there to help us or inform us of this situation. I got on the house phone and asked for a solution to which they told us to walk up all nineteen floors. I could not believe my ears. This was not an acceptable solution as there was a pregnant lady in our group. I was transferred to somebody else who told me to take the elevators (located elsewhere) to, I think it was the 14th floor and walk up from there. Finally, I asked which direction the elevators were that would service a floor higher than the 19th so that we could walk down from there. But this wasn't the end of the story. Unfortunately, we had to move our luggage around rooms because when we arrived in Vegas we had all of our luggage taken to one room so we could start our day quicker. Now we had to carry our luggage back down the stairs, across the casino to get to the correct set of elevators to go to our other room. When I asked to speak to the manager to see what they could do for us, having spent more than two hours on this whole ordeal she offered me a coupon to have the breakfast buffet for $30! Are you kidding me! No, this was not acceptable - apparently the best she could do was a late checkout.

            It was very frustrating that the elevators did not work but even more upsetting that there was nobody to help us with this situation - no signs on the elevators saying out of order, nothing.",0,0,0

First off, I am a big fan of the theme of this hotel. I love the Egyptian look of it. In the past few years, I was a little bothered that this hotel seemed to be going down hill a little. There were areas that were dirty, there was graffiti in the hotel and it just didn't have the mystic of a Vegas hotel any more. When I went through it for this review, I was very pleased that I did not see any of this. I didn't walk through the whole hotel, but what I did see, made me actually want to stay here again.

The check-in line took approximately 30 minutes, and after dragging all of our bags across the hotel and up the elevators, we realized the room keys didn't work.  No big deal, happens occasionally.  Once I walked back to the room with new keys, I found my wife sitting with a security guard who apparently demanded her ID and wanted to know what she was doing outside the room.  He also accused her of not being a guest because the room is in my name.  Once we got that sorted out, we walked in to find a dark, musty room with a temperature something akin to Baghdad.  I know, I've been there.    

The pool is outside our window and the spring break DJ\/dance party has been going strong all day.  We figured we'd go join them, only to find that there were zero seats anywhere by the pool.  I stood in line for approximately 10 minutes to try and buy a drink, and exactly zero people moved in front of me.  So, we gave up on the pool and came back inside to try and cool off, except its still 300+ degrees.  So, as I sit here sticking to the sheets about to jump in the shower and get ready for dinner, I'm thinking we should have spent the extra money to stay somewhere nicer.  My wife stayed at the Aria earlier in the year and had none of these issues.  We're only here for one night, but if we were staying longer in Vegas, I'd be checking out and finding another place.

Smoking is prohibited throughout the hotel. Unfortunately, this mean that's rude drunk people do ash their cigarettes all over the place. 
There were SO many moths both dead and alive in our window seal. We called maintenance and they told us that they had a moth problem.

No in-room safe, no tub (ergo, no edge to hold shampoo, razor, etc.), no mini-bar (frig), no coffee\/tea set up, no easy chair or sofa.

The devil is in the details: carpets throughout were badly faded. Elevator interiors showed considerable accumulated wear and tear; some elevator doors had problems closing; and some elevator call buttons seemed non-functional. Elevators with any problem do not instill confidence.

Our queen-Pyramid room was spacious, but not all that comfortable. The picture shown on the Luxor website of a typical room must have had extensive supplemental lighting, because even with all the lights on, the room was dimly lit. The bathroom was worse with just one low-watt overhead fixture in the middle of the room making shaving or doing make-up annoyingly difficult. Bathroom fan was very loud, as was the  the toilet flush. Facial and toilet tissue were unpleasantly coarse and scratchy (however, tissue at their spa was acceptable). 

Although beds had nice firm pillows, the worn mattresses lacked adequate support. Linens were exceedingly thin. Seating in our room consisted of three dining room type chairs, two of which needed to have their partially broken seat surfaces replaced. A small circular utility table had numerous scratches. Exterior of the windows was extremely dirty.

One odd comment: the electric outlets all seemed to allow whatever was plugged in to fall out easily. Tried charging a phone overnight, only to find the plug had fall out before the phone had fully charged. 

We could watch the planes land and take off from McCarran Airport, only a little over a quarter mile east of our room, and surprisingly, we heard very little noise, generally.

Spa massage was excellent. Poolside chaises could use a good scrubbing.

You wouldn't visit the Paradise Cafe twice; my burger was served at room temperature, as were the fries. The buffet was $15 for breakfast, $16 for lunch, $20 for dinner, or $32 for an all day pass. Such frugal pricing resulted in a selection of dishes that was adequate, but nothing special. Prime rib at the carving station at dinner was well prepared and tasty; turkey breast was also well prepared and moist. I did appreciate the petite dessert sizes; despite unlimited access, I would rather enjoy two small tastings than only one big one.

This hotel is certainly 3 stars overall. Let me first air my grievances.

The rooms do not have a safe, which in Vegas is unacceptable because many people carry cash. The rooms are also very arduous to get to, even if you have a room near the elevators. The elevators are extremely slow in every manner, and are located in very inconvenience out-of-the-way places. Also, they don't have wi-fi, just a single Ethernet cord hidden away in the armoire. Secondly, the food options are seemingly random. They have very cheap places to eat in the food court (Nathan's, McDonald's, and a Swanson's) and very expensive restaurants outside of the food court. They really need to offer better happy hour specials, more fixed price menus, and lower prices in general at all of the restaurants, most of which were half empty even on a Saturday night. Slot selection was minimal and spread out extremely randomly throughout the casino floor.

Now, the pros. It is a gorgeous hotel inside, and the rooms are very nice and clean. We had the cheapest room, the Pyramid Deluxe, and it was very spacious. The pool is also very nice, but was a bit crowded. I don't blame the hotel for this, as they had almost every conceivable empty space filled with lounge chairs. There was also a private event being held in 1\/3 of the pool, so that confined the rest of us guests to a smaller area. The water was very clean and refreshing. The buffet is one of the best I've ever been to as well and it is certainly worth the $20 it costs for dinner. I'm sure the breakfast buffet is awesome, but I didn't end up going out for breakfast either morning I was there.

I paid ~$170 total including resort fees and taxes on the room for Saturday and Sunday night. I think it was just right as far as value, but  I am certainly not staying here again. There are so many nicer hotels on the strip closer to all the fun that I'd rather stay at in the future!",1,0,0

I jump out of bed and yell for him to get the f@$# out of our room!, he stumbles to get up and is pretty wobbly, I'm thinking it's either going to be a round house kick or a major blow to his jaw to knock him out, I scream at him again, GET THE F*@$ OUT HERE NOW!!! ...he stumbles and say's OK, OK, I'm in the wrong room, I make sure he's out and turn to see my kids face in total shock, to which she replies, ""This place SUCKS!""...to make it worse, I have 2 other kids down the hall and have to make sure this jerk doesn't head down the hall.....It's now about 2:00 AM and unable to fall back to sleep thinking of what just happened....we have another game that we have to leave by 5:00 AM to get there and I don't get to explain this until later that night......

You'll love this...I ask for the manager, I get someone that has as much concern as the check in person, after a long explanation, I'm getting the feeling she either doesn't give a crap or just not interested...BOOK YOUR ROOMS ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!!!!

Oh yeah, one last surprise, the quote you a room rate and forget to mention they'll be adding $40 worth of fee's PER DAY....this place is the worst.",0,0,0

This is a fair hotel for it's price and it's class
. 
Check In: No welcome from front desk, just do the job. 
Room: Spacious and clean but just don't compare with Wynn, etc. Black clumsy TV with very limited channels.  Internet is free but did not receive instruction for how to hook up.
Restaurants: Food court and other restaurants are available but does not attract me to dine there. So dark.... after all, I am inside a huge triangle coffin. =) 
Oasis Pool: Good music (except that one day with every 10 mins announcement of poker game buy in with an annoying male voice) 
No pushy pool sales; available when needed 
Overall, it's enjoyable with very little or no kids present at the pool.
Note: Pool depth all around in 3 feet
Attraction:  The not vertical elevator.  It will be more cool if it's transparent.

So what?  it's very unique, lots of fun, and location isn't bad.  This was my second stay in Vegas, ever, my first was just me and my wife without kids in the Paris.  This was with two kids and the wife, we had a blast!  The casino is lively and well done as casinos go, the lobby is wild, unlike other casinos I've seen or hotels I've stayed at.  Why go to Vegas just to stay in a nice Hilton?  

I don't gamble, of course, which might skew my perspective.  And I didn't eat in any of the nice looking restaurants, just the Starbucks (outrageous prices, of course) and the little deli.  But Tender, Tequila & Taco, LAX, they all looked pretty swanky, and I'd eat there if it was just me and the wife.  Plus the indoor access between the Luxor, Excalibur and Mandaly Bay hotels and malls was a nice touch.  

Finally, it was a nice kiddie diversion to hop the monorail that connects these three casinos too (also free, a plus with the kids and on a budget).  Location may not be the best, it's a bit far from the pulse of Central Strip, but it's not bad.

My BF and I checked in and lugged our bags to our room -- and after a 6-hour drive -- we just wanted to take a quick nap. Well, it's hard to do that when once you walk into your room it looks like someone had just gotten out of bed. That's right, they gave us a room that hadn't been cleaned or anything, and had the old sheets still on the bed.

So, we make the trek back to check-in and ask for the manager. She was less than helpful, and even tried to convince us that WE were the ones who left the bed a mess. WTF?! She then tells us that they're all booked and there's only one room left, but it's in a loud area. We tell her to just get the room cleaned, she says okay she'll have it done right away. We ask - Where do we wait? She said - You could wait in the room. We just said - No, we didn't want to watch the cleaning crew make the bed and stuff, so we'd kill 20 min in our friend's room.

30 min later, the room looks exactly the same. We talk to the manager again and she tried (second attempt) to try to convince us that maybe the room isn't a mess and are we sure we saw the bed unmade. So frustrating. After, what seemed to be another 30 min, she somehow found another room for us. 

There are other hotels.

We were presented with a $40 fee for use of the pool, and exercise facilities, which is fine except that it was too cold to use the pool and we were too busy to use any other extra facilities.  We were granted our room keys in the West Tower.  As we traveled down the winding hallways towards the west tower, there was a stench that became increasingly prominent.  The smell of drunk sweat, vomit and excrement filled our nostrils as we entered the elevator.  Not soon enough we arrived at our room that was directly across from the ice maker and elevator.  The ice maker is not enclosed in a room with a quiet door on it, people would clearly be passing our room at all hours of the night and our sleep would be disrupted.  We made our way back to the casino floor at which time the main doors had been closed because no one wants the smell to escape in to other parts of the hotel.  The lady at the desk changed our room after we complained and we made our way towards the East Tower.  We could already see a huge difference, the corners of the wall paper and carpet we maintained unlike the west tower where they were pulling back from age.  The paint looked more fresh and there was no awful smell.  We got to our room and it was similarly slight nicer and fresher than the previous room.
The rooms are just OK, there is no mini-fridge to store a beverage or bottle of wine.  The on-demand menu didn't work on the TV, it merely beeped when the ""menu"" button was pressed.  The bathroom was probably the most exciting with a full size bathtub and walk in shower, however they were very stingy with the amount of soap they included.  You CANNOT call for valet to bring your car around, you must walk yourself downstairs with you luggage and request the car across the 10 lane driveway and wait in the cold (depending on the time of year, may be extreme heat).

Unfortunately I had to stay at this resort for three days on a business trip. Bad time for a business trip. It was so last minute and affordable that I had to stay here and boy did I hate it. Staying here will likely have you next to some rowdy neighbors and god does this place need renovation or a paint job. It's just so dark, it needs lighting to accent the place just a tad bit to bring some life into it. One thing that's really just annoying to see is carrot tops face plastered everywhere. The posters beefs him up and makes him look all buff but when you actually see the guy, hes pretty scrawny. Poor thing!

Anyway thumbs up to the people who like the stay, the only thing I'd literally agree to like on is the fact that they give you complimentary drink tickets; that's all!

I was also amused at how well you can see the Pyramid and the big light shining up from it as your plane lands at McCarran.  

Our room was in the Tower.  It was blah looking, not much space and the bathroom was not all that great, but it was functional. My friend and her fiance had their room in the Pyramid and it was really weirdly shaped with slanty walls.  

I did like the cafe here as it's kind of in the middle of things so you get a nice view of the goings-on in the Pyramid and casino while you eat.

Of the three connected ""theme"" hotels at this end of the Strip (Luxor, Excalibur and Mandalay Bay) I preferred the Luxor but that's probably because I'm not all that big on medieval knight-and-lady reenactments, and I thought the concerts and attractions at Mandalay Bay were a big yawn (it was like one big Margaritaville).

The tv initially didn't work. Figured out that it wasn't even plugged in. The cable is fuzzy\/grainy. It it is what it is. We were mainly there in the room to sleep anyway.

The inside of the hotel itself is okay. Currently under construction in some areas too.

I stayed two nights this past week and was very pleasantly surprised!

I got a complimentary upgrade to a tower room and was on the third floor. Check-in wasn't a bad experience; the line was long, but it moved very quickly and I was to my room in 15 minutes. The room was pretty spacious, complete with a very large bathroom (one where there was both a tub and a separate shower). The bed was comfortable, and noise was never an issue (I was a bit worried about being on a low floor, but I never had an issue).

As far as the rest of the property is concerned, it isn't flashy, but it's nice. The location is an issue, and if you're going anywhere north of the New York New York-MGM Grand area, you probably need a car, a cab, or the monorail. I drove from SoCal, so traveling wasn't an issue for me, but if being centrally-located is important for you, this is something to keep in mind.

But seriously,for the prices, who can complain considering that I've paid $80-$100 a night for chain hotels along the interstate. This is a solid mid-range or even budget option (I got rates for $42 a night, plus the de rigeur resort fee) if you're looking for a decent place to stay on the Strip.

My husband and I stayed in the pyramid because it was cheaper than the tower (and thus, more ghetto...). If I wasn't trying to save money on this trip, I would have stayed at a higher end hotel, so you could say that I knew what I was getting myself into by booking this hotel.

The rooms were okaaay. I didn't feel super clean. I found some stains on the bedding. I'm not sure if these were permanent stains and had already tried to be removed or if they were stale and didn't see the laundry room yet... ewww...

The bathroom was big but the fan in the bathroom was so loud! It was like I was next door to a jet engine. I could also hear the people above me flushing and using the bathroom. Weird. I would think their bathroom fan would drown out that noise for me... The walls must have been very thin or my hearing is remarkable.

Room furniture (needs replacing, stained, dingy and some broken)

I wanted to steal the pillows they were so comfy {i found the info on them and have already ordered my own for home}.  All the hotel staff were friendly and helpful.  

We had an interesting experience.  Our second night there we got back to our room after the night out and were watching TV.   About 20 minutes into our program the TV changed channels, the remote was on the night stand, untouched.  We thought strange but whatever. Two  nights later at about 4am I woke to a very loud dripping noise that was getting louder and louder.  It woke my husband as well so he got up to check it out.  When he got to the bathroom it suddenly stopped. So he got back in bed.  An hour later it happened again and again stopped when he went to check.  Then our last night the TV changed channels when the remote was on the night stand again.   So out of curiosity I decided to google if there were reported hauntings at the hotel.  Sure enough I found that there were a few deaths of workers doing construction  as well as a prostitute with AIDS who jumped to her death from the 26th floor, landing in what was the buffet only a few years after the hotel opened. This tragedy prompted the hotel to do a remodel and that area is now the food court. They say that she haunts the floor. Guess which floor we were on? 26! Room 26140 to be in fact.  Coincidence?  I cant explain why these things happened, we thought it was kind of cool!

My only complaint is the plethora of time share sales people who HOUND you.  They entice you with cheap or free tickets to shows and events if you will go see some other hotel.  They ask for about 2 hours of you time but as I heard from someone else they take your entire day.  We did not fall for it but in the 6 days we were there, they bugged us well over 20 times.  It makes you want to not spend time with in the hotel.  My rating would have been a 5 star but since the hotel allows these people to solicit I took a star away because I find it a negative thing.

me and a couple friends from college hit up las vegas for new years, and decided to stay in the luxor as it was the cheapest nice hotel on the strip for new years (try $415). the funny part was on the night of the first it was only 109. 

when you walk in this place you are speechless. i mean it's a f**king pyramid. the inside can hold a 747 (just the lobby). the rooms are not the nicest on the strip, but to get better you will have to go to venetian, Caesars, bellagio or the wynn, since all the others are pretty much on par with this one.  but its not bad. it has a tram over to the excalibur (so so so so ghetto) and is close to everything. 

i personally think the best part is the spotlight shooting straight up in the air from the top of the pyramid. that and the cheap beers they bring you while blowing lots of money at the tables (yeah i'm in debt).

To start the inclinators (elevators) are rickety and shabby. The rooms look cool upon first seeing them but upon closer inspection may not be that great. Ours for example had several defects. The bathroom door was damaged by moisture near the floor and there was a big dent in the wall near the entrance. The armoire showed signs of wear and even deterioration from moisture. The shower walls have no place to put your shampoo etc - just a soap holder which the soap always slipped off of. The towels never smell fresh - they either smell over dried or bleached. The halls always had stuff outside of messy people's rooms like bottles and glasses and food trays. There was even broken glass. The hotel cleaning people did not clean up the mess fast at all. Some of the stuff was out in the hall for two to three days! Ugh! Worst of all perhaps was the fact that our room was never really cool - probably due to the side of the hotel we were on and how the sun hits it - but still they did not provide good enough AC to remedy the problem.

The casino area is not that great looking. The lobby is real cool and so is the entrance through the big sphinx. The monorail service is convenient but really slow and it does not always stop at The Luxor. It goes to Excalibur and Mandalay.

Parking is a problem on some nights but they open an overflow lot. The hallway from the lot to the hotel is not air conditioned and it does not have the moving walkways that many Las Vegas hotels have.

 Entertainment wise they have Bodies Exhibition , Chris Angel , Jabawockeez and also Titanic. I saw on their website they often have deals of 2 shows for $75  and 3 attractions for $57 which seems reasonable ( for any Luxor OR Excalibur show). 

This isn't your high class fancy Aria or Cosmo by any means which is why it's not a 4 star -- but I think it's great for the price and you're still on the strip.",4,0,0

Not to mention the cable went completely out the whole day Saturday. Only Lifetime and their own Carrot Top channels worked. We were going to use the ice bucket to put ice in but when I looked inside there was an old used razor blade that wasn't ours. At least when the maids came they disposed of it.. 

Later when we were getting ready in the bathroom, all of a sudden the middle panel under the sink decided to fall out and fall on me, revealing what were probably scorpion remains inside. I nearly puked. 

To top it off, when we got back to the room we started playing music off a Macbook (which isn't very loud) and playing beer pong. 20 minutes later a rent-a-cop knocks on our door and threatens to evict us because he had already been up to our floor multiple times.. I told him I'm sorry but we had just gotten back here and he hadn't visited us prior. He still told me he wanted to evict us. Now we are staying at the PH Towers and it's an upgrade x10000000000.

It got so hot when going to different hotels through the escalators but thankfully each place had a\/c.  The problem I had with this place was that when I got to my room, there was no signal for my iPhone at all. No one in my family got signals at all.  I tried to post up pictures and such but I had to wait to get outside. Seeing that it was hot as hell, about 117 throughout the 4 days I stayed there, I didn't want to go outside. 

It was a fun 4th of July for our family trip so I can't really complain too much. It's an ok place to stay but I wouldn't mind coming back here again.

We arrived at about 5:30pm to check in, hoping we'd miss the crowd, but there was still a small line.  The only advantage of arriving late was they had over booked the Pyramid Deluxe King rooms so we were upgraded to the Tower Luxury Suite, but that meant we didn't get to stay in the pyramid and we were looking forward to that.  The room itself was ok, but not sure if it's worth the $140 a night price tag (not what we paid because we were upgraded, but what they're listing for online).  We had a separate living area and bedroom, but honestly we only use the bedroom.  The room was furnished nicely, but for a suite it certainly wasn't what we expected.

Remember when comparing prices that the price you see online does not include the $32 a night resort fee, which you pay at check in, so the room is not as inexpensive as it appears.

Failed to load my comps correctly and had me wait in buffet line for 1 hour to find out the comp was not correctly loaded. Many machines did not load my mlife players card, so much of my play was unrecorded. Many machines will also not accept comped credits.

Bathroom was aged, but that was not the problem my sheets had brown stains along with pillow cases having make up on them, so I called down to housekeeping and she told me to ask for another room so I did. They move us with in 5 mins I feel better already right? Wrong!! We get to the 2nd room same set up but now our towels ( more than 2) have stains on them. So my BF was extremely mad and ask for completely different room and was willing to pay extra. Here's where they get the 2 stars.

and used one of those special promotions from the Luxor website that gave us $30 credit for free food from their restaurants, 2-for-1 admission to their spa, and 2-for-1 admission to their buffet... not that we ended up using the latter 2 though.  

Our room was clean, decor was not too shabby, and we had a nice view of the pool \/ the mountains. It was on par with our needs (a nice, convenient place to pass out) and our expectations essentially. Sure the casino wasn't very big, and overall the hotel interior wasn't anything impressive, but it had everything we needed for the minimal time spent there rather than exploring the strip. We actually appreciated the fact that it wasn't very big because then we could easily find our way around without getting lost. They had some special event going on downstairs at the pool for Halloween, but we weren't around in the evening to see it. Additionally, we didn't have time to see any of their shows, try the buffet, visit the spa or go to LAX. We simply ate lunch, drank at the bars, and passed out in our room at Luxor then spent most of our time out. 

Goods:
- convenient, free self-parking right next to the pyramid 
- checked in early around 1pm on Friday, not much of a line  
- room \/ bed \/ bathroom were clean
- inclinator elevators were pretty cool
- loved convenience of the aurora bar and a starbucks by the front desk
- couple of the bars are 24 hours so they worked well to start off and end off our long Halloween night on the Strip
- exterior looks nice both day and night
- deuce bus has a stop right in front of the hotel
- tram that goes between luxor, excalibur, and mandalay bay  
- express check-out allowed us to stay a bit longer until we finally rolled out of bed around noon, haha

Really, we didn't find anything dirty, wrong or bad in our experience with  Luxor. Perhaps we were lucky since a bunch of the other reviews seem to think otherwise, but whatever. *shrugs* 

It's a good hotel that I would probably go back to if it were anywhere else... but since it's in Vegas and there's the whole rest of the Strip's hotels to try, I probably won't, haha!",2,1,2

First they gave us a room on the 1st floor, where we had a great view of the taxi stand. The AC didn't work. We immediately complained (it was August, for God's sake) and were sent to a different room on an upper floor. The AC worked about 1% better.

You can head over to other hotels for more variety. Rooms are nice and spacious, and clean. Only thing was shower could have been scrubbed down a bit more, toiletries and towels were low when arrived. There was even a stain on one of the towels makes u wonder if it was even clean ?!!? Ugh. No fridge either. But large room. 

But all together trip was nice and fun. The casino floor is sometimes way to cold. But I believe they do that so you will drink more. Art of the hotel is beautiful of course which is great for pictures. Upstairs didn't have a lot going on heard the club was okay. They sometimes give out passes to ladies. I did get passes for me and Hubs but ended going outside of hotel to party. All in all good stay better then the excalibur which smells like funky and smells of smoke !

From reading the reviews it's not somewhere I would have picked to stay but we went with a group and this is where we ended up. The check in went really smooth. I like the option of being able to check in early, even though there is a small fee to do so. If you don't want to pay that fee you can still check in then wait until 3 to get your room which eliminates the huge lines. We were checked in within 15 minutes including standing in line. We stayed in a pyramid king room, which was plenty big enough and had a small table and two chairs plus an oversized chair. The bed was decent enough and after a day of walking around Vegas it felt great when we finally made it to bed. The bathroom and especially the shower was very nice
I did pretty well in the casino and all of the employees were very friendly and helpful. 
The only negatives I found were the people constantly trying to sell you vacation packages. I don't mind being asked once but geez-you end up just being rude to them by the 10th time they try to get you. The other negative is how far down the strip it is. If you want to go down to Ceasars it's quite a walk.

Since the casino is right below the rooms wreak like smoke.  When we left it was to the point that my lungs were sore, it literally hurt to breathe.  If you are not a smoker I suggest that when you book a room ask to stay in the tower.  

Something else that stood out to me was how freaky the inclinator (angled elevators) felt.  Those things feel completely unstable and shake all the way up.  I thought I was going to die every time I went to my room *yikes*

The cool thing about actually staying in the pyramid is the view, inside and out...pretty neat.  I enjoyed the restaurants and bars as well as the shows.

Unfortunately, the stay was disappointing. We were initially in awe over the enormity of the place. It looked really impressive, both from the outside and inside. 

When I first booked our hotel through Expedia, I requested a room with a nice view. Shouldn't be too tough, right? Mountains, sunrise, sunsets, the pool, the strip... there's a lot to choose from, and really, we aren't picky people. So, we get up to the counter to officially check-in, and I got specific - I requested a room viewing the west, so we could see some nice sunsets. Or at the essence of one, at least. With no words uttered, the woman gave us our room information, keys and a little coupon book, and we trekked through the casino, toward the elevators, and headed to our room. Well, we ended up having an unfortunate view of some air conditioning units, and ductwork. Joy. The rest of the stay was just rough. There was a Wheel of Fortune slot machine outside our room that we could hear clear as day through our door (even three floors up), which was unnervingly annoying. Why the choice was made to put one random machine in the middle of a mostly empty hallway, I'll never truly know. Using up the real estate, I guess. I've also read multiple reviews regarding customers getting free upgrades to Suites and such, and we had no such luck... even after staying there for a whole WEEK. No compensation of anything, no in-room wifi (weak), no coffee pot in room (I could kill a man for some hot tea in the morning), and a ridiculous resort fee of $22.40 per day for extras we never used like the fitness room, incoming faxes (gee thanks, 1993), daily newspaper, etc. I was also a little disappointed with what the actual room provided for us. Usually, when staying at a hotel, they provide you with a book or handout that includes important numbers, hours, directions, room service menus, or channels. I mean, I've gone to places where this thing is a literal novel. Our room had nothing. I'm sure our hotel offered room service, but apparently, I'll never know.

The pool was refreshing though (even if the ""free"" portion of the pool was only 3  1\/2 feet deep... not really used for swimming, but rather wading around). Still lovely on the hot days though. And the drinks served at the pool were awesome, albeit expensive. The beds and pillows were also nice, and housekeeping seemed to be on point (we always saw them busily working from room to room).

When I go on vacation, I like to feel like I'm really getting away and my hotel room is part of the experience. On a day-to-day basis, I'm usually totally focused on keeping my own house clean, organized, and comfortable... it's nice not to worry about it for a little bit. So, when I feel like I'm getting nickel and dimed, or like I'm just one random customer in a sea of others willing to pay ""better"" money, it's disappointing. Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be back...",4,3,3

We didn't purchase early check-in, so we left our luggage at the bell desk. When we came back, we had to wait 15 min for the guy to get our bags out of the room, because he was eating a sandwich. He later explicitly complained about us not tipping him.

The TV reset its volume every night, and lowering it with the remote just made it jump to max, then go down very slowly. Also it was difficult to find real TV channels among all the hotel's self-advertising crap (which includes messages on the room phone)

Security was extremely annoying about having the baby in the casino. We never had the baby near us while playing, and still we got warned.

The restaurants at the Luxor have pretty low ratings on Yelp, so we only tried Backstage Deli, which was quite disappointing.

I decided to try the Luxor as a friend of mine had suggested it.  I had not been here in quite a number of years, and decided it was time to give them a try.  I requested a 3-night stay.

As I check in at the front desk, I was offered an upgrade to a tower suite room for an extra $20, which I thought was a good deal.  This was in the new towers (not the older pyramid) in the existing resort.  I was very anxious to see these new rooms, as this was supposed to be a new renovation the Luxor completed.  The last time I stayed in this hotel was about 6 or 7 years ago, so it looked totally different now.

After check-in and receiving my room key, I had one HELL of a time finding the elevators.  This was bar none, the most confusing arrangement I had ever seen. -- Even other guests were asking ME for directions to THEIR elevators...  Pathetic..  Finally, after asking two casino people, they were able to escort me to the proper elevator.  Now, as they were doing so, I counted 9 (nine) different turns down various passageways.  I was so spun around, I didn't know which way was up after being  brought to the correct elevator door.  This place is like a MAZE unlike anything imaginable...

...Now I finally reach my floor.  After getting off the elevator, I noticed several different hallways going off into different directions...  Yep, you guessed it, NO signs indicating which rooms were down which hall, either...  Well, after some poking around and wasting maybe 5 more minutes trying to find where to go, I finally found my room!

So, I put my key into the door, unlocked, and went inside...  That's when the fun started....

So, what did I see when I opened my hotel room??

There was this old guy sitting on the bed, in his underwear, T-Shirt, holding a TV remote control in his hand, staring me up and down....

The guy, VERY surprised, asked me ""Ummmm?....  Who the HELL are you?!!!""...

I was about to ask the same question...

I was like ""This was supposed to be MY room, sir...""...   The guy told me that him and his wife were not supposed to check out until Friday!....  W-T-F!??

Yep, something was really screwed up, BIG TIME!

I apologized to the guy and told him I would sort it out with the front desk..

So, down the elevators and into the maze I went marching back to the front desk.

I told the Luxor desk clerk what happened.  She just said, ""Oh, sorry, we THOUGHT that room was already vacant""....

Nope, there was an old guy sitting in his underwear watching TV and he was supposed to be there until Friday, I said...

They acted like it wasn't any big deal.  That was until I told them to cancel my reservation and refund my money.  Now, the manager comes over and tells me he would make things right by offering me a ""free upgrade"".

I told him that would not do, as I didn't like the layout of the hotel and had a very funny feeling about the place.  I told the manager that the hotel signage sucked, and the layout and design was beyond bad...  He seemed very disturbed by my comments, and just said, ""OK, then, that's the best we can do""..  Anyway, I had to insist two more times for a refund before they would finally process it.  They were trying like hell to keep me from canceling.

No matter where you stay the rooms are sufficient and the action is never ending. My only gripe was that the pyramid inclinations stop on one side of the pyramid and our rooms was all the way on the other end. We got lost for a while trying to find our room. The pyramid rooms are a tad bit dated compared to the tower rooms but sufficient. This is the perfect hotel for kids because you can walk to the Excalibur next door and take them to the dungeon arcade or you can even walk to Mandalay Bay, MGM and NY NY. The kids love staying here. I am coming back in 2 months foe a bachelor party and have 2 tower suites waiting for us! I can't wait to go back.",0,0,0

I've been in Vegas a number of times, and this trip was by far the best.  Luxor helped make it so.

When we first arrived, we received our keys, hotel information, etc, then proceeded to find our room.  This is when we ran into a little trouble.  We immediately got lost and were searching for a good 45 minutes going back and forth.  We asked the cleaning help and registration desk and got different answers at times.   Finally, we found exactly what elevator to take to the ""correct"" 17th floor  on our guest card that is used to charge things to your room.  So, be sure to refer to that immediately if you have problems locating your room and the elevator you are suppose to take.  Another slightly annoying thing was that you had to insert your room key to use the elevator.  The key reader was often temperamental and eventually our keys would stop working.  We had to exchange your keys two times because of that. Our deluxe room in the pyramid was alright, nothing too fancy but good enough to be reasonably comfortable.  Room service was great, but  it was usually a 30-45 minute wait.  I especially enjoyed the black forest ham cheddar melt and kettle corn chips, so delicious I ordered it twice.  One other bothersome irritating thing that happened during our stay at the room was that our cleaning lady tried to pretend she replaced our bathroom cup.  She put our already used dirty cup back down on top of the paper cover.  A stain could still be obviously seen on the bottom of the glass.  

Overall the hotel at large and what they had available on site was great.  The casino was frequently busy, but not overcrowded.  I was always able to comfortably gamble and not struggle too find a decent table or slot machine to play on.  One thing however I want to mention that is IMPORTANT!!!!, is that they are employees of the Grandview hotel resort hovering around certain areas of the floor.  They have dark navy blue coats with a white name tag that has blue and red logo.  They often ask you if you would like to go see a show and get a great deal on one.  They then bring you over to a table and tell and sign you up for a 5 minute shuttle to a 2 hour presentation that has free food and drinks provided.  You would only have to sit through it to receive your amazing show package deals.  What it really was, a 20 minute shuttle to the Grandview resort processing area in a near empty plaza off the strip, a 6 hour individual one on one sales pressure to buy a timeshare.  It was tolerable, but Ive heard other horror stories, and they do take an incredible amount of vacation time away and sometimes will not take no for an answer.  I would avoid this at all costs and the show deal is not worth the headache.  I did however end up with 2 passes each for Fantasy, Titantic: The Artifact, BODIES, and 50 dollar credit towards food or spa for just 50 bucks alone.  Be weary however, and the timeshare they offer you is usually overpriced with a high financing interest rate.

As far as the entertainment shows, I don't really care for Chris Angel or Carrot Top, as I find them both to be stupid, lame, and possibly overrated.  However, I did enjoy the Fantasy show.  Honestly, it wasn't as erotic or sensual (because of some of the ""pop"" group dance numbers) I thought it was going to be, and the singer they had was amateurish and at times irritating.  Surprisingly, the comedian\/dancer\/impersonator that would come out intermittingly , Shawn Cooper I think his name was, was really good and funny as hell.  

Dinning at the Luxor was good too.  I went to the More buffet for breakfast, which was alright, and it had everything from being able to have a chef make a custom omelet in hot food section to fresh fruit and pastries in the cold food section.  I also ate at the Company, which was next door to the LAX.  It was a mix and match ""social"" American fused cuisine dinning experience.  The prices for the items are reasonable, but portions are somewhat small.  The truth was in flavor, and the items we ordered were extremely delicious and unique.  I recommend the yellowtail sashimi glazed with chili sauce, the tender duck, and slightly fried eggplant.  You also even get complimentary access to the nightclub next door LAX after you dine without waiting in any long lines to get in.

LAX was just an okay nightclub for me.  I didn't really care for the mainstream DJ sets and music they had, there was no where to really set down as all seats\/tables were reserved for VIP, and it gets uncomfortably crowded while making your way through it.

Finally, the exhibition they had, BODIES and Titanic, were amazing and really thought provoking.  It was a very immersive and thought provoking!

My visit had its ups and downs (mostly ups), but overall I had a great time and an excellent experience.  Highly recommended!!",1,0,0

If you're looking for a place to stay on the South end of the Strip, and you get a deal at Luxor (we got $85\/nt, before resort tax, on a huge fight weekend that was also the weekend of 11\/11\/11), go ahead and give it a whirl.

It was extremely easy making a reservation over the phone - the woman was very hospitable and easy to work with. We got a deal because of the off-season where it was buy 2 nights, get one free. The only thing is that they throw in a $5 fee a day for phone usage which we never used but still had to pay for. I guess it's pretty standard these days.

The room was perfect for our needs. 2 queen sized beds, an awesome view of the sphinx and the strip, cool slanted windows, a TV, and a decent sized bathroom. We were barely in here, but it served its purpose. It was clean - when we got here, there were a few glasses that were left outside our room from the previous guests, but all in all, was decent. 

The Luxor had some great restaurants, clubs, shops, etc. It was a little annoying how we were harassed by promoters and sales people the whole time for show tickets...but again, that's the case in any hotel there.

LAX is pretty cool, Aurora, Tender...definitely places to check out. It seemed like there were really new, trendy places in kind of an older hotel.

One thing I was NOT happy about was on our last day when the fire alarms went off at 2 in the morning when we had to leave to catch our plane early that morning. They went off for about 30 minutes non-stop and we were standing there, wondering if we had to evacuate. Some stupid kid had pulled the fire alarm...

The Luxor is at the end of the strip. If you're planning to check out the whole strip and don't want to take a taxi and don't have a car, I wouldn't recommend it. I ended up walking almost 30 miles the whole weekend, trying to get to the other side. By the end, I gave up and taxied everywhere.

SITREP

Every time I visit Vegas, I always find myself here for some reason.  Not that I ever stay in the Hotel.  But the Casino activity, the restaurants, and the clubs always keep me coming back.

The Luxor Pyramid is one of the Strip's most distinctive buildings, so it's fun to pop over and check it out.  The interior décor & architecture inside is just as impressive as the architecture outside.  [I also get a kick going up & down on glass-walled elevators that let you see the entire inside Atrium.

SETUP

The onsiite clubs - LAX Club & Cathouse Boutique - have always been hopping when I've been there for events.  Several of my friends - including DJ Ernan - have done guest spots in the club there.  And it is always cool to get guest-listed, especially in a city that is NOT your hometown!

RESTAURANTS & EATERIES

And the restaurants are always delicious, though these last two times I've always been monopolized for dinner by Luxor's ""T & T - Tacos & Tequila.""  This was an awesome time that I shared with fellow Yelpers Chris & Tkiller.  Such a great time with great food.  [I found the cheese enchiladas to be exceptions, BTW!]

CASINO

Not a huge fan of the Casino set-up.  Very big and impersonal, and the main reason why I can't give a full 5-Star rating in this instance.  I would much rather go over to the Old School area of the North Strip & Old Vegas along Fremont Street and check out the Golden Gate Hotel & Casino.

I got a deal through Mlife rewards that said $39 rooms.  What a deal I thought! until you tack on the fees it came close to $100 a night.  

So I guess it is becoming more common for Vegas to charge for parking now.  Never in my life had I heard of a casino charge for parking.  The point is to get you there and you will spend.  It is not like a concert etc..  I had remembered that a few years ago it was at least free for hotel guests so I went to valet.  They charge for guests now so I had my husband drop me off and had him go to self parking.  After waiting in a huge line to check in the guy tells me it is $10 a day for self park and $15 for valet but since they had a walkway closed that they discounted it to $7\/$10 per day.  Heck for $3 more, it was worth convenience.  However since my husband already went to self, he said I would have to pay both fees if he did not move the car within the hour.  Are you kidding me???  I asked couldn't he just transfer the fee because we planned on leaving the property later that evening.  He said no.  What a major inconvenience!  

So to add insult when we returned to valet that night, the valet did not have us on file.  He said the front desk needed to set that up.  Had to get a manager to fix it but by now already boiling about the whole situation.  I really hate paying for it so tipping on top of it makes it more pricey because I tell you if you don't the valets stand there and stare at you with a discomfort that makes you feel compelled. We did because we came and went often and felt that it affected the level of service we received because we didn't tip at first.  Oh and forgot to add that it does cover other MGM properties so from that respect might be beneficial. 

Getting to the room.  OMG.  First off the elevators sound like nails on a chalk board and shook like crazy.  Had a lady in heels stumble over.  It is that bad!  I posted a video but not sure you get the full effect because it is short.  But damn it is so bad you wonder if you won't get stuck.  Terrible!  And there is only one elevator per floor so of course we were as far as you could be.  It is a 1\/4 mile walk!  

The room is absolutely NO frills.  No water,  fridge, microwave, and toiletries are cheap.  Fine but everything seems old and broken.  The heating\/AC unit is archaic and noisy.  I thought the night desk lamp didn't work but no it was unplugged and the clock had the wrong time.  Another lamp was plugged but the outlet did NOT work.  The other outlets were so Loose that my plugs were about to fall out, No full length mirror.  Shower had only a tiny ledge for soap.  Had to put my stuff on the shower floor.  Great water pressure though.  Fitness center had two broken treadmills.

Within an hour of check in I get a knock on the door from housekeeping to check in on us.  i asked for an extra blanket because the blankets\/sheets here are very cheap and thin.  She said she would drop some off.  Throughout our 3 day stay I never got it.  

Then I need to print our boarding passes.  They don't even do that for free.  It is a dollar per MINUTE with a $5 minimum plus $1 per page printed so it would have cost me $7.  Nuts.  Resort fee doesn't cover that!  It did cover wifi service which was good.  

This is probably technically a 3 star resort but really a 2 star IMO.  I suppose for $100 a night you get what you pay for.  However I did expect a better quality service and the place ought to have working parts.  Broken down stuff is a sign of neglect and insult to injury when they charge so much for everything you wonder where your money is going. 

I would not stay here again.  The beginning just soured me from start to finish.  If you guys only do one thing, REPLACE the elevators! They are a disgrace.   One is so loud and shaky you feel like you are on an amusement park ride.",5,1,2

The room itself had a wine stain on the floor, the bathroom door had water damage, and the furniture was pretty beat up. The television channel selection was pathetic and the signal was terrible. What kind of hotel doesn't even have hbo in 2015? I know, they want me to leave my room and go spend $. Overall Vegas pretty much sucked, I counted the hours until the wedding we were there for was over, and I would finally go home.

One saving grace was the gym there was pretty nice and had some pretty sweet equipment. Also the pool looked pretty cool. I didn't need a sun burn so I didn't go. Also, the internet access was fast enough to stream netflix in light of the terrible television channels.

Would I stay here again? No way. I was more impressed with some of the smaller hotels around Boulder City. In event I ever have to suffer in Vegas, I will opt to rent a car and go there, instead of stay on the strip. It's just a gigantic mall there now anyway, pretty lame.",1,1,1

Check-in was relatively quick on the Sunday morning we arrived, and the desk clerk was friendly.  She gave us a room on the 25th floor in the pyramid.  Getting to and from the room means a ride in the diagonally-moving ""inclinators"" which didn't provide the smoothest of rides, but weren't scary, either, like some seem to think.

The room itself was decently sized, with plenty of space to move around in and store luggage.  Armoire was amply sized with room for both hanging clothes and packing away in drawers, if you're like me and don't like to live out of your suitcase.  Walls and carpet a little worn, but acceptably so.  Television was older, non-flat screen.

The bathroom did not have a tub, just a roomy shower, so if you're the kind who likes to soak, you're out of luck.  Served our needs just fine, though.  One notable thing was that the toilet was pretty noisy when flushed - it was the ""power flush.""  Sure did the job, but everyone on the floor probably knew we were flushing the toilet.

My only real complaint about the room would be about the weird placement of the wired internet.  It's located in the armoire, so you have to run the wire from there to wherever you have your computer.  Unfortunately, the desk is no where nearby, and the cord is not long enough to reach.  Additionally, you have to figure out how to plug the unit into an electrical outlet from the back of the armoire.  They really have to address this.

The casino was great.  A good number of tables always open with a variety of minimums.  During our stay, there were always several $10 blackjack tables, and in the mornings they even had $5 tables.  As usual, dealers ran the gamut, some very personable and talkative, others more like robots who deal cards.  However, even these folks will open up when you start talking.

While not the glitziest place on the Strip, Luxor's still a pretty good place to stay and play.",0,0,0

(Side note: We literally saw 5 or more cars pulled over by highway patrol on the way there, be careful if driving from Southern California)  We arrived around 9pm Saturday, and waited in the line for the valet.  A guy came up to greet us, he was very friendly and told us where to move up to, and he quickly shut down a group of guys who tried to drive in front of us.  gg pwned #1.  After valeting the car, we walked into the lobby, this place looked great.  It was like it's own little bustling metropolis.  Now take this for what its worth, as I have not been to Vegas in over 10 years, so please bear with me.  There were people everywhere!  We went to the check in, where there was no line, and were told that our reservation had been cancelled due to the fact that we didn't check in yesterday.  gg pwned #2. The lady at the check-in line told us they might not even have any rooms left, so she would check for us.  (I found that odd, since on the drive there, I saw a huge electronic sign that said : ROOMS AVAILABLE AT LUXOR!)  So after confirming a room was available, we asked for a refund for Friday evening.  The lady asked the manager who approved so we got the refund for Friday which was cool.  Luckily we were not situated in the pyramid part of the hotel, as I heard rooms in that part feel like you are in an attic due to the cut off corners.  If memory serves me right, we were in the East tower, floor 17.  I must say that the decor inside the room was definitely not the greatest, but for 90 dollars a night I didn't think it was sub par.  I've stayed in 60-70 dollar Best Westerns before, and this room was far better.  They really should get  flat screen TVs as the ones they provided look like they came straight out of a Brady Bunch episode.  Beds were comfortable, no squeaking whatsoever.  We really liked the bathroom, nice glass shower and also the anti fog mirror was great!  I browsed the room service menu, they deliver 24\/7 and will even bring up bottles of alcohol which I thought was awesome.  (However, ended up taking a taxi to a local liquor store and saved about 50 bucks by buying liquor there)  When we checked out, the bill came out to around 125 or so, not sure how that happened since we didn't order anything from the room.

the room served its purpose and I didn't really have any complaints.  Everything was comfortable, and while not overwhelmingly nice, definitely a good place to stay for a night or two while in Vegas.",0,0,0

It was near noisy, very noisy elevators, it was dirty, crumbling and the wall paper was peeling.  I found a fingernail in my beer at the aurora bar. When I told the bartenders, they just looked at me and said, ""Wow, that's gross."" Then they went about their business. I cleaned my straightening iron before I ironed my collar witha small towel.  It had product gunk on it.  I put it on the floor by the door with my other dirty towels.  I go take a shower that night, grab a towel to wash my body and when I open it, it was the gross gunky towel I put on the floor by the door. She took the obviously nasty towel I put on the floor and folded the dirty part on the inside and put it back in the rack!  What if I was checking out? Some other poor fool would have opened that up and probably would have checked out that night (because it looked like feces to be quite honest). I don't think my sheets were regularly changed, as I kept finding my own hair where I slept.  

When we were put in the awful room, she said sorry we're putting you in this room.  She knew it was a terrible room.  I haven't been so disappointed in a hotel stay in years. I went to the desk to ask about the ""resort fee"" and she said no matter what it's nonrefundable.  What about the no pool part, I ask.  Oh well she says, non refundable. I never use a gym. Oh well, non refundable.  What about the fact that I didn't use WiFi or make calls.  Oh well she says, non refundable.  This is no way to treat customers.  

Luxor used to be a name associated with great hotels of Las Vegas.  No more. these guys need to take a hard look at the image they want to put out and what they want people to say about their hotel.

The only negative about the room, was the darkness of the pyramid and being on the opposite side of the strip! I also didn't have internet the entire time I was there, no biggie I'm in VEGAS no need for that! 

I did notice a lot of families at the Luxor compared to other hotels I viewed that weekend, but I like the layout, the design, and the convenience it provided for our group during our stay. 

I would stay here again, but it doesn't have the wow factors of other hotel\/casinos on the strip simply because its older and more established and not as fancy or popular these days.

Decoration is pretty good, but not as impressive as a lot of the other hotels. The pyramid looks cool from the outside, especially at night, but you won't really see it when you walk around on the strip.

We stayed in the west tower. The rooms are better than the pyramid rooms but it's a hike to get to the elevator. The walls are pretty thin, especially toward the hallway. If there are any people talking in the hallway anywhere near your room you'll hear every word. You can hear muffled talking through the walls to the next room, but not as bad as the hallway. The tower rooms have a safe, which was a good size and made us feel better about our stuff being secure.

Compared to other hotels, it doesn't take as long to learn the layout, but it has just as many people bothering you with timeshares and other junk when you try to walk anywhere. The lobby stinks (literally) -- smells much worse than the other hotels.

It can be tricky to get to the strip where you want to go. There's a tram but you have to go north to Excalibur before it'll take you south to Mandalay Bay. It's a pain coming back because you have to go past Luxor to Mandalay Bay to get back. It's most of the way on the south end of the strip so it's a long trek to reach places with shows like Bellagio and Venetian.

Wired internet for some reason. The cable comes out of the entertainment center so you can't even use it at the desk.

Limited dining options. Pretty small number of restaurants (but three Starbucks). Restaurants are probably still cheaper than other hotels. Backstage Deli was alright, lower price than a lot of Vegas food, and pretty good.

I can't complain about the walk to the room because I think it is like that in any hotel in Las Vegas.  I actually thought the walk to my room was short.  I think they need to do some serious renovations here though. The elevators were a little scary not because they moved to the side but the were looking kinda junky and the door was moving apart as we would go between floors.  My room was pretty basic like I mentioned very dated, no coffee pot, refrig.  We had a crappy view of the roof, but when you opened the shades it got warm pretty quick so the shades stayed closed most of the time anyways.  Prices were pretty cheap.

This place has certainly gone downhill.  Or perhaps the flaws remain with the rooms within the pyramid, because about 1 year ago I stayed at a room in the tower and didn't have this experience.  The room was generally very rundown, outdated, dark and dingy.  I would have been more comfortable sleeping in an actual pyramid, curse and all!

In any case, as can be determined from my beginning paragraph, room service was nonexistent.  The room had a card that was supposed to tell me who was servicing it.  The card was left blank.  Smart move, employee.  Touche.

The bathroom sink made a loud gurgling\/dripping sound for about 10-45sec after use.  There was a rust mark on the low-frequency fluorescent light in the bathroom.  Obviously, there had been, or currently is, a water leak on the floor above my room.  Dripping through these yellow-tinged lights that drive a hypnotic headache into your head because you can see them flash like you just set your CRT monitor to a frequency below 60Hz.

And speaking of CRTs, that's what you get for a TV.  Looks like maybe a 24-incher.  Maybe smaller.  Actually, it's probably smaller.  And next to this TV is the internet connection.  Because that's the most convenient place for your internet connection right?  This is wired internet access that requires you to pull a cable from behind the TV and sit on one of the beds to use.  They practically expect you to stand while holding your laptop in order to use this service.

For this service they charge a ""resort fee"" that is added on to your room whether you like it or not.  It also allows you access to the pool, two tiny bottles of Luxor-brand water, and a coupon book that you can't use because the restrictions on practically every deal are so inconvenient.  Example:  $10 off at such-and-such restaurant!  (Fine print:  Between the times of 7:61 and 7:99 on Thursundays only) .

But wait, there's more!  The elevator in my corner of the pyramid was down so in order to get from my room down to the casino or registration floor I had to walk one entire length\/side of the pyramid.  This was on a single-digit floor!  If I was on the top floor I probably wouldn't have minded that walk.  I think this is how the Pharaohs got their slave labor to work.  They put stones in their suitcases and gave them an inconveniently located room number.

If there were no casino and decent restaurants within the confines of this giant pyramid, the hotel experience alone for me would be a 1-star.  Additionally, it is generally more affordable than a lot of other hotels in the area and they have always offered me an extra night (Sunday, obviously) at an extremely reduced rate of $40-50.

It ain't no wonder of the ancient world.  It's more like I wonder if I stay there again.  Unless they renovate, Luxor shall not be my nightly tomb again.",2,9,1

The blanket on our bed had dried white crusty stuff on it (use your imagination as to what this could be!). The pillow cases were stained. The table and chairs had chunks notched in them.

Check in took forever! And beware of the time share people! They attacked us before we even got to the check in line. This hotel also doesn't have a strip view, we asked for one and we put in the West tower and had a view of the parking lot. We complained and were moved to the East tower which had a view of Excalibur, while not super exciting it was much better than the parking lot, and there was no crusty blanket! The info book in the room said the pool was open till 8pm. We dressed and went down about quarter to 5 and the pool was closing, it closes at 5.

We check into the hotel get a room key it's excessively hot and felt like the devil's morning breath in there. I alerted the front desk and let them know that it's excessively hot because they do not have central air conditioning in the room yes a casino that makes over tens and millions of dollars does not have central air conditioning which is essential in the summertime. They then transferred us to another room and that room was hot and he downgraded Us by giving us two queen beds.

After all the efforts and traveling back and forth without any assistance with luggage the third room and add up to be hot as well but we have to go to our concert.

my wife books a spa suite. what a great room. loved it. for the amount of time we spent in it, it was fab. 

the casino was clean and all that worked there were super nice to us. only once were we forgotten in aurora, and once they didn't clean out room, because on that day we were in and out of it all morning.

The first day we arrived, the check-in line was packed, and they only had 4 reps checking guests in. (You can imagine the long wait) By the time it was our turn to check-in, the representative had a very bad attitude problem.  When my boyfriend made the reservations, he spelled his last name correctly.  The rep at Luxor couldn't find our reservation and was not willing to help us find it even though we had a confirmation number and the print out of the reservation in front of him!!! He then looked under all the ""B"" last names and realized that when someone input our information, they spelled my boyfriends name wrong.  

The second incident was when we were ready to go to our room.  The same rep directed us to use inclinator 2 which was on the other side of the casino.  We did so as followed just to realize that our room was directly above the check-in desk which had an elevator next to it.

Third incident was they gave us a room with 2 queen beds.  The same rep during check-in said that's all they had and that we will receive a call the following day to change rooms with 1 bed.  Throughout our 4 day stay at the Luxor, we didn't receive a call from anyone.  

Fourth incident was on our last day.  When we made our reservations for this trip, we had a 8PM check-out special.  We left our room at 12PM to have lunch and to gamble for a bit before heading back to our room to check-out at 4PM.  We arrived back to our room at 2:45PM just to realize that our key no longer worked.  We walked back down to the registration counter and informed the person at the counter.  She activated our room keys so we can get back into the room.  As we were packing, a guest uses his key and opens the room door!!!  Why did they give him a room knowing that we haven't checked out yet?

Clearly, the people who work there don't know what they're doing.  They are rude and very incompetent in the job that they do.

First of all I prepaid the express check-in and express checkout.   Stood in line for 40 mins and finally after 10am got to counter and they proceeded to tell me no rooms available, WTF?  I paid for the express check-in in advance, so had to argue to get room.  

Clearly went over the bill with the front desk and confirmed express check in, express check out and a refrigeration rental (shame you have to rent a fridge as it should be in every room) so then proceed to room.  They put is in a room that was the very last from the elevator, it was a so far of a walk with luggage that I was about to turn around and check out of this hotel, but I had my niece with me and I wanted to make this a fun experience.

The walls on the way to our room were covered in this black eerie black mold stuff and full of dust and cobwebs.   Guess cleaning is not a top priority.  

Then on second day caught the maid next door and asked him for towels and proceeded to get a grilling and had to explain why I needed towels, really!! He was a towel nazis and made me give him the dirty towels before he would give me new one.  Really are you that hard up Luxor for towels?

The pool, while the pool is large, its not very clean.  I would expect to arrive at the pool as soon as it opened to pristine waters but it was murky, clearly an indication that they just don't care and don't. clean pool.

So forward on and try to make the best of a crappy hotel.   The parking is ridiculous here, and again hassle to use valet, I don't care if you are FULL. I'm a hotel guest and you find a parking spot with a smile!  the self parking isn't much better and its not covered.....

Then on the last day, I was to have an express checkout and there was a message on phone when I woke up to remind us check out was 11am again WTF!  I paid for the express checkout.  Called the front desk (after waiting on line 15 mins) and was told there was nothing on my account!  Okay, fine, asked for it and was told it was not available.  Really!!!!

We waited 20 minutes in the MLIFE line to have our problem fixed..AND all i did was use my wife's card, SAME account, different card!

I have stayed at Hampton Inns (associated with the Hilton family brand of hotels) and their rooms are much better than this. 

For a room with 2 queen beds, they should expect at least 2 guests in the room. But they only had soap, shampoo and moisturizers for one person. The decor and vibe in the room was ok but nothing that makes you go wow. Some subtle design hints to go a long with the egyptian theme of the hotel. 

We went with other people who also got rooms at the Luxor. 2 out of the 4 rooms had the A\/C feeling like it was on its last breath. 

A positive was the window from the room had nice views of the surrounding strip, and since its slanted because of the nature of the architecture--its something different.

The elevator is cool since it moves in a slanted orientation, but it definitely feels like they needed to do some maintenance on it. The doors were shaky. Also the elevators are all on one side, so if your room is on the other side, you will have to walk a bit. 

What also set Hilton brand hotels compared to this, was they didn't give free hygiene products like Hilton hotels (hilton, embassy suites, hampton inn, etc). This was a huge bummer, since I was use to Hilton brand giving them out. 

The pool are is nice, with a bar out there serving drinks perfect for sunny days.

But keep in mind, they have a gym at this hotel, but it IS NOT included with your room charge. You have to pay $25 for a DAY PASS for the gym. Not very appealing considering, other hotels include access to their gym at no extra cost. It was a bummer for some of the guys in our party considering we wanted to work out before we went out.

I usually take my kids to the Excalibur but we thought we'd try something new. I rarely write reviews, and this is my first hotel review, but this experience was beyond terrible. I booked the ""Deluxe Tower Premier Suite,"" thinking I'd give my kids a special treat. Firstly, the line to check in took 35 minutes, on a Sunday. Then we got to the suite and it looked NOTHING like the website picture. It looked liked it had not been updated since the 70s. The wallpaper was coming off the wall. The velvet couch had stains. The hall table had damage from drinks apparently. Worst of all, the Luxor website said it 'sleeps 3', but actually only had one bed. I had asked on the phone and when checking in if the couch folds out into a bed. They said yes. They lied. And the website is a lie. We went downstairs to change to a regular room. We had booked for 3 days but decided to cut it a day shorter, due to the rooms. I called within 24 hours notice to tell the front desk we'd leave the next day, and not two days later. They said I could not cancel the third day. I asked to speak to a manager. I explained to ""Damaras Costa"" the problem with the suite, and their website false advertising. Told her we would only stay 2 days, not 3. She became very rude, more rude than any service personnel I've ever experienced. Even after explaining everything very politely to her, she told me she would not let us check out, even with 24 hours notice. Regarding the suite, she told me ""We could have brought a portable cot to the room."" I asked her, ""So you want us to pay $700 for a cot."" Her tone was very rude and condescending. I told her the website is falsely advertising the suite as 3-person occupancy. She didn't believe me. I told her I'd email her the screenshot of the Luxor website, and I did. I then asked her to allow us to check out the next day. She still refused. I asked to speak to her manager. She said ""Just one minute. I want to check on something,"" and put me on hold. I waited for several minutes for Damaras Costa to come back on the phone, but it went dead. Apparently, this is her way of getting rid of customers requesting help. I called back. I again told her we would like to check out the next day, cutting the stay back from 3 days, and didn't want to be charged for a night we wouldn't be there for. I told her the hotel is committing fraud false advertising the suite. She finally said, ""Okay...it's not worth it. We are sold out anyway."" She finally agreed to let us check out the next day. In addition to all this, an iphone charger plugged into a lamp was stolen. The bathroom only had two towels (for a two-queen bed), the iron was broken, there wasn't any 'do not disturb' sign for the door, and the beds were lumpy.

I read another poster saying that you get what you pay for, but I found that for the price you could stay elsewhere with more amenities. 
We went to the breakfast buffet, and I can only say that the food was average at best. What I thought was interesting, was they were doing renovations and they had signs that said amongst other things, please excuse our dust. That is just what I want to see while I am eating, a sign proudly advertising the dust in the restaurant. 
The next time I go to Las Vegas, I will either stay at a more expensive place, or stay off the strip. I will not stay here again. 
On a more positive note, it is somewhat conveniently located and I do like the pyramid shaped building.",1,0,0

The Luxor was not our first choice in hotels during our most recent trip to Vegas, but a wedding we were in was next door at Mandalay and many of the guests were staying at Luxor too. I'm not really picky and let's be honest, how often are you in your room in Vegas anyway? So, we booked a room there through a timeshare tour thing (I'm writing a review for Grandview too- RUN if they try and lure you in with their bullshit. I digress.) and everything seemed ok until we got to Luxor. 

Our room was the biggest piece of shit ever. Again, I'm not really picky and lived in Isla Vista for four years, so it takes a lot to creep me out. But, our sink was backed up and stunk of sewage, our shower was broken, air conditioning didn't work (hot as FUCK in our room), cracks in the wall, paint peeling everywhere..honestly, it was a mess. Plus, the elevator up to our floor was the shakiest thing ever. I seriously prayed for my life everytime I had to go up or down. Hotel management seriously needs to have that thing checked for safety. 

The icing on the cake was when we went to speak with someone about moving rooms. The guy we spoke with (forget his name) was kind of rude. Yes, they moved us to their new tower (if you are forced to stay at Luxor, request a room in the East Tower) but we were not comped or anything- good customer service would have done something nice for us considering I was in a wedding and couldn't shower..

When we got up to our old room to grab our bags and move, our FUCKING DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN! Apparently, they had a plumber there (at 1130 at night, mind you) to work on our sink, but the jackass at the front desk failed to tell us that we could expect him. Also, the plumber wasn't in there when we got in, as he was working on multiple rooms at once. Are you kidding me?? I had thousands of dollars worth of clothes, jewelry and luggage just open for anyone to cruise up and take. 

I am abhorred at how Luxor handled our initial complaints about our unlivable room. But, the lack of communication and the negligence on behalf of the plumber is unacceptable. You have many choices of places to stay when you go to Vegas. I don't care if youre trying to save a buck or what, but I would never recommend anyone to stay here. Worst experience ever.",6,7,0

Huge Sidenote:
**I am not a gambler.  We did our fair share of poking our heads into other casinos: Excalibur and Mandalay Bay are on either side of Luxor , we also stopped into Caesars Palace.  We were only staying for two nights, which was more than enough time to get the feel of the Strip (meh...)

**Excalibur's lobby\/casino looked like a glammed up Knights Inn--super goofy\/campy\/goth\/dark

**Mandalay Bay had a great restaurant that we had lunch at (Border Grill) BUT the entire casino\/lobby\/shopping area SMELLED like someone farted, lit a cigarette and then sprayed Coconut body spray to cover it up!!! How nasty is that?????

-Anyway, unlike Mandalay, Luxor smelled like heaven.  I got very little ashtray funk walking through and whilst playing penny slots

Huge disappointment!!! On all levels! 
The room was nasty! The AC barely worked, it smelled damp and musty and it wasn't even a smirking room. No biggie, we were staying for the night and a lot of my time was spent in the casino. 
When it was shower time the water didn't even I down the drain gross! The sheets nasty and I'm sure they had bed bugs(see pic). Overall the rooms were outdated and just plain old. You can see the dirt on the lamps, night stand etc just gross! We stayed at the pyramid not sure if the other rooms are better but I won't try to find out based on this experience. 
On to the hotel itself. It needs some serious upgrading and why the heck is a pool in Vegas at a major hotel closing at 7 pm? Whack!!! It wasn't the best pool either just average! 
I will say the casino is my fave part because I won. 
The food is shitty at best! The buffet was nasty and cold, the deli overpriced and if you call that a Philly cheesesteak you should be smacked by this native Philadelphian! 
Points in the waffle fries but if you mess that up you certainly have issues! 
I payed 3 times more for this room then the one we stayed at the following evening in the Stratosphere!

I've stayed almost everywhere along the Strip, but have stayed at Luxor the most often (1st time was for 21st Bday & have stayed here half a dozen times since) It's great south Strip location and low rates make it hard not to! 

We upgraded our room this time to a Pyramid Deluxe Suite on the 28th floor. We had two rooms- one with the king sized bed and oversized bath tub that looked over the Strip, and another room with a couch, refrigerator and another flat screen tv. The room was clean and modern with a TON of space- we loved it! The bathroom was a little outdated and crowded but was fine. The fan was broken but not that big of a problem. Maid service was QUICK- we'd leave for breakfast & come back and it was done. Never experienced that in any hotel throughout my travels ever. 

The inclinators (elevators that don't go straight up & down- they go to the side) are in dire need of repair or just to be replaced. They were dirty, dented, scuffed, missing buttons, etc. There were some mornings I was so hungover that I didn't appreciate these inclinators going sideways but other than that no major problems.

There are a lot of food and drink options at Luxor! The buffet was ok- not as good as I remembered in years past. The guy making fresh eggs and omelets was the most popular but there was a very long line. Luxor should definitely make sure there are at least 2 people doing this on busy weekends. We enjoyed Public House- no wait on an NFL Sunday with tons of screens you can see from anywhere you sit. Also, we had a lot of fun sitting, drinking and gambling at Aurora and Centra bar. The staff were really cool to us! Tacos & Tequila is tasty, but expensive. We used a $50 voucher from our MLife MyVegas points at Rice & Company and had a very nice dinner. We actually struggled to use up the $50! 

The location is awesome. A tram will take you between Excalibur & Mandalay, but if you prefer to walk there are great shops and bars along the way. Plus it's pretty close to the airport- just make sure you tell the cab driver ""no tunnel!"" or else they will try to screw you out of a higher fare.

What we didn't like at Luxor: the nonstop sales pitches that accost you at every entrance. We came and went so often they didn't realize they had already pitched us & we'd have to decline again. Just annoying. 

Other than that we had a great experience and it was inexpensive for us. I would stay at Luxor again- in fact, just writing this makes me miss Vegas!",5,1,1

It includes wifi, a newspaper, and a telephone in your room. A total rip off. People checking in were furious about this and the hotel will not budge. If you don't pay it they cancel your reservation. Well, the Wifi signal was weak, I never got a newspaper, and I have this thing called a cell phone so didn't need a room phone. I don't know how they can legally do this its a total scam.

The elevators were totally ghetto. Walls grafitiied, buttons smashed in, mirrors broken. Looked horrible.

Nothing but attitude and crappy drinks at those places.

This pyramid could use an upgrade as far as : staff, decor, and accessibility.  Way over due!!  

Oooohhh the last thing I must say, is avoid all the people in black suits with nametags asking ""Where are you from?"", or ""Do you want to see a free show?""

At least they still have the store where you can buy Egyptian items, I spent a lot of money there. :)

My Husband and I thought we were staying in Vegas, where everything is open late but apparently at the Luxor this is not the case. After going to their very disappointing LAX club we were hungry. It was like 2am and almost nothing was open! That is unacceptable in my eyes. I live in a smaller city (not by choice) and things here are open later! The only place to get late night food was the back stage, which was decent or McDonald's and I'm in Vegas-I refuse to go to McDonalds! I can get that anywhere else. I work at a hotel and thought the very idea of the pool closing at 7pm absolutely insane! who wants to go to a hot tub in Vegas at 2 in the afternoon?! you would roast to death. We just wanted to relax in the hot tub later in the day and we couldn't. We thought the front desk guy was joking when he said it closed at 7pm. 

Criss angel show is the worst thing ever, do not go see it! It was a waste of money. 

I can't complain about the price we paid because we had a really good deal. I had a group of people with me because it was my birthday but I feel bad because I picked this place and it went downhill a lot since I was here last. People are complaining about the resort fee, but that's normal. And they have it stated on their site and it says it again in the email they send you with the confirmation number.

The one thing that we loved was the fact that you could pay $15 and use the spa area (this includes indoor hot tub, sauna, steam room, locker, shower) it was pretty amazing. My husband and I did it twice because it was so convenient and relaxing.

I still love this place despite all the issues because it is still Egyptian some what and it holds a lot of memories for me, they just need an update. They sent me an email asking how my stay was after we returned from our trip & I responded basically the same as I typed above and still have yet to heard back from anyone. You think since we had issues they would of at least made an attempt.",0,0,0

I have been thru the Luxor previously, and had even briefly (uh-hum) seen the inside of one of their Pyramid Rooms until last week, when I actually stayed in one.  I will say that the rooms are ""cool"", with their sloping windows, huge atrium (that you walked across to get to\/from the ""inclinators"" which are now just called ""elevators"").  My room had a view over the pool area, a comfortable bed, an older style wall a\/c unit that kept my room comfortable, and a shower but no bathtub.  The shower was nice and big, but the bottles of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel kept sliding off the soap dish onto the floor, so I ended up just leaving them on the floor!

All in all, I was satisfied with my room, even without a refridgerator in it!  However, in the morning, I was awaked to the sound of hammering and sawing taking place, apparently a couple of floors above the room I was staying in (on the 13th floor).  The construction noise persisted, so I called the front desk who were very accommodating and arranged for me to move to one of their tower rooms.  The tower room was great, had an awesome view of the Excaliber Hotel next door (I felt like I was living in a fairytale)!  I really liked how the Luxor is connected to Mandalay Bay to the South, and to Excaliber to the North, with moving walkways and various shops\/restaurants\/bars all along the way.  I got plenty of cardio in, and got to sample some alcohol at Minus 5, and some Krispy Kreme doughnuts an the food court area of Excalibur.  What shocked me the most was seeing the lines of people at McDonalds (in the Luxor & Excalibur)!  Really people, you go to Vegas and line up to eat at McDonalds???

Anyway, the Luxor is a cool hotel, true it's not the newest hotel on the strip, but they are renovating the rooms in the Pyramid, and my room in the West Tower was great.  Only odd thing, the bathroom had a jacuzzi tub (which I was excited to try out), but I discovered that the hotel had disabled all of the jacuzzi tubs in the resort.  Nobody would tell me why, I'm guessing the reason might be ""shocking""!",0,0,0

Good:
+ Great price
+ Fun Egyptian-like inside design
+ They have the Titanic and Bodies exhibit
+ Good basic food court
+ Rooms in the pyramid, not tower, have a huge hot tub near the windows
+ Part of Mlife, so you can taking a parking pass with you to park for free at other Mlife casinos.

What could be better:
- We booked a non-smoking room. Arrived to our room and it smelled like a dozen smokers lived there for a week. When we called the front desk they were EXTREMELY unhelpful and basically said we can down grade you to an available room or you deal with it. After making a significant amount of noise and escalating to Management, a good compromise was met and they were very accommodating. The Lead that initially took our call was so unprofessional and I hope she retires from the hospitality industry.
- Rooms are a bit outdated
- Pool hours are odd. Only one of two pools are open until noon, then they open the second.
- Not enough pool side chairs. People were fighting over chairs. Impossible to tell who is using them versus just left their towel on the chairs.

Overall, its okay at Luxor. Had it not been for the Lead giving me a hard time about the room smelling like smoke, I would have likely given them a high score.",16,11,13

These rooms look like a nightmare. Furniture needs to be thrown out. Looks like a bad version of a Super 8 motel. So at this point ready to leave go downstairs to check back out and front desk manager sends us to West Tower.  It's like a different world and hotel. Better but I expected more from an MGM hotel. We stayed but next morning housekeeping knocks on door about 8:30 to see if we are in the room. My irritation came when she came back at 10:30 am and told us we had 30 min before check out. When we responded to her yelling thru the door that we would leave at 11 she stated she would check back later. But when we opened the door at  10:58... The housekeeper was standing at the door.

So I called at 7am and the receptionist told me it would be $260!!!! So I kindly told him what we were told and he said we would have to go down to talk to the manager.

The A\/C in my room didn't work so we had to switch rooms. We did have new mattresses this trip compared with last year when our beds were terrible. 

- There is also the disingenuous, mandatory ""resort fee"" added to every bill

- Which was also irritating because it said that included the Internet, but there was no wireless Internet, only a cable\/wired connection, and of course it didn't work in my room the first time, but did the second room.

The GOOD:
Staff was generally helpful and pleasant, including the front desk, security, pool staff, and casino employees. Rooms can be found for fairly cheap.

The casino is rather sparsely populated, and the poker dealers speak constantly about how bored they are and how desperate they are for people to sit down and play. On the upside, this lead to them promoting games with splash pools (the house throws in $25-75 when the flop is a straight, flush, or straight flush). They offer free craps, roulette, and blackjack lessons, and the relaxed and empty game room means that beginners, as well as those simply looking to gamble without much pressure, will find this great place to play.

The BAD:
The building is old, and it shows. The river ride that used to exist is now gone, and no complimentary experiences come with your stay. The ""resort fee"" is tacked on only as you finish booking with the hotel, so the cost is really about 15 dollars more per night than advertised. As a result, customers are given ""FREE!"" internet, available only through a single wired connection in the room. The connection speed is decent enough for streaming videos, at least.

The elevators are finicky, with buttons that don't seem to respond and card readers that require more precision with swiping than NASA does with docking at the ISS. The ride is also a bit unnerving for those who have trouble with motion sickness, as they move at strange rates, traveling at a sideways angle (to scale the pyramid's walls).

The rooms are not terribly clean. The towels had stains on them, and there were plastic ties on the floor, as well as a bottle cap by the night stand. The nice thing is that the cleaning staff clearly doesn't want to do its job, so if you leave your stuff strewn all over your room and place a privacy sign on the door, you can be sure that your stuff will remain totally undisturbed by any hotel staff.

The rooms also lack basic amenities, such as coffee makers, and some of what is provided is old and in need of replacement. The hair dryers, for instance, immediately emit a burning smell.

The Luxor has very little to offer. It is a dying hotel that is at the ""lesser"" end of The Strip. However, for cheap rates on rooms and (relatively speaking) on the buffets, the Luxor's lack-luster offering may be just what you are looking for if you want a quiet, unintimidating home base for your stay in Vegas. It is connected to the Excalibur, which has more offerings for children (carnival games and such). Its location at the end of The Strip makes it easy to access and out of the way of all of the intense city traffic that begins just past the hotel.

That said, these benefits come at the price of being located far away from the excitement of the rest of The Strip, so you'll need to plan on a long walk if you intend to get to see any of the other hotels, and it's about  miles if you plan on going down towards the busier end of The Strip.

Also, the beam is very overrated and unimpressive. Most spotlights are more to look at than the Luxor's beam.",2,0,0

I had originally stayed here back 2010ish and thought the bad-average reviews were harsh based on my last experience. However I can see why more recent reviews were so low. 

Off the top I got to say , if you plan on staying here, GET THE TOWER ROOMS. I got to experience both the tower rooms....and the pyramid rooms. Tower rooms were much nicer and better maintained. Also the elevator system in the pyramid rooms are so weird....cool gimmick (goes up at a 40 degree angle) but not a cool gimmick when people have been drinking and throw up in your elevator....eek

also it seems like this hotel is in need of some refurbishing as the doors on the bathroom were peeling bad and a lot of things like the carpet looked like they needed a good cleaning. 

the hotel is nice and so are all of the amenities like the gym (which I used 3 times) but there's definitely a need to clean this hotel up and maybe bump up the pricing to steer away the grundgy people that seem to ascend here and mess it up. such a shame because I really liked this hotel more a few years ago.",4,0,0

It's a big hotel. All the hotels on the strip are big, so of course the experiences will vary for each person. I thought this was a decent place to stay. It was my first time in Vegas, so I wasn't looking for a high end place to stay at since I knew I'd be out and about most of the day. 

The service here from the staff at the registration\/check out desk was quick and friendly. The maids that cleaned the rooms were also very nice. I would always see them on the way out in the mornings, and they would always make an effort to say good morning and ask how we were doing. I've never had maids ask that at any hotel I've ever stayed at, so it was nice. 

Room was a good size. Bed was a bit uncomfortable, but I have scoliosis. So everything is uncomfortable to me. The room we had included a shower and a bathtub. (Go to the LUSH store in Mandalay Bay and get a bath bomb to use and soak at night. It'll relax the sore leg muscles from so much walking, and it'll moisturize the dry skin from the -20% humidity that Vegas has!).

Though the parking lot was a long ways away, we didn't use the car very much because there was no need. Luxor has free trams and is within walking distance of some hotspots on the strip. We stayed in a Tower Deluxe room with 2 queen beds and overlooked the pool area. LOVED IT! It was clean, beds were comfy, bathroom had a sep. tub and shower which was great for me(my two kids used the bathtub and i used the shower).

The price was reasonable for a holiday weekend through Mlife.com.  Overall, it was just OK.  Rooms are on par with Monte Carlo, but not as nice as MGM Grand or Aria.  You can get from Excalibur and Mandalay Bay via a monorail or through an enclosed mall\/walkway which makes things convenient.  A few details:

My ""run of house"" rate landed me in a double queen pyramid room.  The beds were good and the bathrooms had been redone since the last time I stayed.  There is no tub, just a walk-in shower which is fine with me.  The slanted wall makes the room layout a bit awkward and makes the drapes hard to open and close. There was a little bit of wear and tear on paint and furniture.  They are in the early stages of a refresh of the rooms, though at this point, there is an up-charge for the better rooms.  

The pool was just OK.  There is plenty of room on the pool deck, but it is just a big concrete area.  It is not as nice as the pools at Aria, MGM Grand or Monte Carlo.  They did have a couple of bars and waitresses running drinks.  

The casino is fun.  They had lots of tables and you could find blackjack and craps for $10 a hand.  This was a pleasant surprise on a holiday weekend.  The dealers were all friendly and engaging.  

My biggest problem is parking.  If you didn't know, most hotels in Vegas have started charging for self-parking.  However, at MGM properties if you have higher status in the Mlife program, they comp the parking fee.  While I appreciate this, I had all sorts of problems getting this to work properly.  Once while leaving, my card didn't work. When I returned, worked to let me in, but then later it didn't work and they said it was ""deactivated"".  I needed to spend 15 minutes in line to work that out.  Another issue was upon returning to the hotel from golf around 3:00 pm on Saturday, there were signs saying the lot was full!  The attendant said I could park at any other MGM property.  Nothing like a half-mile walk to whet your appetite.  I eventually found parking on the top floor of their structure.  Bottom line, be aware on busy weekends that if you find a spot, keep it. 

Overall, the Luxor met my expectations.  The room was OK. The fun casino offsets the parking hassles for me.  Three stars.",0,0,0

The price wasn't bad for the weekend, but the rooms (including the suite) felt like a holiday inn. Luxor also doesn't really have a lot of options for restaurants, the pool was junky, and the buffet was overpriced and generic. Overall though you have to take it for what it is.

I have stayed at the Luxor once before in my younger years and I thoroughly enjoyed it and a lot of my long-lasting Vegas memories are here.

During our most recent trip to Vegas we did visit the Luxor again. Not to stay but explored everything within to make all those memories come rushing back. Took an elevator up to the room floors to see out onto the concourse (a must do for anyone visiting)

We visited, and yes, deposited some money into the casino which is nicely tucked underneath the exciting main floor that the rooms overlook. The waitresses in the Luxor are great to serve drinks while playing. They have plenty of fun games to lose your cash to and did we ever.

We also came to eat breakfast at ""More"" the buffet at Luxor with another two for one pass from MyVegas and the MLife app they have created. (That review to follow)

But my girlfriend and I agree, Luxor is and probably always will be one of the most exciting looking buildings in Las Vegas.",3,0,0

The room is rather basic. A bed, flat screen TV, bathroom. No WOW factor at all. The room had this wet\/moldy feel to it...Imagine if you left the hot water running in the shower for hours and the room got all misty\/damp like...well that's what the room felt like.

The hotel itself houses many good food options from sit down places like Tacos & Tequila to fast food joints like McDonald's and numerous Starbucks (yes in the same hotel).
The negative that we encountered about the room was that it never got cold enough; I like my environments frigid and this one never got better than cool.

We chose a room in the pyramid because i thought ""HOW COOL! SLANTED WALLS!"". It was...eh. View of the parking garage. Second floor. Not really anything to write home about. If given the choice, choose the towers. I hear the rooms are bigger and you get a better view.

That being said....As hotels are, this one wasn't that bad. It is clearly older but that isn't too big of an issue as we didn't stay in the hotel room long. Out having fun! The room was a non smoking but when the bathroom fan was on, the room filled with cigarette smell which was a huge turnoff for me.

The hotel main lobby\/casino was CONFUSING to leave. We couldn't get out. and when we did get out, we weren't on the side we wanted to be on! The signs point out INTERNAL things but none of them point out EXITS!

On our second day, we discovered a tram that went between Excalibur, Mandalay, and Luxor. It was a little confusing to navigate but it was good not to have to walk. It is right out front of the pyramid on the other side of the taxi and drop off area.

As far as the pool is concerned, it was average. Nothing amazing to write home about. But it was big. we rented some cushioned chairs and it was well worth it since it was a private area. Cabanas seem like a great deal for a larger group.

We checked out the spa. I had never been to a spa so nothing to compare it to. It is separated by gender. Male side had a Sauna, Steam room, Hot Tub, Cold Plunge, showers, lounge area, and lockers. If you stay at the hotel it's only $15 and well worth it. I had been having back issues so the hot tub was PERFECT! By the way, it is clothing optional so don't be surprised by the rogue naked old man or feel free to join him.

I would stay here again. We got a great deal on Hotwire and it was ON the strip which was a perk. It may be old but you're literally on the strip and its Vegas so your not sleeping anyhow! Staff was great and helpful.",0,0,0

Check in was great, very nice young lady, I checked in way before the allowed check--in time and the front desk attendant was very kind and helped me out, I was very appreciative.

Were talking Las Vegas at world class Hotel Casino? after reviewing the Room service menu I also noticed they only serve from 6:00a to 2:00p, after that you're forced to go down stairs find a 24hr café or wherever you can find something.

The food court is great for breakfast at reasonable prices and done fairly quickly. If you're on a meal break here at the LUXOR in the Business Center, you know what an issue it can be to get a quick meal anywhere on the LV Strip.

Second impression is the inclinator. It is dirty and has not been seen any maintnence in at least a decade! Nasty brass walls, broken tiles, and the floor numbers have fallen off and been written in with a Sharpie marker. They are also slow and very noisy\/shaky. 

The room... we stayed here because the website made it appear that they had upgraded their rooms. Nope just threw out the bed spreads and replaced it with a sheet. That's all. Same gross wall paper, old abused furniture, and a now a bizarre painting that doesn't match the theme. The worst part was staying during 100 degree heat and not having a great A\/C unit.

We usually stay in the middle of the strip at a Harrah's property, but we will be glad to stay the Luxor again! Great pool, quick  check in, great Aurora martinis at the bar downstairs and T&T restaurant was also fun. The Bodies exhibit is neat too! 

 The staff was very accommodating and hands -off which we like, with very little sales pitches from the usual timeshare people who hang around. There's a 24 hour sundry shop and a Starbucks in the lobby, which is nice on vacation. Also, the (gross) Excalibur has a food court + some little shops connected to the Luxor.

Our plan had always been to bring our kids there for their 21st. Being a widowed mom I never could have afforded it. So my daughter booked us for the Luxor as she knew her dad would have done. And again I had a great time. Not the same Vegas I remember from 97. The free shuttle out front if very convenient. Also the bus stops right out front if you travel out on the strip.

They stop you and offer you a fantastic price on show tickets. Only then to tell you that you have to attend a time share. No place for it in a hotel you pay 200+ a night to stay in. I feel you should be free from that during your stay. Another sour spot for me was the LAX nightclub recruiter. He was relentless. Every time we passed him he was trying to get us to go into the nightclub. My daughter turning 21 had already drank quite enough. He saw I was having a hard time redirecting her. Yet he would not stop. When I told him she had drank her share already and needed to sober up, her persisted that she was fine as she had me with her. With her drinking it caused quite the conflict between my daughter and I. A real vacation spoiler.  Another issue is the rooms really need to have a coffee pot. This is HUGE with me. I also think the elevators need more attention from the housekeeping. We used the 2b elevators during our stay. And there is funk running down the wall. Very dirty in there.

We had a Luxury Spa Suite on the 30th floor, and although they are no longer running 'Jets' on the Spa.. 

The room was pretty comfortable, albeit smaller than expected, and the bed was pretty comfy.  The lighting is relatively dark, but not too bad, but OMG the view that we had of Mandalay Bay and the valley behind it was absolutely stunning.  The staff wasn't rude like most reviewers say they are.  We were checked in relatively quick, and when I had a concern that I brought to the M-Life desk, which was the wrong desk by the way, the guy was nice enough to help me anyways.   The elevators are scary.. but in a fun way.  I loved how one of them kept opening on the 29th floor for no reason what so ever.. maybe a ghost?

The pool was fun, live DJs, plenty of sitting space to lounge out on the chairs, the pools were only 3 feet deep which I think is stupid, but I guess they're looking out for lawsuits or drownings.. but cmon... 3 feet deep?  Why even have life guards, who the heck is going to drown in those pools?  Midgets?  

The pool bar was cool, the guy at the pool bar got me the bucket-o-beer and was telling me some funny stuff about the week prior when they had the flash flood how everyone went flying out of the pool and back into the building the second 3 rain drops hit the floor.

The gaming area is definitely laid out cool, and the tables are right near the front of the casino instead of waaaay in the back surrounded by freaking slot machines, and I like that.   What I didn't like about the gaming area is that you have more of a chance of winning the lottery than making even .50 cents at this casino.  Their payouts sucked the big one, just take my word on that one.

All in all, it was a fun trip and the Luxor is a place you should stay if you get a middle to higher end room.  Would I return?  Sure... just not any time soon... Next time its the Bellagio or something a little more classy.",0,0,1

I had stayed here twice in the past. Once 15 years ago when I was easily impressed, and another time which gave me the impression that the Luxor was going down hill. 

I wouldn't of stayed here again, but thanks to Mlife the promo package offer was too good to resist. We were already in Vegas, and by this point we probably should of been heading home, but my husbands ""lost"" passport ( see Mandalay Bay review ) was preventing us from doing so. 

We were dropped off downstairs. This was not the main lobby, but we discovered the Mlife platinum lounge here. We were able to check in and grab some free drinks and snacks. The guy who helped us was awesome. He upgraded our complimentary stay to a Tower suite, and gave us our resort credits for food, drinks and entertainment. 

Our suite was really big ! Hallway leading to living room, a separate dining room and bar area, the king bedroom and really large bathroom. (See pics ) 

We had a prefect view of Excalibur from both windows in living room and bedroom. The only thing that was a downer, was the colours which were that awful yellow shade. 

The resort itself was ok. 
Pros
-Lots of entertainment if that's your thing (Chris Angel, Carrot top, Bodies, Blue man group, Titanic ect.

-Cool Egyptian theme 

-Tacos & Tequila cantina always great Mexican food ( see review) 

Cons
-Every time you stepped out of your room, you were asked if you would be in town the following evening ( some sort of time share ploy - just say no! ) 

-Prices in retail shops - beyond ridiculous!  

-Only one late night 24 hour food place 

-Regular rooms are shoeboxes 

-Casino -Security rudely shook me down for ID - I am pretty sure he thought i was an Escort working the casino ( no -  I am an invited platinum level guest here with my husband ) 

-Hair salon - my husband was quoted one price for a service for me - then when I called to make the appointment, they claimed they didn't speak to anyone that day and the price was now 3 x what he was quoted! 

All in all if it wasn't for the free rooms and the large dollar resort credit, I would of been skipping this place for sure.",10,3,5

The front desk was also very accomodating  to all my requests, the line was long but quick, so its ok.  The Mlife booth reps are also nice and they gave me a luxor pyramid keychain, so cute abd useful cuz it lights up.

1) when we first walked into the room it smelt so much like weed. It was as if the housekeepers never came in and tried to get rid of the smell.
2) the ac did not work. I mean it kind of did but with this Vegas heat you want to cool off in you room but you can't because there was barely any air coming through.
3) the elevators never worked! We always had to wait in a line to take the elevators up because though there were four elevators only two worked.

Stayed here for my first time in Vegas. I must say I had a good experience here. We checked in about 1 in the morn and only waited 15 mins with a free upgrade. I was gonna try the sandwich trick where u slide a 20 between your cc and id and ask for a comp upgrade, but before I could ask the lady gave it to us :) I kept my 20 lol 
We got a players king deluxe room in the east tower. We wanted to stay in the pyramid but can't complain. Our upgrade came with a cal king bed, love seat, and a jetted bath tub. It did smell like weed at first but didn't bother us. Hmmm maybe that's why we were always hungry lol. 
For less than 100 bucks a night including taxes and fees we got a great room, and if the gf was ok with it. PERFECT :)

The casino is large and offers most of the games you'd find in your standard casino (3-card, 4-card, blackjack, let-it-ride, craps, baccarat, roulette, etc.) with pretty low minimums. As the floor fills the minimums may creep up a little but you can still play fairly cheap here. They do offer a poker room with limited action so be sure to swing by and see if they have a game you'd like to play. They also offer a great range of slot machines and video poker\/keno with decent payouts. Make sure to check those machines before you start pumping money into them.

There are a great selection of restaurants here, ranging from high- end to more casual. Be ready to dish out some serious bucks here, but I mean, it is Vegas. They have plenty of options with a decent buffet. They did have the split crab legs which are always a win in my books but their prime rib was a little over done. That's a big no-no. Be sure to look around and find just what you're looking for. Don't expect too much and not too much bang for your buck.

The hotel room was much more than I had expected. The rooms are a little cheaper than other places along the Strip and as long as you're not there during a holiday or event, you should be able to get a pretty cheap room. They did mention that it was a newly renovated room and there was plenty of room. The bathroom had a few tiles that looked a little shaky but everything worked and it was clean. There was a lot of furniture in there but it didn't seem cluttered. I enjoyed all the space and the bed was big and comfy. Try to get one of the views of the mountains so you can escape the Strip for a little bit.

The service was great and everyone I met there was polite and helpful. I am just not a big fan of those people trying to sell you something or show you timeshare presentations. Yeah, I'm 25, so what? I don't want to come to your 8 hour presentation for a couple show tickets. I'm on vacation. Just let me be.

10.01.2017

- Security rapidly evacuates all guest and employees to safe locations.  A situation so critical it's ""drop everything, don't worry about casino assets"" and evacuate.  Possible active shooters in the casino.

- A second evacuation.  A bomb threat now on Luxor.  Security rapidly but calmly evacuates the theater where we were OUTSIDE behind Luxor.  I'm not going to go into the scariest 30 minutes of my life that followed.  Suffice it to say we eventually made it from under a truck to the ""refugee camp"" in the casino underground.

- Flustered, dazed, but sympathetic employees pass out pillows, blankets, comforters, towels, fresh baked cookies, pastries, and cell phone chargers to the many crying, scared people huddled together.  Hundreds of cases of bottled water are brought in.  Smoking areas rapidly designated,  Industrial fans to help cool the tunnels until the all clear many hours later.


The days after:

- A housekeeper as I leave my room; ""thank God you're alright.  All my guest were accounted for but you"" as she gives me a hug.

- The chef for Tender at the end of the night; handshake forgotten replaced by a tight hug.  He's let some of his staff go for the night because they were too shaken up.  Another tight embrace before he's off to hear another employees story and offer a hug.

- Tender's manager coming over to listen to what happened.  Legit concern on his face and a hint of  guilt in his voice for not being there with us when it all went down.  He insist on sharing a drink.

- Bartender from Tender and a friend more than willing to ""grab a drink"" and commiserate about the night before and during the evening, buying two Metro cops dinner and thanking them for their service.

- Bartenders at Playbar all encouraging our group of gathered employees to share experiences and emotions, cathartic.  Drinks flow with little regard for ""must play for comped drinks"".

-  Smiling employees throughout being welcoming, asking if people needed help with directions just to engage and comfort.

Perhaps this is all just the human condition to care for our fellow man but IMHO Luxor has gone above and beyond to hire people who legitimately care.

PS - To those who took advantage of the situation, cashing out slot credits, stealing gaming checks, alcohol from bars, food, and even cash from the evacuated casino, good luck sleeping at night.


Oh, the ""Review"" - 

Since the day they opened in 1993, I've spend at least a year of my life at Luxor.  

Luxor, a middle class property that provides ""best value in Vegas"" resort experience (meaning, this is a themed, mega resort with over 4,400 rooms ranging from 420 sq ft in a pyramid to 2,000 sq ft suites on the top floors of the towers, a 120,000 sq ft casino, multiple pools, spa, shows and restaurants.  Value?  Top suites can be had for $225\/nt.  

Although renovated many times, suites currently show their age with some scuffs on furniture, wear on the carpeting, brass fixtures that can use more polish but relatively clean (some dust under the coffee tables) with very comfortable beds and business traveler amenities (coffee maker, energy bars, mini fridge).  Common areas well kept.  Relatively clean restrooms throughout.  Elevators could use some refurbishment.   Dual lobbies, convent valet, on site car rental, easy access self parking garage, dual taxi stands and easy access to ride share stands.   All told, it's as good as to a little better than any good Hilton or Hyatt standard property.

I stayed in one of the pyramid rooms and it really was not too bad. The rooms was clean for the most part but the vent in the bathroom could of used a vaccuming. A lot of lint in there. Stall shower that wasnt bad. The drain right in the middle of the shower was a pain to step on though. The bed wasnt the most comfortable but I'm used to a pretty soft bed and it took some adjustment to get used to. The $15 for internet access is pathetic but it seems that is the norm in Vegas. Really how much would hurt these casinos to offer free wi-fi? The tv was just a basic one with pretty basic channels offered. I dont go to Vegas to stay in the room and watch tv anyways. The inclinators that you take to get up to the rooms is pretty strange at first. Its pretty funny looking at the peoples faces when they ride them the first time thinking its an elevator. Feels weird going at an incline. A big downer was the walk from the inclinator to the room. My room was at the front part of the pyramid with a view of the strip\/airport so I had to walk half the perimeter of the building to get to my room.
They have a food court but the options pretty much suck. A way overpriced Nathans hot dogs, a McDonalds, frozen yogurt type place, Little Caesars pizza, and a WAYYYY overpriced Quiznos. There are 3 Starbucks that I saw. Talk about overkill! 
Near the food court is one of those booths that they have all over the strip where you stand in front of a green screen and they videotape you, then add stuff to make it look like you are on a magic carpet or whatever cheesy thing you want. The girl working there SCREAMS directions to the people being taped. It was REALLY late and we were trying to sleep but could hear her annoying voice all the way through our door. And my room was all the way on the 17th floor!! Someone needs to shut her up.
The Luxor is all the way at one end of the strip so to get to the more interesting parts of the strip be prepared to do some walking. They do have a free monorail that connects the Luxor with Mandalay Bay and Excalibur that sames a lot of walking but of course it was broke down. From what  I could tell, it hasnt been working for a quite a while. That meant having to walk through the maze of Excalibur to get over to New York, New York.
I'm used to getting some kind of coupons\/freebies when checking into casinos. At check-in at the Luxor I got room keys and directions to the inclinator. Thats it! Really pathetic considering the economy and how the casinos are trying to compete for customers. I turned down a totally free room at the Tropicana with no strings attached to pay to stay at the Luxor. If I had to do it all over again, I would have just stayed at the outdated Tropicana or paid more to stay at a more convenient location near the heart of the strip. Oh well. You live and learn I suppose.

The bathroom was nice and spacious and there were separate tub and showers.

The buffet....it was so clean that you could eat off the floor and everybody was so nice and polite. :-) The food...it was really pretty good I was happy and I felt like I got my monies worth. The rooms...they need a little work. I had a room with dirty Windows and the ceiling had a big water stain but overall it was pretty clean. The casino was spot on!! It was the very first time I went to Vegas and actually doubled my money. Yup I came home with more money then what I came with.,0,0,0

The closest I got was Circus Circus at the other end of the Strip. Lo and behold, there was a Groupon deal advertising $33 prices per night. The advertised rate was misleading. I looked at the calendar and many weekends (Fri-Sun) were upwards of $200\/day. I saw that the beginning of September (1-3) was available near the advertised price so I took the bait. I made reservations for 3 weekday nights after consulting with my man who had wanted to go for over a year. The die was cast! I was then unpleasantly surprised to learn they charge $25 per night for resort fees (FINE PRINT). Damn, that nearly doubled the advertised price and I was no longer happy. i thought it would be close to $100 for three days, but it ended up being just over $200. 

We drove early in the morning from LA (4:30 in the morning). The drive was only bad because the sun rose and made it difficult to see the road (DANGEROUS). We arrived around 9 am. We went to eat and found a way to waste time (we were suckered into going to the Jockey's timeshare presentation and let me tell you those people were not pleased when we said N-O 5 times). 

After wasting several hours, we headed to the Luxor, which is still quite the looker on the outside. We found the guest parking lot and were given a hard time by the parking attendant-this is the only hotel that hounds people parking in their ""self-park"" lot (I visited the Mirage, Bellagio, Wynn, Planet Hollywood, LINQ).

We waited in the food court and decided to grab some fries because we did not want to pay more money for checking in early. We make our way to the check-in at 3 pm. The line is somewhat filled (half), but there were a lot of workers. We get a lady who has no clue; she was curt and did not give us information or inform us about our  $20 credit\/coupon. 

We were given a room in the PYRAMID on the 22nd floor! The view was amazing. We were facing the pool area. The room itself was basic, somewhat following the Egyptian theme with hieroglyphic painted dresser\/chest, headboard, night stands, and lamps. However, the room did not include a refrigerator nor microwave--which is so weird because even at basic hotels like Best Western, they provide a mini fridge and microwave. Ugh, no cold drinks, I guess. 

The elevators were also janky, one shook so bad we decided to avoid that one at all costs. Unlike other reviewers, the air conditioning in our room worked too well--my man woke up freezing the first night, lesson learned. The bed was comfy. The bathroom was ok (the sink made a weird draining noise when we were not even using water, hmmm), but I was sad there was no tub to soak in after walking miles along the Strip and inside the malls. 

The internet also stopped working the second night, but only for me, not my man. Yeah, not so great when I really wanted to research some things to do while in town. 

So the room was decent to average but I ended up feeling like we had paid too much. The novelty of staying in the pyramid wore off rather abruptly. They also cannot be commended on the fact that I had to insist on my $20 credit, which forced me to waste 30 minutes on the second day in the check-in line and 20 minutes on the phone (ugh), They also have the nerve to charge for the nicer pool, (yeah the audacity!) while limiting the pool available for the non-paying masses when several could be easily opened. It is also only 3 feet, so you cannot really swim. 

On the flip side, I did win $30 with $5 and $10 with $1 at the slots (but then lost $6 =(). FYI, the food court at the Excalibur is superior, so go over there for fast food.

Ultimately, I probably would not stay at the Luxor again. After all the years I spent wanting to come here, it was not as nice as I hoped it would be. The price did not match the experience (I feel ripped off).",4,1,2

From the pictures I took there was a great view of the strip. As far as hotel theme and concept everything is in three. I love the Tri concept and the Egyptian theme. There's a Starbucks in there so that's cool and the rooms are average. Nothing too fancy and everything is placed in a pyramid shape when you walk into the room and bathroom. Even the towels are folded into a triangle. Though I only stayed for two nights and later went to another hotel I will do a review for its good for the money if you stay during the weekday.

Rooms here were less than half the cost of the Mandalay when I stayed, and I'm satisfied with the value for the money spent.

I booked a tower room on the advice of friends. The room was clean. The décor was plain and simple. There was no work desk, so I had to work with my laptop on a round metal table while sitting in a chair that was definitely not made as a work chair. None of that mattered much though, because I was in town to work a conference and mainly just slept in the room.

One negative was the noise. Anyone walking or talking in the hallway could be overheard. The room door didn't seem to block much sound. Noise also leaked in from the adjoining room through the connecting doorway. There was a bit of an odd smell to the room and the hallway. The noise had me fearing for my sleep, but thankfully my neighbors turned out not to be loud.

The walk to the Mandalay Bay's convention center is Loooooong with a capital L. I got used to it though, and rather liked it for the exercise. The long walk was also a chance to clear my head after a long day working the exhibit booth.

When checking in they decided we should all be together.  The person at check-in took forever (20 mins?) and finally put us in a pyramid suite (these cost less than what I booked but she never told us that).  I got to the suite and it was terrible.  It was old, the curtains didn't close all the way (what is better than the complete darkness afforded in LV hotel rooms?), the suite was weirdly laid out with a bathtub in the corner under the slanted windows that would have been weird to get into, the suite also was slanted downhill so when in bed you were going downhill. The bathroom door stuck, the toilet seat had a burn in it, and the fan didn't work but was full of dust.  It was pretty gross.  I spent about 10 minutes in there before deciding that I wouldn't be spending the next three days in that room. The elevator to get there is a recipe to vomit all over yourself because of the angle it travels at to get up the pyramid.  I went downstairs and changed back to a tower suite.  That room was SO MUCH BETTER.  I can't believe that they would have kept me in a pyramid suite for the same $$ as the tower suite.  They are drastically different.  Even though the tower suite had blue pillows with what looked like semen dribbles on them, at least the room was temperature controlled and not weirdly 90 degrees like the other one. The mattress was not great, I kind of felt like I was at an old Motel 6. I also thought it was weird that there were no extra blankets or pillows in the room.  The bf and I like different temperatures and I wish there had been an extra blanket for me to not be so cold in the middle of the night. The bathroom in the tower was awesome and had separate bath and shower, but the toilet was not separate and the closet was in the bathroom.  It's a weird setup for someone who wants to get ready in the bathroom but not while someone they are traveling with is pooping. 

I feel like it is a smaller casino floor than what I am used to which is nice because it's easy to find others you are with.",2,1,3

It just isn't in the same category as places such as Caesars, Treasure Island or even Mandalay Bay. And, someone staying there should know to except subpar conditions given the comparatively lower prices. 

So, my review is from the perspective that the room was MUCH cheaper than any other room I could find in Las Vegas ON the strip. The hotel is towards the end of the strip on an angle which made figuring out where we were a little difficult. However, they had a nice free tram that went from Mandalay Bay to Luxor to the Excalibur that was very convenient. The casino was wasn't too big and offered your standard slots. The cheapest table limits were $10 during the day. They had plenty of clubs, bars, restaurants and even a food court inside. No need to go anywhere else really. 

Pro:
Great layout
Nice slots and plenty of tables 
Music from the main lounge played throughout the hotel 
Shuttle service to the airport  
Rooms are very affordable 


Con: 
The room was musty smelling
The hallways did not look very clean

I got a discounted room price for $27\/night, and I decided to beat the July 4th crowd and booked a room from Monday to Weds (7\/3).

Room:
They gave us a pyramid room 15013, on the 15th floor (via Elevator #2). Decent view of TheHotel and Mandalay Bay Resort, but that's pretty much it. The A\/C was like a motel style one where you would have to go through trial & error to find the ""right"" tempt for the room.  There's no digital reading or measurement, but a dial for fan control (low to high) and tempt (Warm to Cool).  There is a flat screen tv in the room, but the channels all had bad receptions. Bathroom was OK, with a shower and a sink with all the complimentary toiletries.  Beds were comfortable, but I swear the room has fleas.  I had a bug bite on my arm when I woke the next morning, so that was something I was not expecting. And my mom got bitten too, when she sat in one of the room chairs... UGH... LUXOR, if you're reading this, considering FUMIGATING YOUR ROOMS!

Elevator:
Didn't know the Luxor was an amusement park, too. LOL!  All of the Pyramid Elevators all rattled and roared from one floor to the next.  Hm...if you didn't know any better, you'd expect a sudden drop and free fall when you hit the top floor....luckily that didn't happened.

Final Verdict:
I have no problem splurging a bit more to stay at a 4 or 5 star resort after this 3 day hotel horror show.  No wonder it was $27\/night...they literally exchanged it for blood, and a souvenir of bites to take home.  No.THANKS.LUXOR!",9,2,1

The price I paid for my room was great and our room had a very nice view from the 18th floor. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the hotel\/casino itself as it was geared more towards couples in their mid twenties to early thirties just looking to have a sophisticated good time. No watershows, no wild animals, nothing much of the touristy nature. 

Tacos and Tequila was a pretty good gringo Mexican food. Can't beat gouda cheese enchiladas and a free shot! I am also from Michigan and was happy to find a little ceasars pizza up in the pyramid.",5,2,1

It is actually about as 'no frills' as it gets on the Las Vegas strip.  It is an okay place to stay if in need of just a basic room. It just isn't the place to stay if you want to have the full Vegas experience.  

I stayed here when I recently visited Vegas, and my room was facing the Sphinx in the front.  I could see part of the strip, but  had a great view of the race track across the street.  It was cool to see the rally races, but I was woken up by the racing almost every morning I was here.  Apparently the windows aren't very sound proof and I was able to hear their engines and exhausts from across the street and 19 floors up.  There is really nothing special about the rooms themselves, and they are on the smallish side.  My room was slanted on the window side because of the shape of the building, which made it feel even smaller.  The only cool thing about the room was the awesome pyramid shaped soaps in the bathroom.  

The casino area of the Luxor is not very big.  There are some restaurants and attractions, but nothing special.  I hardly spent any time here when I left my room, and found myself visiting other casinos a lot.  The other thing that I didn't like about the Luxor is that it is at the edge of the West side of the strip.  I had to take a cab almost everywhere I wanted to go because of the location. 

The Luxor is a decent place to stay if just in need of a room.  There are not a lot of fun things to do here, so I would stay at another hotel if I wanted a more complete Las Vegas experience.",7,4,6

Check-in was fast and easy, but just as we walked away from the counter, the woman informed us that the none of the spa tubs in the rooms equipped with them worked any more.  So essentially we paid extra for an awkward-shaped bathtub in the corner of the sleeping space.

The casino area was ok, but the difference of service and clientele between night and daytime was literally like night and day.  During the day (and even early evening), it was quiet and fairly sparse for a strip casino.  There seemed to be almost no waitresses walking around seeing if anyone wanted a drink.  When we finally found one and started to ask her if we could get something, she snapped ""WAIT!"" and stalked off.
At night it transforms into a trashy wonderland of drunk Jersey Shore wanna-be boys, and drunker girls that obviously have no clue that there's a huge difference between ""dressing sexy"" and looking like they should be turning tricks on a seedy corner someplace.  If your boobs are barely held in and your skirt is so short you're nearly showing off your downtown dining and entertainment district, you've achieved the latter category, darlin!

The room itself was large but sparsely furnished and extremely oddly laid-out.  Upon entering, there was a large bathroom to the left; a big shower and lots of counter space, but the lighting was absolutely awful.   Further into the room was a very small writing desk with no outlets that I could see (and no kind of seating).  The main wall of the room had a bed and two side tables.  Strangely placed perpendicular to the bed and off to the side was an armoire (which was WAY too close to the end of the bed and allowed only about 10 inches of walking room between it and the corner of the bed), and on the far side of that was a flat screen television that was pointed at a partition wall.  It could be moved to angle more towards the bed, but then the armoire was blocking half the screen.  Past the partition wall was a small room that looked as if it should have been a seating area, but was completely empty except for two luggage racks. Overall, it gave the impression of a sad, neglected theme room.

There were absolutely no amenities... no coffeemaker, no mini-fridge; but I'd have to say my biggest complaint was a lack of wi-fi.  There's an automatic fee with the room that includes wired internet, but that's it.  C'mon... it's 2012.  Even small coffee shops have wi-fi!  My service is AT&T, and standing completely still in the room, I watched the service on the phone go from 4 bars to 2, then to no service, then to the edge network, then back up to 2 bars.  Thankfully, calls seemed to go through ok and texts were slow but worked; but anything web-based on the phone was pretty much useless even when it would reach 4 bars of service.  I'm not sure what's going on in the pyramid, but my phone even started acting buggy while in the room... at one point I noticed the clock showed eastern time for no reason.  To top it all off, I had to keep the phone plugged in or in airplane mode because the battery drained so quickly from it constantly searching for signals.

The tower rooms are of better quality, but if you have to stay at the Luxor, avoid staying in the pyramid!",1,3,2

The rooms are clean. The bed is comfortable. If you look around online, you can get a room rate around $100 per night. Beyond that, what else do you want in Vegas? Are you really spending that much time in the room? A few more bonuses:

- The layout of the casino is a bit more spread out than the other rooms in this price range, which is nice. You can actually get around without feeling overwhelmed. They've done a nice job of keeping it up to date as well, it feels very modern. Walk through say, Bally's at a similar price point for comparison, and you can tell the difference. 

- Close walk to the MGM and Mandalay Bay. And close to New York New York too, which has solid late night eats.

- Very solid 24 hour diner.

- Giant, nice pool, though it was super crowded when we went July 4th weekend.

Minor negatives, if you want to call them that:

- Yes, there is no WiFi. Tough shit. You'll have to plug in your laptop. #firstworldproblems. 

- You also need to walk a bit to get to your tower room from the casino. Really though, not that long of a journey. I don't know about you, but after stuffing my stupid fat American face at a big Vegas meal, I actually enjoy a bit of a walk. If you complain about this, you're probably a bit overweight and could use the exercise. I'm also going to go out on a limb and say you probably live in the South and vote Republican. 

- Read lots of complaints about CRT televisions, but we got a flatscreen. Not that it matters, how much television are you actually going to watch? There are only so many Carrot Top show ads you can sit through. 

- I would definitely recommend upgrading up one from the lowest room rate to get into the tower. The rooms in the pyramid itself seem to be too close to the casino and could get noisy I'd imagine, especially on the first few floors. 

It's not going to be as nice as the Wynn or Aria, but you get really good value for what you pay for here. If you're stressing the negative reviews, don't. I did the same, but after staying there four nights, I'm happy to report that I had no troubles with the room. In fact, I'm planning on booking there again next time I visit. It's not going to wow you, but between the price, the comfort of the casino and the proximity of other good casinos, it's a very good value.",11,9,2

I mean, it's modern enough, but old at the sametime. It has a lot of amenities, but the last time I stayed there, it was NOT a happenin' place on the strip. It's not as old school as the Sahara (with rooms that smelled like your great uncle lou's ash tray), or as new as the Bellagio or the Wynn. Or the Mandalay Bay, or NY NY, or.... What it does though is strike that equilibrium for people such as myself - those that make enough to not have to stuff 8 people in a room at the Sands, and instead pay a normal double occupancy rate in a hotel, but can't quite spring for the middle of the strip yet.

So what does this mean? You get nice sized rooms and suites for reasonable rates, but you're stuck on the bottom of the Strip (thankfully that tram on the east side isn't too far of a trek through the MGM).

I'd like to be able to go to Vegas at some point, stay at a nice place, like the Venetian or the Bellagio on a peek weekend, and just take a relaxing vacation, gamble a little bit, go catch a couple shows, do some major wardrobe upgrade shopping, and just hang by the pool.

Can't say much about the rooms since I haven't stayed here since 2001 or so, but my cousins just stayed here and didn't seem to have any complaints.

The Luxor has actually done a decent job redefining itself as a hipper hotel than it was during it's major Egyptian themed era.  The center of this is the LAX nightclub, which I've been to a couple of times and actually don't mind too much.  They also have the CatHouse inside the Luxor, which is a cool restaurant (so I've heard) & bar.

There's a center bar here called Liquidity, which has a really nice ambiance to it.  They have a few video poker machines there, but in looking around last night, I couldn't find one that was 25c, only $1 and up.

I ended up grabbing a drink at the Flight bar in front of LAX, which did have a couple of 25c machines the bartender pointed out to me.  I played for a bit and was very pleased with the large beverage I was poured.  A lot of casino bars give you a tiny glass when you're playing, but this one was a above-average sized lowball glass.  I'll be remembering this spot.

There's another casino bar called Aurora that I think I've checked out before... if it's the one I'm thinking of, it's very spacious and has lots of plush seating.  I was served trail mix with my drink that included wasabi peanuts; I can remember that.",1,0,1

My husband and I paid for the players suite for a weekend getaway in Vegas.  When we got to our room we found: 

1.) The couches and chairs had sketchy stains on them 
2.) the TV was tilted on the wall
3.) The lamp shades were broken
4.) All of the furniture was scratched and much of it was broken.

Generally, we would have just dealt with it, but because we paid extra for the suite-- we decided to complain.  The manager didn't want to do anything but the woman at registration upgraded us to a pyramid suite.  excited to finally get our vegas weekend started we lugged our bags to our next room and found:

1.) The room was meh.  Old furniture.  Nothing special. 

2.) The spa jacuzzi was not a jacuzzi at all-- just an oversized tub.  When I couldn't figure out how to drain the water-- i hoped that house keeping would know what to do.  I was sadly mistaken.  The water in the tub sat for 3 days-- which made me wonder how clean the hotel really was. 

3.) At night, the horizontal elevators in the hotel were so loud and they shook our hotel room-- yes, every 10 minutes it was like an earthquake in the room.  

On top of it all the customer service at the Luxor is lacking.  It is the only hotel that I have ever stayed in (EVER) where you have to wait in a mile long line just to give your bags to the bell man.

My first impression of Luxor (to be honest) was that it was kinda tacky.. and not as grandiose as the other hotels. On top of that, the hotel is not a comfortable walking distance from the main strip where all the action is happening so you need to either exercise it up or deal with the bus and its inconvenient schedule especially at night when there's traffic.

Luxor does not come to mind when I think of ""Vegas,"" but it's not bad for its price (said my cousin in law who paid for my stay  lol). I stayed for a week and the maid did a good job tidying up our room each day. The service, casino, and restaurants aren't bad. I didn't get to go to the nightclub here but I heard it's pretty famous and apparently has higher Yelp reviews than the other nightclubs I looked up. Better rating than the nightclub I actually went to at MGM.

I give Luxor an average rating because you're getting what you pay for. Yes, Bellagio, Wynn, Caesars they're all nicer but also come with a higher price. If you're in Vegas reading this, have fun! :)",1,0,2

In Naming Our Own Price and Saving (priceline, duh), we were able to secure a room at the Luxor for $39 -- especially nice since Leo doesn't believe in paying for rooms in LV. 

We arrived and got a room in the pyramid, which is a nice novelty to say we've done. But the room is definitely outdated. I'm sure it would have been totally super cool in 1993, when the pyramid was built and was the tallest building on the strip (according to my Foursquare message from the History Channel). Now, however, the hieroglyphics on the closet don't make up for what the room lacks. Typical LV hotel essentials -- a safe and a luggage -- were missing. 

But the room did come with something extra-special. The PLU sticker from a mango was found on the bathroom floor. We felt so special to receive such thorough cleaning. 

A definite plus was the fitness room, which had enough quality cardio equipment to go around. I can't speak to the quality of the weights, but I appreciate the amount of space provided.",2,2,1

Das Luxor - von außen sicher eines der interessantesten Hotels am Strip. Die Pyramide, allein die hell leuchtende Spitze, dazu sie Sphinx, all die ägyptischen Figuren - das hat schon was.

Die Zimmer sind groß, mit großem Badezimmer. Die Möbel sind schon etwas abgewohnt, Matratzen in meinem Raum waren ok. Großer Flat-TV wurde irgendwann mal nachgerüstet, LAN ist vorhanden. KEIN WLAN, für mich ein no-go, ich hatte das in der Beschreibung nicht gelesen. Selbst im Lobby-Bereich kein zugängliches WLAN für iphone etc. Sorry, das ist wirklich nicht mehr up to date.

Die Aufzüge sind ein Erlebnis - schräg laufen sie an der Pyramide entlang. Auch sonst ist das ""Innen"" des Hauses sehr schön. Das Casino schon etwas älter, wird gerade an allen möglichen Ecken mit dem Hinweis ""we build a complete new Luxor"" renoviert.

Der Preis ist super, günstiger geht es nur noch im Circus Circus oder weg vom Strip.

As I sit in the cigarette stenched pyramid suite, I am begging anyone who reads this to not stay here. DO NOT DO IT. it will be the greatest hotel related regret you have. 

It is the worst hotel experience I have had in my life. Not only am I never staying here again, but at this point I don't even want to come back to Vegas ever again. Yes, this experience is that bad. 

We checked in yesterday at midnight. 

We found blood on our sheets. I can let a lot of stuff go... But blood on your goddamn sheets is pretty much one of the worst things you can find in the room. It's worse than the crack in our ceiling. Or the peeling walls. Blood. On. The. Sheets. 

We call for new sheets immediately. After waiting half an hour we call again. 45 minutes after that a man shows up at our door and unceremoniously hands us the sheets, and we go to bed. 

An hour later... At 3 in the damn morning, we get a loud phone call. Have we gotten our sheets? Yes, we have. Thanks for the rude awakening.

The next day we make the mistake of driving to dinner. When we come back, we are forced to circle the parking for an hour looking for a spot, because the Luxor is seriously lacking in guest parking. After about 20 minutes we tried valet, but the valet was also full. So full that the people waiting in line in front of us were out of their cars wandering about because, yes, they have been waiting THAT LONG. So back to circling the self parking we go. 

The worst thing about all of this is that NO ONE WILL HELP.  Contacted guest services to see if they could salvage something. Anything. Basically got told that it's a busy season and everything that happened to me was out of their hands.  Which is utter bullshit because no other hotel I've stayed on the strip - even the lower end ones - have ever had bloody sheets, 3 am phone calls, and absolutely no parking. None.

Compared to some other places, you can find some amazing deals here.  I've stayed three times and never had a bad time.

While this is on one end of the strip and can be a bit inconvenient, it's still a really good choice.

The place is huge inside, like most of the casino hotels\/resorts, and it's fairly easy to navigate yourself around.

From the outside it gives the impression you're walking into a pyramid, as is the point of the many Sphinx like statues outside and throughout the lobby. The deeper you go into the casino, however, the more confused you are about the ambiance. There are neon lights everywhere (shocking, I know, it's Vegas) but they way they are tracked throughout the casino, it reminds me of a 1980's nightclub. Part of me loves the Luxor for this, it brings me back to the 80's and that makes me nostalgic, but the rest of me wants so much for them to stick with the Egyptian theme and make the casino consistent with the Lobby and outside. 

Moving onto the pool- I will say that the pool is very nice. The pool attendants are also very responsive and quick with your orders, which is not always the case at other Las Vegas Hotel pools. The guy who gives poolside massages is also very sweet. Although we were not interested in a massage he was still very nice to us and engaged us in a lovely conversation about Vegas, not a sales pitch, which I really appreciated. 

The guest rooms were nothing to brag about. What I found interesting is that this is one area where they stay consistent with their Egyptian theme, and maybe not the best place to maintain this theme. The bedspreads were obviously very outdated (consistent with the casino) and the only wall decoration they had were of what were supposed to be ruins and artifacts, but were laughable. Also, while we did have a non-smoking room, because our room was in the pyramid section of the hotel that over looks the casino- our room smelled of smoke due to poor ventilation of the casino as well as the design structure. 

In all fairness though, this casino is constantly offering deals, and for $70 a night, you can't really beat it. It's also quite the late night hot spot for young gamblers leaving LAX.",0,0,0

My main reasons for staying here was that it was close to the airport (fifteen minutes away by car), it was affordable, and it's supposedly a haunted pyramid! This review is for the hotel only.

-- CHECK-IN --
You are greeted with grand Egyptian statues decorating the entrance. The check-in lines were very slow. I had hoped I would be in and out quickly (as my family was waiting for me outside). It was about five to ten minutes in line, then five minutes at the counter, then ten minutes to find my room because signage isn't very clear. Minus a star for all the time lost at the reception area throughout my stay.

-- ROOM 1 --
My first room was in the West Tower (actual north-west). This was a five-minute walk to get there. I was placed at the very end of a winding hall. I was already told stories that someone had died and the hotel was haunted, so being at the very end felt like a dead end. I got the creeps when I unlocked the door, only to find--nothing but a regular hotel room.

The first thing I do is look out the window to see my view, it was of the pyramid itself, meaning my room was *outside* of the actual pyramid. It was a decent view; I just didn't like seeing the roof in front of me. Everything had an Egyptian theme to it: Egyptian artwork, tasteful gold trim on the furniture and in the full-sized bathroom (which had a tub and stall). It was a perfectly fine room.

-- ROOM 2 --
Because my flight was cancelled I had to stay another night. I wanted a closer room that was in the pyramid. It took about twenty minutes at the front desk to change and get the right things charged to my account because of my particular situation. It was OK because my clerk was very cute and looked liked an old roommate.

My second room was on the seventh floor inside the pyramid. It has a cooler view of most of the casino\/hotel on the walk to the room. The windows were on a cool slant (as I was part of the pyramid now), with a view of the Excalibur next door. This room had a tinier bathroom with a stall, but I was fine with that.

The rooms do not have fridges, but you can improvise by filling the provided wine bucket with ice down the hall and putting any perishable food or drinks in there to cool.

-- THINGS TO DO --
I walked by a few things but didn't go to them: the Titanic exhibit, the Blue Man Group show, are right near the obelisk in the center of the hotel.

-- SUMMARY --
The Luxor Hotel was a good place to rest in a unique building. And because most of the hotels are connected to each other you can easily walk between them to do things. You could also catch a Lyft or Uber on the north side to go somewhere else. I was a little disappointed that I didn't experience any ghostly sightings, but this was still an enjoyable stay.

I'd been able to get the time off and had never been to Las Vegas before (with kind of an itch to go just because the Syfy TV series Dominion takes places in a future version of Las Vegas [and then there's Mars Attacks]). Coupling that with reviews of this hotel via word-of-mouth, I'd pretty much lined up everything. And then there's the [Dr. Chaotica voice] *space ray*.

I'd reserved a run-of-house pyramid room, so I'd not really known what I'd be in for until I'd gotten to the check-in desk. Having decided (some would say foolishly, but I was game for it; it was an experience) to *walk* from McCarran Airport all the way to the hotel, I was quite ready for anything they would give me; I just wanted to sit down. The Luxor would be my base for sitting down throughout the week I was in Las Vegas, because I did *heaps* of walking (including a walk to and from the Stratosphere the next day: roughly 33,000 steps).

The check-in process was pretty efficient, which I'd expected since they have about ten different spaces for people and the lobby was *enormous*. I was just thankful I'd not come in at a time when they would be checking in 50 or 60 people simultaneously as I'm sure happens. The agent was clinical and just the right amount of friendly. She didn't get into too many details beyond that I did have a run-of-house room and so had gotten a two-queen-bed room on the 22nd floor, and how I was to get there.

I took a seemingly long walk to the elevators, passing many interesting details (light fixtures, Anubis guards, hardy desert plant-life, faux hieroglyphs) on the way, something I'd continue to do during the week. I'd also noticed, to my back-of-the-mind annoyance, how much advertising for their in-house and MGM Hotel-related shows they had. It wasn't until then that I'd really given any credence to how much people went on about shows being a ""thing"" one does in Las Vegas, and something to what I'd paid more attention as the week went on. I didn't actually end up doing any of the shows because I'm not a ""shows person"", really. I didn't check out their exhibits, either, though they seemed somewhat interesting.

A speedy elevator ride up, I carefully walked to my room because I wasn't certain how many turns it would take before I got there. I did, eventually, arrive to a room that was almost pitch black. I fumbled around for a light switch, found it, and walked into a room, to my surprise, facing the pool, the interstate, and the mountains in the distance. I liked it.

I'd also noticed the room was pretty nippy. I'd turned off the AC unit would not really need to have it on for the majority of my stay. I'd walked around to familiarize myself with the room, finding little nicks in the furniture (fine; it's a relatively budget resort) and the fact the television seemed askew to the bed setup (I didn't really watch TV much anyway, as probably most of the guests don't and so they perhaps didn't care too much about its placement). The toilet startled me the first time I'd flushed it because you only have to push the button ever-so-slightly and it almost literally vacuum-flushes everything down. The Lake Mead water was kind of hard, so I didn't feel quite as clean until my skin got used to it the next day, and the hot water can scald you if you aren't careful.

I didn't take advantage of the wireless Internet my somewhat-annoying-but-understandable resort fee paid for, though I probably should have done.

Walking around the hotel over the week I'd kept finding new things. It didn't seem that massive from the outside, even though everything towers above you. That's one of the things I'd liked about the hotel. If you want a base of operations that's relatively close to everything, this is it. If you want something kind of kitschy, same. If you want posh, try somewhere else.

Oh, and then there's the night I could literally hear some poor, poor guy *HEAVING* his guts out after probably an eventful night drinking, it seems, and couldn't tell if it was just outside my room or above me in another room where he was. I didn't find out, though my curiosity was *burning*.",4,4,2

Someone came into our room and took about a 1000.00 worth of items. An iPad, several cigars, charge cords and get this... Hairspray, mascara, body spray, razors and two tubes of toothpaste. Of course we went to security, and then they made a report, and turned it over to risk management, a separate  agency.

Every time I've stayed, I've ALWAYS got a free upgrade to at least a high floor tower room, so I can't speak for the pyramid rooms. Tower rooms I've heard are a lot newer\/nicer than pyramid rooms. The rooms are always very clean, and the bathroom is huge. 

I do have a couple complaints, like the long ass hike from the parking garage to your room. I wish there were at least people to help you carry your luggage, or even little carts. Hauling all my luggage and booze a mile to my room is brutal.

Also, those time share people are the worst. And don't bother eating at More buffet. Dry, bland food. Don't waste your money.

Other than that, I have no complaints. Rooms are cheap, good location, and I always win at the casino.

We were in the pyramid portion of the hotel - our room was a Pyramid Deluxe which was a nice size. Then again, we also only had one king instead of 2 queen beds. The bed was really comfortable too!! In addition to the bed there were 2 night stands, vanity, circular table with two chairs, an over-sized chair, TV with armoire and high speed internet connections (not wifi). The room was clean, bathroom had a big shower as well as lotion, shampoo, conditioner, body wash and a hair dryer. For those that need it, there was a ironing board and iron. We wish a mini fridge and microwave came standard but other than that, we thought the room was great. The room also had adjustable ac\/heat so that was real nice.  FYI: Upon check-in, the room we had requested in advance w\/ a king was not available so we had to check back the next day (we arrived at about 7pm Monday).  They were able to accomodate us to what had been requested, just had to be patient . We requested a bell man to come and assist with the move of our baggage, which worked out perfectly because he knew exactly where the room was and what elevator to take.

Unfortunately, we did not find the food all that great in the hotel. Starbucks only goes so far *lol* The swimming pools were refreshing, hot tub was hot. All in all, we didn't find the Luxor as bad as we had read in other reviews (on TripAdvisor) so that was a pleasant surprise as I was nervous until we saw first hand. Did not spend much time in the Casino portion but found the filtering out of cigarette smoke pretty good.

Much of the Egyptian theme is gone and the shine is definitely off this apple, but the real problems with this hotel seem to have existed from its inception.  

- The walls are SO THIN!  You can hear your neighbor breathing...and making bad decisions. 
- The bathtub makes no sense.  It is huge and the tap is tiny so there is no way you can possibly fill it before the water become cold.  Most room just have a shower.
- The layout of the suite makes no sense- there is a main room and a tiny side room that is totally useless
- The room has an AC\/ forced air unit with no thermostat.  
- The elevator seems like it is on its last legs (very noisy and vibrates) and there is only one elevator bank per floor.

My reservation was changed multiple times, and apparently, during EDC Week, they do not offer early check-in because of the high traffic. Let me just start off by saying, their reservations department is a joke. I had to call a couple times to make some changes to my booking, (adding a couple nights, updating check in time, etc). One night, I was on the phone for over three hours. First talking to a reservation agent that was rude and unhelpful, then another agent that told me something completely different, then finally a ""reservation supervisor"" who told me something completely different. I paid $20 for early check-in, but when I called back and was verifying everything, they basically said ""Oh, by the way, that's not guaranteed that you're going to be able to check in early,""...wtf is the point of even paying the extra $20 then?!?

Finally, after hours of stressing the hell out, being given different information from different agents, and speaking to a supervisor even, everything got squared away. They ended up giving me a food & beverage credit, but it was not worth hours of being on the phone, all because no one in the reservations department was on the same page about everything. I got told a million different things by a million different people. It was honestly one of the worst customer service experiences I've had to go through. 

When I finally arrive in Vegas, they did end up letting us check in early because they had space available. The location of the hotel on the Strip is less than ideal. It's far away from everything else & the entrance is confusing as hell. We had a cab drop us off at the entrance and ended up walking around for over an hour just trying to find the desk to check in. The place is a maze, and I'm not even over-exaggerating! Thankfully, the front desk was a lot more helpful than the reservations department was.  

There are multiple elevators, with different levels. The elevator system was also very confusing. I thought it was pretty cool that it went sideways, but they need to update EVERYTHING in the building, especially the elevators. Every time we took the elevator, it took FOREVER to not only wait for one to pick us up, but to actually get up. At some points during our stay, there were a line wrapped around the lobby just to get on the elevator. We got the room at a great price, but it was a little dated. I put in a request to get a higher floor, and we had a decent view. I guess they don't have any strip view rooms here. The room felt tiny because of the slanted ceilings. The furniture looked like it came straight from 1997. I didn't mind the room very much, because we were hardly there, but with four people getting ready at the same time, it was kind of a pain! Also, like I said, the LOCATION was kind of horrible. There were no food places open after-hours & since it's so far away from everything on the strip, we either had to walk at least a mile or two, or take a cab. Even to get food.

 I'm definitely never staying here again, mainly because the whole reservations ordeal left a sour taste in my mouth. There are way better hotels on the strip, even for a budget.

Maybe it's because I didn't stay in the room for more than 12 hours the entire time I was in Vegas, so didn't have time to inspect every single detail.  Maybe it's because I read all of the reviews for the hotel before I got here and was expecting total crap.  Whatever the case, I found myself surprisingly impressed by the Luxor.  

Went with a group of peeps for a weekend trip- stayed in a room in the pyramid.  Beds were comfy and SOFT.  Definitely sleepable.  The room, in general, was very clean, decently sized, and comfortable.  Bathroom was also clean and modern.  And not gross.  

I enjoyed the layout of the hotel, especially the overlook from the room corridors onto the atrium level.  Definitely not designed for the squeamish, however.  Do not get into a drunken argument with someone while standing in the corridor.  It doesn't look like it would end well.

My only complaints:

1. Time share peeps and club promoters are fairly annoying, but I guess that's to be expected most places you go on (or off?) the strip.  We ran into the same club promoter at least 3 times, yeah- by the 3rd time, he actually recognized us and left us alone.

2. Elevators are spaced far apart, which means that you kinda have to walk back and forth just to see which one will light up first.  Inside of the elevators are not much better.  They're loud and clanky, and the doors shake pretty badly, making for a somewhat uncomfortable ride up.  In general, I'm not an elevator person, though.

1st thing i notice the minute i stepped into the doorway to the lobby was the evidence of chain smokers.  it was subtle, but, gawd! now, by the time i got to my room, i can definitely smell the smoke in my clothes.  then again, my sense of smell is very strong.

the booking was handled online so, checking in was a breeze with the check-in people.  i.d., sign here, check out time is blah blah and here's your room keys.

the building is quite impressive.  the design and everything.  how they crammed everything in there and still have an airy feel is mind boggling.  you really don't need to go anywhere - you can stay inside and do almost anything inside...movie theatre, restaurants, slots and tables, topless dancer revue.  a full-on poster advertisement for their topless dancer revue was located inside our elevator to our room\/floor.  see pics.

moving along.

i don't know which building we were in but it was the pyramid one.  everything looked normal in our room.  organized, clean, typical, and there was the bed.  it looked soooooooo inviting.  sooooooooo inviting for a..............HUGE BELLY FLOP!  yes!!!  dropped my bag, took off my shoes, sox and cleared a path to the bed from the door so i can have maximum air.  this belly flop needs to be perfect.  trajectory, height and centering has to be on point for this.  if you ask me, the bed had it coming.  it looked like it can take belly flops and then some.

belly flop perfected and bed stayed intact with very minimal wrinkling from the bedding.  perfect bounce - enough height to flip to my back, cross my ankles with my arms across my chest by the time i landed.

wow, not bad.  

for the time i spent there, a few days only, luxor was interesting.  i'm more of a hostel type and seeing what they have inside was a little overwhelming.  as i visited other casinos\/hotels during those days that seemed to be the norm.  staff was average but no stand-outs.  average prices and check-out was as beezy as check-in.",4,2,4

The room is in the pyramid (older part of the Luxor and it shows) Room was on the 20th floor which is cool because it has the nice view of the strip  Two older tv's came in the room. Bed was ok. Could have been better though. Did feel some spring here and there. The hot tub was facing a window was pretty cool.  Drapes had stains (I'm guessing from the hot water from the hot tub) and showed it's age. Bathroom was super clean. (which I totally dig) and the room was pretty clean. The dual AC units were pretty quiet. Room service was quick but pricey. Internet was 12 bucks a day. ugghh.  Last time I stayed in the Luxor I stayed in one of the towers. They were newer and roomier suites. Would I come back? hmm.. depends if they rates are right i might.,0,0,0

Hit the road just to discover traffic on I-15 S was extremely heavy and decided to turn around and stay one last night on the strip rather than sit in traffic all night long.

Using my smart phone, I found the cheapest rate on the strip was at the Luxor. $42! Since all we really needed was a bed, we spun around and headed over. Valet parking was full(!) so we had to self-park in the difficult-to-find lot behind the casino. Walked a long distance into the casino with our bags only to discover a LONG, WINDING check in line.

The line moved fairly quickly. Front desk attendant was polite and generously offered a free upgrade from the noisy Pyramid room to a basic room in Tower East. We gratefully accepted, being tired already and wanting a good night's sleep.

Room was kitschy but clean. Pros: two wardrobes for hanging clothes; nice shower and tub; cute pyramid-shaped soap; $42 room fee! Cons: No WiFi in the rooms at all, not even for a fee; no chain lock or dead bolt on door.

My buddy is a pilot, so I scored some inexpensive First Class airfare and made my way to Sin City. I have always been curious\/fascinated with the giant Pyramid on the Strip, so I figured, why not, I'll give this place a try.

Pros: 
-------

* Live piano players in the lobby. That's awesome. As a professional piano player myself, I have great respect for establishments which employ piano players. Go Luxor.

* The gentleman who was directing those of us checking in where to go. He was friendly, and talked with each guest, so waiting didn't seem so bad. He even remembered me the next few days and said ""hello"" each time.

* Being upgraded to a Luxury Suite. That was pretty cool.

Cons:
--------
* There's no delicate way to say this, so I'm just going to come right out and say it: there were several white, crusty, semen stains on the carpet. If that wasn't gross enough, they were near the window. Eww. Some peoples' kids. I made note of this to the Front Desk, and they said they would create a ""work order"". Someone came up to look at the stains later on, but then he said he had to go ""work on a special project"" and someone else would come up. No one else ever came up. The stains were there all 3 nights I stayed. I never walked barefoot on the carpet.

* Overall friendliness of staff\/management was lacking.

* Neighbors in Suite next to me were extremely loud (2 Brits and 1 Russian) to the point I needed the TV in my living room on 24\/7 to cover their voices. Additionally, they smoked in their rooms and in the hallways, which then made the entire wing of rooms smell like smoke. My room reeked like smoke to the point I went out and purchased air sanitizer spray.

* Time share people. They were everywhere. Such a buzzkill! I don't remember seeing them in any other casino I've stayed at before!

My thoughts:
-----------------

Let's focus on the overall friendliness of staff. If you take the time to read other Yelp reviews, you will notice a consistent theme is the poor attitude of staff and management. If multiple people are Yelping about it over an extended period of time, there is probably some validity to their claims. I realize the Luxor is not the Bellagio, or Caesar's Palace, or SLS. It is geared toward a different demographic and clientele. That said, there is absolutely no excuse for poor attitudes on the part of the staff. 

For example, I called housekeeping one morning around 2:00 am because I wanted to make coffee, but I had no coffee cups in my room. When I spoke with a Hispanic gentleman in Housekeeping, he told me to use the glass cups instead. This is a perfect example of poor attitude. No, the guest should not have to use glass cups for coffee (which can break due to the heat, and which are extremely hot when filled with hot coffee). 

So I did use the glass cup, and I burned my fingers. The next day, when I mentioned this to my housekeeper, she apologized profusely and told me I should never had been told that. This incident, in and of itself, is not a game-changer for me, but the bodily-fluid-stained carpet I had, the poor attitude from concierge, the fact I barely slept my 3 nights there because my neighbors were extremely loud, the constant smoking by my neighbors, the lack of a resolution to the smoking issue - when you combine all of these issues - I had a horrible stay at the Luxor. Tell me - why should I return?

Back to the issue of great customer service - you don't have to be the most expensive resort on the Strip to give the best customer service. Obviously, when I stay at a 5 star resort (for instance, Pelican Hill in Laguna Beach), I EXPECT top notch service. I expect doors to be opened for me, to be addressed by name, because I am paying for it. But, what if, the employees at the Luxor went above and beyond just because they could?! What if the Luxor became known as the inexpensive resort with 4-5 star customer service? Imagine how the revenue would increase!!

Let me give you an example - I love food - and one of my favorite restaurants - simply because of their customer service - is Chick-Fil-A. Regardless of whether or not you agree with their ideologies or beliefs is irrelevant. They are a company who exercises extremely amazing customer service, and as a result, they have overtaken KFC in sales. That is a huge feat, as Chick-Fil-A is only open 6 days a week, whereas KFC is open 7 days. Additionally, KFC has been around longer. But I know there is a world of difference in store quality, cleanliness, food quality, and most importantly, customer service between KFC and Chick-Fil-A. So I drive 12 miles each way when I want chicken, even though I have a KFC less than 2 miles away.

The point is, with simple training, motivation, and a boost to employee morale, Luxor could become the ""it"" place for great customer service on the strip.",6,2,1

Overall my experience was better than I expected. We got a great rate on the room, being that my boyfriend has a player's card, the week's regular rates on Expedia were over 120 and we payed about 40 bucks per night. They also let us get a second room for almost the same price. 

Best part came when we went to check in and our attendant informed us that when you book your room, one king or two queen selections are just a preference are subject to availability. We were starting to freak out because we had a party of 8 and needed two queens in each room. Our attendant told us they were completely OUT of queens for the night, but after a little humorous conversation he bumped us from the standard two queen room to a Spa Suite Deluxe. 

This was perfect!! Now we had a spa that could fit 4, and an extra room with a couch and love seat and a table with chairs. This made our trip. We had one standard and one deluxe and didn't have to pay the extra $150 for the upgrade. Enough space for all of us to party comfortably before going out. 

I love the theme, their service, and the central location of the Luxor. If we get great deals like this, I'd be more than happy to come back.",2,1,2

The window was cool, but there was no pyramid shaped soap.

The room was clean, non-smoking, and two queen beds. Just what we asked for. One thing I didn't like though was that even though we didn't have the do not disturb sign on our door, the cleaning service never came by during our stay. We had to call and ask for new towels and cups, etc.

I was very skeptical about this place but it was the bf's company paid work expense so I didn't have much say in where to stay. Let's just get right down to the chase. If you don't read anything else from my review, just read this: THERE IS HAIR EVERYWHERE ON TOWELS AND LINENS. Check your towels, flip open your bedsheets, I guarantee you will find hair. 

First night checking in on Friday, we ended up in 3 different rooms because every room had hair in towels and bedsheets, including the room we ended up staying in. But because by then it was close to 2am, I just couldn't deal with it anymore. What makes me think a 4th room would be any better?

ROOM 1: 
We were greeted with a humongous dying cockroach. I actually didn't notice until the bf told me. This was only after I told him I found hair and stains all over the bedsheets and towels. Called front desk, they apologized profusely and switched us to another room.

ROOM 2:
Checked again, hair on every single towel in the bathroom. Hair all over bedsheets and between the sheets, linens, and pillows. Called front desk, again apologized profusely and mentioned they'll wave our first night's resort fee and upgrade us to a suite, free of charge. Honestly though, at this point, I didn't care for a bigger room because it's just a bigger room for more germs! And what does waving a night of resort fee going to resolve? I just want a clean room, is that too much to ask?

ROOM 3:
Ah, the suite life, right? No. Again, hair and stains on towels, hair on bed. What.the.f*ck. Was this a joke? Am I on a surprise episode of Hotel From Hell? If you've read this far and is still considering booking at Luxor...What's wrong with you? And don't upgrade to a suite. It is old, furniture is deteriorating. And really, would you even want to sit on these couches? *shiver* 

At this point, I gave up. I went to bed with long sleeves and shirt and tossed my clothes the next day. In the morning, I asked housekeeping to switch out all bed sheets and all towels. Shocking thing is, after the towels were switched out, I still found hair on them! I swear to you, it's not my hair.

The hotel manager finally called to follow up on the second day. I really wish they had checked up on us the night before so that I can point out all the dirty linens. It was unbelievable, even to myself.  There was nothing they could have done except check us in at a different hotel. But alas, we were stuck here for a week.

Housekeeping and the hotel manager were very apologetic throughout the whole ordeal. I'm not putting blame on anyone. Housekeeping was super nice and I don't expect her to inspect every single towel she puts out. The hotel manager did try to offer free meals and what not, but honestly I didn't want anything for free. I just wanted a clean room.

For what it's worth, Luxor has a fairly nice gym with lots of equipment. But guess what? Dirty and stained towels here as well.

Anyway, you get the point. Good luck if you're planning on staying here. Bring Lysol...your own towels and sleeping bags...a big bubble. Just put yourself in a big bubble. Good luck.

EDIT:
To Guest Relations, please spare everyone your canned responses and actually do something about this. Housekeeping staff is probably doing their best, but perhaps it's time to replace those dirty linens!",20,9,5

I asked for non smoking, and there were people in neighboring rooms smoking,  which me being a non smoker can make it hard to sleep when all you can smell if smoke!  The room itself was ok, nothing special, definately in need of renovation.  The bathroom was the worst part, it has wallpaper coming off the wall, the shower was tiled, which were spotted with mildew (it was on the ceiling as well), cracks, and even chunks of grout\/tile were missing in the shower itself!!  There was very LITTLE lighting in the room, so trying to do your hair and makeup can be very hard since you can't seen what you're doing!  The towels were hard, and not of good quality, and well, there really weren't any amenities.  The room also had a 22"" tube tv (didn't know those things were still around), and not nearly enough blankets on the bed.  The air conditioner\/heater was a wall heater that was very noisy and didn't work well at all!!!  The air in the room was stuffy and warm for my entire stay, even with the a\/c on!!  Another security issue for me, was that there weren't any additional locks on the door, just the one by the knob that you turn, I've never stayed in a hotel that doesn't provide at least a latch to secure your door with.

Another thing I noticed with this hotel, was that they have the most ANNOYING employees trying to get you to see a ""free show.""  I felt like I was at a car dealership beign haggled by salesmen.  My advice on that, just tell them that NO you are not staying, you are going home that day!!!

Also, I do not reccomend eating at T&T (Tacos & Tequila), it was gross and overpriced.  Their chips are harder than a rock, and their carne asada tacos are dripping with grease and more chunks of fat than actual meat!

On a happy note, I did LOVE eating at Tender Steak & Seafood, food was excellent, service was excellent.   It is expensive, but you pay for what you get.  (see complete review separately)

- housekeeping did a great job and even cleaned our rooms in late afternoon when privacy sign was up in morning
- comfortable beds, new televisions, plus channel selection

Con's:
- They gave us 2 free drink tickets per day of stay, but most others in our wedding party that stayed at the Luxor were not given their tickets (supposed to be part of the daily resort fee of $18)
- Quite far from the center of the strip
- They have timeshare people everywhere always pestering you (very annoying!)
- Lower limit tables, slots, etc definitely attracts a certain ""crowd"" so to speak
- Lights in the bedroom are not energy efficient (have to shut all off and on manually - this is 2012 right?)
- Pool area doesn't have much shade nor has it been updated since it opened I imagine
- Lack of quality eating establishments means you always need to go somewhere else (again annoying!)

A front desk associate was advised of the problem and an engineer was promptly dispatched. 

Unfortunately, during the unclogging process, our room became permeated with the smell of sewage, which forced us to leave the room for several hours. A HUGE setback in our plans for the evening. The following day, a similar situation occurred, but with the bathtub. The water drained so slowly, that when we returned from our evening out the water had still not completely drained.

It would have been ideal if the front desk associate would have been open to accommodating the room change request. We would have been in favor of moving to another double\/double. However, the front desk associate indicated that for this request to be accommodated, the plumbing issue would have to be irreparable, and also required additional management approval.

Luxor is not a great hotel, but I felt my room (given the very low rate) was decent.  It was clean and comfortable.  It was not an incredibly modern room, but it was not too outdated or in bad shape like some other rooms I have experienced on The Strip.

The room had a good temperature (good temperature in the shower too).  The shower's bottom was a little warped, which can cause slipping and thus has the potential to be very dangerous.

I did not explore much of the food and activities in Luxor since Luxor is not one of the nicest properties on The Strip.  Like Mandalay Bay, it is a little far from The Strip.  There is a free tram that will get you to Excalibur and also get you close to MGM Grand and the CityCenter.

Service was good.  As mentioned earlier, room rates are typically pretty good here.

Luxor is not a bad option if you can get a good rate, which you often can as Luxor is one of the more budget friendly hotels on The Strip.  Luxor does not offer much to do.  It is also a long walk from The Strip so you will have to be willing to spend a little bit of time in transit trying to get to other places on The Strip to enjoy your stay here.

The carpet in the hallways leading to the room have come loose, causing lumps to appear in the middle. Not very attractive.

Our room didn't feature WiFi, a coffee maker, or even a safe. These are three amenities one would come to expect from modern hotels. I've stayed in much cheaper hotels that featured all of these things. I could have done without the first two, but a safe is a must-have in Las Vegas. How was something like this overlooked?

The room was also poorly lit, despite the fact that it had three lamps and three ceiling fixtures. Perhaps it was the decor, which was a tad dark as well. 

The plumbing has some issues, also. In the mornings, the overload from people flushing and taking showers caused a strange gurgling to emit from the drains in our bathroom. 

Another thing: Our room faced the airport. The airport is very noisy in the morning, especially Monday morning. There has to be a way of soundproofing the room better.

In addition to all this, our shower had mildew on the ceiling. 

All this for $300 a night? Thankfully work paid for it all. Otherwise, I would have had a few words with the management.

I'm giving the Luxor the benefit of the doubt at this point. My fingers are crossed that their remodeling job will work wonders on the rooms. 

My advice: Ask for a remodeled room when you check in.",0,0,1

Being a novice,  I ""upgraded"" to the Pyramid suite expecting typical creature comforts.  Instead my jaw hit the floor in horror as I was greeted with scuffed and worn tables, threadbare furniture, holes in lampshades, frayed carpeting and crumbs on sheets.  YIKES!!! I was afraid to sit down, for fear of rising carrying a flea and tick infestation, and did an immediate about face back to registration.  Now I understand that the point of Vegas is to be out and about, and not in room hibernation mode, however one must feel comfortable at all times.  As I told the registration staff that the accommodations were unacceptable, I was asked ""well what exactly are you looking for?"". To which I responded ""something that's been upgraded in this millennium!""  To the credit of the agent, she offered an upgrade to the Tower suite explaining the area was the most recently renovated.  While the sofa and pillows looked like they had just given their last breath, the suite included a dining area and the bathroom and bedroom areas were much much better!!

Since it's connected to Excalibur, Mandalay Bay, and New York New York you could literally never go outdoors and have a great trip. Personally I like the sunlight too much for that but whatever floats your boat.

The Carrot Top show that is featured on site went above and beyond expectations (which were low to be honest). But I highly recommend checking it out while staying at Luxor.

Our pyramid rooms were clean and had everything we could have hoped for. Well, a mini fridge may have been nice.  And perhaps a newer shower head.

My only real complaint is that even when we placed the do not disturb signage on our doorknob the maids still came in and cleaned. Although I appreciate a clean room I prefer to know when people will be entering it so I can pick up my panties and maybe lock away any valuables.

I was pleased with the food on site, the casino was decent but I preferred to visit other during the day and play at Luxor in the morning or evening. The rooms were 100% satisfactory.

We were so excited to make our trip to Vegas this October. Flights were on sale and we had bought our tickets to see Britney. We were a couple weeks out and decided to go ahead and book the hotel. Luxor was having a special through Chase travel so we booked it. 

The minute we walked into the hotel around 4 pm we were clearly a mark. We were greeted by a lady who asked if we were checking in, we say yes. She asks if we're married, again yes. She turns to her partner nearby behind a desk and says ""give them some vouchers!"" The gentleman pulls up a screen on his computer and says ""pick any show or exhibit on here, we'll get you two tickets."" Since we already had Britney planned for the evening, we picked the Bodies exhibit: we'd always wanted to see it. 

The gentleman then pulls out a paper and pen (starting to sound like a car salesman yet?) and starts talking and writing at the same time: ""These tickets normally cost $38 per, and we'll also throw in 4 $25 checks to be spent anywhere in the hotel, plus a free breakfast or lunch. All that for just $50."" Sounded like a great deal, sign us up! ""Would you like the breakfast or lunch?"" Breakfast please, what time does it open? ""Breakfast is at 10 am."" (first red flag). 

He then pulls up a screen with some other MGM properties on it and says ""Breakfast will be at one of our newest properties here in Vegas. Just meet us in the west tower lobby tomorrow at 10 am and we'll shuttle you right over. After breakfast they'll even show you around the property for an hour or so before bringing you back here."" (Second red flag)

Okay, seems kinda odd, but still a good deal. He hurries us through initialing and signing the slip of paper he'd taken out and collects our payment of $50, cash only (third red flag). We shake hands, walk away, check in, and make our way to the room. Once we get to our room we inspect the paper more carefully and sure enough it says in small print ""The purpose of this presentation is to attempt to sell you a timeshare interest at one of our properties in Las Vegas"". It was all too good to be true. 

We then use the restroom to freshen up to go out (we had visited the West Rim earlier in the day) and when we turn on the hot tap on the faucet, no water! That's odd, whatever. We go out and come back around 10 pm, ready to shower: nothing is coming out of the shower. We call the front desk, and after being on hold for 5 minutes we let them know the issue. We are tersely told that a water line had just broken and they had turned off the line for a moment, but it would be back up soon. Never mind that there was no water 5 hours earlier either. 90 minutes later we test the water (because we were not given any notification or time frame) and it's coming out warm, so we showered and went to bed. Next morning we get up around 9, hot water appears to be off again. We dress and head down to the west tower lobby. 

We get there and the lady at the desk takes our slip from us and hands us a form to fill out, which had all kinds of personal and financial questions on it (did I mention that the gentleman who sold us the slip asked about our income while he was taking to us?). But the final straw: the form said departure was not until 10:30 and that the presentation could last 3 hours, not including travel time, plus the ""breakfast"" only consisted of assorted breads and pastries. We were looking at not being back until 3 pm, not to mention that we came from the central time zone, so it was already noon for us and we were starving. Nope, that's enough, please refund our money. 

The lady spends a few minutes trying to talk us out of it, offering another $50 in vouchers, and eventually says she has to call a manager to get our refund processed. A gentleman in a suit shows up and proceeds to give us the same talk that we just went through with the lady. But eventually, he relents and we get our money back. We then head to the buffet (so hungry!) and spend an hour eating two meals-worth of food. By the time we returned to our room at 1 pm, hot water was restored. It seemed to stay on from there forward. 

After all that, we were feeling pretty burned with the whole timeshare thing, but every time we went by an entrance\/exit of the hotel, walked in front of a restaurant, or simply walked through the casino, someone was trying to stop us to ask if we were staying at the hotel, they had a gift for us.

I knew the place had gotten old and only booked the room because I was in town for a convention at the MGM which is right across the street. I was prepared for the room to be average and not so nice so my low scores are not based on that. I wasnt expecting a 5 star stay, but what happened over the course of the week was disgusting and so wrong! 

First of all Ammenities: 
- Rooms are old and out dated
 - Furiture was scratched and broken in some places
 -Bedding was comparible to a motel six 
- NO WIFI! 
- No central A\/C so the room doesnt get cold.

ok now lets move on to the real reason I will NEVER stay here and will warn everyone I know not to. My Macbook Laptop was stolen from my room while I was out all day. I left my room at 7:00am when I returned at 11pm the laptop was gone. I searched everywhere before calling to file a complaint. They sent up a security officer who had me fill out a voluntary statement.

 Once that was done I realized I had no way to charge my cell phone, because I was using the outlet on my laptop. I went to the front desk and asked for a manager. I explained to him that my laptop had been stolen from my room and I had just filled out a report, but that I have no way to charge my cell phone and was hoping the hotel could let me borrow one for the remainder of my stay. The manager was so rude!! He told me that I could go to security and see if they have a charger in lost and found, why would they give me someone elses property! I told him I am not familiar with the hotel can he show me where to go. He pointed into the casino floor, never even looked up. I told him I couldnt believe after being stolen from in their hotel that he was not more willing to assist me in which he replied "" look lady if I had a charger in this drawer id give it to you, but i dont. Itd not my fault you cant charge your phone."" WOW you would think he could have at least walked me over to security to try to help me. 

I eventually found the security station. They told me they have a charger but I would have to plug it in and wait for it to charge! 6 hour wait and its 2 in the morning. I told her I have to get up at 5am and cannot wait, so she suggested I leave my phone there. WHAT! after my property was just stolen! I ended up having to buy a $45 charger from the gift shop. 

On top of that when I went back to my room to get into bed the sheets had chocolate stains all over. I called the front desk who told me they could have a sheet change done in 90 mins. I told her I could not wait that long as I needed to get some rest and had a big day the next day is there any one who could come sooner. She replied that they have limited house keeping and I shouldnt expect so much, there isnt anything I can do. WOW! 

The next day my husband came to join me, when he arrived he came to the valet. The valet told him the lot was full and he couldnt not park. I was on the phone with him walking to greet him- my husband said I am a guest here is there another place I can park myself. The valet said no this is your only option, but if you give me $100 I'll work it out for you. I told my husband do not give him any money I will be right there with a manager. While I was waiting for the manager the valet was telling my husband you better move your car or I'll make you move it. My husband replied to him trust me you dont want me to get out of this car..when the manager came to help me he told me that there is self parking around the back....WHY did the valet tell us that....loh yeah because he is trying to STEAL $100 from us!!! The manager did nothing and told us he has to side with his staff. 

At the end of the day nothing was done about any of this. The manager we spoke to at check out was rude and unhelpful I asked them to refund the room and was actually asked why would we do that? was there anything you didnt get that was promised? WOW how about common customer service and all of my belongings with me during check out. 

Also regarding my laptop I have called risk management over 10 times and no one has called me back. I finally got a hold of someone yesterday who told me the only person who used a key besides myself was the maid. They said she told them she didnt take it so the investigation is closed.

I was happy to get a room within the pyramid so that I could see the effect of the slanted windows, another one of those dumb little things I get so excited about. Other than a little water damage around the window, the room was pretty nice. There wasn't much to indicate that Luxor opened way back in 1993. The wardrobe was comically Egyptian themed. I'm impressed with how much is stuffed into the Luxor atrium. The entertainment possibilities are endless. I wish I had the time to visit the Titanic Artifact exhibit. It looked interesting. I liked the color scheme on the casino floor. Creamy white, blue and silver are a great combination and such a difference from many of the other casinos.

I had a conference in the Mandalay Bay and as these two hotels are interconnected (as well with the Excalibur to the other side). this seemed a goodf choice. The prices are on the lower side compared to the Mandalay Bay. I give the hotel three stars, but I mus say I am rating it in the higher 3.

I arrived late on a Saturday after a 14 hour flight from The Netherlands. The checkin line was long so I had to wait half an hour before being checked-in. Check-in was friendly. The room was spacious and although I booked for one person, there were two large beds. 

I was staying in the pyramid part (there are also towers which are said to be newer.) looking out on MCCarran airport. Being an aviation geek, this is awesome as it give excellent views on runways 01R\/19L and 01L\/19R. But this view is somewhat distorted by the dirty windows. I guess maintaining a glass structure like the Luxor requires lots of effort, but nevertheless this was noticable. In no way had this a negative impact on my stay as far as comfort goes.

Wifi acces is great! No complaints. TV is modern, but didn't use it all that much.

Overall I had a pleasant stay, but I do have some remarks:

1. Food court prices and of the small grocery shops are high compared to other hotels like Excalibur. As the Luxor is farther away from the Strip and its cheap shops to buy drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) the prices are probably a bit higher. Add to that the somewhat worse dollar\/euro currency rate and 5 dollar for a yoghurt\/muesli dairy product is a bit on the high side to put it mildly. Another option is to take an Uber\/cab (or walk 45 minutes along S Las Vegas Blvd in southern direction adjecent to the airport perimeter) to the Whole Foods market and buy some groceries there.
2. My planning was to have some laundry done and the website stated that this was possible. But during check-in I was told only dry-cleaning was possible. But in the room I found a bag and note offering laundry services as well. After checking this with the Bell desk I learned laundry services were offered indeed (just as the bag and note would assume) so all in all, this worked out fine and my laundry was done anyway. But I was a bit confused and I was already checking out if there were laundry services nearby, but this would involve taxi's and other assorted transportation, just to have some socks and shirts done. ;-)
3. Bathroom is OK, but some places show their age. The faucet is not tightened (but functional) and there is some calcification around the showerhead. 
4. The airco unit works, but also saw some better days. 
5. The escalators (the diagonally ones) are functioning (and probably subjected to regular, state-mandatory checks anyway), but had a bit of a ""clunky"" feel to it. Small remark: due to the friction of the carpetting when walking on rubber soles I was being discharged by the metal escalator buttons. Maybe some other non conductive materials can be used here. 

Overall a nice stay, but be aware that especially the prices for common food products like drinks and small bites to eat is higher compared to the rest of the strip. The room rates are lower though, so it's a trade off and you have to decide what's more important. Either spend more money on food\/drinks or take a short walk to Excalibur and\/or Strip and buy for far lower prices.",1,0,0

Oh and then when I emailed to complain they sent me an email back saying my next trip will be guaranteed the lowest price...Ugh priceline does that.

First off, the self parking was so difficult to find!!!! We spent about a half hour driving around the strip trying to find the self parking garage and valet was completely full. When we finally found it, we spent another 45 minutes trying to find a parking spot because the parking lot was way too small to hold the amount of people. When we finally found a spot, we had to walk inside without a trolley for our luggage because there was none to be found! How can a hotel not provide a trolley service when you're carrying a ton of luggage into their hotel??? Then, we wait another 30 minutes in line to check into our room. For some reason, even though the line was extending past the roped area they couldn't open more check in counters for customers waiting in line! We get a room, a tower room. We specifically requested a pyramid room when we made the reservation so it was very disappointing when they couldn't give us what we agreed upon when making the reservation!  The room they gave us smelled horribly of smoke which my boyfriend is very sensitive to, so he immediately felt ill when we walked in.

My very first time staying in a pyramid! (and probably the only way I will ever stay in a pyriamid) Decided to give this place a shot when I received a discount offer for my birthday. We came here in January and were welcomed by a pretty long line to check in but lucky for us, it moved pretty quick. There is a Starbucks near by that you can grab a drink to do yourself a favor and get ready for the night while waiting in line. The desk clerk that helped me out was really nice and noticed that I was celebrating my birthday late. We had a nice conversation about that and the holidays. She was very helpful and even offered to upgrade my room, free of charge! That definitely was a nice gesture and gave this place a huge bonus. Made me feel very welcome and excited for my weekend stay at Luxor. As she provided me the keys for the room, she explained that it's a bit tricky at times to find your room being that there is two sides of the pyramid so make sure you are on the West or East Wing or else you might be stuck walking around lost. The desk clerk also provided me a coupon book that came with my room and the birthday deal. Unfortunately there was only one coupon I really used (Rice and Company), which wasn't a bad deal. 

The Room: We were upgraded to the Player's Deluxe room. Walking in, it is very clean, spacious and has a nice comfy love seat to chill at if you wish. The bed is comfortable, the stand alone glass door shower was also spotless and pretty spacious. There is a tub next to it. Near the bed there is a wet bar and a small mini empty fridge to keep a few drinks cold during your stay. The tv was alright, flat screen and worked decent. Great room to stay at. Noise level from the outside though does seem to travel in (from the hallways). We had a few loud morning people on one of the days but nothing that lasted too long. It did wake me up though. The only downside about this room is their Wolfgang Puck Coffee. I thought it was gonna be a great perk to have but honestly, not sure if the coffee maker wasn't working or what because it was a huge nasty mess that went down the drain. 

Casino: There is plenty of slots and tables. I was lucky enough that weekend to come back with more than I had taken. Some of the dealers are friendly while some are pretty snobby. There is a good amount of waitresses walking around and it doesn't take too long for you to get your drink. One thing that bothered me though about being downstairs in this casino were the people trying to get you to sign up for time shares and what not. If you are a couple, they will aim at you for sure! Just walk away from them and don't get sucked in with their free show offers. Once you hear the catch and you decline, they rudely turn you away.


Customer service: 10\/10
Player's Deluxe room: 8\/10
Decorations around the hotel: very neat and interesting! 10\/10
Casino: 7\/10
Over all: 8\/10

Wouldn't mind coming back and staying here again, especially since the service and the rooms were great. Only thing is that it is at the beg\/end of the strip (depending where you're coming from) towards Mandalay Bay and THE Hotel. It is a little further than I wish it would be but at least you get a few walking steps in your day which we all need after eating a buffet.

Pro: Even tho my stupid computer can't hold their wireless signal, there is a wire for me to connect to.
Con: The halls and bedroom smell like some kind of toxic air freshener, and the bathroom smells like someone lit a match.

Pro: The bathroom counter is pretty, and comfortable to sit on, allowing me to soak my poor lil' feet after some drunk douchebag almost took my toenail off with the bottom of his shoe!
Con: The shower head is ghetto; the spray leaves much to be desired.

Pro: I haven't run out of hot water (yet?)
Con: They don't give you a towel\/mat for the floor, so you must use one of your scratchy towels to dry the bathroom floor when you get out of the shower.

Pro
1. We got the pyramid king suite. The room was spacious and it met our expectations. It was very clean and the hotel maids did a good job of cleaning it once we left the room. We also had a bathtub in our room which was great! 

2. Hotel staff were very helpful with any problems we had 

3. The buffet in the hotel was good. For being a buffet the food was actually not bad. You can get an all day pass for the buffet for $40 

4. I loved the convenience of the hotel being connected to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. It really helps when temperatures goes over 100 and you don't want to walk in the heat. 

5. We got a parking pass which can be used for any parking lot that is a part of MGM resorts. Very convenient so you don't have to pay for every time you go to a different parking lot.

Cons

1. Our room keys stopped working. We couldn't get into our room for a few hours since we went downstairs to look for someone to open the door but it was 3 in the morning there was no one at the front desk. We finally got to talk to someone later on that morning about our keys and they changed the keys 

2. The whole time we stayed there we had a parking pass. The pass was good, but it only worked twice during our stay. Just like the room keys the parking pass stopped working too. We would constantly had to go to the front desk to get a new pass. The parking pass was not included with your stay. You have to pay an additional $10 per day just to use this pass. It was not worth it since we had a problem with it the whole we were there. 

Thankfully we were compensated with the inconvenience with both the parking pass and the being locked out of our room.",0,0,0

The problem with Vegas though is it keeps re-inventing itself every couple of years, and the Luxor is starting to get a little tired inside.   Our pyramid room on the 20th floor overlooking partly the strip and partly the airport was awesome with the views, but not so awesome with the shabby less than chic decor.  It's OK though, and the dark muted colors helped hide that.  And it's Vegas, so you're really not in your room that much anyway.  If you're looking to stay in a really swanky hotel, it's not going to be the Luxor, but you probably knew that anyway.  If you want to stay in a nice hotel, with nice amenities, and be able to easily get around the strip, the Luxor is probably a good value for you.  The casino areas and adjacent bars are laid out nicely, and the pool area is very nice looking, but was closed for our stay in January.  We used the pool at Excalibur for free as a Luxor guest, so that was nice to be able to do that and get in some pool time.

The building and casino itself were alright, but the room was not up to par. First of all, we booked a two queen bed Pyramid room. When checking in, the woman helping us never mentioned that there were no more two bed rooms and that they had put us in a one bed room. It wouldn't have bothered us to be in the one bed room (we like to have two beds to put stuff on top of the other bed instead of on the floor) but it wouldn't have hurt to let us know. When we went back to the check in to ask about it, the woman gave us an attitude so we just made it work instead of fighting it.

Also, the woman at the check out desk told us the wrong elevator to go on to get to our room so we spent an hour and a half trying to find our room. We stopped and asked three people who worked for the Luxor and none of them had any idea where our room was! That's not okay.

Next, we noticed two different trays of room service that had been placed out in the hallway near our room to be cleaned up. The next day, those trays were still sitting out in the hallway. After the third day, we called the front desk to complain because it was starting the stink very badly. Finally by the fourth day it had been cleaned up. Gross!

We only put the privacy sign on the door when we were sleeping, but some how still got skipped over for two days when it came to room service.

It also really sucked that to get to the monorail, we had to walk through the Luxor and Excalibur, go across the street to New York New York, then back across to the MGM. You already do a ton of walking in Las Vegas but this just adds to it. This was our fault though for not figuring it out before booking a hotel room.

I was looking forward to staying there as it looks pretty cool from the exterior. The Luxor is good for those who enjoy casinos, but as for staying there... I say heck no...

1) Check-In: Went pretty quickly as no one was there. Front-Desk clerks didn't look very happy to see any of us.

2) The Room: It was not bad at first look, but once we turned the lights on, we saw the issues. The carpet was worn out and stained, the TV's were outdated and one was not operational, the couch was stained with substances, the desks were not properly cleaned (sticky sauce still on it and dusty), the mini- fridge provided was leaking from the bottom, and the paint on the wall was peeling off. The list goes on and on. (Oh, and the privacy is really low... You could hear people outside your door and sometimes in the room beside you.) *Note: We stayed at the Pyramid Spa Suite. 

So after the discovery of the filthiness of the room, we decided to go complain and get another room. One of the clerks we spoke to had an attitude furthermore making the situation worse. She gave us a key to the new room and in inspecting the new room, we saw it was exactly the same... dirty carpet, etc. We decided to stay in the same room and live it out. 

Other Info-

-Elevator is unstable, you could feel it shake as you descend and\/or ascend. It's also poorly maintained, feels as if it hasn't been replaced.
-The columns that hold up the pyramid looked cracked on the upper floors.
-There are the popcorn ceilings...

The Luxor is one of those hotels.  We were told there would be one, but it was not forth coming to what that fee was for.  There was a brief mention of ""save your cell phone minutes and use the land line for calls,"" but who counts cell phone minutes anymore?  Last time I checked most plans were unlimited and it's not 2002.

Another thing, not only were the pools closed, they were void of water.  How resort does that feel?  But, anyways... We stayed at a Spa Suite and I recommend those are definitely a pass if you are offered an upgrade to one.  (Unless it's free.)  The room doesn't look like it has been updated completely.  While there are few things that appear new like bathroom tiles and a plastic toilet, there are others that look like they have been in the room for the whole of fifteen years.  

First, the theme of the room is Egyptian and the furniture reflects that, but in a cheesy not-so-classy way.  All that hot mess of odd looking stuff looks like it has been there the whole time.  It's not in such great shape anymore.  Dings, dents, and dust were the main event plus the cabinet for the television is small, and the old rounded screen tube TV was as well.  The room itself was spacious but the decor was really lacking that luxurious feel.  In fact, in my opinion, the only thing suite-like was the nice linens.  The towels were fluffy and the pillows on the bed were very soft.  Still there was no comforter on the bed and the extra blanket looked like it had seen better days.

As for the non-hotel parts, the place has certainly cleaned up well.  The last time I was in here they had poorly slapped some walls up around the casino and called it a nightclub.  Now it has a nice modern open feel to it.  Food court was lacking, but they make up for it in casual dining.  They also have the Titanic exhibit and Bodies plus shows like Criss Angel, Carrot Top and Fantasy.

We came to see the rooms because of a Yelp freebie to see the Titanic and Bodies a little while back.  (We did Titanic again.)  While I'm glad I got to ride in the sideways elevators and check out the view from the 29th floor, I doubt I'll be back to stay even if the pool did have water.",0,0,1

We checked in around 7pm the systems were down for maintenance so the rooms were already assigned to everyone upon checking in, I booked a room in the tower it was a comp so I only had to pay the resort fees, they now charge you $100 deposit to stay depending on how many nights. We were assigned a room on the 16th floor in the west tower room 16202 be exact. We entered the room and of course I had to scope everything out, I kept smelling something when I was standing in between the two beds it smelt like puke I left and came back and the smell was more intense, I smelt puke and didn't understand where it was coming from well I decided to sit on the bed facing the other bed and what to you know there was throw up all over the bed skirt and all over the floor. I called housekeeping and they sent someone an hour later to come clean it the housekeeping man was so sweet he suggested we call the desk and switch rooms because it was that bad, I was on hold for a good 20 minutes for them to get approval from a manager to switch our room. We switched to room 16242 this one was much cleaner, I'm very disappointed in how this was handled the room should have never had puke in it I don't understand how housekeeping didn't see or smell it, I can't get the stench out of my nose, I'm going to have to think again about staying here, this is one of my favorite hotels to stay at too maybe I should stay in the pyramid and skip the tower.

Thoughout our stay over the 3 nights we found there was a constant line of unimaginable length nearly all the hours of the day! We had never stayed at the Luxor in the past when we went to Vegas and never will again.  We had 3 rooms and the windows in all of them were so dirty we could not see out.

When I called to request the windows be cleaned outside, I was told they use an outside vendor and have no control over that.  The manager never apologized when I called him--after a 24 minute hold for the front desk, and he offered a credit at a restaurant.  I accepted that, but would have preferred a sincere apology.  We asked for a late checkout of noon on the last day for 2 of the 3 rooms, and upon leaving they had no record of it for one of the rooms. The casino floor seemed louder than most, maybe because the absorption of sound was not as good as other locations.  Signage throughout  the hotel was so poor we spent every day getting lost at least twice.  Also, 2 of the 3 rooms still had not been cleaned at 6 pm one day, and the excuse given, after calling the front desk and being on hold again for an un-Godly amount of time, was that if the housekeeping staff were to see the DO NOT DISTURB sign when they go thru in the a.m. they don't come back and recheck after lunch.  Never had this issue at Paris or Ceasers.  Not being able to get in touch with people was very frustrating.  Our bill was so confusing it took us 40 minutes to decipher all the charges.

They are timeshare husseling chizlers looking to trap you into a high pressure sales pitch 20 minutes away from the strip with the lure of a free show. Dont get sucked into that! Better to pay for the shows you want to see rather than spend one of your precious vacation days with sales sharks.  When we finally got to our room it was nothing special.

Since we both brought our kindles we couldn't even use it but of course they still made us pay for the short wire hanging on the wall. WTF! Hello Luxor!! Even every roadside motel has WiFi now!  So on to the pool.  What a huge dissapointment! They have 3 pools: one for the kids, one for the adults and one that you have to pay to swim in.  All three of them were dirty and only go to 3 feet deep. and since no one wanted to pay to swim in the other pool it was completely empty and the other one was standing room only. I've swam in pools at second rate motels that were far much nicer and cleaner.  To top the whole thing off the 2 free buffets that I was promised they ended up charging me for and it was not even  that good. I would have never spent $50 to eat there!

As I am not traveling with her, I attempted to have a celebratory item set up in her room for her arrival. This task has been surprisingly challenging. After an hour of back and forth with the hotel staff, I have printed, completed, and sent back a credit card authorization form for in-room dining to deliver balloons. I have two questions arising from this process:

1. Why must I go to the hassle of completing a credit card authorization form to send balloons to my mother's hotel room? Clearly the hotel accepts credit card payments over the phone for room reservations. Why would a delivery be handled differently?

2. Why does in-room dining only operate between the hours of 6 a.m. and 2 p.m.? I am placing this order with the hopes of my mother walking into her hotel room upon check-in to see her balloons. My mother will not be checking in prior to 2 p.m. and in-room dining will not deliver until the intended recipient takes possession of the room. Due to the unique operating hours of this team and the rule of not delivering prior to the guest checking in, it appears to be an impossibility for hotel guests to walk into their room upon check-in to see a delivery, as the majority of people check in to their rooms after 2 p.m. 

I legitimately look for answers to these questions and hope by raising these questions, The Luxor can provide for accommodating services. 

- After I experienced the above, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that my mother did walk into her room to find the balloons upon her arrival. Overall, ordering the balloons was harder than necessary and I did not receive the best support while doing so, but I am happy the Luxor was able to accommodate my request.",0,0,0

The updated rooms are OK- but our room was NOT clean. Hair in the sinks... dirty shower. The bathroom was a mess. I have stayed at the Luxor MANY times and I've never had an issue with cleanliness.
So my biggest gripe- We came back to our room after an extremely long day expecting to get a nap in before going out to dinner and neither of our keys were working. We walked down to the lobby and stood in line for at least 45 min at the concierge. I told the concierge our keys did not work and told me ""I had the wrong line""... I'm sorry but no matter what line I was in... you should be able to assist. He directed me to another line where we stood in for another 15 min. At this point, I was pissed because I thought this was a technical error with the room keys. After finally talking to someone, he told me that security would meet me at my door to let me in.... Security??? WTF, why? Obviously the man at the counter couldn't tell me why.
SO we head to the room and Security tells us that the housekeeper saw a firearm in our room. I was immediately puzzled... then it came to me that the dumb ass house keeper thought my BRIGHT ORANGE pepper spray was a gun. Are you kidding me? It has the words ""PEPPER"" written on the side. They had to go in my room to double check.
They literally wasted 2 hours of my day because apparently the cleaning people can't read.
Worst experience of my life. The security man barely apologized and excused himself quickly. I honesty think HE was embarrassed at the whole situation.

Location in South Strip is pretty nice-- everything is pretty walkable. I haven't stayed at Luxor since I was a kid, so I didn't remember much of how the rooms were. We only ended up with a room on the 4th floor with a poolside view. The beds were very comfortable and clean. The people with me complained that the pillows were too big so they ended up not using them. They were fine to me!

Room itself was just a bit loud. They had the window cleaners working at around 7-8am (which is too early for Vegas!) and the ropes kept hitting the window, so it woke us all up. Additionally, the music from the pool traveled up so we could hear it on the 4th floor. 

Overall, I think the room was pretty spacious, but I don't think they did an amazing job of cleaning since some trash we accidentally left on the floor remained there after the cleaning.

We had an incredibly poor experience with the Shelly, the gal at the check in desk, the YS detailed it in his review so I won't bring it up again and that's how it started.,with incredibly poor customer service.

It used to be, too, that they had security near the hallways watching who went up and down in the elevators in the towers, that is no more and also you are no longer required to use a room key to operate the elevator so that means any and all can use it at all hours.  A fact I was not pleased to hear.  Shelly didn't tell us about that someone else a day or so later told us when we couldn't make the key work in the elevator.

I dislike greatly the timeshare people that they allow on their property that hound you every time you walk by, however, we must have gotten better at dodging them or they are slipping because it was minimal hounding.  

All in all, I'll try a newer property elsewhere on the strip.  I've recently stayed at the Encore and that was a much nicer experience.

They are charging a resort fee of $26.00 per day on top of the room fee.  The pool closes at 6pm so you have a couple of hours (if your lucky) on your first day.  The Jacuzzi was so tiny it could only fit about 8 people and was the most disgusting thing I have ever seen.  Cigarette butts and trash on the ground around it.  No one came by to check on or clean up.  The water had pond scum on it and even though we showered right after, our skin was itching from it for days!!!!  The health board should shut it down and fine them for being a health hazard.  Be sure to stay away from the pyramid café or you will be as disgusted as we were.  About $15.00 for a simple bacon and eggs plate that tasted like they ran next door to the Excaliburs buffet and brought it to you (cold and nasty).
Drinks?  You better just go to the bar and get your own as you will never see a waitress on the floor serving.  A\/C unit was broken in the room and the sink clogged.

The cheaper rooms DO NOT have bathtubs or fridges. (These rooms are the cheapest at the Luxor--NOT cheap $)

There is only 1 elevator that goes to each floor, and it has panels knocked out and buttons missing. You will spend more than 5 minutes getting to the lobby and more than 10 minutes leaving the Luxor.

Low quality food court with $$$ prices, like 10$ for something like a McD's burger. To be fair, that's indicative of Mandalay Bay and Excalibur; but at least Mandalay Bay's $$$ prices get you something better than a McD's burger.

Checkin line was like a line at Six Flags: really long and really slow. This was a Tuesday afternoon.

Good things:
Cleaning staff is phenomenal. So nice. Everyone who cleaned my room noticed I'd benefit from an extra blanket while I was out, and kept the AC as I left it. 5\/5 for cleaning staff, but 0\/5 for everything else I would expect from a hotel (or frankly, anything above a 40$\/night family-run motel).

I literally have bruises on my hips from laying on my side on the bed made of concrete.  

The walls are made of rice paper I think.  We woke up in the middle of the night to a woman screeching at the top of her lungs in the next room over, but you would have thought she was in our room.

When we arrived (and after waiting 25 minutes to get through check in line)  they gave us a non-smoking room in one of the towers.  We walked what seemed like a mile to the room and when we opened the door it smelt like chain smokers had been staying in the room.  My brother is allergic to smoke so we called down to the front desk to ask about changing rooms.

At first they said someone could come up and spray but this room really was bad.  So they had us come all the way back down, wait in line again and then they gave us our new keys.  They wrote West tower on the key binder but the room was in the East tower.  Urgh, another mile of needless walking.

Oh, and did I mention we always travel on a low budget to ensure we get to do a lot of things throughout the year. Because I found a great deal for the Luxor which provided us free buffet breakfast with each night so we were sold on staying here. 

The hotel itself looked spectacular on the outside.but when you entered the first floor (casino level) it was a little dark and dated looking. The trip to our room was a little interesting too - the elevators move sideways going up because of the pyrimid shape and apparently not all of the elevators go to every floor.

Our room was clean, but needed some serious TLC and a remake; a dimley lit room with cracks in walls, wired internet with a hiden cable behind the television, and a bathroom that was a little questionable. However, for the price we paid it was a good room.

Checking in was quick and painless. We paid the extra 20$ to check in early since we got there at 9am on a Saturday. We didn't want to have to worry about our bags. The women that helped us check in was not very friendly and didn't seem to be enjoying her job. However, she was quick.

I stayed here for 3 nights, and paid $35 per night. You can't get much better than that. Of course you have the $20 per night resort fee but that is Vegas for you and you can't get away from that charge no matter what hotel you stay in. The room was nothing special, but it was very clean and that is all I expected for $35 a night. Beats spending $250 a night somewhere else.

There is still plenty to do in this hotel. You have shows like Criss Angel, Carrot Top, The Bodies Exhibit, Titanic Exhibit, you have some restaurants and bars inside the hotel with the casino gambling option as well.

The Inclinator (elevator) is not for the weak at heart.  Seriously, it is an interesting experience.  Wikipedia just told me that it travels up the pyramid at a 39 degree angle...hence the reason it feels like you are going to fall down the entire time you are riding it.

We called the front desk (took 5 minutes for someone to pick up) and the lady told us she will move us to another room. So we have to pack up all our stuff to move to another room. So where do we move at 3am in the morning, all the way to the end of the Tower.

It took us 5-6 minutes of walking just to reach it! And apparently the pyramid leaks water according to the bell boy that helped us move. They put us in a nice room (mold was on the ceiling, we were too tired to care), better then the one before but it was already 4 in the morning by the time we reached it and unpacked, and we were going to check out at 10 am.

So during check out, we ask the front desk if there is anything they can do for us, and this rude manager comes over who seems already mad at us for even asking such a thing. She yells ""we put you in a better room then the one you had before so in our view you have already been comp"". But we were only in there for 4 hours and that was to sleep, we would have been fine with the same room we had before. We didn't ask for a better room, just one that wasn't leaking water! She didn't want to hear it and said she can't do anything for us except comp us a free buffet, ROFL wow thats it?

We sold out and took it, we were hungry and tired. So we get to the register of the buffet and they couldn't find our comp! I was like WTF, COME ON! The lady behind the register took our names and room number down and we finally got in for free (or so I thought). So a half  week later, back at my house I noticed on my back account a $40 change from Luxor, I WAS LIKE WTF!?!? I called and they charged me for my buffet!

The view from the rooms looking down into the pyramid is outstanding, and extremely disorienting! I love the elevator!

I've stayed here a few times, and have never been disappointed. The rooms aren't the fanciest, and fairly standard. They're clean. Have comfortable beds. And that's what matters to me! I'm just there to sleep anyway. I stumble into my room every trip at like 3am, then wake up in the late afternoon to venture Vegas once again! 

The best part of this place is that it's QUIET. At least the rooms in the pyramid are. I've never stayed in the tower. Walls are super thick. Very peaceful, which you can't find much of in Las Vegas. 

The hotel itself... is okay. The theming has been gradually going away, especially in the casino (almost all the well-themed casinos are doing this). The food is decent , but obviously there are a thousand options somewhere else if needed. Never had a problem with staff or valet.

I haven't been here in while and it looks like the Luxor has really put in some hard work to update the place.  Lots of new restaurants and design features, such as beaded curtains hanging from the ceiling over gaming tables, are a cute touch.  They've linked Mandalay Place through the upstairs atrium which is convenient.  Instead of having to walk past nothing to get to Mandalay Place, it looks like they are opening some more restaurants in that space.  Looking up to the top of the pyramid from the atrium is always neat.  

But the timeshare people are super annoying.  They are all over the place and don't seem to recognize that you walked right by them 30 seconds ago!  Ugh.

I did stay here once about 8 years ago and it was very kid-oriented.  You had to take the ""inclinator"" up to the rooms in the pyramid, which went sideways and up instead of just up.  I remember the ""inclinator"" was crowded (it needed an operator and was slow) and the rooms were smaller because of the shape of the pyramid.  Back then, I wasn't really impressed with this property.  Hopefully they've improved the rooms and the transportation to the rooms.

They appear to still be working on the renovations as there are some statutes and tile torn up in the front lobby.  I hope when it is finished it will remain a more ""adult"" property with more upscale dining options to enjoy.  Unfortunately right now it's not enough to keep us there - we ended up going over to Mandalay Place for dinner.  But if they keep up the good work, it could compete with some of the better properties.",2,0,2

Don't get me wrong, it looks beautiful on the outside, but the inside is a totally different story. Because it's a pyramid shape, your hotel room is going to be slanted as well, which makes the hotel smaller than it seems. I remember coming here and the room was disgusting. I found cups from leftover drinks (probably from the previous customers) but still, I can't believe that my room wasn't fully cleaned. I also found strains all over the shower. I made a complaint to the front desk and after arguing for a good 30 minutes, they finally upgraded me to a tower room. It was a little bit better, but I didn't think it was worth coming here. It's also at the end of the strip so you would need to cab it everywhere. Save yourself the money and go towards the main hotels on the strip such as Bellagio.

I did have to give this place one credit though (bumping them up from 1 star to 2). My friend left something at the hotel and Luxor was nice enough to ship it back to NY free of charge.",5,0,0

First off before i even checked in I had employees asking me to put deposits for my next years trip... While my bags are still in my hand before I even check in! Before I made the trip I payed allll fees so I wouldn't have to be hassled with a bill before I even get to my room. The lovely front deal clerk didn't even check to see if I payed because she told me I had a remaining balance of 60.00$. I get the floor manager Gerardo, who explains she messed up and that I did intact pay the fee. I decided to stay at the Luxor only because they had a deal on their rooms. The first day I check in I put the do not disturb sign on the front door and go to take a shower... Not 30 minutes into my super I got a knock at the door. I said one minuet as I dressed myself but the employe let himself in anyways. Once he saw me half naked he said sorry and asked when my check out was...... Let that slide off my shoulders. Next day, same thing happens with house keeping.... Next day, again. Literally three times I get my privacy ignored. So after being a good guest and ignoring these  incidences, I go to find a manager and what does he say?? ""You know that's so rude of my employees. But what do you want."" I told him I want my privacy and that I shouldn't have to ask for anything! He chuckled and said ""you know, I turned 21 a few times myself...."" His name was kelvin or Kevin.


Bottom line is, this is a cheap hotel with no idea of what customer service is. I let multiple problems slide by me and when I finally tried to explain what happens to a manager, they smile and say have a great day. I will be staying at the bellagio next year.",0,0,0

When I found out they put me at the Luxor, I read the reviews on Yelp and called the corporate travel folks and used my considerable executive clout to get moved to MB. When that didn't work, I used my unending charm.  When that didn't work, I cried like a little girl.

So, upon checking in to the Luxor, I braced for the worst and got...much better, thank you. The room is quite nice. Tub AND shower. The bed wasn't bad at all although a pillow upgrade would have been an improvement.

They had $10 blackjack tables even at night and in the bar near the entrance to the LAX nightclub, they have a $10 table in a nice sofa setting. I was in awe of paying $10 for a G&T and a buddy of mine paid $6 for a Red Bull chaser. Ouch. But you can watch the natural and man-made wonders waiting to enter the club. Surprisingly, even on a Wednesday night there was a line to get in.

The hotel covers a lot of ground. I wasn't thrilled with the walk from the room to the casino.

The Luxor is big. It is easy to find.  When we arrived finding the ""right"" place to drop off the car took a little time to locate.  The staff coming in was very nice and professional. However, the man who checked us in gave us no information, and he kept using the term ""guys""  ""You guys"".  I am a university professor\/grandfather and my wife is a physician.  Being referred to as ""you guys"" was inappropriate and unacceptable. 

They upgraded us to a ""better"" room.  When we got to the room, we wondered what we were upgraded from, because the room was clean, neat, yet small.  

The room was a surprise.  There was NO coffee pot nor courtesy bottled water in the room.  There was no refrigerator.  There were no pay-per-view movies.  We couldn't find a list of hotel services and locations.  We couldn't find a menu for room service.  After three days, we are still unsure if they have room service.  We looked it up on the Internet and in fact, they do have room service, but you wouldn't know it if you just checked out the room.

The Casino is huge, but there are few places to eat, and most have very limited hours.  On Saturday, we got back and couldn't find an open restaurant.  We asked one of the security guards at midnight who told us it was the Deli and a McDonalds.  After roaming for awhile we found a group of restaurants open until one outside the hotel..  

The Luxor did a great job getting us to the venue.  There was a shuttle going across the street.  We tried to get information about the tickets and we were given different information.

There is no desk in the room.  It is not expensive to stay here, but the lack of amenities and being forced out of our rooms to get any services seemed like we are being encouraged to gamble.

This place is like a maze. We got a room that was diagonal from the nearest elevator, so we ended up having to walk half the pyramid each time we left and came back. 

Inside, the place is looking run down. The brass doesn't gleam and the dust on the tops of the fake building is starting to form cobwebs. The casino rugs are taped together at some spots, and it is pretty obvious which restaurants and bars were renovated because they look 100x better than anything else. 

The bathroom is also disappointing compared to other hotels apparently of the same caliber (i.e. Planet Hollywood) as ours had no bathtub.

I'll start with the good things. Of which there are few. 

Pros:
Check in was relatively fast considering we got in friday night around 9pm. 

Had a tower room, 10240, and was pleasantly surprised! There was a brand new, large flat screen TV which I was not expecting. The Ethernet cable was very long and stretched all the way to the bed, which was a must since we brought our laptop. Shower was great, as was the deep bathtub. We had two queen beds, one for sleeping and one for piling all of our souvenirs on lol. The bed was COMFY!! It was hard coming back to my cheap, firm bed. 

Even tho we were in a tower room, the walk to the Excalibur walkway was only about ten minutes or so, not too bad. 

And that is where the pro's end. 

Cons:

I knew to expect a Resort Fee, but it was still ridiculous to pay $17 per person, per night for access to the fitness room (which we never used), local paper (which we never got) and internet. The pool was closed so that was pointless. So we basically paid almost forty dollars a day to use the internet. Blah.

Our television didn't work when we first checked in. Now, I understand when you go to vegas, the last thing you plan on doing is watching TV. But my boyfriend and I like to wind down our day by laying in bed and watching television, so this was dissapointing. We called and while we were out, they brought a new remote control to our room, thinking this was the problem. Well, whoever brought it didn't check to make sure it worked, and it didn't. Turned out there was a problem with the TV and a technician had to come fix it the next day. Boo.

On our third night, we heard SCREAMING coming from the hallway. We listened at the door and could tell something bad was happening. I called security and they asked if it sounded like people having fun. Um, no, this is Vegas and I wouldn't call if I heard people having a good time! Ten minutes later, a woman was still screaming bloody murder, and I could here people scuffling and being thrown against the wall. I called yet again and they said someone would be up. Another ten minutes later, security finally arrived. A woman had been beaten buy her husband and there was blood all over the floor. Why it took TWENTY MINUTES to get security up there is beyond me, and very disappointing. 

On our last full day, we had to online check in for our flight and print our boarding passes. We called the front desk and they directed us to concierge. Well, when we got down there, we were told ALL of the printers were down and wouldn't be fixed till the next day! WHAT?!?! First of all, the front desk and concierge are not far from each other, so how did the front desk not know the printers weren't working? Second, I'm sure tons of people needed to have their boarding passes printed, why should it take a whole day to have someone get this fixed? AND THEN when we tried using the self serve stations, those didn't work either! We had to wait hours before we could use them and by then, we checked in so late my boyfriend and I were in a position where we might not be able to sit next to each other on the flight home (we flew southwest).

And lastly, THE TIME SHARE PEOPLE!!!!!! ACK!!!! We initally did pretty well avoiding them at all costs, as they were easy to spot. However, my boyfriend made the mistake of making eye contact and we were sucked in by their tractor beam. After hearing their pitch I started pulling my boyfriend away, and one of the guys kept asking me ""Why don't you want to do it, miss? Why not? Why don't you want to?"", in a very bully-like manner that made me uncomfortable. I get why these people are here, but they should have a code of conduct to follow, and clearly they're allowed to do or say whatever they want to. 

Final summation? It was an okay experience over all, HOWEVER I will never be staying at the Luxor again and would not recommend it to anyone going to Vegas.",6,0,1

When I booked the Pyramid deluxe queen suite I had not read the reviews.  It was after I paid for the room and went to the reviews a day later was when I became alarmed by the negative reviews regarding the Luxor.  In all fairness I did contact guest relations and went point by point of my concerns based on the reviews.  Jeff from guest relations addressed my concerns and offered me a good faith gesture which I did decline but greatly appreciated.  Some of the reviews were about the elevator, the room, the check in line, the dilapidation of the pyramid.
So I get to the hotel at 3 pm to check in and yes there is a line but it was moving quickly and there was a gentlemen there who was very helpful as he was letting people in line know when a check in desk was available I didn't catch his name but he was very helpful and friendly.  So I get up to the window and Kayle checks me in.  Now this Front Desk young lady was helpful, friendly, personable, and easy to talk to she made checking in a nice and enjoyable experience.

So from check in to check out was a great experience.   The only complaint I have was at the Buffet ""More"" inside the Luxor which definitely didn't live up to its name because we paid 20 Plus each for this but over half the buffet was out of product and this was around 6:30 pm.

After housekeeping cleaned the room the next day it was cleared up do wife found a housekeeper hoping to get the situation fixed. She came back empty-handed and said the housekeeper told her they didn't get washcloths or bath mats delivered. 
Then I thought okay let's go to the pool to forget this 
No dice there -- the pool was closed off 
After a frustrating phone call it was apparent that the attitude at the  front desk  was  --too bad
Then with all of that we still got nailed for the resort fee--- What?
Wife called again and she was told that all of that while true isn't what the resort fee covered?
It was like having an debate at Alice in Wonderlands Tea Party
It was nuts 
Thus used to be a great property but something has gone wrong with the management and wife and I are going to vote with our wallet and stay elsewhere in the future.",1,0,0

The first night was horrible, our room air conditioner was broken, and it was the week of LV first real heat wave, and the daisy music fest, so there were screaming drunk (and apparently high) young idiots everywhere. We were in the Pyramid and I couldn't take it anymore so around 11pm I walked down to the front desk to complain about the heat.  The girl I talked to said if I was still unhappy in the morning they will call a maintenance man to our room.  So we stuck it out until about 6am, and I ventured to the front desk again to demand that something be done.  The nice lady at that time gave us a new room in a tower near by.  The room was nice and chilled.  We also liked the coupon book she gave to us, it apparently was supposed to be given to us when we originally checked in.  She was surprised we didn't have one already.  We also went to the buffet, it was ok as well, but didn't expect the four seasons.  Might return, but not in summer time.",0,0,0

I have personally stayed at many other upscale hotels in Las Vegas, but for an honest and reasonable price, the Luxor is where its at.

The Luxor provides the whole Vegas feel, with their iconic structure and design, and like I said, for a very reasonable price. The few disadvantages are that its more towards the beginning of the strip, so a little walking will be done to get more into the middle of the strip, but the connections to the Excalibur and New York New York, make it a little easier to get ahead on the Strip. I'd say this hotel is very kid friendly and also provides a fairly big casino.

The Luxor is also home to ( believe it or not ) probably the best or one of the best shows i've seen in Vegas. I have to admit I was very skeptical but after reading the reviews I had to give it a try, and it did not disappoint one bit. Hilarious show, its a must see.

I also enjoy the Luxor's pool area. Very classic Egyptian feel to it, almost like an Oasis of endless water. Club LAX is also one of the nicer clubs I have been to in Vegas, and i've been to some very trashy ones before.

Overall, great place. They can add a little more excitement to the Casino floor, maybe more music, party atmosphere going on but other than that, good job.",1,0,0

We got to the hotel around 12:45am and had to wait nearly an hour to check in. Once we got to the checkin desk we were told that the room we had booked (2 queen beds in the pyramid) was not available and the only available room was a king size room in the east tower. When we told them that we needed two beds they offered to bring a roll away bed. After talking to the manager we were told there was nothing they could do that night, but that they would switch out the room in the morning.

The room that we were put in was awful. Every single piece of furniture in the room was damaged, there was peeling wallpaper, cracked tiles in the bathroom, and a fire hazard with the plugs.

Here is just some of the horror I witnessed last weekend...

The worst part for me is room.  I had a reservation for a king non-smoking, and received a 2 bed smoking room.  The bed was ratty and old; motel 6 quality crapheap.  And most shameful, they have the AC on half power so the room is always warm.  I have read a lot of reviews noting the same AC problem.

The rooms and casino have not been maintained.  There was black stains on the sheets, scratches all over the bathroom door, and what appeared to be dried vomit on one of the elevator doors.  The casino is smokey and tight and a lot more ghetto people are walking around there now.   

Literally, half of the elevators that led to my room were broken, so the wait was ridiculous.  One time I had to wait 25 minutes to go downstairs.  You are constantly waiting in the Luxor.  Valet takes between 15-30 minutes, having your bags brought to your room takes 30 minutes, buffet line is 15 minutes.  I lost about 3 hours of my weekend waiting on the Luxor.

They are renovating a lot of the pyramid so there is loud ugly construction everywhere.  They used to have Blue Man Group and club Ra hopping.  Now they have fucking Carrot Top as their main draw.  Seriously.  Carrot Top.  The crowd used to be pretty and fun, now they are walmart ghetto.

They also have these salesmen constantly badgering you in the main lobby and throughout the casino offering ""free comps!"".  I have not seen this occur anywhere else on a strip casino.  

In conclusion, it's really quite depressing what the Luxor has turned into.  It used to be fresh, clean, prompt, and filled with fun people.  Now its an overpriced pile of hot manshit.  I will never be going back there.

But, with the kind of traffc that place gets it could have been much worse than it is. The casino was pretty good with fairly attentive drink waitresses. We went to the buffet a few times and although the lines were long, it was worth it. The pool area was huge and there were a ton of chairs, even when it was crowded.

A grand entrance upon check-in no less!   Mind you --- not from alcohol, it was food poisoning during the drive from LA to Vegas!  Yuck!  PS.  Thank you to the housekeeping staff!

LOBBY -- Line was long at check-in, but lots of hotel agents...15 or so...so the line moved nicely.  The lobby gives good central access to the casino, restaurants, bars, gift shops, and a Starbucks.

MY ROOM -- Nice decor, egyptian themed, clean, and very comfortable.  Flat-screen TV, and lots of pillows.  The resort fee is a very moderate $15\/night.  This will get you the wifi included in your room.  One note, no wireless as of 12\/18\/2011!  Really?  I had to plug my laptop into a short CAT5 cable...no good.  

While I can appreciate AC\/DC's ""Back In Black"" or Def Leppard's ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"", it was Neil Diamond's ""Coming to America"" that kept me from sleeping.  The music blasts from the lobby and thru the casino, and with the way the rooms are situated, the room's door faces the lobby.  Turn it down, Man!  I'm trying to get some sleep!

RESTAURANTS\/FOOD CHOICES
--- Pyramid Cafe - a decent little spot.  A good alternative to the buffet.  Really nice service.
--- More Buffet - Eh.  A huge place in the basement floor, with 2-4x duplicated items, so the selection is one of the least of any buffets.  More is less!
--- T&T (Tacos & Tequila) Cantina - By far, this is the coolest and best experience offered here.  I didn't get a chance to eat here, and feel like I missed out.  Next time in Vegas, it's on my list to dine at.  Not only beautifully designed, but they had one of the best mariachi bands I've ever heard.
--- Backstage Deli - Didn't have the opportunity to eat here, but I was very surprised at the ridiculously inexpensively priced menu.  Great for a budget! 
--- Tender Steakhouse - Didn't try this place, but it has absolutely no energy.  Not busy at all, even on a Friday or Saturday night.
--- Blizz - great self-serve\/weigh frozen yogurt place.  They also have crepes, both breakfast types and savory -- and it looked great.  Super cute and nice girls.

BARS
--- Liquidity, a new bar that opened within the last couple of years, was nearly empty on both Friday and Saturday night.  I believe something wasn't working with the normally cool wall-of-water backdrop on the bar.  It wasn't fully lit, and boring compared to when I first saw it during it's opening 2 years back.
--- Aurora, is connected and opens to the lobby.  Eh.  Nothing special.

CLUBS
--- LAX -- Apparently this is 95% of why people come to the hotel that aren't already guests.  The place, the line-up, the buzzing amount of 20-somethings was quite crazy.  I didn't go, but it seemed nutty to get in.
--- Cathouse, looked very cool, an ultra-seductive lounge.  Didn't go in, but I think this may be worthy to check out.
 
SHOWS\/EXHIBITS
--- Criss Angel Believe - Saw this show about 2 years ago.  Then, it started off very slow for the first 30 mins, and then took off and was off-the-hook.  Totally recommend.
--- Bodies, is disgusting, but very worthy if you can stomach it.  After, you will become a vegetarian.  Does it also have to share a wall with the T&T mexican cantina?

VALET\/OTHER -- Stay away from the valet, including check-in, at 6pm-ish, and expect a long wait from 10p-12p.  It's near impossible for the process to take less than 30 mins.  For pickup, they use an automated ticket system...and it's pretty efficient.

SUMMARY -- I think you have to get a real good deal to stay here and be okay with it.  Personally, I would chose somewhere else to stay if at all possible.",9,4,2

The last time we went we got upgraded to a King pyramid suite for free so I asked about upgrade options this time.  Paid upgrades were the only options this time, so I paid for an upgrade for 1 of my 2 rooms, so my guests could experience the same suite we had 2 years ago.  Our front desk representative made it seem as though the suite we were getting was in a really great location at the very top of the pyramid on the 30th floor. When we opened the door to the room, we were greeted with a pungent smell that was a cross between pickle juice and a solvent (weird, I know!), the Jacuzzi (not a Jacuzzi) tub was peeling on the bottom and the access panel to the tub was broken and hanging open. I cut my finger on the panel trying to close it. The suite was also smaller with half of a living area and not much larger than a regular room.    
I called to complain and they did assign us to a different room that, again, was in a better location and a larger suite.  We were told to wait for someone to come up to bring us new keys.  Two phone calls and about 20 minutes later the bell hop called and asked us to just come down to the desk because the room we were in was ""out of the way"" from our new room.  So we went down and got our new key, picked up our own bags and went to our new room.  Besides the smell of the food court that was very strong on the hall, the room was better on the 11th floor but we were still disappointed after wasting all that time. 
Overall, the rooms are showing their age, but I guess that's what you should expect for the money.  They were clean place to sleep, but if you are going for quality, convenience and a cool pool, pay more and stay somewhere in the middle of the strip.",3,0,0

Since it was an early flight and we had a two hour drive to the airport we decided to stay overnight at the Luxor and had a good old time. We checked in at 2:45 (15 minutes before the allowed time but no issues). The line took about 15 minutes to get to the desk which is typical in Vegas. We went to our room which faced the airport and went in and it was warm. Maybe 80-82F. Granted it was 112 outside but it should be cooler in the room. I checked the AC and it was set as low as possible so I called housekeeping and they said it would be checked into. We left to gamble and have dinner and came back around 7pm and it was still warm but the control panel was open so someone at least looked at it. As the sun dropped the temp became comfortable but never below 78 I would say. 

No one called and no one fixed it, not impressed with that.

We went to the Chris Angel show and enjoyed that, had dinner at one of the lower priced restaurants in the casino which was reasonable price and decent food. 

My daughter is an adult so this was a good place for her but they have dancers in the casino that look like strippers and I would caution any families to not stay here.

Overall had a good time but felt for the money it was not worth it. I could have stayed at a casino on the strip for half of what I paid but wanted to give my daughter a nice bonding experience.

Had looked forward to staying in ""The Pyramid,"" but, alas, our room was actually in the tower next door.  Bummer.  Quite a walk, too. I'll break it down as to why I gave 3 stars (and that is generous).

HIGHS:  Very unique hotel with elaborate Egyptian decor
             Check-in easy (we did pay the $20 early check-in)
             Staff very courteous, especially the concierge staff
             Room was clean and spacious, had a separate soaker tub
              Comfortable bed, (but linen thin and cheap)
             Food options plentiful
             The TITANIC EXHIBIT (so incredible!)
             Carrot Top (his show was truly one of the BEST comedy shows we            have ever seen!)
              Very efficient valet service and taxi service - staff exceptional
              Decent pricing
              Buffet at MORE was very good, lots of selection and quality
              Laundry service was fast (although quite pricey).

LOWS:   Not all the pools are accessible to everyone, have to pay extra for one, even though you're already paying a $25\/day ""resort fee""
              No refrigerator or coffee maker in room
              Pool area closes at 7pm - maybe they should consider leaving it open to ADULTS ONLY 24 hrs. 
              Fast food court is the only option for late night meals 

So you would think since my highs outweighed my lows, I would have given a better rating. Let me explain.  A couple of things happened during our stay, which left a big impression on us.  
     1.  After we came back late one night to Luxor after a show, we witnessed 2 big, full, heavy laundry bags being tossed over from way up high by some stupid idiots. One of the bags nearly hit a man who was only several feet away when the first one hit.  It potentially could have killed him! When security came, they told us stuff like that happens all too often, unfortunately.  So the rest of our stay, we were very alert when we were walking anywhere in the open! 

     2.  This is the BIG REASON WE WOULD NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN - 
           The constant barrage and harassment of the people trying to promote the timeshares. They try to trick you on arrival by posing as hotel staff and ""giving you"" discounted tickets to shows. Even though we politely declined, they still hounded us the whole time we were there. You couldn't walk in or out of the hotel, or just walk around without one of them stopping you. We had to get creative on ways to avoid them! We visited many of the other hotels during our stay and didn't encounter anything like this in any of the other properties. We heard several other people at dinner one night complaining about the same thing.  When I checked out, I let the front desk staff know how annoyed we were by that, and he just said, ""yeah, we hear that a lot."" Well, maybe that's a clue that they are running off business and should be stopped. 

Long rant I know, but every opinion helps others make informed decisions.  I wish I would have researched a little better before we chose Luxor.",3,1,1

The hotel is definitely an interesting one, kind of fascinating from the outside but not as spectacular on the inside. It's pretty aged and you definitely wouldn't use the word ""fancy"" to describe it. The elevators run diagonally upwards to each floor. The hotel layout I wasn't that fond of. Since the rooms are all on the sides of the pyramid the casino and lobby and everything else happening downstairs is a giant open area and if you're a light sleeper you won't survive here. All night all you hear is the entertainment, sounds from the casino, and the smell of smoke since the rooms aren't separated from the rest of the hotel like they are at Planet Hollywood.

Luxor is a little out of the way and we didn't even try to get food around here.

From the moment I attempted to check into my ""reserved"" room I was treated like my time and money did not matter. I understand that hotels overbook with an expectation that a certain number of reservations will cancel. That being said, I still think it's reasonable to assume that when you pay a deposit to hold a room, that room will be available to you. A completely unapologetic staff member was not willing to do anything to accomodate my group. Well, she did offer to put us into a regular room as opposed to the suite I had booked... For an additional $230 of course. We had no other choice but to take the ""only suite left"" and have an awkward sleeping situation with just one bed. Our stay only got worse once we got to the room. It was disgusting!!!! It smelled of vomit, had peeling paint on the ceiling and trash in the cabinet. A call to the desk did little as we were told again that this was the ONLY room available and also informed that the hotel has a policy against extra blankets and pillows. Great, we can sleep uncomfortably in the same bed and now share blankets too! 
You wouldn't believe how astonished I was when a friend of ours arrived to check in a few hours later and was offered a free upgrade to a queen suite..... The exact room I booked, but was repeatedly told was unavailable. 

The only small saving grace to our time at the Luxor was Kim at the Mlife check in desk who managed to be an upstanding person while working at 3 a.m.  Kim easily found us a queen suite on the same floor that had been properly cleaned. Kim was very empathetic and understanding to the situation we were put in and really helped us out. If the Luxor has any chance of people looking past the run down rooms and arbitrary policies, they need more employees like her. She is the single reason that I stayed the second night ( thankfully in a clean room with sufficient beds) and the only thing that helped get the bad taste out of my mouth from the terrible service we received. 
I am still astonished that I paid almost $600 to be expected to deal with the condition of that room and the service I got. I am thankful that Kim so kindly found us a new room despite that ""there were none available"". I really did love waking my friends and moving all our belongings across the hotel floor at 3 a.m. though. Not quite the memorable Vegas story I was hoping to go home with.",4,1,0

I work for the government, so we are basically required to take the ""deal rate"".  Anyway, I waited in line for about 30 minutes to even get checked in, and then the woman claimed my hotel stay was not ""paid for up front"", and that I needed to pay for it.  I provided a copy of the receipt and authorization showing it was paid for, but she still showed in the system it wasn't.  I told her, ""How could I have a credit card authorization and a confirmation from this hotel showing it is paid for, if it hasn't been??""  She then went to talk to a manager...and came back over 20 minutes later.  I didn't get a ""sorry"" or ""thanks for waiting"", she just gave me my room key without saying anything.  

My room was supposed to be non-smoking, but when I opened the door the smell of smoke was overwhelming!  The entire room smelled of smoke, including the bedding.  I realize all of Vegas is somewhat smoky since it's legal there to smoke in the casinos, but the sheets shouldn't smell like it if they wash them.  Yuck!

1) There was an exposed pipe in our bathroom. Harmless but just ugly to look at. 

2) There were long strands of hair on the hand towels. Gag!

3) I've stayed at plenty of motels in my lifetime, and never have I encountered such tacky comforters before! I had a laugh attack for a good 10 minutes just looking at them! It consists of row after row of people in Egyptian garb. I know there's a theme and all but DANG! 

4) We didn't have a fridge to store our beverages. Even motels have small refrigerators.

5) Our AC was tweakin. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. 

6) The employees were horrible at giving directions. Instead of pointing me in the right direction to the pool, some heiffer named Macala tried to con me into paying for some real estate tour in exchange for a discounted stay at the Luxor. Lady, I don't plan on staying here again.

7) Finally, to somewhat quote what a man said in the elevator, ""The Luxor was ahead of its time when it first opened, but now it's far behind.""
Amen, baldie! 

The pool is nice though. I can't swim for shit, not even float, so it was nice to have such a large shallow area of 3 1\/2 feet to just relax in. And because we had a room key, my party of 5 was able to get into LAX for free on Saturday night.",0,1,1

We were in town for a soccer tournament and although the team had lined up another place to stay, we wanted to get in a day early. I managed to find a discounted room rate and was expecting to stay in a tower room.

We ended up getting in late and when we checked in, the gentleman confirmed our pyramid room. I was pretty stoked, since we had the kid with us and I felt it was a pretty cool experience to stay in the pyramid.

The gentleman at the front desk was very pleasant to us and it was nice that he was so friendly after our travels. Our room was a nice room, I mean, it wasn't extravagant by any means but nice. 

I thoroughly enjoy the Luxor. More so than other hotels I have stayed in in Vegas. The dealers are nice, it isn't impossible to find a server and I feel I have an overall more enjoyable time wandering around in here than other casinos. 

After playing for hours and hours we started to walk back to the room and a staff member offered free tickets to 2 shows. Unfortunately, we had to decline due to our 3rd person being a minor, I was still impressed we almost got free tickets. 

I would definitely stay again and again. I would also recommend checking out to anyone who never has. I mean, come on, it's a pyramid.",1,1,0

ROOMS: The rooms were updated. We had a suite that had a living area, a jacuzzi tub inside, and a nice updated bathroom. Because we were so high up, we got to look down over the casino. I'm afraid of heights so it was a little terrifying, especially since there isn't really anything but a small wall to keep you from climbing over. I wonder how many drunk people accidentally plummet to their demise?

Because the hotel is in the shape of a pyramid, the elevators move in a diagonal. The rooms are set up that way, too. Because of this odd shape, there are weird pockets of empty space where furniture doesn't fit which I'm guessing was a interior decorating nightmare for the poor designers. Overall, the room was nice and clean and since it was non-smoking, smelled fresh the duration of the trip.

POOL: This was nice and it's located near the parking structure. They provide towels and a lot of adult beverages at the pool. They aren't the cheapest ($30 for a bucket of 6 beers) and we went with the Shocktops which actually came in can form. I'm guessing it's because you can't have glass by the pool, but if you're a Bud drinker, the cans are aluminum so you're okay.

The water is shallow and they have some pedestals in the middle where you can lounge or do as we did and rest your drinks on it. They have the VIP cabanas and pool for those people that think they are high rollers and plenty of lifeguards on deck in case you drown.

PARKING: Super easy in an adjacent structure. You don't have to maneuver much through the casino to find the check-in area. They even have a motorcycle parking area if you're on two wheels. 

INTERNET: We could never connect, so if you're in need to do work, I would maybe try to find another spot in the hotel.

If you can get a cheap rate, it's worth it. Especially if you're just going to be out on the town anyways.",18,13,14

Minuses: crappy old TV that buzzes loudly when it's on, really noisy hallways that echo so when someone down the hall leaves their room at 2am, you hear it and wake up; questionable house keeping. The room next to mine ordered room service 3 days ago and put their tray outside their door on the floor. It's still sitting there today. I've seen maids go by, but apparently it's ok to leave food sitting around for days. Good thing there wasn't much food left on the tray- they could easily have a rodent problem.",1,0,0

Yeah but I guess you pay for what you get. The lounge and casino area are nice but because of the unique pyramid shape of the building, it is easy to get lost. You feel like you're doing laps the entire time.

The restaurants inside were expensive and the food was mediocre at best. Rice & Company is an Asian fusion place. I spend $30 on Americanized imitation Chinese food and it was not good.

My room was clean, but it was small and old. The shower drain was clogged so the water did not drain down during a shower. Big minus for me there.

The only thing I was to do was to show up and add fuel to the fire that was the party. The hotel itself, judging from what I recall from the party - the room was nothing special other than the fact that it could hold a dozen plus people including alcohol. ;D The inclinator things were alright. I have to admit that the place is confusing - not that I really care at that point. Not many things matter when under the influence and surrounded by a bunch of friends. After what seemed like an hour of drunk asking we finally found our way to the front. Don't ask me how, but somehow we ended up in a limo on the way to Rain. HAHAHAHA! That's good enough for me.

Thankfully the Luxor didn't disappoint. For the price, we got a nice room, decent bathrooms, and the room was relatively large (we got a free upgrade to a tower room, so I didn't get to witness the awesome of the Inclinator). 

The breakfast buffet was good (I had a wicked hangover and was in dire need of a decent breakfast and was very happy with what I got). Didn't have the other food options though. Also, there's a walkway to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay if you don't feel like taking the Tram (it's also a good way to get onto the strip and avoid those extra 10 minutes of heat walking outside).

The only downside is how far down the Strip Luxor is...cabs are sooo not cheap. I'll do a review of LAX separately.",0,0,0

The hotel is very Unique and massive.

Now, I have had a wonderful time bring IN Vegas! 

So, into our stay here at the Luxor. 
My husband and I are currently still here in the room until Tuesday.  We have been here since Thursday for our 1 year wedding anniversary. 

So, the check -in takes forever. We waited around an hour. Then they tell us that they now charge for parking. WHAT?! Yes, the rate is only $8.00 a day, but I find it ridiculous. No other hotel charges to park. Only MGM GRAND hotels. 

We got to our Pyramid ""Deluxe"" room. I'm not sure where the ""deluxe"" comes in. There is no coffee maker, no refrigerator and the rooms are drab at most. 

They charge $25 a night to rent a fridge. 
The bed is subpar.  
Everything is very outdated in the rooms. 
There is some damage to the room, like chipped lamps, mismatched lamps, damage to tables, and the fan in the bathroom squeals for a about 4 minutes until it stops and then it sounds like an engine. 
Shower head is not the best. It's old. 
Peeling wallpaper.

The entire hotel smells of an old ashtray that hasn't been washed. I understand that smoking is allowed in the casinos, but the other ones we have been to have great ventilation unlike here.
The rooms have conjoining doors, so when our neighbors were partaking in their ""smoking"", we came Into our room and it smelled so badly of Marijuana you would have thought we were smoking it. 

We have been here 4 days and they have not changed our sheets at all.

The In room dining....NO! JUST SAVE YOUR MONEY!! 
We ordered an omelet, bisquits and gravy, orange juice and a side of hash browns..... $68.00!!!!! 
The food was absolutely HORRIBLE!!! 
Nothing was homemade, it was not hot at all and the orange juice was nothing but pulp. 

MORE The Buffet......for $58.00 I expected it to be amazing!! NOPE!! The food was gross and the buffet was small.  Not a lot of variety at all. 

Now the great things about this hotel....
It's definitely unique.  I love the look of it. 

TENDER STEAKHOUSE......AAAAMAZING!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!! FANTASTIC FOOD!!!!
THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST PART OF THIS HOTEL!!!!! 
We went here for our anniversary dinner and it was PHENOMENAL! Amazing service as well. 
When we made reservations before we even got to Vegas, we let them know my allergies and that it was for our anniversary.  
They made sure we didn't get anything that would affect my allergies as well as after we finished our dinner, we were going to order dessert. Well they didn't bring us a menu for it, but the Manager sent us a chocolate truffle cake with ice cream on a plate that said Happy Anniversary.  On the house!!.
This is the BEST part if this place!! 

Needless to say, the next time we come to Vegas, we will NOT BE staying here again! 

Seriously, spend a few extra bucks and stay somewhere else!!!!",2,1,0

We had stayed here a couple years ago and found it to be nice for the price. So when it came time to book our trip we chose it with the hopes that it would be as good as last time. We were wrong on so many levels!
 It started when we got to the hotel and had to wait 20 minutes to even pull into valet. The bell hop was rude and did not know the first thing about customer service. When we got inside we were greeted by the oh so welcoming smell of milldue and wet carpets with a touch of fast food. We got to the counter and we were barked at by the lady to hand over our credit card and Id. When she pulled up our reservations she said we owed an extra 50$ then what I had on my confirmation print out. We immediately challenged her and she snapped at us that she would get a manager. Well the bell hop could have been the manager at this rate because the guy who came over the so called ""manager"" knew nothing. They couldn't figure out how we could have possibly got the rate we did. After the lady made a couple more snappy comments she corrected the price and we were sent to our room. It took at least 20 minutes to wait at the elevators to get up there. Once in the elevators we quickly learned that we be praying for our lives quite a bit this weekend. The elevators shook as if we were on the ride tower of terror. They had dints and dings, it looked as if someone has shot a gun and watched the bullet bounce around. The tile was cracked and the mirrors looked as if they could still have Elvis's finger prints on them. Once exiting the elevator We were shocked to find scraped up walls, dirty carpet and a full blown smell of the greasy McDonald's that was directly below our room. Our room was extremely outdated, the floors were dirty and the shower barely had water pressure. 
House keeping was a night mare. Your sheets don't get changed and your room doesn't get cleaned. We put a chair up on the table to take an automatic picture and it stayed there the entire trip. Just for entertainment we left a carton of empty cigarets open to see if the maid would clear the trash and of course she didn't. The worst was my friend who had a little to much fun the first night got sick on the already crusty ground and of course she cleaned it up with a towel but it needed to get vacuumed and actually gone over by a maid. They never even cleaned any of it up and it was clearly visible it was bright red!!! The second night we laid a towel down over the area to cover it. The next day the maids preceded to just walk on the towel as if nothing was wrong! Gross! 
The two most appalling parts or this hotel were one the room service carts with old food on them that lined the hallways we kept track they stayed there for over two days collecting more trash, old food, and mold. The second worst thing was the moldy flowers in the lobby. They have two large vases filled with orchids that are dead and the water is covered in a couple centimeters deep of mold. 
The food at the restaurants was terrible not to mention the coffee tasted as if they had grabbed it off the rotting room service carts and microwaved it before serving it to us. 
I have stayed at some shitty hotels one being the Sahara I mean it does not get worse than that but I would pick that over Luxor at this rate.
The funniest part of this whole situation was when we were walking through Excalibur and a customer service rep stopped us and asked if we wanted a free weekend at the Luxor not strings attached. My friend and I both looked at each other and busted out laughing saying NO!! He asked why we wouldn't want a free weekend in Vegas we responded with have you been in that place? He looked confused. He obviously has not!! 

If you are considering staying here RUN!! DON'T do it!! You will regret it! This hotel is marked as the suicide capital of the US on one website and I cannot imagine why!",0,1,1

When booking the room, we were told that we'd be able to get a roll away bed at no extra cost because we had not exceeded the room limit of 4. We called down from our room and spoke to a man named Kirk. We told him this and he said there would be a fee of $35\/night. We let him know thats not what we were told when booking. He then proceeded to be extremely rude to me. He said that I was a liar and that I never had that conversation with the booking agent because ""that's not something that usually comes up."" However, we asked when we booked because this was a deciding factor for us. We had 4 people in the room and wanted to be sure all of us would be comfortable. The plan was one person on each bed, one on the rollaway and one on the couch. Most other hotels have double bed rooms with a pull out included already, but they cost more. But here the price was cheaper and we thought we would have the rollaway. So that's why we asked and ultimately decided to book with you all. Kirk went back and forth with me and was extremely condescending and rude. I was just going to leave it alone but I wanted his name. When I asked for his last name he said ""I'm the only Kirk here, you don't need my last name."" I asked if there was anyone else that I could speak to and he said he was the only one there (which turned out to be a lie). He said another manager would be there in the morning but he didn't know who (another lie). I then asked if he had a badge\/ ID number since he refused to give me his last name, and Kirk hung up on me. So here it is, 1 something in the morning, we are tired but now we have to go down to the lobby and speak with someone in person since Kirk hung up on us. We go down and ask for Kirk specifically and he comes out of the back and completely ignores us. I know it was him because they have their names on badges (which have their last names on them. So it's not like his full name wasn't public knowledge anyway. He just wanted to be rude to us). So instead, we speak with a man named Alex. He said he was another manager on duty (Kirk told us no one else was there but him). Alex basically told us the same thing about the rollaway fee, but was much nicer. He also told us there were 3 managers on duty and that there was a list he could look at to let us know who would be there in the morning (Kirk said he had no way of knowing). Alex was much more helpful and acccommodating. He allowed us to have the rollaway for the weekend but only charged us for one night. But because of this experience with Kirk, I will not be staying here again nor will I recommend to anyone else. We paid a lot of money to stay there this weekend (we booked two rooms, the deluxe pyramid queen room and a run of the house room) and did not expect to be treated so horribly.

Also, we requested 4 sets of towels Saturday afternoon. I understand things get busy with housekeeping requests, but it seemed like we had been waiting for 45 min to an hour for the towels. I called down and told the operator that we had requested towels about an hour ago. She says ""I see here that it's actually only been 30 mins. They're very busy, but will bring them up soon."" And then hung up! What is it with the staff and hanging up on people?! The customer service all around is just horrible. What's the point of paying lower prices when you can't even be comfortable during your stay? It'd be worth it to pay more money at another hotel where the staff treats the customers muh better.",5,1,1

Since Luxor is one of the closest casinos to the airport, I recommend you take a taxi instead of waiting around for a hotel shuttle. The cab fair was about $14.  

Since we arrived around 9am, we didn't bother trying to check into a room since they were still working on check-outs. We left our bags at the bell desk and did some walking around before returning the casino around noon to try to check in. BEWARE: we stopped immediately by some people dressed in suits asking us if we were checking in and brought us to a desk to get our ""welcome gift"". Turns out they were offering free show tickets - the catch is you must agree to a 3 hour time share tour! No thank you! We were pretty much bombarded by these people throughout our entire time in Vegas, so I won't hold it against Luxor - they're everywhere! 

At check-in we were helped by a REALLY friendly woman who I believe was named Marilyn. Because of our MLife room comps my boyfriend and made the reservations for each night separately but it was no problem to join the reservations so we could keep the same room for all three nights. She also informed us that there was an early check-in fee, which we agreed to pay because we were exhausted from our early flight, but she ended up not charging the fee afterall. They also gave us a booklet with a lot of coupons that could be used throughout Luxor and Excalibur. We used several of them.

We originally booked a pyramid room with two queens, but at check-in we were able to upgrade to a king room in one of the towers at no extra cost. We had been told by friends that if a tower room was available, take it! And I'm so glad we did! It was really nice and clean and we had a cool view of the airport. The bathroom was pretty big and had a large bathtub as well as a separate large shower. There isn't a microwave or refrigerator in the room. I'm not sure if it came with a coffee maker because I don't drink it!

Inside the pyramid, on the casino floor, is pretty neat. Instead of just your basic boring casino, you can look up to the top of pyramid. We had dinner one night at Public House. It was happy hour so the drinks were cheap, but the food was expensive. The menu wasn't huge but we liked the sandwiches we ordered. The only other place we ate in Luxor was the Pyramid Cafe for breakfast. They have several breakfast options around $10. I had Red Velvet Pancakes. They were AMAZING but way too sweet. I couldn't finish them.

Since Luxor is at the end of the strip, it's nice that it connects to Excalibur, because from there you can walk to New York New York or cross the strip to hop on the Deuce bus. I prefer to stay mid-strip, but if given the choice, I would always pick the South over the North (think Circus Circus). That end of the strip has a lot of vacant lots, that I'm sure will be built up in a few years, but it just feels a little safer by Luxor.

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would go back to Luxor again if given the opportunity.",7,2,2

It's ridiculous the amount of luxury and pampering that is to offer if you have enough money to drop... and on the flip side it is scary\/disgusting\/potentially-biohazardous where you can end up if you don't.   The Luxor obviously falls somewhere in the middle of those two extremes.

This is a great place to stay if you are looking for a basic room on the strip.  Location location location - this place has it.  It's smack dab in the middle of the action, toward the newer nicer end of the strip.   The prices for the basic rooms here are among the lowest on the strip.  It's true that in most other cities, the amount per night you are paying here would probably get you an upgraded room, but you have to remember that Vegas has a higher baseline price.  (Unless you want to wander off strip - which I DO NOT recommend from more bad\/scary\/unsanitary experiences than I care to admit.)    

Be aware, the basic rooms are very basic.  There is no refrigerator, no coffee maker, and not a lot of frills.  But they are clean and comfortable.  The basic amenities are there.... TV\/Shower\/Bath\/Closets\/Drawers\/Toiletries\/Towels\/Ice\/Glasses\/BEDS\/table\/etc.  (Honorable mention for the pyramid-shaped soap! Miniature anything makes me squeee! hehe.)   Everyone recommended staying in the Tower rooms vs. the Pyramid rooms, as they're newer and a little larger, so we did - although the novelty of the Pyramid rooms was appealing to me, I was overruled.  

Also, the staff were attentive and friendly.  We were three needy women with lots of demands and they met them all promptly and with a smile.  Check-in was fast and easy, and the friendly woman there answered all of our questions about what to do, how to get around, etc.

The hotel\/casino itself is beautiful.    This place is a bit older and some of its shiny has worn off, but I can still appreciate it.    Helllooo it's a pyramid!  How can that NOT be cool?  And the Egyptian themed decor is stunning and beautiful.  You get a little numb to the over indulged larger than life decor after about 8 hours in Vegas, but if you airlifted this hotel and dropped it in the middle of hotel circle in San Diego, I'm certain it would be the talk of the town.

There are a few nice bar\/lounges in the casino - we found ourselves gravitating to Aurora and spending many hours there playing video poker and chatting up the bartenders.    The hotel also offers walkways to the two adjoining hotels (Excalibur & Mandalay Bay) lined with food and shopping for easy meandering from place to place.   They also offer a tram that runs back and forth between the three hotels for those who prefer to skip the walk.  (I could tell you some interesting stories from those tram rides if I were to break the Vegas Secrecy code. lol)

All in all, I really enjoyed our stay here.  Sure I've stayed in nicer\/fancier hotels and I'm sure I will again, but not every time around.  When what  I want is an affordable, comfortable place to rest my head between adventures in Sin City, I will definitely be returning to the Luxor and recommend it to anyone with similar expectations.",7,0,2

Check-in line is not too long maybe 10 people but somehow that takes almost an hour.  They give me the keys and say they only have a room on the second floor. I walk over to the room, and find out its two queens (not the king i reserved) so went back to the front desk where i had to wait for another 30-45 minutes to get a king room on the now open 16th floor.  Its now past 2am have to walk to the other side of the hotel (since there is only one elevator to take you to the 16th floor) then walk to the other side of the hotel once on the 16th floor to get to the room.  Finally get there and find out the air-conditioning is rattling. At this point its 2:30am and i am exhausted so decide to crash, only to realize there is a thin blanket on the bed which made it one of the most uncomfortable night sleeps i have had in a long time.  It is too bad i had this hotel booked for a week.  Will not be staying here again.

Some things to keep in mind when booking this hotel:
1) Outdated rooms.
2) The sheets on the bed are not comfortable
3) Check-in is a nightmare 
4) The room service ends at 1PM!!!!!!!!
5) No mini bar.
6) Depending on where your room is located you may be walking a whole lot
7) The air-conditioning in the rooms are not quiet.",1,0,0

Want a late checkout? Ok, for $10, because we like extortion. (Notably although I have traveled far and wide across the country and into foreign lands, only one random hotel in rural Pennsylvania has ever asked me to pay for a late checkout and it was run by a tiny grumpy hospitality dictator.)

Want a king bed? Have to upgrade for $25\/night. Oh you think you booked that? Sorry their end says no, so you're screwed. Hand over the cash buddy.

From only three pillows on the beds instead of four to the paper thin walls that allow you to hear your neighbors sneeze. Or talk. Or their music. To the weird aftershave smelling shampoo and conditioner mix. Everything is less nice at the Luxor. Stingy with towels. Beds that make you wake up a dozen times a night and an aching back.

Also it's a maze of stretched out spaces so you have to walk around and around to get from one place to another.

Everyone I spoke to but a few Hispanic women were bitchy, curt and had poor customer service skills.

Won't EVER stay again and I have been telling everyone I meet how awful it is, especially my divers so perhaps they can save their other riders from my pain (literally in the back).

It was a bit of a journey to get to our room, but well worth it!  Our room was nice and spacious, with modern furniture - we even had a mini-fridge and coffee maker!  OMG there was also a separate shower and jet tub (perfect for soaking in after a long day of walking around and being a tourist!).

My first stay I was in the pyramid, but moved to the tower.  I highly recommend the west tower as that is closer to the spa.  

Speaking of, there are times of the year that you can get free coupons to get into the spa.  The workout area in the spa is good, but the real attraction for me is the coffee bar, fruit, and juices in the locker room.

There was nothing wrong with our room, but it just seemed like there weren't any nice amenities to make me want to stay there again.

A year ago my husband and I reserved 2 nights at the Luxor. The second morning there, we received word that my mother in law had suffered a brutal attack and was in the hospital undergoing emergency brain surgery. We had to leave immediately. The upper management at Luxor basically said ""sucks to be you"" and refused to even comp us our 2nd night good toward a future stay. We weren't even asking for a refund, although, given the circumstances, I think would've still been honorable. And the incredible thing about it is, the people standing in line behind us as we were checking out, booked OUR same exact room that we had already paid for. So Luxor was profiting twice off of one room for one night. Sweet deal for them. So then, a couple of days ago, Luxor has the audacity to send me an email stating I can book with them for 20% off...some promo crap...are you kidding me?! We will NEVER stay at this place again!

The room in the East Tower was fine and I would rate it about 4 stars but I had to drop stars for the following reasons:

1.  When I checked in I let the front desk clerk know my wife & baby will be coming in on another flight and will need to get up to the room while I'm away to the conference.  So she had me write down my wife's name on the room reservation.  When wife arrived she was told that the name was not on the reservation and she had to wait an hour & a half at the reception with a crying baby and had to clean diapers in the public washroom.  When I talked to the manager on duty later his response was ""What do you want me to do about it?"".

2. There is a loud screeching rumble which sounds like a generator right behind the room we were given that started up around 6:45am every morning we were there.  I did not have to set an alarm as the generator was loud enough to wake all of us up.  Luckily for us, baby normally wakes up around that time anyway.

3. Quite a few annoyances such as at one of the restaurants at Luxor, the waiter gave us the option to charge meals to the room and then came back 15 min later saying they can't do it (with no reason given) and then taking another 15 min to settle our bill with a credit card.

Still, my room was $50\/night + that pesky resort fee of $18. Still really cheap. The public areas are WORN and the eating options are subpar. But it's cheap. My reasons for a 2 star review are (keeping in mind the price I paid):

1. No chain lock on my room door. And very obvious pry marks near the latch, so right away I'm feeling a bit unsafe.
2. Carpet was old and dirty. Like actively dirty - as in the last peoples crumbs were still there....gross. Three days later, yep, still there. Can SOMEONE vacuum?
3. No wifi, paid or otherwise. You MUST be joking - is this 2002? What the hell is a tablet user supposed to do with an Ethernet cable? 
4. Rooms and bathrooms are very, very dark.

In summary, Luxor is perfect for Criss Angel\/Carrot Top fans, cheapskates, people whose corporate travel policy won't pay for the Mandalay (that would be yours truly) and those who are indifferent to personal safety and hygiene.

Ok, get here and first thing the line to check in on a Sunday morning is ridiculous. There are like 4 desk clerks and 20 stations. So wait wait wait, I have to get off my feet so my husband says ""go on over to the bar and play a game and I'll check in, honey"". Well, then he comes rushing back in 45 minutes saying after all that time, they wouldn't let us check in because I did the reservation online and not him.. ARG. So over I go to complete the reservation and we had lost our place in the line from hell. So we wait. and wait. Finally we are allowed to check in. I tell the clerk our friends are staying in #53** east, could we stay on that floor too? ""Oh yes, no prob"". He assigns us our room and says"" OH you must go over to the M-CARD desk to get your MCard because you'll get so many discounts and a gambling credit for every time you gamble on our properties"". Great idea, I think.

I get to the M Desk and the line is literally 40 people long with 2 clerks.... What tha?? If this is supposed to be so great, I better wait, right? I wait..... I wait..... I wait.... And I'm not moving. You know why? Because the desk also serves the VIP people who ALREADY HAVE THEIR M-CARDS"" and whatever they need they just butt up to the front, coz that's how it works. WHAT THA??

My husband is about to divorce me and I'm not backing down - I will have this coveted M Card if it's the last thing I ever do! So FINALLY, I get up there and they take literally 20 minutes getting every detail and aspect of my existence they can gather, give me the card and tell me ""see you when you win and cash in on your points!""

Travel up to what we thought was our room ~ well, because our check in card said it was ~ and cannot find the room number on the floor we were assigned. WHAT THA?

A super nice ""floor person"" from the hotel scurried around and determined we were assigned a room corresponding to the WEST tower but the clerk (mind you I asked for the East tower coz our friends were there) wrote down EAST. Flip! My hub is tired (not thrilled with my 1 1\/2 hour detour to the M Desk) and now we have to travel BACK to the front desk to get the right room assigned? The nice ""floor person"" (these people need to make a living wage, just saying ~ they were the ONLY personal who gave a crap about our visit) let me contact the ""manager"" via a hallway phone and that ""manager"" assured me if I went to the LL level North check in desk, I would not have to stand in line again. GREAT!

K - we get to the LL North desk and I'm promptly (and rudely) told to get to the back of the line (which was long and clerks were scarce) because ""you don't have any right to be in front of these people"". Well, ok ~ maybe she's right in a way, but those people haven't been wandering around the planet looking for a room that doesn't exist (or so I think) and afterall the ""manager"" I had on the phone said no problem, just go up there and tell them I put you in room ""53**) and you will be expiated.

So, Hubbie is fuming (as hubbies will, I'm sure you get it) and (I'm sure because the steam-from-ears and a red neck is a sure sign) so we drag our (thankfully on wheels) luggage all the way thru the casino back to the front desk and confront Jason, the wonderful guy who checked us in. ""Jason!! Dude, that room does not exist!"". ""Wha??"" So he attempts to obtain the focus of a ""manager"" (term used loose -ly) and that manager says ""Wha??"" and it takes her literally 30 minutes to come back from the cubby-hole in which they escape into to tell us what we already knew. ""Jason made a mistake and wrote down EAST when he meant WEST"".  ""Yes, brain-flippin-child, you are so right. Thank  you for researching that.."" I hope her parents did not invest in a college degree, this one...

FINALLY up to our room after a triple-lap jaunt around this grand palace, liking the room, it's ""fine"", not bad, pretty good, I'm thinking. Plop down, bed's not horrible, it's pretty giving. ERG. There are a total of 3 flimbsy pillows for 2 ""major pillow hog"" people. (We're not hogs, just like 3 pillows each ~ is that wrong or unusual? I don't think so"". So I'm starting to forgive this bunch for the check-in line, the M-Card ridiculousness, the ""running all around the resort"" trying to get our correct room endeavor, so Hubbie says ""can you call to get another 3 pillows, my lower back hurts too.)

Well, when Hubbie starts complaining about this so early into what should be a action-packed weekend, I'm on it!

""Hello, housekeeping, I'd like 3 pillows, please, I prefer no down pillows, as hubbie is allergic.""

""Mamm, no ~ you can have 2 pillows only. That's the rule from the hotel.""

TO BE CONTINUED...

""WHAT THA?"" Just 2 pillows? Question; how many pool towels do we get?

""Oh, Maam (again with that label) You'll get at least one pool towel if you wait in line and show your card!"" Thanks alot, that's really sweet..

1. The check in line regardless of the time of day is ridiculous. Fortunately it only took my 30 minutes to get through but at some point the line was close to do the door.

2. Stains- there were stains everywhere. From the bedrooms to the common areas. The entire building needed a coat or two of touch up paint. There was something brown on the wall in my bathroom- don't get me started.

3. I know the elevators in the pyramid go diagonally, however, they sound like they are on their last leg.

4. Don't go to the M Life booth there because you'll spend most of your day waiting in line. Go to another casinos.

That being said, for the price, should I complain? Well, yes and no. I was charged more here for resort fees than anywhere else and the Internet never worked.

The good? There were good points. The bed was so comfortable and the front desk staff were stellar. I had zero customer services issues with them. The food court is open 24\/7 which is great for when you have the munchies.

It sucks because just because you don't pay a lot doesn't mean you should have zero expectations when you stay somewhere. I had no idea that in less than three years I would have had such a different experience here.

Seriously, three times as much for the same thing, but Vegas prices can piss you off if you let it.
We got a good deal on Hotwire for here and it turned out to be pretty good.
There are  nice areas of the Hotel and not so nice.
First we had a room on the 7th floor, disgusting, straight up danky smell from the room and bad view, also it was still occupied?!!!
So trek back the whole way to the front counter  to complain which got us a tower suite.
Nice, huge room, clean, wifi not plug in, shower and tub, not my taste but nice.
Everything is pretty spread out here, there is no sense to it or short cuts.
Staff is nice, but there are way nicer hotels and better located.
There is only one parking area which gets pretty full, also quite a walk.
Resort fee is $20 but thats about average.
They give you a coupon book but its pretty much worthless, alot  of BOGO's to get you in their places.
LAX is insanly full, most of the bars ok but nothing fabulous.",1,1,1

We just used our ice bucket anyways. A\/C unit keeps our room cool but not too cold even on the max which is good in my opinion since we left it on overnight. Bathroom was nice. Thing I have to complain about was the water pressure and the calcium buildup on the shower head. The room was clean and tidy throughout our stay. Bed was soft and comfortable.

May i inform the hotel staff that those long walks that i did just to call u that i need assistance made me have shortness of breath... even though i was suffering from pain and leg cramps i still have to walk that distance just to let u know i need help but to my surprise was the response of the hotel manager of the day which is by the way was even worst and totally unacceptable... i was informed that she didnt know when i can get some assistance bec the security needs to attend to those guests that have a medical problems, now what kind of answer was that... isnt i told u that i was in pain and not feeling good... now that is being insensitive...and lastly, to the very least nobody follow thru was made by the hotel personnel if my concerns were addressed to... i guess that how you handle your guest... well one thing for sure i wont be coming back nor will i never ever recommend anyone to stay in your hotel.

Avoid! Avoid! Avoid! - Hit with a nasty smell of sulfur the minute we drove up. This smell wafted throughout the hallways the entire weekend.  Hotel is overpriced and dated.  Shower door did not close. Toilet seat did not stay up.  Strange shower floor which wasn't firm under our feet. No microwave, no coffee pot, no mini-fridge.

Housekeeping did not replace our water glasses.  Used glassware which was set outside the door was there from the first night to the last.

The ""free"" buffet which was included in the Groupon had a 45 minute wait. When we got to the front it took over 10 minutes for the cashier to figure out how much to pay us. After that, we watched another party of about 12 people get seated, but when we were seated, there were ""no tables for 9"", and we were offered two tables.  After walking by an empty table that would have easily seated 10, and asking for it, the hostess sighed and said, ""you'll have to wait for it to get cleaned"". It was really ridiculous.  And... to top it off - a hair in the food.  UGH. When I asked for the manager, she just justified and defended, ""It's really busy, it's the weekend, etc...""  Really?  A resort can't handle the weekend crowd?

Every hotel representative that we encountered was RUDERUDERUDE.  The most polite person of all were the people associated with the bell desk.

Both rooms were clean and came with the standard promised amenities, but did show signs of wear. I think a renovation will be needed sooner then later. The linens, bathrooms, and room were clean. 

I ate at Tender Steakhouse, T&T(Mexican Restaurant), and the Pyramid Cafe. They were all great . I also ate at the buffet which was just ""meh"", not worth $30. They also have a food court with burgers, pizza, ect... 

There are lots of people trying to sell you future stays at the Luxor. It is kind of irritating, but a good deal if you listen to the sales pitch. I didn't buy in though because I wasn't sure when I would be coming back. 

The Luxor hosts several entertainment shows including Chris Angel and Carrot Top, if you call these two entertainment. I didn't see either of these two because it is common knowledge that they both suck. The Luxor's other shows Bodies, Titanic, and Menopause the musical didn't really appeal to me. Not really a place to stay for the shows. 

The casino itself was great. Friendly dealers, variety of games and slot machines. There is an inside walkway lined with stores that connects to Mandalay Bay. The Luxor gets 4 stars instead of three because the rooms are very reasonably priced.",1,0,0

I'm giving them two stars because of that and also the fact that the lady at Check-in was super helpful and very accommodating.

It was a bit of a turn off that ceiling had leaks. 

The hotel room was stuffy and carpets looked so old. The bathroom was disgusting, wasn't able to shower because of the disgusting thing that just appeared when we were filling the tub. (See pictures) and also the disgusting water that came out of the tub. I left it to fill but saw that. I think something is wrong with the pipes and water system which scares me and is not safe. Disgusting. 

The more buffet was not AMAZING. Honestly not worth the price. The sushi I got looked black which I thought was fish but it was black avocado. The food was basic. Not much to choose on. The cheese ravioli was so weird. 

The shows Blue Man Group & Fantasy was so worth it! Any seat you get is worth it!!!!!!  Additional star because of that! 


Other than the very disappointing stay, it doesn't stop there. The service at Check Out was horrible. I told the lady about my experience in my room and she told me she'll refund me a daily resort fee. And I even said thank you she gave me the receipt and saw that I was charged more. I went back and asked where in the receipt does it say I was refunded and she said ""oh i'll be right back"". For some reason I was charged twice at the buffet, why in the world will I go there twice at the same time period. Showed my receipt and the manager looked annoyed. They refunded me with the buffet  but completely forgot about my disgusting bathroom experience. No refund on the daily resort fee. 

Never come back here unless for the shows. Inconvenient and disappointing.",5,1,1

I had to walk to Mandalay for a convention every day. It's a good 20 mins. walk. If you are attending a convention there I would suggest you stay closer unless you don't mind the walk.

The clothing wasn't expensive but it definitely had a lot of sentimental value and the two items definitely were chic. Since I realized it was gone, the evening after I left, I've been trying to get it back, calling multiple times a day, with no success. I'm certain one of the staff stole it, as the next guest was asked about it and did not see it. It was not reported in lost and found and the bureaucracy of the luxor prevents me from accomplishing anything productive. I even stayed at the luxor a few days later and they wouldn't let me look at the lost and found nor at their database.  If you DO stay here, don't forget anything or else you'll be sorry.

Even so, it is a VERY affordable stay at the Luxor. It's one of the last 2 Major Resorts on the far South end of the Vegas Strip; which lends it to offer some crazy low pricing on the strip! Luckily, the Luxor has a tramway that connects the Luxor with the Mandalay and drops you off at the Excalibur, which is a bit closer to the heart of the Strip. Which, I may add, saves you some considerable time if your walking.
     The Hotel\/Casino has become known for catering to the LGBT culture as far as themed pool parties, nightclub themes, etc.
     The main pyramid is the attraction of the hotel\/casino. Having said all that, the Luxor lacks alot of the ""energy"" found at the other Casinos on the strip.",3,0,0

LOCATION: On the further end of the strip, but right down the street from the airport. We didn't mind the location and were able to walk to Mandalay Bay & Excalibur without going outside.

CHECK-IN: 3pm - the line gets long! Luckily, they have a system down and have multiple desks open to help speed through the line. Wait in line was about 10 mins or so and then we got checked in. Their computer system or something was taking a while to load, so it took a little longer than usual.

ROOMS: You'll either be in the Pyramid or one of the adjacent towers. We had never stayed at the Luxor before and always wondered what it would be like to stay in the Pyramid rooms. We received a King room in the Pyramid and it was aiite. Wasn't anything special, but there was plenty of space in the room! Lots of table\/desk\/counter top space for belongings and instead of a tub, it was an oversized shower. Cool!

ELEVATORS: To the guest rooms are kind of a hassle. You will have to go to one corner of the pyramid to get to the elevator that goes to your floor. The elevators also shake a lot as they are moving diagonally (the edges of the pyramid) instead of up & down.

We spent most of our time at the shops between Luxor & Mandalay Bay and it wasn't a far walk. We even had dinner over at a restaurant in Mandalay Bay. Very convenient to walk to the neighboring hotels.",2,1,1

My check-in took a bit of time. While the line wasn't long and there were several lines open, it seemed some people were closing their lines. When I finally checked in, I had to pay the resort fee upfront - $67.20 - via debit\/credit card. After I was set, the check-in teller provided me a map of the hotel and told me where to find the West Tower, where I was upgraded to (complimentary). 

Finding My Room:
=========== 

Okay, so here's the thing... I got lost. I went to the 5th floor with all my bags and walked around the entire pyramid before I realized I didn't go to the West Tower. I had to 

My View: 
======

In my room... there's none. Oh, look, the slate gray roof from the casino floor. Bwahahahha. 

Tender: 
=====

I used my $20 food credit to eat here. I had the Pumpkin Ravioli and Baked cookies. Mmm delicious. 

Booklet: 
======

Usually booklets are full of crappy coupons that are useless. I used the $20 food and beverage credit I received at check-in and ate dinner at Tender the first night I was there. I had the Pumpkin Raviolo and the fresh baked cookies and ice cream. The credit covered the bill. As much as I wanted meat, I decided to wait until my first ""full"" day here to find one of the local buffets. Considering 1-21 is my birthday, I planned to eat at MORE because you'll eat all day for $35 there, and I really plan to do nothing but live and love life on this day. There's coupons for all of the restaurants in the Luxor, some of the shoppes and the lovely $5 Tee shirt coupon. 

CASINO: 
========

I'm not much of a gambler, but the floor is cool.... but $5.99 for the ATM plus other FEES?! Nah I'll watch TV in my room. 

MY ROOM: 
=========

As stated previously I was given an upgraded room in the West Tower. Unlike the ""basic"" Luxor rooms, this one is a full room that doesn't have a weird angle that everyone warned me about. To be clear, I wasn't tripping on having an angled room in the first place, but it was nice to walk into a full bedroom with 2 nicely made full size beds. The decor was creme brulee and a contemporary deep blue. The bathroom had a separate shower and bath - awesome because I'm hitting up Lush to take a nice long, sexy soak as soon as I get the chance. 

THERE IS NO VIEW. 

You have to pay for the view ... so my upgrade had me looking at the concrete roof of the casino or something. I don't really think I care about the view ... but if you're interested in a room with a view just know it will cost more.

THE BATHROOM IS SPACIOUS - BATH TUB AND GLASS SHOWER ARE NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER BUT SEPARATED. Water flow scarce in the middle of the night. I guess that's when everyone bathes or something. *Kanye shrug*

INTERNET ACCESS: 
================

You only have a gray wired ethernet cord for your room. At first this bothered and worried me. I thought I'd have to push back my trip and go to another hotel - Tropicana - instead. However, I discovered that the cord actually stretches to one of the beds and even the table in my room. And so, that, coupled with the fact that I'm here alone - it's NOT as BIG of a deal unless your laptop does NOT have an Ethernet hookup. (I have a MacBook pro).

MORE BUFFET: 
============

I paid for the all day buffet... I did breakfast and dinner. I was able to get full but I wasn't impressed with the food. Tender has amazing vegetarian - or at least non-meat- based dishes. With that said, I ate what I could and kept it moving. I can see why people weren't satisfied when they came here. It's just... not great for $35... but if you want to avoid starvation, it will do. ;)

TIMESHARE PEOPLE:
=================
 Up and down the Vegas strip you have people offering you all kinds of incentives to go to timeshare presentations in Vegas. Nevermind the fact that nobody gives a FAQ about timeshares anymore... much less the need to pay $20,000 for the ownership of a room for one week every 1 or 2 years, 

When you walk the casino floor, there are timeshare people. When you try to go eat food, there are timeshare people. When you go to the gift store, there are timeshare people. These momofukus are like roaches. 

I'm not even 30 but they'll hound you until you tell them you're not 30. Then they hound you to see if you're here as a couple because they can show couples a tour and then offer show tickets. 

Look, Lauryn will just pay for the tickets to the shows she wants, avoid all your stupid contracts and keep it moving. I don't even give a damn about free when it comes at a price like that. 

EVENING CALL: Probably the best thing here... get your Luxor book, use your $20 credit, get your $5 t shirt then come here and get your free shot in your drinks. Bartenders give free samples of the daiquiris. It's amazing and delicious. I love it. I like Straw Bama, the Call Girl and the Mai Tai. Jaegerbomb i",13,7,4

The room rates are awesome, we got a suite for two nights for about $550, can't really find that anywhere else on the strip. The room came with two queen beds, a jacuzzi, one bathroom, two flatscreens (one in the bedroom\/the other in the living room), and a separate room with couches. It's not at the most convenient location on the strip since it's at the southern end, but as long as its on the strip I'm happy! 

I thought the elevators were really interesting, since they travel along the slanted  sides of the pyramid. We all felt a little distorted the first time riding up to our room. Our room was facing excalibur and a few other hotels, it was a pretty nice view. 

I think if you're looking for a newer more trendy hotel, the Luxor wouldn't be a good choice for you. But if you're looking for a more reasonably priced comfortable stay, I think Luxor does the job! Not to mention that their club -- LAX gets pretty poppin', and its really easy to find a promoter to get your crowd in for free (assuming you have an equal girl\/guy ratio).",0,0,0

I had a tough time on the day of my check-in as Vegas Blvd was closed for a marathon that day. I obviously don't blame the hotel for this, but due to the marathon, they posted a guard at the entrance of the self-parking garage who wouldn't let anyone in without a key-card, I explained that I had a reservation at the hotel, but the guard still made me drive to the front and valet my rental car while I registered, and wouldn't let me park until I had my key-card so that was a bit obnoxious. I was a bit concerned about the check-in process as previous reviews mentioned having to sit through timeshare presentations on the way to the check-in desk. I didn't come across this problem at all, you could see where the timeshare presentations were, but you can easily just walk past them to the registration desk. I didn't find the registration desk to be tough to find as there was pretty clear signage from the front doors leading to it. Registration was quick and friendly, I had a reservation for a pyramid room and they offered a non-smoking room for a small daily upcharge, but I chose not to do this as I'm an ex-smoker so the smell doesn't bother me at all. Everything in the room was clean, if a bit dated. The bathroom had a walk in shower rather than a tub which I prefer. One thing I really loved about the hotel was the smell that they pump in through the air system, it was tough to describe, but I found it very pleasant, and slightly similar to the smell next door at Mandalay Bay. I enjoyed the casino and had some decent luck playing roulette and blackjack. I tried the T&T (Tacos and Tequila) restaurant and had some good Mexican food, I do wish that they had an Egyptian themed restaurant though to match the rest of the hotel. The downsides were that the elevators were very loud and sounded like an elephant going through a wood chipper and there's only one elevator which would go to the floor of your room, so you'd sometimes have to walk the entire way across the casino just to get to the correct elevator. As other people have mentioned the Luxor's location at the south end of the strip can be a bit inconvenient, I wanted to go to the Bellagio one night and I had to take a tram to Excalibur, then walk past New York New York, Monte Carlo, and the whole City Center complex (Mandarin Oriental, Aria, Cosmopolitan) which is about a 1 mile walk.",0,0,0

The lobby looks old and out dated. The elevators are slow, shaky and nerve wracking because they go diagonally instead of straight up and down. In one elevator the casing was loose and we were able to move it! cheesy!

The elevators are super far from most of the rooms, it takes forever to get to and from them. The rooms are OK but worth a lot less than what you pay for.

The beds feel like a old futon and they give you cheap sheets- no comforters

On the last night I used the hot tub, one minute into it the water started turning green!! DISGUSTING!!

Plus to top it off its far from everything on the strip, for the money you pay, you can get something way better.

My favorite restaurant at the food court was the Original Chicken Tenders, they also have a 24\/7 McDonalds. This hotel is HUGEEEE! And is connected to other hotels with lots of other restaurants, and bars. They also do some shows here I believe.

Luxor had rooms for less than $50\/night when we were booking so we chose to stay here despite reviews. Maybe it's just Vegas (or this hotel) , but I'm used to staying at hotels with free airport shuttles so I wasn't a fan of the fact that they didn't have one. Anyway, I read that it was outdated but didn't think anything of it. But as soon as I walked in, I noticed a very distinct old building\/thrift shop\/senior complex odor. Older places on the strip, such as Excalibur, Circus Circus, and The Flamingo also had that really annoying smell. I got used to it, but walking into the newer hotels like The Cosmopolitan was like rubbing salt in the wound because the scented air blowing through the vents was heavenly and I didn't want to leave! 

The interior does look dated, but it honestly wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Believe me, I've seen some ridiculously old hotels and this wasn't too bad. But I will say that someone needs to take care of the walls by the elevator bank on in the main pyramid. They were so obviously peeling off (like literally ready to part ways with the wall) that there's no way the staff didn't notice. 

I also would not advise anyone to eat at any of the places here. I had been looking forward to trying Tacos and Tequila, which happened to be closed for the ENTIRE time we were  there. We stopped at the McDonald's when we first checked in and I can honestly say it was one of the worst I've ever had. How do you mess up fast food? My grilled chicken sandwich honestly tasted wet and raw and I thought they don't even make it themselves?! The buffet was $35 for an all day pass, but I saw the reviews and didn't even bother...

There was free ""wired"" internet access in the rooms, meaning that you literally had to plug in an ethernet cord like it was '01. It was fine for my laptop but my sis had no access on her iPad. I have no complaints about the service, as the rooms were clean and the hotel staff was friendly enough and came promptly whenever we called. However, I seriously doubt I'd ever come here again unless it was to see Fantasy. The location is at the beginning of the strip, so we had to hop on the bus just to get to where all of the real action is.

FOOD: They have a variety of options here from Mexican to Asian cuisine in their food court. We went to Tacos and Tequila and they had a good amount of food and drinks to offer. 

POOL: The pool closed because of a little bit of drizzle, which I have never heard of to be honest. The drizzle was literally a drizzle (no where near close to rain, without thunder). And it lasted less than 10 min. We went back the next day (when it was at 98 degrees) to find it closed by 6pm. IT'S THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER! If you're a pool person, not the place to be.

And while I wasn't terribly disappointed (you get what you pay for), I wasn't thrilled in any way either. Here are some things that make the Luxor sub par. 

*Confusing structure; got lost like 8 times without the aid of alcohol
*Terribly uncomfortable beds; slept roughly the entire trip
*Gross buffet
* Awful air-conditioner in room; felt like the goddamn rainforest when turned on

Some positive aspects of the Luxor...

*Cathouse nightclub; snazzy looking bordello inspired with great specials for females on Madame Mondays
*Cheap rates
*Pretty clean rooms
*Friendly service all around

I walked into the bathroom again and saw that there was a leak... it was coming from the light.  Now I know that sometimes these things happen, and I would normally feel bad for giving a place 1 star for something that might've been out of their control, but their customer service was so atrocious that I feel really justified in giving them the lowest grade possible.

The first time we called the front desk, they told us they were going to send an engineer up to fix the leak.  After waiting for an hour without a visit from the engineer, we gave the front desk a call and they told us they were going to switch us into another room and that someone needed to go to the desk to retrieve the new room keys.

Your really can't beat the Luxor for price and value on the Strip. We're currently staying over Labor Day weekend and the Strip is backed and yet we still got $50 weekdays and $100 weekend nights.  They ran out if Kings and upgraded us to the Tower for free. I've heard the towers are about 15 years newer so the accommodations are still really nice. The bathroom is nice with a separate bathtub and shower. The bed and pillows are extremely comfortable.  The windows are floor to ceiling and we had a reasonable view of Excalibur and the Luxor.

Other negative comments I've read in other reviews are lacking from our visit:

1) Checkin took only five minutes
2) Rooms are in good repair (see above)
3) Service is great. Both the valet and the bell hops were extremely quick.
4) During both visits no one has tried to sell me a timeshare.

We also enjoyed the Steakhouse, Criss Angel, LAX and the Titanic Experience during our visits.  Not many hotels can have such a great assortment of activities under one roof. We're looking forward to seeing Bodies tomorrow.

This being my first time in Vegas, I didn't know anything about the casinos or the lodging situation. Prices during the Christmas holidays looked good so I booked a room here. Omg resort fees. The resort fees were pretty much 50% of the room cost, and what for? Wifi? It was freaking free for everyone when we got there. No special guest access needed for the wifi.

Room was very meh. Originally booked a room in the pyramid but upon check-in, the only available pyramid rooms were on the first floor so they offered us a room in the tower, which was totally okay until we entered the third floor room... Non-existent view, frigid cold temperatures, and loud noise from the outdoor generator\/conditioner. (Disclaimer: If you get a higher floor room, you'll probably be okay.) Beds were definitely a little lumpy and the comforters show a lot of wear. Bathroom was well-lit and spacious...until we saw mold. It's not that I don't appreciate the attention to the Egyptian theme (I really do), but can the bedding be at least replaced with something from the 21st century?

Now location and transportation: super close to the airport (Uber\/Lyft was $7-10) and the structure itself looked great in the early morning daylight. The tram though...who engineered the tram. Seriously, from Excalibur, why would you not have a stop at Luxor before going to Mandalay Bay. I just want to know why you're skipping this casino that's literally IN THE MIDDLE of the two. So instead, from Excalibur, we're taking the tram to Mandalay Bay, getting off the tram to transfer to a second tram in order to head back to Luxor. Does that make sense to you? Sigh. Super inconvenient in terms of location on the Strip. 

I completely understand that each casino has its own appeal and cool distinctions. I'd recommend checking out the Luxor, but please don't stay here.",4,2,0

Unfortunately,  Southwest Airlines experienced a computer glitch on 7\/20\/16; therefore our flight was delayed 5 x. We called the hotel to inform them. We finally made it to Vegas @ 12 midnite; 7\/22\/16 morning. We made it to hotel to check in. Our suite fee was $200.00 or so per nite. Of course we missed our first night, along with events we had scheduled for 7\/21\/16. We asked the front desk rep if we have our suite prorated,  hotel rep said she didn't know. We asked for a Mgr , Ciro came over; it was explained as to why we were late, in which the hotel knew due to us calling.  Ciro wasn't personable or empathic to what we had gone through. He continued saying ""a reservation is a reservation "". We knew what a reservation was,  but was hoping for some kinda discount due to us missing one day in the suite.  Ciro gave us a coupon $20 off on spending  $20 or more in food. Ciro thought his coupon was good enough. He had a don't give a crap attitude. We asked if we could down grade our room, answer again  was No.   We paid our balance in cash. We asked for Ciro's mgr;  we met Jessica who was more personable. Jessica was Awesome ,she gave us a buffet voucher for 2 for the Luxor Hotel.  She did show empathy.  We paid our bill in Cash; suite was assigned. We entered the suite which was not what we reserved.  The suite had one bed instead of two. We immediately went back to the check in desk. We explained to Mitchell,  who was Awesome was very personable and apologetic for our room being wrong. We found out the suite only had one bed, two beds were never an option.  We asked of we could have our original room before the upgrade,  Mitchell replied yes,  we were shocked because all we had been told was No. Long story short,  what we initially asked for we finally received and without a hassle.  Jessica & Mitchell are excellent employees for Luxor. Ciro needs more customer service training. We may stay @ Luxor next year but not sure.

Terrible service started before even getting inside.  Trying to pull into the drop off area found three cars stopped and parked abreast of each other.  The occupants clearly knew each other as they kept moving back and forth between cars chatting, leaning against the cars and drinking their beers.  Neither passengers nor luggage was being unloaded and the security and concierge personnel at the front curb did nothing to either move them along or at least have them pull up and park in the 15 minute parking area so other cars could move in.  About 10-15 minutes before they finally moved (after finishing their beer).

Poor service continued at the check in where it took 25-30 minutes to get checked in.  Found out that despite having prepaid for hotel there was also a resort fee (none of which we planned to use since we were there on business).  Fortunately got there when we did because when we came back downstairs the line was about 5 times as long to check in.

The room initially looked nice enough, but closer inspection revealed:  peeling wall paper in the bathroom and mold present, not great water pressure in shower, no coffee maker (but with all the Starbucks downstairs you did have the option of paying $4.00+ for a coffee- likely a deal worked out with Starbucks), no mini fridge, and the air conditioning took forever to cool the room down.  There was depression about the size of a softball under the carpet at the foot of the bed that was noticeable when it was stepped into.

The decor was hideous and tacky.  Brass elevator buttons led to getting static shocks any time you called for the elevator.  Inside the elevators were absolutely filthy, brass unpolished, covered in finger prints and smeared with some foreign substance and at least one elevator the door off the callbox was completely missing.

The restaurant choices seemed very spotty.  Only found three by looking around.  One (Pyramid Cafe) was never open when we went looking for a meal.  Backstage Cafe had a limited selection (pretty much burgers and sandwiches etc) and was not completely unreasonably priced.  The steakhouse had prices that were absolutely crazy and we immediately left.  No way the food could be that good based on how poor everything else in the hotel was.  The only goes in the room were for room service so couldn't easily see if there were other restaurants.

Came home from dinner first evening to find two employees knocking on the door to bring us the extra bathroom items (shampoo, etc) that we had asked for.... Clearly the wrong room.  No idea if the persons who actually requested them ever received them.  The next morning, at 1 am we were wakened by a knock on the door.  Another employee who had come up to help us connect to the internet.  We had never called down about internet problems- and certainly didn't at 1 am in the morning.  Again... clearly the wrong room.  One would think that at 1 am in the morning- you would make REALLY sure you had the right room.

The rooms in the pyramid are a little different from the other casinos. As soon as you walk out of your room there is a view of the actual casino down stairs. It's OK, it's a little different. The beds are not very comfortable, but it does the job if you're just looking for a place to sleep.

Which I could accept for the price I had got. But . . .

My first morning I was surprised with an ice cold shower and no hot water.  I informed the front desk on my way to the conference and they said they would send someone. 
I got back late that night, and did not check.  Next morning guess what, still ice cold.  So this time I called the hotel, who had no record I ever had an issue but said they would send someone right away.  Next morning (checkout day) still ice cold.  Informed the check out agent who showed zero care or compassion to my 3 ice cold showers and simply said they had no record of any issue.  She did get the manager who said the same thing.  But said he would compare the resort fee.  Never once did the agent or manager even say we were sorry for the unpleasant stay.  Would not even comp the parking (8 bucks a day).

So I'm check in at the Luxor, I have to pay and additional 12.99 for 24 hour internet service (ok - don't mind).  I have to print something out (24 pages, simply word doc, b\/w, nothing fancy). 

First of all the business center closes at 5pm.  By the time you stand in the huge line to check-in your room (check in time 3pm) get settled in your room and get your business stuff together the place is closed.

So I called the front desk and told her my situation - I needed to print out a 22 page document.  I have it either via email or flash stick.

She said I can use the computers near the front desk for $5.00 for the first 5 minutes and she incorrectly told me that printing was free.  It wasn't.  It's $1 per page.  WOW! That's alot.  

So I go prusing around to get more info about the business center so I can be ready right at 7am the next morning.  Unfortunately, no one knew more than the center's hours.  The point was if I knew the services and charges I can weigh my options on what more affordable and accommodating for my situation.  

It seems that the $5 for 5 minutes for computer use and $1 - 1.50 per page printed is the norm in most of these strip casino\/hotels here.

WHAT I DID - I hate that these places try to get over and $5 and $10 us (as opposed to nickel and diming) to death.

We stayed in one of the Tower suites.

The good:
The room was clean, spacious and totally silent.  Either we had the quietest neighbors ever or the walls are pretty thick.  We literally never heard another human being while we were in the room (although we did hear one or two sirens from the street).  The bed and pillows were also pretty comfy, given that it's a low-end hotel.

The bad:
Everything is old, outdated and sad-looking.  Both TVs in the suite were ancient and very small (maybe 19""), plus the picture quality was bad (black lines across the screen) and the channels were limited.  As a lot of other reviewers mention, finding the correct elevator bank was surprisingly difficult and there were a lot of people trying to talk you into ""great discounts!"" everywhere in the casino.  Also, there is a $15\/per night resort fee.

The weird:
When we were coming back to our suite Saturday night (well, technically Sunday morning) security guys were shutting down the elevator bank and told us they had a ""big crime scene"" and we couldn't go up that way.  I pointed out that there didn't seem to be any other way to get up to our room and there was no way I was doing 14 flights of stairs in heels, and one of them grudgingly took us up in the elevator himself.

For some of the harsh reviews on here, I was really surprised and impressed with my experience here at the Luxor!

Positives-

- Almost every employee I came in contact with during my stay here was so friendly and helpful! People on the casino floor to direct the people to the front desk, the front desk, the bellman...all just superb!
- the room did show some signs of age, but was still pretty good! I stayed in the pyramid and it's great that some of the cheesy charm of Vegas is still alive! 
- Front Desk was AWESOME! Josephine checked me in and was so warm, friendly, and personable! A true asset to her department! Chris handled my check out and was equally engaging! They made me feel like I was special and that they were glad to have me there! All the more impressive considering the volume of people they must see on every shift!
- Beds were so soft, plush and comfortable! Got a great nights sleep!
- Coupon book they give you has great discounts on shows and food options in the casino
- Good size TV's in the room with plenty of channels!
- has a tram that connects to both Mandalay Bay and Excalibur

Not so positives-

- those machines were pretty tight for me
- the time share people were fairly aggressive and bothersome.
- $28 resort fee. Ugh.

Overall, I was very much impressed with my time at the Luxor and I will certainly be back. For the price point and the location, it really is a great value! The thing that really stands out for me is still the friendliness of the staff. Good service makes ALL the difference in the world!

I live within 40 minutes of Atlantic City, so I've seen casinos and their nightlife before. Vegas, to me, was AC on steroids. I visited from 12\/30\/2009 - 1\/1\/2010, and in those two days my opinion really changed.

It was my first and only trip to Vegas thus far, but I really liked the Luxor. Our room was very clean and neat, and the bed was by far the most comfortable I've slept in while on vacation in a while. We paid $100\/person for the total trip, which I thought was a steal for the room. It was quite big, and the bathroom was very spacious - a must for 3 girls, especially over New Year's! 

The front desk staff was very accommodating. Check-in was shockingly quick, especially during such a busy time. We were allowed to check in early and get right to business, which was great. I particularly liked the clubs\/lounges, and the fact that it was connected to both Mandalay Bay and Excalibur (hello, Thunder Down Under!). The inclinator - not elevator! - was an event all in itself. I believe I fell each and every time I set foot in it, and I was sober the whole vacation! We were pretty high up in the pyramid, and anytime I walked over to look out a window, I inevitably misjudged and gave myself a concussion. Our windows had very thick blackout curtains, which was fantastic since we never went to bed before 11am. 

The little convenience stores and vending machines are WAY overpriced but again, it's Vegas! No time to be cheap! I agree with Stefanie H. in that even when you're not dressed up, you don't feel like you're being shunned or out of place.

When we checked in we were given a room inside the pyramid that was sweet because we could see everything going on in the casino from outside our door. Right when we walked in though my girlfriend complained of the musty smell. I'm able to ignore a lot of things and the smell really didn't bother me but I told her I could ask for us to be moved to another room if she liked but she said it was fine. She complained of the smell a few more times and I was able to figure out what the smell was. I took a shower and while I was walking barefooted I found out a large section of the carpet in front of the cooler was wet and that is where the smell was coming from, probably water dripping from the cooler. At this point I went down to the front desk and asked to be moved to another room and told them about the issue and they gave us another room without any issues, the lady who helped us was extremely helpful and I wished I would of gotten her name.

The room they relocated us to was in the ""East Tower"" and we were bummed that we were not going to be able to stay in the pyramid. That disappointment quickly faded when we walked into our 2nd room. Much more newer and nicer than the pyramid room and the bathroom was awesome. It had a shower and a bathtub that we definitely were excited to take advantage of on our last night in Vegas. Next time we stay at the Luxor we will for sure be requesting our room to be in one of the towers. Also there is a cool tramcar you can ride for free which can take you to and from Mandalay Bay Casino and Excalibur Casino.

Only issue I had was that we should of received a parking pass to Luxor's parking lot along with our hotel keys instead of having to make a 3rd trip to the front desk to ask for a parking pass. Also the walk from the parking lot to your room can be a struggle if you have a lot of things or heavy items.

The suite was actually nicer, much larger and more updated than the previous mini-suite. All seemed great UNTIL the night came. They had a banner that was loose and the large cables were  banging up against the window, which I can understand it happens. It is how you treat your customers when this DOES happen. I called to complain and the service was once again EXTREMELY RUDE. She finally said to me, Well do you want to move or what? Excuse me? I just want to have it fixed. She told me she would have someone fix it. I didnt get much sleep and it sucked waking up on vaca so sleepy. I called down the next day and they had no record of any of this. They told me they would call me back. Nobody did, I called back again a few hours later when I got back into the room and they told me it wouldn't be fixed until Monday or Tuesday and I was leaving Sunday afternoon. We decided to move rooms.This time we moved into a the same sort of suite, but just not as nice. The bellman told me he was surprised they didnt put me in a nicer room, because that is what they usually do. I was just glad I actually got some rest that night. I was exhausted from being out late and having fun. 
The service at the restaurant this time was better and the time frame to get our food was MUCH faster.  I had a good time with my husband out and about doing our thing...

  Let me preface this by saying I am rating this property as a business convention goer and not as a gambling\/drinking thrill seeker in Vegas.
  I haven't been this unsatisfied with a hotel stay in a long long time......
  #1) my room in the west tower smells like smoke, not like someone just smoked in there, but like in the paint and walls were saturated in smoke for years.
  #2) this hotel serves room service from 6am to 2pm ONLY.  So unless your wanting breakfast or lunch you are out of luck.  Having to be on a show floor from 8am through 6pm and not having an option for in-room dining is really tough.
  #3) the food on site at the Luxor left a lot to be desired.  The buffet I already Yelped about and it was no were near satisfactory. I wound up eating a few nights over in Mandalay Bay (and that wasn't so great either) and finally took at taxi to the Rio Carnival Buffet.
  #4) the bed actually had a big divet on one side where people sleep as if the mattresses haven't been turned in years.
  #5) it was a 20 minute walk from my room to the Mandalay Bay convention center.  That was 40 minutes a day walking.
  #6) But I will tell you all the staff I encountered there was friendly and helpful as best they could be.
  If you are going to the Luxor\/Excalibur\/Mandalay Bay Convention Center complex, I would highly recommend staying at Mandalay Bay - pay the higher rate to be closer to the convention, have a better selection of restaurants and the ability to have 24 hour room service.",3,2,1

I got an offer for a deluxe king room in the east tower. I only had to pay the resort fee, since I have gambled here multiple times.

The room I got was on the very top floor. One of the two chairs had stains on them. But the room was big and the bed was comfy. I had to call the front desk because there was NO hot water. Literally I turned on the hot water and there was all this noise but nothing happened. Pressure was there just no water. Plus the room was hot. Maintenance came up and magically the water was flowing. Ac was colder too.

However with the I tense summer heat...the room was never really cool. I woke up multiple times during the night hot.

Next day decided to hit the pool. Only con is that the pool is one 3.5 feet deep but it's good to cool off. Came to my room and showered and washed my hair. The bathroom outlets are so old that my blow dryer kept falling out. So...I had to blow dry my hair by the window (blazing hot even with the shades closed). Couldn't see because the mirror was on the other side of the room. Called downstairs again....said they would send an engineer....nobody showed.

Never got a confirmation email for my trip so called to confirm and also asked about the credit.  She said it was $20 per night good for anything on property (food, shows, spa, merchandise) Checked in and no record of the offer and the front desk and Mlife told me they don't do anything like that.  I pulled the offer up on my phone so they decided to finally credit me $20 but that was in reference to a $20 food and beverage credit which was a new offer. Wasted about a half hour between the two trying to figure the crap out.  Went to Backstage Deli at 2AM and rang up almost exactly $20 and the chick tells me they cant credit charges to the room right now because the system is down.  I get sorry, ask for a supervisor, she call says front desk and says  the system is down til 6, Still ask for a supervisor but have to venture out to find help myself.  Ask a security guard who gives me night manager Emily Acosta who I am pretty sure he woke up and she tells me the system is down sorry.  She gives me a $20 voucher to use at the bar that has no food that charges $10 a drink. No thanks, you lost a Caesars Platinum player that was considering changing teams.  Not gonna gamble a nickle at your casinos the rest of the trip over a stupid $20 that I can lose at Video Poker in 5 minutes.  You might as well scrap that deal because no one is booking at your place for $20 food credits but as you can see you sure can piss someone off when you offer it and can't follow through,",0,0,0

I stayed there three days on a vacation in October.  There were many problems.
1. Early check-in requires an extra $20 fee.  I did not pay it.
2. Wifi is available ONLY in the casino.
3. The shower water was cold on the first day and only low-lukewarm on the second.  Was told to let it run for a while first.  I did so for more than 15 minutes the first day and more than 10 the second.  No luck.  And this was early, about 615 am, so do not tell me that all the hot water was used up.  Wasteful and unproductive.
4. The main floor is totally crawling with people trying to sell timeshare presentations.  They are a veritable swarm.   Ask for directions and get a quiz and sales talk.
5. The $20 ""resort fee"" is comparable to that of SOME other hotels, but at least those hotels put a free newspaper stand on each floor; you don't have to hunt out one small shop to get the paper.
6. The main floor elevator lobby was closed for waxing at 710 am; I had to use two elevators to get to the lobby.  No signs posted, of course.
7. Poor signage through the hotel.  For example, no reference to the food court--which DOES exist.
8. Long lines everywhere though no evidence of a convention.
9. Advertised $20 credit for food and bev is largely a ripoff; few or no food locations included in the offer were open for lunch; at dinner, the places included had grossly overpriced food--like $20 above what it should have been.
10. Windows were very dirty and halls had water-drying machines running 24 hours for three days.  Why?
To be fair, I will admit that the room was pleasant and quiet.
But on balance I will never stay there again.

But it did its job for a quick last minute trip to Vegas and it was well within my budget! I don't usually spend much time in the hotel room anyways. Our standard rooms were used to keep our stuff safe, get dressed to hit the strip, play drinking games, and sleep! The walls are pretty thick because we bumped music fairly loudly and were making quite a racket. 

A friend of mine got an email from Luxor with a sweet deal so we snagged it for a 3 day, 2 night stay. We had a reservation for connected rooms but when we checked in they said they ran out of  them and so they put us in 2 rooms next to each other with queen beds. It worked out perfectly fine but it wasn't what we paid for.

My only real complaints are:
1. There was a mysterious brown quarter sized mush on the wall that could resemble a variety of gross things
2. Do they use fitted bed sheets?! The sheet covering the mattress moved everywhere and I basically slept on the mattress itself
3. The air ventilation is horrible. We woke up with our noses dried out. We had to put a wet towel over the vents to get some moisture in the air

That being said I wasn't expecting the type of grand luxurious experience typical of places like the Mandarin.  Stayed 3 nights for a conference.  Room was covered by my company.

I noticed a lot of variability in the reviews. I suspect this is related to the size of the establishment (4400 rooms) and unreasonable expectations.

Checkin:  despite the fact that my company arranged to cover my room and resort fee... I was charged for the resort fee at checkin.  Minus one star.  Would consider changing this if the hotel actually refunds my credit card.

Room:  stayed in west tower.  Large, quiet, comfy bed, large bathroom, large in room safe held my laptop.  Each morning my shampoo was replaced with a new bottle.  While by no means was the room anything spectacular... it met all my needs.  Would happily stay in it again.

Conference: high quality AV\/tech support.  Handled logistics well.  Overall good food.

Property:  love the theme... Very neat inside the pyramid.  Though i could see staying in some of the lower floors close to checkin and casino  being very noisy.  Overall well kept given age of property.  Only issue was the west tower elevators.  Management-you know this is an issue based on past reviews...  Just replace the damn things.  Minus one star.

Casino: I was impressed that they kept 3 craps tables running despite the fact they could have accommodated the number of players there at 1-2.  Higher minimums than I would expect for the price of the rooms.  I would have played more here if the min was less. Instead I walked to the slightly less classy Excalibur casino next door.  This was close enough that it was a non issue. Less impressed with speed of drink orders.  But hey it's free.  Did appreciate they brought water bottles without ordering them.  

Pool\/gym:  nothing spectacular for those expecting some sort of paradise... But very nice and usable.  No complaints.

Location:  south end of strip. perfect spot for those looking to be away from the insanity but still close enough to walk.  It's about a 10-15 min walk to center of strip... Half of which is inside if you go through Excalibur.  Not bad at all if you're young\/athletic.

Conclusion:  despite the three star rating (see above for where they lost points) would come back without hesitation.   Just make sure you have reasonable expectations about what you're getting...  A very solid hotel at a reasonable price.  Just don't expect all the bells and whistles of a 5 star resort.",0,0,0

The show was cancelled and the Luxor box office WOULD NOT EXCHANGE MY TICKETS.

I won tickets to the show on 97.1 (a local radio station for those of you that aren't from around the Vegas Valley.) The tickets specifically stated they were valid up to March 31. Due to a lot going on in my life, I had to wait until the last minute to use them. 

I checked online to make sure he did shows on Wednesday nights, which is when March 31 fell this year. There was nothing to the contrary on their website. Aside from ""Dark Tuesday"", it said nothing about cancelled performances\/unavailable shows\/etc.

I went to the Luxor, eager to use my tickets and see this funny man. When I went to the theatre where he performs, the doorman said he was on vacation this week, AND THAT I COULD EXCHANGE THE TICKETS FOR A LATER PERFORMANCE. I understand a guy like Carrot Top needing a vacation - apparently he busts his ass 6 nights a week making people laugh in here. BUT WHY WASN'T THE CANCELLATION OF HIS PERFORMANCE MENTIONED ON THE WEBSITE!?

I went over to the box office and told them of the situation, and what the doorman had told me. The woman working the box office said THAT WAS FINE, and THAT SHE COULD EXCHANGE THE TICKETS. She even asked me what later performance I would like to attend, to which I responded a show next week. She then said she just needed to talk to her supervisor about doing it. 

I waited patiently for 5 minutes for her return. She came back, and I was very much eager to get my tickets for the show. The first words that came out of her mouth were ""CAN'T DO IT."" 

She explained to me that they COULD NOT EXCHANGE THE TICKETS. This is AFTER TWO EMPLOYEES TOLD ME IT COULD BE DONE. She also told me the supervisor said I ""should have come earlier."" I came within the dates the tickets told me to come, and now you're telling me I ""should have come earlier"" when you DID NOT POST ON THE WEBSITE THAT SHOWS WOULD BE CANCELLED THIS WEEK!? Seriously, fuck you guys. 

The billboards all up and down the strip promoting the show say that Carrot Top's show is ""worth the trip."" But now I'm never going to know if it was because the Luxor's box office supervisor is an inconsiderate jerk.

Check in would have been a breeze had they actually reserved the right room for us. I hate smoking, but my husband does smoke. When we booked online he specified a smoking room because there was an option. When we checked in the desk clerk said they had no more smoking rooms available. She was not personable, not nice, not bubbly. I looked over at our friends who were checking in a few check in spaces next to us and I really wished we had that lady. I could over hear her telling our friends that the Californians that have been moving to Vegas are making smoking in Vegas rooms more and more difficult. Doesn't make sense since there's smoking inside the casino and pretty much everywhere else. The lady told our friends that she'd send up some ash trays to their room. The lady that was helping us left to ask if sending us ash trays was okay, she came back and said that it was. Score!

In my previous review I said that I was deathly afraid of the elevators in the pyramid. Not exactly sure why I was, but turns out you need to slide your room key card into the slot and then push the floor number. Duh! The incline isn't bad either and the elevator doesn't shake as much as most of you say it does. It's a pretty cool ride actually. 

We booked the pyramid spa suite. Very nice and spacious and a nice spacious spa tub. One complaint, there aren't any jets in the spa tub. The room was clean unlike the last time. My husband asked the maid that was cleaning the room next to us if she had any ash trays. Because the floor we were on was non smoking, she said it would be difficult for her to find some on our actual floor but she would try. Keep in mind that the desk clerk said she'd send some up. She never did. Five minutes later the maid knocked and had two ash trays in her hand. So very nice of her to go out of her way to make my husband happy! I was a little piffered to hear our friends say that someone very quickly brought them their ash trays. Clearly their check in lady was a nice person and ours just didn't give a damn. It is so sad that our friends had a room double the size of ours, they had pyramid soaps and a do not disturb sign. Those are things that should have already been in the room!

Two more complaints: the fridge in the room wasn't working at first. We had to unplug the fridge to let it thaw out, we removed the ice and re-plugged and it started working. Also, the air conditioner doesn't work at all. I write this at 2 am because its so hot that I can not sleep at all it's that hot! I also don't know why the room that was directly above us on the next floor up had a room double the size of ours and we booked the same exact room as they did. It's irritating when you shell out a lot of money and you are how dinky your room is compared to your friends room. 

Room decor is pretty outdated, but the TVs compared to the TVs they had here two years ago are a definite upgrade. Bed is so\/so when it comes to comfort. 

I really like that this hotel is linked to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. There's also a pretty nifty tram that you can take, but there are two and it can get kind of confusing as to which one to take and getting off of tram I and getting back on to tram II to get to Luxor, blah blah blah.

Check out was a breeze. Just click the check out button on your check out email and there ya go. 

And also, those timeshare people gots to go. It was so bad I had to walk past them and just say no every single time. I can't even count on both hands how many times I was harassed. No. I do not want what you have to offer!

Probably going to look into staying at Excalibur or MGM next time. Sorry Luxor.",3,1,1

You know how you can accommodate me? By giving me the room I requested. I did get a ""non smoking"" room but it still had a smell of cigarettes inside. In fact the entire hotel smells like cigarettes. 

The room itself was alright. Granted I did not stay in it much except to sleep and shower. One thing that really made me upset was house keeping were talking loudly when they were cleaning the rooms. It is not fun waking up to a housekeeping smoking and joking outside your door. 

Check out had to be the worst of all. I went directly to the check out stand. The guy behind the desk asks why I did not stand in line and points to the check in line. I look behind me and there is no one behind me. Also the sign there says check in not check out. Common sense genius.

Me and a friend had checked into the hotel on Nov 27, at 3 am after a long flight to vegas. I had my DSLR kit with me worth $900. We had bolted the door when we slept. We woke up at 5 am (2 hours later) as we had to leave for Page, AZ. And my camera was gone from the room. STOLEN FROM THE ROOM WHILE WE WERE STILL INSIDE. Which obviously means someone (of course a Luxor employee) had access to our room and entered the room and stole it. 

When we reported to the hotel security, they did not even react with concern (It looked as if they get such reports everyday). I filled a complaint (which was filled so casually by the hotel staff as if it was a sign up drive for a club membership). I kept calling them for 3 days and the fourth day I get a vague reply that we did not find anything in out investigation. And, wait for it, the lady on the phone said this- ""Did you have other guests in the room. You should check with them first"". This is pathetic and ridiculous beyond words; the other guest in my room was my sister, and oh yes, she should be the first person I should catch hold of to look for my camera.

What really bothered me in the whole incident was that SOMEBODY HAD ENTERED MY ROOM!!! This bloody doesn't happen! To be honest, I am glad they just took the cam. They could have got away with my money! Worst nightmare - what if i had woken up while they were in my room? Would they have harmed me and my sis? Yes, they could have!!

The room itself was kind of small, and I was stuck at the end of the hallway so my view looked directly down to Valet and then nothing much behind it.

I'm a serious bathroom snob, and again while nothing is wrong with the bathroom, it was just...boring, and felt kind of unwelcoming and cold. Seperate tub which was a little small, and the shower while decently sized was just meh. 

The casino is okay, I definitely lost a bunch of money here until I decided to go play somewhere else, the hotel front desk line moved quickly, and the woman who helped me was very sweet. Overall everything was okay, pretty cheap for a Friday night stay ($80), but I probably wont seek out this hotel again.",1,1,1

We were here for 2 nights in the Pyramid Deluxe Queen Room, and with the 12% room tax + $18 resort fee + 12% resort fee tax our total was under $200 (we got this rate back in September).  Cheap for a hotel on the Strip during this busy season (rates are even lower off season).

Of course, being inexpensive comes with a price (har har, no pun intended).  There were minor drawbacks that didn't really affect us in a big way, but were there nonetheless (here are some that I could remember) - 

1) We got a room on the 4th floor, and since the hallway was open to the public, we could hear the hustle and bustle - including music - from the 1st floor\/lobby area even with the room closed;
2) There were a lot of water stains on the ceiling and wall;
3) The bathroom only came with 3 sets of towels (we're a family of 4);
4) There was no makeup mirror;
5) The bedsheets had tears in them.  The bed was soft and comfy, which was not good for me who has a bad back (but fine for hubby and kids);
6) We went out and came back around 1am on Saturday and the valet was full (there are more rooms than parking).  The mall valet between Luxor and Mandalay Bay usually don't accept overnight valet (as we were told by one of the guys working there) but luckily made an exception for us.

On the other hand, this was a great location for us as a family -

1) Luxor is connected to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur so no need to step outside (Luxor is situated in the middle).  There is a free monorail that goes from Excalibur straight to Mandalay Bay, and from Mandalay Bay - Luxor - Excalibur (route is different depending on start point).  We didn't use the monorail as we were fine with walking;
2) The mall in Excalibur included a food court, which was great for a cheap and quick bite.  Excalibur also had a cool arcade downstairs from their casino.  The mall in Mandalay Bay looked nicer than the one in Excalibur and had some upscale restaurants, so there's a wide range of edible options;
3) Luxor is located at the end of the South Strip (Mandalay Bay being on the very end), so we were able to avoid traffic at check in and check out, as well as when going to the LV North outlet.

This is probably not a convenient location for those who want to walk up and down the main Strip area (around Caesars Palace), but I liked being away from the crowd and my kids had a lot of fun walking around the vicinity and playing at the arcade in Excalibur.",1,0,0

However, if the very basic requirements for any establishment housing people are not met - we have a serious problem.

Our ""Pyramid Deluxe"" room was moist, musky and upon further inspection riddled with Black Mold. Didn't find that out though until the morning after we stayed, when both my fiancée and I woke up sweaty, dizzy and nautious.

Sure they comped the resort fees and Hotels.com refunded the entire stay - but I would have honestly paid any sum of money to leave that place as soon as humanly possible. 

I have no idea about the quality of the other rooms, or if the Luxury Suite they offered us is any better. All I know is that if anywhere in this day and age knowingly allows these types of conditions to exist, and worse allows people to sleep there with their loved ones?! - than they are setting a dangerous precedent for an utter lack of regard for human safety.

I was a little worried. The worst thing for me was the elevator. Our elevator was 4a\/4b and I could not handle the no-window-moving-on-a-diagonal. The whole elevator situation was a PITA. We ended up on a service elevator at one point, we tried taking another elevator that went to random even floors...all that I would have needed to not be nauseous on every elevator ride at the Luxor would have been a window. It would make the experience so much more enjoyable, being able to see which direction you were moving, having a nice aerial view of the inside of the pyramid. 

What was good? 
Our room was pretty nice (although I must mention I think I reserved a king, not two queens. I never mentioned it to them so I can't fault them for not changing it, but I think when I booked online I chose 1 king). 

The shower was huge (but no tub) in the Pyramid Deluxe room. 

TV didn't have a lot of channels but who watches tv there? 

The main bar, across from registration (Aurora) had great cocktails for pretty reasonable prices ($10 range). 

The cab service from the front door was great and the concierge (is that what you call the guy who gets the cab for you?) was happy and friendly all weekend. 

I won about $10 in slots at Luxor. 

The casino wasn't super crowded and when I was ousted by a 
smoker of my own volition, it was easy to find another comparable group of slots. 

I loved being able to catwalk from casino to casino. 


What was bad? 

The towels were a little small. I would have like to have seen bath sheets instead of towels. 

The elevators, maybe if there were stair access points, that would be better. I don't mind taking the stairs (even 12 flights), especially as an alternative to the nauseating elevators. 

The gift shop sold stuff that seemed really ghetto and trinket-y. I was going to buy this water bottle until I tried to screw the cap on, it didn't make a tight seal and there was a caribeaner that wouldn't close once it was open. Kinda garbage-y. 

OH THOSE ANNOYING PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE THEY WORK FOR THE HOTEL BUT TRY TO SELL YOU GARBAGE SHOWS AND MEALS? That was probably the 2nd worst thing about Luxor but it wasn't exclusive to Luxor. 

Luxor seemed like a pretty cool, child-free place. That's what I was looking for and that's what I got. If I go to Vegas again, I would probably stay somewhere else because of the elevator and because I would want to see more of the Strip. But Luxor was okay!",2,0,0

As I walked up to this casino, it was pretty cool how the outside was structured and everything inside was in the shape of the pyramid so the top was narrow. 

I also liked the Egyptian statues outside and inside. Since this is a casino, the cigarette and cigar smoke was heavy. Not sure if they tried to throw in some fragrance to mask the smoke, but the combo of the two was no bueno! 

I did not check out the Titanic Exhibition. I have seen the Bodies Exhibition in Dallas years ago so I also passed on that. I mainly wanted to check out the pyramid and the architecture.

Without the theme, Luxor is just like every other 3000+ room mega-resort in town with multi-ethnic eateries, a Cirque show, nightclub, ultralounges, etc. What Luxor has going for it is that its cheap, clean(er than Excalibur), and is located on the strip. 

The hotel has 2 towers - the pyramid tower and the west tower - try to stay in the west tower because the rooms are more modern and practical. Bathrooms in the West Tower have separate tub and shower which is a nice plus. I frequented the fitness center a few times during my stay. The room itself is of an adequate size. It has some free weights, and lots of cardio-equipment. The fitness center is free for hotel guests thanks to the resort fee. 

The Luxor parking garage is located in the back of the hotel and is only a 2 story structure with a pedestrian bridge that connects to the building on the opposite side of the lobby. This means a far walk from the parking garage to the main lobby. Luxor is connected to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur via skywalk and automated monorail.",3,1,0

Well ... Anyway ... My bf & I stayed in vegas at lux for 4days. When I first walked in the inside architecture is just as beautiful as the outside. they have a few great shows in the lux. A food court ( go to LA subs !!!!!). The woman that checked us in was very nice. We stayed in the pyramid floor 10. The pyramids elevator was shaky( which freaked me out) but the hall & room were both very clean. You can set your own temperature in the  room. Room service, but if you put your sign on the door the lovely maids won't peep & bother. Beds are very comfortable (I think I was sleeping on a cloud) bathroom was nice & very clean with soaps. On the third day we were there... We woke to a leak in the roof of our room due to epic rain... So they moved us to floor 18 in the tower of the lux( which was a lot fancier) the elevator was smooth... Lol. Oh might I yelp about the fantasy show in the lux ;) the women were all very talented & gorgeous. They dance & show boobies, but no kitty. Also.... The casino doesn't smell like cigs (like most casinos do) it smelled as if I walked into Victorias secret. There's also a walkway escalator thingy that leads to the Excalibur from the lux inside, which I thought was pretty cool.  Anyway .... Overall ... The lux was a great experience. We'd go back.",0,0,0

I agree with the reviews that the inside of the casino is great.  The restaurants (except their 24\/7 cafe) are great.  The Titanic exhibit is fantastic.  The hotel rooms themselves have a lot of problems.  Outdated is the first problem.  Second is dirty.  Third is ""upgrade"" to the ""recently remodeled"" tower rooms.  BS!  Do NOT get the upgrade to the tower rooms!  They are worse than the pyramid rooms. 

We checked in and had reservations in a pyramid room.  We got a tower room.  When we called to ask, the lady said we were lucky because we got a free upgrade.  Upgrade to what?!?!?  A Motel 6?!?!?  The comforters were like 40 years old, sheets had stains, the bathroom floor had blood spatters, hair in the sink and shower, chairs were old, beaten, worn, torn, dusty and dirty.  We stayed in the tower rooms back when they were the ""cheap rooms"" because the pyramid rooms were the high end rooms.  

We begged to be switched to a pyramid room and they did the next night.  They were much better, with clean white comforters\/sheets.  Even though they are outdated themselves, at least they don't label them ""upgraded"" when they are not.  Plus you get the cool slanted window and a ride on the inclinator.  LOL.

Now, this place has diversified into the standard Vegas casino with lounges, bars, Starbucks, and the lot.  

The place isn't super big so it's easy to navigate around.  One thing I noticed was that they had West Tower and East Tower rooms in here and the signage at the bottom of the elevator nor the property map give any sort of information about the room number ranges.

The parking here was pretty good. It's outdoors but not too far from a casino entrance.  The room itself was on the small side.  Our room literally was parked right over the Luxor\/Excalibur walkway.  So every time we left the room for two days, we saw a picture of Carrot Top with his crotch aimed at our face!  Ugghhh...

Gambling wise, Luxor is a nicer atmosphere than Excalibur with slightly higher limits.  You won't find a $5 BJ or roulette or a $10 Pai Gow table here usually.  Go to Excalibur for that.  Otherwise, it's a nice middle of the road option between Mandalay and Excalibur.",1,0,0

It's definitely not as fancy or uptown as some of the other places to stay in Vegas, but if you're looking for a good bed\/room (somewhere just to sleep), it did the job just fine. 

We stayed in the tower, not the pyramid and my two favorite parts about the room itself were the stand alone bath tub (seperate from the shower) and the king size bed. I'm not much of a gambler when it comes to playing in Vegas and the tub was wonderful! It was not only deep enough but the drain was a special flip over kind so I didn't have to listen to it making leakage noises when the water got too high.And it was perfectly hot too - like I didn't have to worry that it was going to run out at any point. Bliss!! And while I don't believe the bed was a memory foam one, it did the job excellently! We slept great and woke up feeling refreshed and ready. The room was also beautifully decorated in its Egyptian theme, from the molding around the ceiling and wallpaper, to the light fixtures and bedding. 

Overall, if we were doing a quick-trip to Vegas again, we would stay here. Like I mentioned above, it's not as fancy as some of the other hotels, but if you're looking for something reasonably priced and to get you back in the action (the strip, gambling, etc), it's great.",4,0,0

But that was a long, long time ago.  I recently booked a vacation on a whim to Las Vegas and was excited to see we would be staying at the Luxor since I had awesome memories nearly 20 years ago.  But a lot has changed in 20 years - but you wouldn't know that by the rooms at the Luxor.

Like many others we were hit with a fee when checking in we didn't even know about and there was no getting out of it.  We were told free continental long distance was included in our room, but that didn't turn out to be true.

Then onto our room.  The way the elevators are placed in the Luxor there are two in either corner, well our room was in the corner not near the elevator.  Which basically meant we had to walk to one end of the casino to get the elevator then walk all the way back to get to our room.  Not a big deal, unless you've been out walking the strip ALL DAY LONG and by the time you get back to your room and your buzz is wearing off the last thing you want to do is keep walking, and walking, and walking, and walking.  The elevators are also kind of frightening.  They had more turbulence then our flight in and I thought for sure we were going to get stuck in them one evening.... no they just paused..... for...... a..... terribly.....long....... time.

The room itself was dingy and grimy and the smell could knock you out.  I'm a pack a day smoker and the air quality in our room was disturbing.....  Our air conditioning had a mind of it's own, sometimes the room was so cold you needed a parka and other times I was sure we were baking alive in the room.

I didn't find the staff to be particularly helpful or friendly in an area of the hotel or casino.  Everyone who worked their seemed to hate their life and hate ours just for being there.

Sooooo.... would I stay there again?  If it was the only cheap place I could find - maybe.   But I think you're better off if you're booking online to spend the fifty bucks up and stay at a different hotel.   Also, it's so far down the strip it's kind of no-mans land.",1,1,0

I had to call each day to get my room made up.  I spoke to Jesus Cabrara, manager, about the room not being cleaned, bathroom towels being picked up off the floor and re-hung up (just gross)!  When I tried to explain in more detail to Jesus he just spoke over me.  I told him he spoke over me and continued to argue with me and speak over me.  I will never stay here again.

The elevators, i mean ""inclinators"" gave me a headache every time I used it. The interior of the inclinator is falling apart and in the 4B inclinators, we would randomly stop on every floor AND the doors would open and close numerous times before taking us to our destination. yiiiikes!

The rooms: Spacious for the most part, poor lighting, and I was super impressed with their bathroom. There was ample lighting and spacious counter top.

I do like the fact that the hotel has a decent sized food court and the view you get once your leave your hotel room. I wish their monorail would take us further into the strip, other than just to MGM and Excalibur. 

Overall, Luxor is a place of choice if you don't care where you stay, wanna be on\/close to the ""strip"", cheap, and has a little bit of everything.

The Luxor was our choice being geeks and all and the Egyptian stuff looked really neat in the pictures.  Something tacky and Vegas for our first time!  I passed up buying the ground transportation when I booked the trip since the hotel is only 2 miles from the airport.  Coming from Chicago, I thought we had expensive cabs!  But $25 to get there?  Craziness!  That's an entree!  So when we arrived we were immediately bombarded by someone trying to get us a time share...dude, I've been up since the crack of dawn and just had to fly almost 4 hours - let me check in first.  These people are all over the place - just ignore them!

When we went to check in our agent had put us in 2 double beds (maybe she misunderstood the word 'partner'?) but they quickly changed my 15 floor pyramid room to a 3rd floor one.  Eew...now I'm closer to the floor.  But then we opted to stay in the West Tower and am SO thankful for that.  The room had a nice deep bath, a gorgeous view of Nevada mountains and just an elevator ride right into the pool and spa area.  Worth the extra $20 a night!  

We had room service one night - it was prompt and fine for chicken tenders.  The people who work here are a delight.  Even when I called the pool to find out what the hours were the person was overly cheerful!  The last day our checkout was at 11AM but our flight didn't leave until 4 - unfortunatley they were booked so I couldn't check out late.  So we took the bags down to the *clearly marked* are to stand in a short line for them to hold them while we did some more hotel hopping...that person...also crazy polite!  It was surreal and I loved my first stay in Vegas - will I stay at the Luxor again - if I'm broke sure...but I think I've gotten the tacky hotel out of my system - I'm ready for some class next time!",0,1,0

After calling Travelocity while waiting at the counter, they were able to get us one of our rooms, then they realized we had booked two, so we had to go through the whole process over again.  After spending AN HOUR at the counter, they were able to get rooms for us.

Upon entering our room, a man from inside comes running at the door, scaring all of us.  THEY GAVE US AN ACTIVE KEY FOR A ROOM THAT ALREADY HAD SOMEONE CHECKED INTO IT.  I made the long trek back down to registration and had informed them of their latest mess up.  They finally gave me an upgraded suite that didn't have anybody in it, but we slept with one eye open hoping nobody would enter our room.

Upon check out it took another HOUR to check out, I'm not kidding, because they couldn't find my info in their system AGAIN.  So I wasted about 3 hours dealing with trying to get the rooms that I had booked 2 weeks in advance, wasting much of our vacation time.  The staff was extremely rude as well, insisting that it was Travelocity's fault even though THEY do things like put people in rooms where others are already staying.  Other people next to me at registration were complaining about things like their rooms not having been cleaned upon their check in.  This place seriously sucks.  The pyramid rooms are junky as well and falling apart.  They waived their BS ""resort fee"" ($30) that they charge you on top of your reservation, but it's obvious that THEY SIMPLY DO NOT CARE at this hotel when I was telling them what I had to deal with.

Feel like everytime I come here it's such a looong walk to the tower then elevator ride then walk to my room. I used to come here every year for a dance competition. Dark ambiance inside the hotel. Neat that you're in a pyramid but after a while it's really just a novelty. Check in line is long at times. You can check out on your room TV and avoid the check out line. Hotel bathrooms have a tub and shower stall. Be careful because the glass door swings out and drips water all over the floor after your shower. Phone by the toilet in case you need help. Pyramid shaped soap doesn't lather up well and is awkward to use due to the shape. No refrigerator so if you need to keep something cool you have to get ice in the ice bucket.  

POOL: Pool area is actually pretty big and decent. Free and no paid pool parties so you can enjoy a free lay out in the sun day. They give you a towel at no charge. 

GYM: Gym is downstairs at the West Tower. You have to walk in through the Spa doors. It has free small bottled water you just have to sign in and show your room key to walk in to the actual gym where the bottled waters are. 

FOOD: Food court upstairs has McDonalds which stays open late so at 3am it was heaven to be able to order some chicken nuggets after staying out all night. 

CASINOS: Tables have a lower minimum bets during the day. Walkway to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay is convenient even though confusing because everything looks the same you have to really pay attention to signs.

OVERALL: A-OK. It seems they have a good amount of special events here like Cris Angel magic show, Jabbawockiez dance show, the dance competitions I used to go to every December, and they had the Pacquiao\/Mayweather boxing fight viewing at the Cris Angel theater that we went to and the main reason why we stayed here.

The value of this place is insane. I never even rented a room here, but I can tell you that if im planning a moderate to low cost trip to vegas, this place is definetly in my top spot to consider. For a town where I rarely even sleep, who cares what the inside of the rooms look like. This venue is stocked with a sick place to eat (backstage deli) and two decent nitelife spots (LAX & Cathouse.) The casino here is also decent, great place to find some late nite tale but points off for the abundance of Staten Island types who find this hotel's gaudy ostentatious decor alluring.

Self parking was $8 with in and out privileges for hotel guests. 

I booked thru Groupon (you get 5% in Groupon credit for booking with them) and chose a ""run of the house"" room which basically means your room is chosen upon check in with a chance of being upgraded if available. I didn't expect much and we ended up getting the basic 2 queen bed room.  

The room was VERY dated and looks like it has seen better days. No fridge, no coffee, no full sized mirror, nothing really special. Since we only needed a room for a place to shower and sleep for one night, I really did not mind. Everything appeared clean, bed was comfortable for the one night I slept in it, shower worked perfectly fine, TV was operating fine. There is a functioning hairdryer and iron + board as well.

""Backstage Deli"" is a quick restaurant by our elevator. It's Vegas, it's convenient and open late, so it's on the pricier side with 2 basic breakfasts for about $25.

Didn't eat anywhere else or watch any shows. There is a small shop called ""Everything $10"" located on the lower level if you forgot to bring a small clutch purse like I did! They carry jewelry and accessories for $10 each.

We blame the horrible trashy clientele on the cheap room specials they seem to run frequently, and while we have enjoyed ourselves here in the past this time was our last.  Mandalay Bay all the way next time; you can see the difference in people just by walking into the casino.

The straw that broke the camel's back (pun intended, cause, you know, the Luxor is a giant pyramid) were the horrible guys in the room next to ours, who seemed to have buddies in another room down the hall and would run back and forth slamming doors all day\/night.  Now keep in mind, we aren't curmudgeonly old folks, we got to bed most nights (er, mornings) around 4:30 AM.  But the idiots next door to us would roll in around 5 AM and scream to each other from likely three feet away (using the most disgusting language); I'm shocked that no one else on the floor complained (or if they did it did nothing, just like us).  And they smoked the most horrible skunk weed at all hours that seeped under our connecting room door to saturate our room with the stench.  As a matter of fact, it invaded the whole floor; you could smell it when you got off the elevator.  It was gross, like someone had actually run over a poor skunk.  Now we were able to tolerate this behavior most days since we had indulged in some cocktails and were lucky to land on the bed when we got back, but on the last day when we had to get up early for our flight, we couldn't take it anymore.  We called security, and when they came up to check on the tenants, they went silent and refused to answer the door.  And that was it.  And the minute security walked away they started right back up again.  

Ignorant garbage like that should be relegated to the cheap motels that their behavior warrants.  Our friend whom booked our room vowed to complain to the front desk, and we have all sworn off the Luxor for good, at least for lodging purposes.",6,4,2

I checked in at 9pm on a Saturday, had booked a non-smoking room and at check in, tipped the girl and asked for either a strip view or upgraded room. She said neither were possible because they're super busy. Ok, fine, I get a room over the parking garage on the 2nd floor. I walk in and it smells like someone just smoked a whole pack of marlboro reds. I forgot to ask, she forgot to tell, it's a super stinky smoking room. I call down asking for options: different room? pay for an upgrade? transfer me to another mgm property? refund? No, No, No, No. Apparently, I got the last room in the hotel at 9pm on a Saturday. Right, Claire, Very-rude front desk girl, I don't believe you.

In the morning I go down with the boyfriend down to talk to the manager (I hate that guys can get more done in this world, but oh well). And after a talk with him, he offered us a ""Player's Suite"" in the tower, but still no view of anything good. When I asked about a strip view he said we could have a one bedroom suite with a strip view for $50 more. I kinda felt like that should have been given after the 3 phone calls and in-person complaint but whatever. The ""Player's Suite"" isn't a suite. It's a normal size room that has a couch instead of a table and chairs and a mini-fridge. The hall also STUNK of old food and ciggs because some very classy people had left they're room service tray in the middle of the hall with cigarette butts thrown in drink glasses.  Awesome.

The Good News: loved the mobile check-in!! We had plans for the day we arrived, so we would not be at the hotel until late. Mobile check-in came in handy. They emailed me when the room was ready, at about 1:00! Great!! When we got to the hotel there was a line to check-in, but no line for the mobile kiosk. It took about 2 minutes to get our keys. Perfect! We had dinner at the food court. Liked the pizza. We also liked the breakfast from Johnny Rockets the next day.  I know the pool gets really busy so I am glad I paid for a day bed in the North Pool, private. Right next to the pool with complimentary water and shade. My girls had plenty of room to frolic. We also ate at the buffet. The food was ok... some items better than others. We always found something we liked. Of course plenty of fun slot machines!!  Check out was easy again with their mobile check-out.

The Bad News: the pillows are a bit too soft and you sink into them (maybe bring your own). The valet was a hit and miss. Sometimes we had to  wait a long time even when there wasn't a lot of people. The ice machine was broken so had to go up and down a floor to get ice throughout our stay. At no fault to the hotel, pool was closed due to inclement weather. I was bummed since I had paid for the day bed and staff said no refunds.  We also had a random person bang at the door at 4:00 a.m. Probably someone lost, crawling back from a night of partying, but scared us awake!

The paint was fading, a bulb was gone in the room, electric fixtures had been ripped out in the corridors, the casino floors stank, and then they stuck with me a $24 resort fee on top of the $200 I'd already paid them.

They were nice about amenities though, and when I mistakenly subscribed to a pay per view movie, they adjusted it when I called them right away...

For floor number 6 instead of having a metal number like all the other floors it actually had been drawn on with a SHARPIE pen! I was appalled but kind of laughed it off. Once we reached our floor and got out I noticed the carpet in the hallway was starting to pull up and looked like it needed to be tightened. Once we opened the door to the room a wave of heat hit me like a ton of bricks. I get that they don't leave the AC on all day but it had to be 90* in there! I walked over to the wall unit and cracked it up but it looked so old and out dated. It never seemed to work properly. The TV\/dresser cabinet was so banged up and a drawer pull was missing. There was also no room service menu to be found. I was so upset, this is not how I wanted my first experience in the wonderful Las Vegas to be. 

We stayed for 4 nights and for 3 of those nights there was a used room service cart sitting in the hallway. Also some beer bottles sitting on top on the garbage can by the elevator. If you are are wanting to plan a trip and want to stay in Luxor, I suggest you wait until they do some MAJOR remodeling. Better yet stay more in the center of the strip. Everything was so outdated here and it was all and all just an unpleasant experience. 

I know one thing for sure... I will NEVER stay in this hotel AGAIN!",4,2,0

The casino area is quite large and very clean. They have enough room to walk around and everything is visible. 

They have great restaurants inside as well as to-go food areas and even little markets inside. All quite nice and with well mannered employees. We ate at about all the major restaurants inside this hotel (please see individual yelp reviews on those).

It used to be affordable to go but when you figure in 8 to 13 a day to park, plus the 30 a night in resort fees adds 200 bucks to a 5 day stay.... that's money that I would normally spend on doings things, but they felt they needed it in fees so in reality the business's suffer because the hotels think that money grows on trees.

Hopefully since our stay, they have gotten things together, but due to lack of response from the Luxor, I wanted to write a review about our stay.

My husband and I stayed at this hotel Sunday January 17 through Wednesday January 20.  Our time there was very disappointing from the beginning of the trip until the very end.  This trip was both mine and my husband's first time ever to Vegas.  We were excited to stay at the Luxor and had heard good things about this hotel.  Not only was this our first trip, this was also our honeymoon.  We had just gotten married January 16, 2010.  

 
 
When we arrived at the hotel, we checked into the east tower registration area.  The person checking us in was not friendly.  We explained that this trip was our honeymoon and he didn't even acknowledge that this was an exciting time for us.  He didn't welcome us to Vegas or even smile to welcome us to the hotel.  He didn't congratulate us.  Two minutes into our hotel and we already were disappointed.  When we arrived at our hotel room, we also had a disappointment.  Right when we entered the room, my husband went into the bathroom and noticed black hair all over the bathroom floor.  I contacted guest services over the phone which took at least 10 minutes to speak to someone and once I came into contact with someone and explained the situation, she did not apologize or show empathy regarding our situation.  She explained that she would have someone up to our room to clean it asap.  We asked her if we needed to be in the room when housekeeping arrived and she said no.  We left immediately (hadn't even unpacked our bags) and came back to our room 3 hours later.  The floor had still not been cleaned, it still had black hairs on the floor.  I contacted guest services on the phone again and after waiting for ten minutes, was able to speak to someone.  Again, the person I spoke with did not show empathy or acknowledge that the room was still dirty.  After getting off the phone with her, I pulled down our bed sheets and noticed there was black hairs on the pillowcases as well as stains.  I immediately walked downstairs and spoke with Dawna who upgraded us to a suite.  Please keep in mind that we hadn't even unpacked our suitcases.  The offer to upgrade us to a suite was nice, but unnecessary.  It was only the two of us staying in the room and we didn't utilize the suite.  It really wasn't necessary.  There probably could have been more effective ways to rectify the situation.  Not only that, there was a time that I needed more towels and it took over an hour and two phone calls to receive the towels.  We also ate all of our meals at the luxor.  One time, I went up into the food court and ordered a meatball sub off of the quizno's menu and they said it wasn't available.  Another time I ordered a Starbucks skinny cinnamon dolce latte and they told me that wasn't available.  Both times it was on the menu, but not available.  To top it off, the day we were checking out, the entire hotel did not have hot water, so I had to leave the hotel without a shower and that is bothersome for me.  As someone who showers everyday and relies on showers for the wake up effects, it really put a damper on my day.  The staff was unpleasant and seemed to be in a bad mood most of the time.

I emailed them multiple times to receive a response and never once heard back.  I didn't even receive an automated apology response.  A little customer service goes a long way in my book.  I have spread the word and have told many people what a horrible experience we had.",0,0,0

Good things: our check-in lady was very sweet, it's on the strip, and the pool seemed pretty clean. Bad things: we checked in and went to our room on the 15th floor and it was a total dump! The furniture is old, tarnished, chipped, and ugly. The AC is not central...and it was actually pumping out warm air. So, we opened it up and the filter hadn't been cleaned in a long time (gross!).  After about an hour of waiting for it to ""kick in"" we realized it wasn't going to get better so we called the front desk to see if maintenance could come look. They never came. Another hour or so went by and we were SO hot so we called and asked for another room. They said yes so we started packing up and no kidding not more than 2 minutes later housekeeping just walks right in and says she needs the room to prepare for the next guest. Damn, they were on top of it when it came to making money but not to make sure their guests weren't dying of heat stroke. More bad things: a freaking ""resort fee"" (I think $15 per night)...for shit I didn't need or use (wifi and gym). There's no coffee pot in the room. If you want to use the pool be prepared because it's a $100 charge for an umbrella (vip access)...so stupid. They nickel and dime you to death! Bathroom only has one sink and shower is outdated.

No, I'm talking about the roughly 2 years and 2 months since the time I first stayed at Luxor.  That first time in 2009 wasn't great either, but at least the room was clean and the service was friendly and helpful.

This time, well...here's my check-in experience in a nutshell:
Waiting in line for the next check-in desk to open up.  One opens, and I walk towards it, noticing that the woman at the desk (her name is Shelly) doesn't beckon me over, but she also doesn't flip her sign from ""Check In"" to ""Closed"", as I'd seen others do when they closed their desks.  So I walk over and wait for her to finish typing and look up, which takes several minutes.  When she does look up...
Shelly:  ""Can I HELP you with something?""
Me:  ""Yes, I have reservations under...""
Shelly (cutting me off):  ""Wait wait wait wait.   Are you CHECKING IN?""
Me (looking up at the Check In sign):  ""Yes.""
Shelly:  ""Hmmp.""  (cranes her neck to also see that the sign reads Check In)  (Then, in a low and disappointed tone) ""All right,  well let's check you in.""

The rest of the conversation went about the same way.  Clearly I ruined Shelly, the check-in clerk's day by approaching her and expecting to be checked in.  Had I known this beforehand, I would have avoided my social faux pas by simply booking a room at a hotel where they actually like to see customers coming in to spend their cash.  Unfortunately, the check-in was not the only thing that soured me on Luxor.  Housekeeping skipped our room entirely the second day of our visit.  The bed was uncomfortable such that I woke up sore every morning, and I'm not normally picky about beds.  All in all, our room was pretty tired and far from spotless.  (This was in the Towers, the part of the hotel that is supposed to be newer than the Pyramid.)

Great looking building architectural wise...i don't know about the inside though...wasn't to impressed. As soon as I entered to check in the time share crew mobbed me. They took up about 20 minutes of my valuable time. The front desk was not so friendly either...the lady was not interested with making us feel welcome. It was like every time i asked here a question she gave me a puzzled face very awkward...so i told myself whatever not gonna trip and proceeded to my room but then it gets worse....

The elevator fiasco....

The elevators were well hidden but i got lucky and found the right one. My luck ran out quick though....didn't know I had to use my room card to work the elevator. The front desk should give you a heads up on that one. I ended up going in and out of the elevator 2 times trying to get to my room.

The pool was packed during the day and closed at night. I wanted to go swimming at night! 

The worst part of this hotel is that it was such a trek to the room because of the shape of the hotel.

Do they really think people come to Vegas and stay in a giant pyramid because they want it to have a modern decor? Gimme a break. 

I booked a pyramid suite for 3 nights here because it was relatively cheap (around $80 night BEFORE resort fees) and because I'd always been curious about staying here. 

Self parking is around back. Do yourself a favor and park on the top level, since the bottom level parking is a dank, musty maze that you'll realize requires you to find an elevator to go up one level anyway. 

Why is check-in so slow at every single hotel? Don't you people want me liquored up and gambling asap?

We were on the 30th floor, and the inclinator (they aren't elevators because they move at an angle) for the 30th floor is inconveniently far away from everything. It is also slow. 

I give them major props for making the pictures of our suite look amazing on the website, whereas the reality is a dressed-up Motel 6 room with a big tub and some Egyptian hieroglyphics. Their modern renovation clearly wasn't thought out, since the room looked like it couldn't decide whether to be chic or Egyptian (like, you know, everyone who stays here would expect). It just looks... well, pathetic, really. And there's virtually nothing on the walls. Any excitement it may have once possessed has had its brain removed and it now sits, mummified, in some storage room. 

Speaking of the tub (aka half the reason I booked this suite), it no longer has any jets, and the side panel for maintenance was hanging off, revealing a cavernous lair of decrepit pipes. Way to make an entrance, guys. 

Our a\/c unit was leaking so much that the carpet was sopping wet as far as a foot away from it. I was going to call the front desk and have them change our room, but I'd also already set up my makeshift bar and started drinking, so I just went all ghetto and put a couple towels on the floor. 

Bathrooms are surprisingly large and spacious, but the showerhead is a cheap piece of crap. 

No wi-fi... unless you want to pay $20\/day. I have a hard time typing that without laughing. Who the fuck are they kidding? This is 2013; reservations are made based on wi-fi availability in many cases. 

They do have a fully kick ass gym, though! And it's always empty.  Lots of free weights, cable machines, dumbbells, cardio equipment, etc. I was seriously impressed since I've been to better hotels that aren't half this good. 

I know staying here is cheap and all, but unless you have no discernible sense of taste I'd recommend dropping your cash elsewhere. Without the Egyptian theme at play here it just feels like any other hotel. Well, any other CHEAP ASS hotel. And it's so far away from the ""meat"" of the Strip that you'll be cabbing it every night.",10,13,6

We got to the Luxor and while trying to navigate the place and find the check- in area, an employee approached us, offered directions, and asked if we were married or lived together and made a beautiful couple. We felt complimented as we had spent the morning running through Texas heat to the airport after parking since we were running late, I broke a heel, my boyfriend had been lugging around my luggage, and we pretty much looked disheveled and lost. When we confirmed that we live together, she told us that she was going to ""have a friend hook us up"" for staying at the resort. She lead us to a desk and told the employee sitting there that we lived together, then left. The guy at the desk began to tell us about a deal where we would go tour a new hotel further down the strip and would receive $250 in chips, food coupons, etc and a discount ticket for a show (or a fully paid one, he wasn't clear on which), all for $50. We told the guy our main priority was getting checked in to the hotel and getting changed and that we would be back down thereafter - he kept pushing for us to do it right then. Mind you, I have done one of these tours in Vegas with a different resort for FREE and got all of the same benefits along with a 2 hour pressure sale that ended in me getting insulted for not buying in. I thought for a second that this one would be different since we would have to pay, so my boyfriend and I pulled out our credit cards. Turns out, it was cash only - the guy then instructed my boyfriend to go to the ATM and come back with cash to get the deal. He started pressuring more and we declined at this point figuring out that if it was this tough to say no to this guy, we were going to be bullied at the resort when we wouldn't be interested in a time-share or condo. We finally broke away by giving a false promise to come back and navigated ourselves to the check in counter. 

The line to check in was atrocious, but it went by pretty fast. The front desk person was nice and told us she was giving us a room in the pyramid with the best view. The elevators to our floor were totally dirty and obviously worn-out. The walkway to our room looked directly down to I guess some construction, it was basically a dark, somewhat scraggly replica building set up to look like New York that looked like it hadn't been used in years. There were beer cans and holes all over the roof of the replica that we could see from the walkway. The floors in the walkway were also gross and covered in stains. There were towels and sheets piled in the walkway even after housekeeping went by the next day.

We stayed in the Pyramid Spa Suite, which was nice in theory. It was really rad to have a Jacuzzi directly next to a window with a nice view, the bed was clean and comfortable, and the room was larger than what we needed. On the other hand, the toiletries provided were pretty much what you would get at a Motel 6 (I have had much nicer toiletries provided at other hotels in Vegas), I had all of my own, so this wasn't a big deal, but it's the thought that counts; the TVs were old 90s tube televisions, we don't watch television anyway, but modern electronics have an aesthetic appeal; there was no wifi, just an Ethernet cable that we had to unwind from above the TV; and the furniture was all badly worn. It basically looked like the room was allowed to sit and be used for 10 years without any renovation or furniture upkeep. 

We had been warned by some of my boyfriend's friends that live in Vegas to stay away from the tables at the Luxor. We didn't listen and decided to play the tables - his friends were right - although we ended up breaking somewhat even, we felt pretty raped in the process. I have never in my life seen a blackjack dealer get so many 21s from high and low cards combined and get blackjacks a few times in a row on every table whilst the players mainly got only 12 - 16 almost every time. 

Throughout our stay, we kept getting hustled by the time-share people. As polite as we are or try to be, in the end, we had to ignore any employee that attempted to talk to or compliment us because it got so bad. We didn't go to any clubs or to the pool because the rest of the guests seemed to have the class, look, and intelligence of the Jersey Shore cast (urge to kill rising). 

The buffet was not spectacular, but wasn't bad and the employees were really sweet. We ended up enjoying the Pyramid Café a lot. We also drank the beers at one of the drink stands downstairs - $8 for an Abbey Ale (we were really stoked about this since shots were $9 apiece from room service). 

We ended up going to a show at a different casino down the strip and ended up being more impressed with the lobby, casino, and walk way to the show more than the Luxor as a whole.",0,0,0

The casino was great (and the tables treated us well), the staff were all super friendly and the buffet was good (at least for Saturday brunch).

That said, it doesn't have that super clean feel that I love about the Mirage. It's definitely on the dirtier side, but I'd still stay here again if the Mirage rates are sky high.

 Als erstes also Freikarten holen, dann zocken. Übrigens, wer in Las Vegas zockt bekommt Getränke umsonst! Einige wissen das nicht und bezahlen sich dumm und dämlich ;-)


 In dem Club lief gute Musik, das Publikum war gemischt von 20 bis 60 alles dabei. Die Bedienungen sind sehr nett anzuschauen...


 Achja und die Herrentoiletten mit dem Concierge der einem die Seife in die Hand pumpt, einem den Wasserhahn an und ausstellt, fragt ob man noch eines der ca. 20 verschiedenen Parfums aufgetragen bekommen möchte oder gegen ein kleines Trinkgeld noch die eine oder andere Zigarette haben möchte (ca. 10 verschiedene Marken), war der Hit.

We stayed 1 night over Labor Day Weekend on Sunday night after a 3 day stay at our time share.  I emailed Customer Relations and also completed my survey after my stay indicating ""Yes"" I would like to be contacted by management abou the problems during my stay. 

Neither resulted in a call or email or letter from a manager so here goes:

1. No Customer Service skills-The staff all seemed like begrudged workers who hated their jobs and all customers.  EXCEPT for the switchboard operator that answered my late night call to report:  This was from check in to bar staff, to restaurant to maintenance.

2.  We went to go to bed and there was seriously rumpled sheets with BIG HOLES in them and brownish\/blackish thick substance on them!!  Obviously feces, disgusting!@@!  I called to report this problem and they sent someone in about 10 minutes who brought sheets and ""offered"" to call someone else to come put them on???  Why would they send someone to bring them if they wouldn't come in and pu tthem on so whatever we did it ourselves.  We didn't change the other bed and were disgusted so much we got up and checked out before 6 am!

3.  Elevator buttons don't work for certain floors, when reported to staff member he just chuckled after we had gone up and down several times and had to get off on other floors and get in another elevator to get to our floor..horrible service.

4.  Sigh, the reason I love Vegas, the pool....the smell when crossing over from the parking lot to the hotel that crosses over to the pool stinks like sewer.  I understand this is a big city and behind the resorts can often smell.  Unfortunately this smell permeates throughout the pool area.  There is also yucky mucky water in the pool that is milky and not clear.  There is trash around the pool and when I asked the staff they just claimed there wasn't enough help to keep it clean...gross.  We went over to Excalibur pool and it's crystal clear, clean, no trash and no smell.

Like I said, I got no response, no nothing except for a cheesy promo code offer to come back and stay with them again...really????  poop on the sheets that were rumpled and ripped..I don't think so, I asked for my money back or a comped stay in an upgraded rooms so they could prove to me they are worth their 4 star rating and NOTHIN.

So, this is not a good Vegas experience.  I consider myself a pretty seasoned Vegas traveler and believe me, there are far better places to stay for the same amount of money.",2,2,2

One word.....'bedbug'....we were shocked to have discovered one crawling on our bed. After the initial reaction of flicking it off the bed, we realized we should retain the bug and report to the hotel staff. After waiting for what seemed to be forever for the receptionist to answer the call to report our findings, they finally answered then sent security up to our room. Again waiting for what seemed to be forever. The security came, we gave him the bed bug for evidence. By this time the bug was seeping blood from probably being flicked off the bed w\/ his belly full of human blood. (We know it was a bed bug!) No report was filed because we could not verify that one of us had been bitten. However it seemed pretty obvious considering the blood coming from the bug. In any event we were told to simply get our clothing cleaned and send Luxor the bill. Security left. After thinking about this further we decided to go downstairs to report because we didn't want to send a bill in for the cleaning and them not having anything on record. We went downstairs, took forever to get the manager over. Basically they offered to take ALL our clothing and clean it themselves then 'ship' us the clothing. Seriously? by this time we had already loaded the luggage into our car. Now the car could possibly be infected? not to mention we would be w\/out our clothing for like 2 wks. They refused to discount the room and they also seemed to be unconcerned about the incident. It was not taken seriously. Basically they were to shut the room down for the next customer and take our clothes and inspect the room for 'possible' infestation. They said the would call regarding their finding. The fact that we gave the bug to the security appeared to be irrelevant. The bug was the 'evidence' in our opinion. But that didn't mean much to them. 

Basically I don't feel they took the situation seriously. They didn't care about the car, the luggage or anything else we had brought, except for the cleaning of our clothing. So what would happen if the luggage was infected or anything else was exposed. Cleaning the clothes seemed like only a small portion of what could have possibly been exposed. 

Our main reason for reporting this, was to report the incident and not have the next customer exposed to this situation. Having us exposed to this bed bug or many more was completely disgusting and made our departure a disappointment. 

We are left w\/ cleaning our car, our luggage and our laundry thoroughly, ourselves. A complete inconvenience.

On top of it, they NEVER called us to advised if they found an infestation.  Whether or not they found one, there was absolutely positivity a BEDBUG in our bed.  There lack of not calling us after they said they would shows they DON'T care.

- Nice looking building & gaming floor
- parking access if reasonably convenient
- Staff is polite, especially the house keeping staff
Cons:
- Got our room on Groupon for about $40\/night.  When we got there we we told there was a $30 resort fee (the resort fee is now a common thing).  They said your room is paid for but you can not use it without paying the fee.  I am surprised this is legal.
- There is an $8\/day parking fee.  We only noticed MGM properties charging for parking.
- You will be approached by Time Share salesmen on the casino floor and they will get in your face.  Very surprising.
- There is a $5\/day room upgrade charge to get a ""non run down"" room.
- On Friday & Saturday the checkin counter looks like a cattle line at Disneyland.
- The hotel locked us out of our room when they discovered they forgot to get our credit card number (whatever happened to just calling?).  While waiting to get access to our room again there were 2 other angry couples who showed up that were locked out. 
- Hardly see any cocktail waitresses which is surprising.  But there are plenty of places to buy drinks.

Summary:  Seems Luxor is run more by bean counters.  In the old days casinos wanted you to lose money at the tables, not nickle-dime customers at every turn.

On our dresser wardrobe, the paint was faded and one of the handles was missing.  In the bathroom, some of tile had also fallen off.  Overall lighting was poor in both the bathroom and the main room, even when the drapes were drawn back.

We had called a few times and let housekeeping know about this incident but the entire weekend we were there, and nobody came up to fix the problem.

Well not that bad because I'm not down for places getting the best of me. So I stayed here during Magic last month because of it's close proximity to Mandalay Bay (woulda stayed Mandalay because it has great pools but obviously it's not the season plus I had a strict budget). I had always heard about their sideways elevator so I was anticipating awesomeness. WTF is the big deal. I couldn't even tell, it just felt like a fast abrupt elevator. So to make sure, I called the front desk and her reply was ""You couldn't feel it?"" (in the RUDEST of tones). NO biotch I couldn't! Strike 1

After we got back from seeing Zumanity (which is a Vegas MUST because it's sexy, arousing and hilarious! Can you Yelp about shows, etc.?) we came back to the room to hang out, drink and bond in our pajamas. Well during my bedtime routine in the bathroom, I dropped my tweezers on the bathroom floor and, to my horror, realized that it was DISGUSTING! There were nasty pubes and dust bunnies and other stuff that I didn't catch because I was in shock. As I came out frantic, my friend was complaining that the remote and TV didn't work and the only channel we could access was the M Life (MGM promo\/advertising) one. Great! I hate calling and complaining and sounding like a petty bitch. Well they said housekeeping and a repairman would be sent up. The repair guy came but when it couldn't be fixed he said he'd be right back... which apparently meant never. Same with housekeeping. So, after an hour of huffing and puffing we called again. They sent another repairman up who actually resolved the problem and comped us breakfast. Still no housekeeping... but time to go to bed. 

The next day we did our thing but came back to the room in the evening to realize that no one had cleaned the bathroom again! Another call and more bitching (the guy said he could even hear my friend giving her two cents in the background, nice!) this time to the main manager guy because all of his subordinates were SO RUDE, all five of the ones we talked to. They finally cleaned it, gave us a shower cap (which hotel doesn't have shower caps right there in the bathroom?) and comped us a buffet dinner for two (it was aight) and half of one night's stay. I was happy but it was like pulling teeth. 

The saga continues... During check out I reminded the lady at the front desk that so and so (I forgot his name now) had comped half a night's stay. Well since it wasn't ""noted"" they couldn't do it. I DON'T THINK SO. I busted out into ""just because he's incompetent and forgot to ""note"" (full use of quotation fingers) the account doesn't mean that I'm not obliged to what was promised. He said it will be deducted so I expect to have it taken care of. You can call him right now.""  After much deliberation and calling in the manager's manager they decided to fulfill what they said they would in the first place. I can't stand when someone has attitude. Get out of the service profession if you're not gonna be customer oriented! I wanted to say to the desk lady ""do you think I'm lying?"" Instead of saying ""no I can't do that, it's not noted"" an alternative would be ""hmm, the notes don't mention the room reduction but let me check on that for you"". Easy breezy. I told her I didn't like her attitude and then she apologized and was gracious. Why do I even have to go there???

Needless to say, I won't stay here again (if I can help it). But on a light note, my friend and I went to Cat House, the bar\/club on our side of the hotel (because there was no cover before 10:30 AND free cocktails, what a bargain!) and it was fabulous. The decor was grand, drinks were strong and the vibe was good (not too many douche bags). I would want a bar like this if I owned one as it had a black\/white\/burgurdy burlesque theme with old b\/w\/ pictures, dim lighting, wall sconces and old Vegas style booths. Saved the stay!",3,3,1

To me the Luxor is a Vegas classic like the MGM or Caesars, you know people know this hotel and it's part of the heart of the Vegas strip. So with that in mind I did have sorta\/kinda high expectations.  When we arrived at 1am, the line to check in was like a Disneyland ride line. Luckily I had a drink bought for me and the line actually moved. I was excited to stay in the pyramid part of the hotel because I thought it would be fun but obviously it's the part of the hotel that hadn't been renovated; which explains why the tower rooms are more expensive because when I got a chance to up to one of those rooms (which I wont say how because what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas) those rooms are so much nicer! It wasn't gross and old like some off the strip hotel but it wasn't as luxurious as I pictured it to be AND, this is an important and, the bathroom toilet in our room hadn't been cleaned and we had to have someone come up and clean it. Which set the tone for housekeeping for the rest of the weekend, they really didn't clean.  Also the toilet was extremely low flow, it couldn't flush down toilet paper! But the staff that I had interacted with was very friendly, surprisingly so for the amount of people that were staying at the hotel and no doubt the amount of rude people I'm sure they had to deal with.

We really stayed here for the Bodies exhibit, which was amazing! I can't even describe this exhibit you just have to see it for yourself. We ended up buying a ticket package for $54 that was for three exhibits, so on top the Bodies exhibit we saw Titanic and the Reef at Mandalay.  The Titanic exhibit was wayyyyy better then I expected it to be; it was so captivating and entertaining.  My thoughts on the The Reef at Mandalay are a little skewed since I didn't sleep the night before, so I was dead tired, maybe a little drunk still and heading towards a hang over; and there were way more kids there then made it worth it.

However, I never stayed at the Luxor, and to be honest always thought of it as one of the dumpier hotels on the strip. Well I recently got engaged and my fiancé and I decided we wanted to get married in Vegas. Two of my friends and I decided it would be a fun girls trip to fly to Vegas spur of the moment to look at wedding venues. Seeing as this was a spur of the moment trip, we wanted to keep it as cheap as possible. After some price checking, we found out we could stay at the Luxor for right around $30 a night (FYI our trip was only week days and no weekends). With three in our room this was basically free, but keep in mind that you do get charged tax and a daily resort fee (I believe around $15 a day for the resort fee). Still a cheap trip for three nights. 

When we walked in, I was actually surprised at the hotel. It was cleaner and nicer than I had remembered. Check in was easy and our room was good. The room wasn't anything special, but it was clean and roomy enough. 

We ventured to the pool which was also nicer than I had expected. Plenty of chairs available, decent sized pool, and plenty of drinks\/food options outside. You have the option to purchase a Luxor drink cup for cocktails and you can refill for the rest of your trip at a much cheaper rate. Def worth if if you plan to have a few drinks. We also ate lunch at the pool one day. Plenty of options for an outdoor cafe and everything tasted good. 

There are plenty of options for dining from a food court, Starbucks, or sit down dining. Plenty of slot machines available too. I don't play any table games so I cant say anything about that. There is an escalator that connects directly to the Mandalay Bay hotel. You don't even need to walk outside. Mandalay also had many dining\/drinking options. 

Only real downside is the location. It's not horrible but it is at the end of the strip so cabs to most places are needed. Not a big deal as cabs are always readily available and it's not expensive to get to the other end of the strip.

But, hello, mark your casino!  I like big glowing signs with arrows pointing me in the right direction.  There would be signs and then nothing.  We finally got up to their food court.

Our first room was hot, stuffy, smelly, and the A\/C knobs didn't appear to be in working condition.  In the process of moving to a new room, the bellman left behind one of our bags; which we didn't notice until midnight when we got back to our room and settled in. 
Thus began a 45+ minute nightmare of the hotel not knowing where our bag was and saying our old room was already re-occupied (why were they still putting guests in that gross room??), then not knowing how to get to our bag because it was locked up, then not being able to specifically locate it because it wasn't logged correctly by whoever threw it in to the lost and found. 
The next day we tried to recover mentally by hanging out at the pool.  We had a decent time, but it was way too crowded.  Even though there are several good sized pools, only one was open for some reason.  It was a bummer to be eyeing the serenity of a beautiful, empty, roped-off pool while packed in to one pool with 300 other people. 
I wouldn't stay at the Luxor again.  At about $165\/night, it's no longer a bargain.  It's only about $100 less than the Palazzo suite we'd been staying in earlier in the week, and that hundred bucks made a world of difference in experience.  

I do want to give kudos to the staff, though.  Most were forgettable, some were crappy, but there are some gems here.  
Louie Louie, the bellman.  When we had to store our bags until our flight, I thought my boyfriend would never release his white-knuckle grip on ""the"" bag.  Louie was awesome and made us feel like our stuff was safe. 
Chad, the bellman.  When it came time to get our stuff out of storage and hail a cab, the taxi line was about 30 people deep.  He zipped us to the front, stole a ride, and loaded our stuff up.  Thanks, Chad! 
And most of all Ira, the night time manager.  When it seemed like we'd never get our bag back, Ira stepped in and finally got the show on the road.  He was great and it seemed like he really cared and understood why we were so frustrated.",3,1,2

The Luxor Hotel has been my worst experience so far.
Here are bullet points from my experience:

- The ""check in"" process was terribly sluggish; they did not have enough staff to handle the demand of the guests checking in. A day after staying there, I walked across the lobby and even during mid day, there was still an ridiculous line of guests waiting on service.

- The A\/C unit inside my room (and my other business partner) was weak; it was not able to provide a cool room temperature even if you leave running for hours.

- Their WiFi service was so sluggish that I was unable to complete any productive tasks; the speedtest rated it approx 3 megabit\/sec which is slower than traditional DSL lines.

- The shower pressure was weak; I was unable to thoroughly clean myself. Even the faucet had a better waterflow coming out.

- I plugged in my Amazon FireTV Stick into the TV, and I tried to use it, but to my dismay you cannot change the TV to a HDMI input. The TV remote they provide only links to their paid service, and cannot change the input to a HDMI one. Even calling room service did not help.

Other tidbits are they provide no fridge or microwave.

I was looking to find a decent hotel to spend a summer weekend in Vegas with my boyfriend. Sure, Luxor had a great budget-friendly rate to offer for a weekend stay. That may have been the problem; you get what you pay for. 

Upon arrival, the concierge didn't even confirm the type of room I had requested. Instead, he just gave me a standard room when I clearly requested an upgrade as part of my MLife rewards. I decided not to ruin my trip over that ""small"" matter. That became the least of my worries as the weekend progressed. On the first night, I noticed an awful smell coming from the A\/C vent, and realized that it was leaking and the water was being absorbed in the carpet leaving a humid smell. I called guest services and they assured me that someone would take care of the problem in the next hour. After waiting an hour, my boyfriend and I decided to leave so we could make it to our dinner reservation, and I called guest services to let them know.

After a long night out, we returned only to find that nothing had been taken care of. I was soo upset at this point and called for the third time!  The representative told me they couldn't switch rooms and that instead, he could give me a 20% discount for the inconvenience. I decided that if they took care of it by the next day, it wouldn't be a problem. Day 2 came along and still, the A\/C was leaking. I talked to a representative in person, and they offered me yet another discount. Why can't these people just move our room and fix the damn leak?!

Finally, we checked out on the 3rd day and made it safely back home to San Diego. Upon our return, we noticed that my boyfriends 2 pairs of shoes were missing! We had a bellman pick up our things when we had checked out and they had lost the bag of shoes, about $150 value for both pairs. I was sooo furious, and this time, I called and asked for the Manager of VIP sales. After making a big fuss, he decided to waive our 1 night stay since he couldn't find the bag.

A huge plus, in my mind at least, was the fact that they had free parking in back for their customers. I was a little shocked simply because they could almost certainly have gotten away with charging a few dollars a day for the right to park there. Finding it, however, was another matter as some of the signs to find it were very cryptic. We had to drive by twice before finding it. That being the case, I had no idea we had that opportunity so we ended up renting a car. 

Walking into the hotel the casino is right there at the bottom of the pyramid. It wasn't particularly large, but it was very easy to get lost in especially on your first few days there. After a while it became easier, but the unorthodox layout of the hotel overall certainly didn't help the matter.

The staff was very friendly upon check in and despite a problem with payment, they were very hospitable. Arriving at the room was the biggest disappointment for me, personally. I've stayed in hotels throughout the world and I would say that the amenities at the Luxor was somewhat disappointing. They completely lacked a minifridge and their toilet paper felt like -- we'll stop there and you can figure that number out. 

The hotel has a rail connection to both Mandalay Bay and the neighboring Excalibur hotel both of which the hotel ALSO has footbridges to. Furthermore, if you're trying to get out of the hotel by cab (or anything for that matter) note that there is a entrance on the north side that no one ever uses. It was easy for us to catch a cab there, easy for us to be picked up there, overall it was a smarter choice than the main entrance where everyone flocks. 

Their show Fantasy was essentially a topless dance routine, but there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. The dancers were talented and they were entertaining. I do have to throw out there, however, that the comedian in this show Sean E Cooper was probably the best part of it and it's unfortunate that he doesn't have his own show.

The hotel has a buffet but my friends and I often opted instead for the food court which is populated with Quiznos, McDonalds, Nathans, Starbucks and several other fast food joints. The food court never failed my drunken taste buds at 2 am.

Lastly, whoever designed the hotel, whether out of necessity or design, seemed to really just want to hide the gym. I spent a good fifteen, twenty minutes walking around looking for it. 

Overall, however, the hotel provided bedding and a shower which are essentially the only things I used it for. My experience may have been colored by both the company I kept and the experience I had, but overall, the hotel gave us a great place to hang out.",0,0,0

FRONT DESK MANAGER CHRIS S. NEEDS RETRAINING ON CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

Let me just say that I have stayed at Luxor for years with no problems and always had pleasant service until TODAY. My party and I booked our rooms in December of 2015 for dates 2\/4-2\/7, 2016. 

We checked in, went up to our room, opened our door and found our had NOT BEEN CLEANED. There were beer cans everywhere, beds had been a mess and still reeked of body odor, along with the previous guests other trash sitting around. We called the front desk waited 15-20 minutes for an employee to arrive to give us new keys for our new room that we were being moved too. 

We got to the next room and realized it was a non-smoking room. We called the front desk and was told this was a new policy as of last month. 

I have no problem with the new policy being that I can easily change my reservation with sufficient notice so I can be fully refunded. HOWEVER Luxor did not notify us of the new policy even though we booked 2 months ahead and the new policy was effective January 2016. 

The reason why we were so upset was not the fact that we could not smoke. The main reason of the smoking room was because 2 members of our party burn incense for religious purposes daily. 

We called and expressed our concern over not notifying us about the change in policy. We asked if there was any way they could accommodate us (freedom of religion right?). Chris S. not only gave two shits about the fact that 2 members of our party were inconvenienced upon arrival but seemed uninterested and bothered at the fact that we were asking him to do his job. 

We asked if he could call a sister hotel like Excalibur to see if we could get our rate matched and moved and we were told he could only offer us same day rates which were over $250 a night. Mind you our total 3 night stay was originally to be $344 resort fee included. 

We hung up with Chris S. and proceeded to call Excalibur ourselves. Not only did they understand our situation BUT they matched our rate! We called Luxor's front desk back and informed them we would be needing a refund bc we were checking out asap!

Luxor went ahead and only refunded us 2 nights out of 3 that we paid for. When we asked why only 2 nights we were told that they would have to charge overnight due to the fact that you must cancel reservations within 24 hours for full refund. 

By now we were so frustrated we just decided to end it there and head over to Excalibur. 

We checked into Excalibur and were given and EXTRA DISCOUNT for being an mlife member. In total we paid $284 for 3 nights AND we were upgrade for FREE! THANK YOU EXCALIBUR AND CHRIS ( ironically same name lol), for the excellent customer service!

Update- Our stay at Excalibur was exceptional! 
Also since the Luxor front desk manager would not give us his last name we took the liberty of using good ol' LinkedIn. I'm sorry but if you're a manager (hospitality industry) in one of the busiest places in the world and you refuse to give your name you are in the wrong industry!

I don't know why my dad always insists that my family spend the night in this hotel on Vegas vacations. And I don't know how he talks me into it. Every time I check in I get the WORST customer service. This time, the woman behind the counter was vicious, trying to convince me that I had only asked for one room, when my printed receipts clearly stated otherwise. 

On the way to the elevator I got a fresh look at the peeling and scratched up wallpaper that I admired so much the last time I was there (and that still hasn't been replaced).

The rooms also haven't changed a bit in years. They're still hopelessly muggy every time I walk in and the towels always smell like. . . well, not fresh. 

But new this time: Starbucks after Starbucks after Starbucks. There are at least three within an eighth-of-a-mile radius. I don't really know who this is aiming to please. It kind of just pissed me off. Neither of them was ever crowded when I walked by them, so it just seemed excessive. They could certainly replace one with something else.

I had a great, albeit brief, stay in the Great Pyramid of Las Vegas.  Both the exterior and interior of this structure are just jaw-droppingly stunning, and the guest room itself wasn't bad either.  Of course, I imagine part of the reason I enjoyed staying here as much as I did was due to the fact that it was on a weekday during the off-season (late October), when the prices are lower and the crowds less dense.

Our room on the 27th floor of the pyramid looked out on the Sphinx below and McCarran International Airport across The Strip, as well as miles beyond due to the clear desert air.  From just outside our door the view from the interior hallway was nearly as spectacular: the apex of the building above and the enormous atrium spread out below.  

The room was clean, comfortable, and stylish without going overboard on the theme (no hieroglyphs on the walls or anything).  Check in and check out were surprisingly efficient considering the amount of people they were dealing with, and we were even treated to a coupon book (good at both Luxor and Excalibur) that included a $20 credit for food and\/or drinks at several hotel bars.

Getting from Luxor to Mandalay Bay (South) or Excalibur (North) can be accomplished on foot without ever leaving the climate controlled fantasyland of shops, restaurants, and casino floors, or via a free tram that departs from the Sphinx.

Not me tho! I'm a fan of this place. 

I had a trip scheduled to Vegas for 4 days, staying at Aria. 
I then decided to go out a day early and didn't want to pay another night of the high Aria price so I pulled up Luxor on their website. 
I have stayed here a couple times since it was built and always liked it. 
Price online $58 which included the $14.50 'resort fee'. Killer price. 
I stayed in the older Pyramid Rooms because I like being at the top of the pyramid. it totally freaks me out! 
The room was exactly the same as I remembered. Nothing flashy, but it was clean and great for the price. 
The resort fee included wired internet which worked perfect. 
(Internet at Aria?? $15.00 per day!) 

So they have totally changed the vibe at Luxor. No more boat ride or motion rides or anything for the 'family'. This place is now strictly for adults. To me the place has a dark, erotic feel to it. 
It is very dark in the place, but that just adds to the whole Pyramid eeriness. 

I was on the 27th floor of the pyramid. It still freaks me out and makes me sick to my stomach to stand against the short little wall and look down to the inside of the pyramid. Definitely nothing like it around!

Yes the place is a little worn, but they are slowly bringing it back to life. 
I'm not a fan of Criss Angel so I wouldn't pay to see his show. It was weird to see all the tattooed look-alikes walking around the place! 
Definitely a younger, more casual crowd the night I was there. 

Great music blasting throughout the casino was a nice touch too. 
When is the last time you heard ""Erotica"" by Madonna??!! I should probably give Luxor 5 stars just for that!",6,3,5

After reading the reviews I was apprehensive, but my overall experience was solid.  I found no AMAZING aspects to my stay, but I also did not having anything happen that soured me.

The Egyptian theme is cool, there are lots of thematic things to walk around and see.  I also found the staff to be friendly.  My biggest gripe would be that the place is dated, not horrible, but also not new like a lot of the Vegas hotels.  This place is still popular, the check-in line is usually busy, but it moves quick.

I stayed in the East tower which was fine, but getting to the elevators for the first time is a bit of a maze.  I did like the gym facilities, the equipment was nice\/new, and they had plenty of options.  You might as well use it, they charge a 'resort fee' which covers the not really free wifi and the gym.  The wifi was adequate, not lighting fast, but acceptable.

I did get a chance to use the pool, which has a fun set up, with a pyramid in the middle which has a waterfall into each pool.  This main area has various pools attached, 4 in total I think.  If you don't like the pyramid pool area, they have another pool which is quieter and more refined.  The pool areas are ideal for families, not the out of control Vegas pool party which some hotels have.  

3 stars feels about right.",7,3,5

We wanted something cheap with decent quality. And that's exactly what the Luxor is. Don't expect anything fancy. 

Very simple. Rather quiet. Older crowd. It's not exactly in the middle of the strip but the end, costs approximately $10-15 for a cab ride to the other side of the strip depending on traffic. We got a two queen bed room for less than $80 for a night. The room was clean. Bathroom clean. There's no aux dock\/cable for you to play your music though. There was a table with a mirror for girls that need to get ready. For early check in before 1 pm costs around $20, after 1 free. They allowed a complimentary late check out until noon.

The bed was very uncomfortable, I could hardly sleep at all on them and when i did it was only because the noise from downstairs has quietened down a little.

They didn't listen and no one else said or did anything except a couple people near the old man. Anyway I ran to the life guard for help, took a couple tries to get her attention. In a matter of minutes the old man got back up, he appeared to be drunk and seemed ok. Minutes later more staff and an officer came running towards the scene. Funny part was during that time the old man was walking towards the exit and the staff passed by him.

All in all it was an OK experience. There are few dining choices at the Luxor. If you walk past the food court and into Mandalay Bay there are several more dining choices that probably meet your needs not yo mention sports bars. 

Internet service is non existent in the room while in public spaces a bit better but sluggish. I found when at other hotels or casinos internet speed was normal. I as well as my friends using Sprint and Verizon had terrible cell phone call quality with missed and dropped calls in the room.

The Location: Luxor

The results:  Luxor sucks!

Explanation:  We all got rooms on the same floor.  We were mistakenly given a non-smoking room (16068).  So we were ""upgraded"" to a room in ""The Tower"" with the same view of the pool we originally had.  Room sucked (6238).  It was defiantly no ""upgrade"".  It was almost identical to the last room except less cool, a longer walk from the casino and rest of party, and the only view was a nice view of a roof!  What is worse is that we couldn't get back to the rest of our party due to the hotel's key locked elevators.  (If you don't have a key for that floor, you can't get there by elevator!)

So now we are in a crappy room, far away from the party with no way to get to the floor our friends are on.  When I addressed this with management they treated us like we were giving them a hard time rather than trying to help us find a solution.  (Compromise after talking with 5 different staff: 2 comp buffet passes).  THEN when I went to take a shower I noticed a black hand-print on the shower wall.  When I went to complain about that we were regarded with suspicion and told that a sanitation manager would have to inspect the room to validate our claim.  I offered to have CSI come up and carbon date it!  We were comped 2 two spa packages after two visits to the front desk and about half an hour of arguing and waiting (Spa comps were weak anyways and only covered gym and hot tub use).  No one showed up to look at cave-man hand-print in the shower, and no one came to clean it.  All comps were the definition of weak and we only ended up useing one.

Other grips:

ATM's went down across the whole casino, but only crashed after your request to remove funds was 'processing'... leaving you with the concern that it would withdraw the money without you actually getting it.  (I'm sure a complaint to the bank about a casino ATM not giving you your money would sound REAL believable).  They charge 5$ a withdrawl, Other banks charge 2$ and their ATM's NEVER go down!  You clowns can't keep your ATM's running at 5$ a pop? Please!

Hotel rooms are janky and have funky ironing boards that fall out of the closet, cheap TVs and clocks with the time screwed up (we all thought we woke up at 1PM instead of 11AM because the room clock was off)

Pyramid balcony railings are so weak you can shake the whole thing with one hand.

Amenities close relatively early at night: spa, buffet (probably why we didn't redeem our comps)

Conclusion:  Bachelor Party was a BLAST!  No thanks to the Luxor and I am I am left with the fact that I will never have the 4 hours of my life back that I spent waiting in line to talk to the staff and arguing with them!  All of us agreed to try some other strip hotel next time.",0,0,0

From the minute you walk in you're bombarded by people offering you free show tickets and a $50 voucher if you go to a timeshare presentation.  DO NOT DO IT!  We actually did sign up for it, because it sounded like a good deal and they said it would only take 2 hours.  Friends of ours got suckered into it on a previous stay and ended up being stuck at this presentation for over 4, so we skipped it.  The entire weekend we were there though people constantly harass you to sign up for this.  Even when the photographer was taking pictures of us after the ceremony in the hotel, when we walked past they were still throwing pitches towards us!  WTF?!
Front desk check-in wasn't too slow and they were nice and friendly.  I had the same complaint as everyone else...the a\/c in the room sucks.  It's a box unit and only blows in one direction.  It's right by the large window too, so I'm sure a lot of air gets sucked out that way.  The room also needed some updating and repairs.  The wardrobe was really badly scuffed or chipped.  I thought the bathroom was fairly nice and looked like it had been redone recently.  The beds were pretty comfortable and housekeeping did a good job.
However, the bell desk was pretty unfriendly and seemed annoyed that we were even bothering them.  I was also charged twice for having my dress pressed, and was told it will take 10 days for them to investigate the charges.  The weird thing is they charged one day and the other charge was two days later.
Had breakfast at MORE and it was just ok.  Pyramid Cafe was actually way better and cheaper; I just don't get my money's worth at buffets unless it's got seafood.
Cathouse was a meatmarket.  LAX was just wholly pretentious without even being a good club.  Pretty lame all around.
So overall Luxor was just ok to stay in.  We did get a good deal on it, which we got to share with our wedding guests.  Now I know why.  If I ever return to Vegas I'll definitely find somewhere else to stay.",1,0,0

The room was tidy but you would want to use rubber gloves to handle the dust covers on the bed. Must have been a guy who had the room before us...Beds were soft and cushy! 

We checked in 3 hours earlier than we were supposed to and they had no problem with it even though most hotels were booked solid (close to new years). Checking out was fine as well.  Only annoying thing was trying to book a rollaway bed for a friend who was staying in my room.  Asked during check in, and called 3 different times to confirm it was being brought up. They kept transferring me to different people and claiming it wasnt on my reservation. 

The casino was the cheapest in the area and we tried a few! The buffet was crap but very cheap if you paid for an all you can eat all day pass for 30 bucks. You also had access to the Excalibur buffet with this deal so we tried both.  Food is food, we cared more about the quality of our drinks! 

Not a lot to do inside the hotel other than A female review, Carrot Top, and Criss Angel. We went over the Excalibur and MGM for shows, which were just across the street.

In the past I've had awful experiences and vowed to never stay here again however things come up and you need a room and sometimes the luxor is the only options without paying $800 a night! In this case the offered me a free 2 night stay and some resort credit so I gave them a another shot to redeem themselves! Upon checking I was told the room would be in the pyramid which I would pay just about anything to not stay in the pyramid the hotel check in lady (very nice) explained it would be an additional charge for the tower so i said ok how much etc... she ended up getting me a tower room for no additional charge! Yes! I was very happy! Once I got to the room it was very clean. Everything looked great. I was bummed that there was no fridge but hey no big deal. I decided to go downstairs and our elevator broke. Eeeek it was so scary. No phone service, all the electrical was gone, it was so hot. Not good. About half an hour later help arrived and saved us from our potential death trap! The hotel manager offered to add some more resort credit but ended up giving me 3 tickets to a show! Although the elevator experience sacked it was nice to be able to see a show! Gambling was great that first night. Cocktails were quick. No complaints. Then night 2 happened. Every machine broke down for at least an hour that I saw could've been longer. They had to go to every machine and hand pay out as you can imagine it took forever. Not much fun to gamble when you have to wait hours to cash out. Some of the cons: if you get hungry late at night there is only 1 place to eat however most of the employees don't know about it so you walk and walk around to each spot they tell you only to find out there is nothing open. The hotel rooms are really hot. The a\/c doesn't pump well and you can't really control the temp from the room. I was on a business trip and needed to get some work done I ended up spending over an hour with the tech team support trying to fix it for me so I could work. That was very frustrating.

 It took us about half an hour to get checked in on a Friday. 

We stayed in the east tower in a delux room. Beds are are really comfortable. Bathroom had a nice tub and separate shower. Mirror in the bathroom was really big with lots of light. It even comes with a magnified mirror that is attached to a handle so it can move around. Great for applying make-up. 

We had to consistently adjust the water temperature on the shower head, highly annoying. 

Our toilet had a water leak. I could have called the front desk to have someone come and fix it , but I did not. We just shut the bathroom door to cancel the noise. 

There are these people that are constantly trying to hustle you. They say they are going to give you free show tickets or free money. They don't even work for Luxor. Beware of these people. Highly annoying. 

Overall a good hotel. We got a good night's rest which was the main point. Would stay here again.",1,1,0

Now that I'm older and have had my fair share of hotel stays...this place is no longer the place to be given its competitors. Vegas has upgraded substantially and this place is very outdated given the overall strips updates\/facelifts. This might be one of the reasons why it was pretty empty, both day and night. It was just a place to sleep so it wasn't too big of a concern. The shower leaked onto the actual bathroom tile...not sure how that happened.

Hubby and I wanted a vacation before we have our baby in February. I saw an all-inclusive package with Luxor that included tickets to Criss Angel, and I was sold since I've wanted to go see that show for ages.

Check-In: Was pretty speedy. The line was long but it moved fast, which was nice after a 5 hour drive. Overall it was all very pleasant. The clerk answered all my questions about the all-inclusive pacakage and directed me where I needed to be to get everything squared away.

Room: On the advice of friends, we booked a Tower room. I had heard that these rooms are more modern and have a bathtub, the pyramid rooms don't and are older. I was thrilled with the room. It was spacious. The bed was super comfortable. The bathroom was huge, with a big bathtub. Except that the room doesn't have Wi-Fi, or really any internet access that I could find at all. If you want to use the Internet you have to use one of their public terminals down on the casino floor, where anyone could look over your shoulder. That was really annoying and outdated.

Buffet: Part of our package was all-day passes to the Luxor buffet and the Excalibur buffet. Here is where it started going downhill. I was informed that the Excalibur buffet is closed for remodeling, so we can only use the Luxor buffet. Okay, they should have changed that on their offer page, but whatever.

Shows: Here is where I really started to get angry. Apparently, Criss Angel was on vacation for the whole week....so no Criss Angel show. So, why exactly did no one call me and let me know that? Or, I don't know, sync the show page with the booking page to SHOW ME that there was no Criss Angel shows that week? Hello, this is ridiculous, that was the whole reason I booked the package to begin with! They said they would ""try"" and get me tickets to something else instead. Oh no dear, I'm getting tickets to a show. We got tickets to Jabbawockeez instead. And I was irritated further when everyone insisted on telling me ""It's really a better show than Criss Angel anyway."" Shut up, seriously. I paid because I wanted to see Criss Angel, just say you're sorry it wasn't handled better and move on. The Jabbawockeez show was really good, I enjoyed it. It was fun, energetic, and really was worth the time and hassle.

Titanic: This exhibit was pretty good, it wasn't as great as I expected but it was fun. I don't think I'd go again but didn't regret the time spent.

Bodies: This was fantastic, the highlight of the trip for sure. It was absolutely fascinating and I would go back on a return trip for sure.

Spa: Part of my all-inclusive package was a ""day pass"" to the spa. No one could tell me what that actually meant, so I had to walk over to the spa and asked. It was a pass to use the sauna and whirlpool tub for the day. Well, that's great but I can't do that because I'm pregnant. If someone had told me before what the day pass actually was I'd have booked a spa service separately, but instead they were all booked. 

Timeshare people: I have never in my life been more harassed than when I stayed here. We would literally have to dodge 3 groups of timeshare hockers just on the way to the buffet! Yeah I don't want to sit in a meeting for your timeshares for 2 hours just to get cheap tickets to a show. And they will follow you and hound you with questions. We visited a few other casinos on our trip and didn't get bothered at all, or very rarely. But at Luxor it was constant.

Complaint handling: Needless to say, after the buffet trouble, the spa trouble, and the Criss Angel show trouble I was not happy and asked to speak to a manager. According to her, the Criss Angel show was cancelled the day we arrived due to an emergency....okay then why does the show page show the show being out for the whole week then? Not just starting the day before? Management tip #1: Don't lie to make your customers feel less ripped off. Then she again repeated that the Jabbawockeez show was so much better anyway that we really got lucky. Yeah, great, except we didn't want to see the Jabbawockeez show! We wanted to see the Criss Angel show! Then she offered to comp us the ""resort"" fee of $45, so about 10% of the overall price of the package. I thought that was a pretty pathetic attempt to appease us. Every problem we had was because THEY failed to communicate, yet they seemed to feel no need to make that right.

Bottom line, we will not stay at Luxor again. They can't even update their offer page when unexpected things happen. They can't give customers accurate information on check in (no one told us about any changes to the package we'd originally booked). And then their attempts to make their mistakes right were pathetic. Next time we'll stay somewhere else and buy the Criss Angel tickets when we arrive.",2,2,0

Nothing like a Memorial Day weekend to experience Las Vegas in all of its glory. Wall to wall people, having a good time, throwing drinks back and losing money. Our stay started with a quick checkin. I booked the tower as I read it was the most recently renovated and newer rooms (as opposed to the pyramid). The elevators where off the beaten path and half of the buttons didnt work on our floor. The room was less than spectacular. The hardware showed age and there was some tarnish present. The TV was horrid, but who really comes to Vegas to watch TV? If anything the room served its purpose....To keep you out of it. The bed was comfortable, no issues there. And everything worked. The Luxors price point is one of the lowest on the strip, if anything it makes for decent and affordable accommodations. On non-holiday weekends its insane how low it cost.

As far as the casino and entertainment goes, I cant speak much for it, because we spent time elsewhere. The Luxor had to have been the least populated joint of all the strip hotels that weekend. 

The only saving grace was that it was a quick (and oh so air conditioned) walk to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur (the latter of which suffers from a similar aura of blandness).

It was cheap, and for a good reason. Id look elsewhere if you'd like the full package (gaming, dining, entertainment) in one resort. However, if you dont mind a short walk it makes for a very affordable place to crash at nigh.",0,0,0

It was a little tough at first finding out how to get to the self-park area.  Coming from the self-parking you walk in from the back of the hotel. Hint-Hint, the entry is on the 2nd level, so if you don't walk to walk up the ramp or stairs, take the elevator up from the parking lot before you cross the street.

Check-in was simple. Came a little bit early, didn't have to pay extra. I noticed later in the evening (5pm or later) the check-in line was quite long. The room was nice and clean. I stayed on a thursday night so the price was much better than staying on the weekend. I stayed in one of the towers (which are the newer rooms). It was a little bit of a maze going back there to take an elevator up. After a few times in and out of the room, it was pretty easy remembering where to go.

Beds and pillows were comfortable. The air controller was a little odd. Couldn't figure out how to turn the air conditioning to not be so cold so I ended up just turning the fan of the system off.

Check-out was very easy. Did it from my email by clicking on a link. This prevented me from having to walk all the way up to the front of the hotel only to have to walk back again to get to the parking. I would stay here again. However, I might want to try New York, New York next time since I liked their casino better.

Any casino you go into though will reek of cigarette smoke!! For all the non-smokers, I really don't have any tips other than DONT GO. Because smoking, drinking and gambling go hand and hand they will most likely never offer a non-smoking casino (but it would be nice if they did). The headache, nausea and dizziness was not fun to deal with. I could only take so much. They would have got more of my money had I been able to take the smoke any more.",2,2,1

And the fact that it's connected to two other very popular hotels is a great plus.  Plenty of shopping, casinos, clubs, bars\/lounges and eateries without having to go outside was a great thing considering its supposed to rain my entire trip. 

Now the bad: that $22.40 resort fee. They boast about their low rates, but fail to mention that when you check in, you'll be paying an additional fee per night. These fees are supposed to pay for the wifi and long distance and local calls. 1) I only got wifi in the common areas. No wifi in my room. Barely any service in my room for that matter. 2) who doesn't have a cell phone these days??  

I had to start the shower\/bath water in my room 10 minutes prior to taking a shower\/bath because that's how long it took the water to get hot. 10 minutes!  Ridiculous!  

I've stayed in less ""luxurious"" hotels and there was a fridge and microwave in the room. The Luxor has neither. I understand that this a probably a way for them to ensure you spend more money (no microwave to reheat leftover so you don't take any back to your room. No fridge to keep beverages cold), but at the very least a fridge would be nice. 

Also, forget calling the front desk for assistance. You're met with an automated system. After selecting 5 different prompts to speak to an actual live body, I was on hold for 10. All just to inquire about late checkout.

Pros;
- great price - wedding daily rate was $30\/night on during the week
- connected to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur so it was easy access to the amenities in those hotels without leaving outdoors
- hotel is not as crowded as others - we went to other hotels like New York and Bellagio and their lobby was super crowded and busy 

Cons:
- no WiFi in the rooms, only in the casino lobby, but you can literally leave your room and stand in the hallway to get WiFi
- you need to pay $20.00 resort fee for the internet cable only for laptops, but who brings a laptop nowadays?? people only carry tablets or mobile phones
- noisy in the lower levels - stayed in level 5, and it was close to the lobby so it was noisy, try to book a higher level
- casino smelled like a combination of smoke and perfume, but that was expected as you can smoke indoors in casinos ...but this casino smelled worse than other casinos
- mold in the bathrooms - the bathroom door was broken at the bottom
- located a little south of the strip so there was a bit of a walk to get to the main strip - bring comfortable walking shoes, but you can easily take the transit or taxi

Value is also one of the better on the strip. Pool is cold in the off-season, the two year-round hot tubs can get cloudy and nasty. Pool area is very basic and lacks the character of some other hotels. Elevators are a lot bumpier now than when this place opened. It can be a freaky ride.
Casino isn't bad but I prefer to venture out to louder, busier casinos. But I'll hit it up occasionally..it does have all the gaming I need, and always serves very strong drinks. It's much busier now than when I started staying here regularly six years ago. It was a ghost town then. 
Food options are okay here, but I never eat here as there are much better options a short tram or cab ride away.

I was really and truly excited to stay at the Luxor for the first time on my birthday, I made reservations like three months in advance. When the day finally arrived and we were driving to Vegas, I started to read reviews online to kill time because as most know the drive from SoCal to Vegas is INCREDIBLY boring. The more reviews I read the more panicked I became. They were almost all terrible! Yikes! What did I get myself into?
So we pulled into the Luxor and I was pretty nervous about staying there at this point. Walked in by the pool, which looked really freaking awesome. Little islands to chill on, pool store, snack bar, free fluffy towels, the works. Also, huge Egyptian style fountains, which my boyfriend and I are soooo into. 
So, check in went smooth, the hotel general fee is atrocious, but that's all of Vegas. 
The room was awesome! The entire Luxor has very low lighting, which I loved, I'm big on dark places, it made it seem more authentically Egyptian. The way the low lighting casted shadows seriously made you feel like you were in an old pyramid digging around, way creepy, but soooo awesome!
Also, I hate the question that comes at the end of these paragraphs that ask ""is this a good place for children?"". Personally any ""good"" parent would never bring their children to Vegas in my mind because the only option here is to stick them with a strange sitter as they aren't allowed in a vast majority of the areas within Las Vegas, but that is just my personal opinion, not of the Luxor specifically but of Vegas as an entity. 
As anyone who has ever been to Vegas knows, most of the hotels are the same, just different themes, all in all though for what we paid I thought the Luxor was pretty bomb. Especially compared to what other hotels charge the exact same price. It would definitely be a do-over. =]",1,0,0

The place was newer then, and after some struggles with room cleanliness and maintenance items in my originally assigned room, I was move to a Junior Suite.  It had a jacuzzi tub in it, overlooking the strip.  Pretty nice room.
Fast forward to 2012.  With the desire to take my wife to this hotel and experience one of these Junior Suites\/Jacuzzi Rooms, I booked two nights at the Luxor.  Upon arrival, the lobby was nice and clean, updated and the staff efficient and friendly.  It was at check in that I was informed that the jets in the jacuzzi tub had been disabled, and that it was just a big tub.  OK, well I'll roll with the punches.  We head to our room through worn hallways, and loud, bumpy, slow elevators (or whatever the stupid name that Luxor has given them....inclin-o-meters, or something like that).  It's an elevator that doesn't exactly travel vertically.  It does take you to your room floor, and it is old, worn, loud and slow. Once on the 17th floor, we saw what looked like hole that a fist had been put through the wall, and more old worn wallpaper, carpets, etc.  Into room 17121 we go, to find more of the same.  What could be a very nice room, with old carpet, multiple wall paper patches.  As for the tub, apparently you can fart and swirl the water around with your hands, but otherwise, they'll be no bubbles or moving water.  The front desk explained that people only assume that the tub is a jacuzzi, but the Luxor website never mentions jacuzzi.  OK, whatever.

The pool area and towels are free to hotel guests and you are invited to play a game of 'seek the loungers' after 10am. The hotel has three pools but strangely two are roped off for and unused by the people paying $$$ for cabanas and premium sunloungers. Music is trash chart guff.

My second trip to Vegas, and the first visit was to the Sahara, which is now the SLS. The property is very nice and I can only imagine what it must have been like when it first opened in 93. Check in was a breeze(no crowd before Thanksgiving) and I was allowed to go to my room just after noon time, and stayed in the pyramid, as I requested. All of the staff I encountered were great, and one young lady even walked me to the area I needed to check in when I first arrived. You have to pay a resort fee of around 25.00 dollars a day, and leave your credit card open for a 50.00 incidental fee, which is returned to you after 5 days if you don't incur any charges. Whatever happened to pay as you go along, and I didn't use any of the resort services beyond what I originally paid for through the travel agent. This is normal for all resorts around Las Vegas.
             My deluxe room in the pyramid was just fine, and had a great view of the strip. The room does have that lived in look, and the maintenance staff tried to touch up the bathroom, and forgot to sand some spackling, and left drops of paint on the floor.

It was a holiday so the price was slightly higher, but a lot lower than many of the other resorts. You can bring in alcohol from the outside, and across the street there is an AM\/PM gas station\/convenience store with great prices on beer and liquor. Easy connections to Mandaly Bay, and Excalibur, with the use of walk ways and monorail trams. A bus station is right across the street at the Tropicana and you can buy passes at the machine!
                   Not really sure why people complain about the location so much, it's a close walk or ride to everything including the airport. I've wanted to stay at this place for years so I did, and I have no regrets. Vegas is changing a lot so the Egyptian theme may not be as appealing as it once was, but I think this resort will be around for a while. I think it was a great value to stay on the strip during the start of the holiday season.",3,0,1

The room was older, not recently renovated, but still not bad.  Beds were ok,  clean but not terribly comfy.  The shower was big, so that's a plus.  I figured ""we're in Vegas! How much time are we going to be spending in our hotel room anyways?!""  

The lady at the check-in wasn't terribly friendly.  She was trying to be and you could tell, but you could tell that it wasn't genuine.  Not a good greeting from the place you're staying at on vacation.  

The gaming floor isn't terribly big, but that was ok with me.  There were also a few places to grab a quick breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Plus a restaurant or two for a more fine dining experience.  There is a buffet, which can cost about $34 for the all day all-you-can-eat buffet.  Great if you're planning on sticking around the place all day!  We didn't though, so I'm not sure how good the food actually is and if it's worth the money.  There is a monorail type shuttle that will take you to Mandalay Bay, and two stops at the Excalibur.  Not too bad if you're wanting to walk the strip a bit.  However, it does stop running at night (not sure what time), which can lead you to have to walk or find other modes of transportation back to your room if you're going back in the late hours of the night or early hours of the morning.  

No fridge, coffee maker or microwave in our room.  But there were at least three or four Starbucks around the place and a few other places to grab a coffee in the morning.  We went in the middle of November and the pool was already closed.  Looked nice though.  I liked the plants outside, very tropical-like.  The bridge across the parking lot to the hotel was closed the entire time we were there for some reason, which caused us to walk all the way around from the self-parking area.  Oh, which reminds me, if you self-park, be prepared to pay an extra $10 a day.  You can ask for a parking card upon check-in which allows you to come and go as much as you'd like and also gives you parking access to the other MGM properties at no additional charge.  

The elevator was fun.  It moves at a slant and we got a kick out of it on each ride.  The room windows were cool too, slanted.  And our view of the strip was pretty.",1,0,1

The room decor was updated, fresh and very adequate with a nice oversized bathroom - separate shower stall and large full bathtub. No smells, no noises, decent water pressure and comfortable bed made for a better than expected in-room experience. Outside, the monorail service and valet parking (free not including tips) were very convenient and quick. 

I found the inside decor and layout of the Luxor impressive - what do you expect inside a giant pyramid? How about some cool angles with center core access to everything. I found navigation pretty easy and straightforward - not always the case in Vegas. The Egyptian decor was eye-popping throughout and the lobby is spacious with staff helpful. Check-in was easy and included a coupon book for free drinks and discounts. The casino had no odors and was fresh throughout - including the sportsbook, which was a fun place to sit and watch Sunday afternoon NFL action.

Certainly you will pay for such convenience at the bars, restaurants and even the food court inside the Luxor. Think shot and beer ($18 at Public House) and hoagie with chips\/drink ($15 at food court). With a south-end strip location you have easy access to neighboring properties but be aware it's not the same experience as staying more central on the Strip where you can be on foot pretty much the whole time. Overall, I found the Luxor to be a more upscale and comfortable experience than some previous mid-strip or downtown experiences. 

The minor deductions - TV remote did not work (of course, I didn't find out until last day as I wasn't in the room much), and wired internet only (no Wi-Fi) - though on the plus side the wire was so long you could be on the bed and use a laptop. 

I would definitely stay at the Luxor again and the $80\/night average I paid felt like a bargain. Weather was absolutely perfect for October in Vegas (80s day\/50s at night). Take in some of the shows and perhaps the Titantic artifact self-guided tour - expensive but worth checking out.

The good:

1) The AC worked just fine. No complaints here.

2) Room was clean.

3) Even though room was comped, I still checked to see what it cost and it was one of the cheapest you'll find on the strip.

4) You're in between Mandalay Bay and Excalibur so you don't have to walk outside to get to either one of those casinos. Tram takes you to both if you don't wanna walk.

5) Pool wasn't busy at all but that's because we got there early and were able to get chairs under some trees. Plus there was a hot tub!

6) Lots of entertainment options. Carrot Top, Blue Man Group, Criss Angel. 

The bad: 

1) Rooms are dated. It's time for an update. But when I'm on vacation I only shower, sleep, and get dressed in my room.

2) Even though I've been to Vegas about 15 times, the casino was kinda hard to navigate. Maybe it's because I have a poor sense of direction. They do, however, give you a map when you check in.

3) No poker room and slot machines are tight!

4) You're the second to last casino\/resort on the south strip. Be prepared to do some walking or shelling out cash on Uber\/Lyft\/taxis if you wanna see the rest of the strip.

There's always uber and your legs. The walking distance to other casinos isn't bad and plus most people come to site see anyways so if your not that worried about walking your good to go.

I really wanted to see it, even though it has gotten bad reviews because face it - how often do you get a chance to see someone that hot in the flesh, breathing in the same room as you?

I called the concierge at the Luxor and they told me that he is performing on Sunday and Monday. It was Friday when I called. Great. So I planned to see him on Sunday. 

Turns out when I went to get rush tickets, Sunday and Monday are the ONLY days he is NOT performing. I was leaving Tuesday am.

Positives: 
I love the Egyptian theme and I think it's well done. It doesn't look tacky. It's fun to walk around inside and outside and see the details of the design.
The pool area is very nice, except for the fact that the pyramid reflects the sunlight on you and threatens to burn your skin off (!). 
The Pyramid Cafe was yummy and reasonably priced. 
The person who came up to our room to pick up our bags was extremely professional and courteous.
There are a 2 Starbucks and a fro-yo place inside! Happy times.

Negatives: 
The resort fee ($18\/day) did surprise us, but I'm sure that is true for every hotel on the strip. 
The entire hotel is smoky, but that is definitely true for everywhere on the strip. 
It took us almost 2 hours to get through the check-in line. 
The rooms were not as nice as they had appeared online. We had a King suite, and it was extremely small and old-fashioned. 
Our hotel keys stopped working multiple times, and since you need them in the elevators, this was extremely annoying. We saw this happen to other people in the elevator too. When we went to get replacement keys, the front desk person was rude.

I would stay here again, mainly because I've seen the other affordable hotels and don't think there's anything better that we would be willing to splurge on.

They had initially booked the same suite as ours, but were upgraded due to a leak. He said that the room they upgraded too had more footage.... but it all went to the bathroom! The bedroom \/ livingroom space was smaller and they put more footage into the bathroom. Thankfully we declined the upgrade that morning. The suite was very clean and we didn't have any problems, the little jacuzzi tub in the room was cute, a little weird for the placement but everyone definitely enjoyed it.

I go straight to the bed.. pull back the sheets.. and all they had done was flip and rotate everything! The first time I did not take photos.. I gave them the opportunity to fix the problem.. the second time I made sure to take photos. Please share with your friends and family- - stay away from the Luxor Hotel and Casino ..

Just returned from our trip and stay at the Luxor yesterday.  It was THE worst!!!  We will NEVER stay here again!!  Why?  First red flag, our rooms were by the swimming pools that are under construction.  This was not a problem Saturday and Sunday.  Monday morning the back hoes started beeping at 7am!!!  When we complained, we were told it was an error and work would not begin until after 10am.  Tuesday morning 7am beep-beep-beep!!  We asked to be moved.  We were told we could be moved but would not know what rooms until after 2pm  Our luggage was taken to the bell desk to be held until we had new rooms.  We went out for the day and returned to the hotel at 5pm  We did not have new rooms assigned.  Why?  Now we are told we had to be present to assign new rooms.  We had two rooms (sister in law suffered this with us as well)  The clerk made a big deal out of making sure we would get a room with two queen beds and a room with a king size bed, as that is what we had originally paid for.  We also asked that our rooms be as close to our sister in law's as possible.  After 20 minutes of BS at the front desk, we got two new rooms 6 doors away from each other.  Sister in laws room--two queen beds.  Our room--two queen beds!  Called front desk and told them the error.  Rooms were also overlooking the bus parking area, another noisy location.  My husband politely asked that we be moved to a room with a king size bed.  Now we were offered to be upgraded into a one bedroom suite.  We accepted and reminded them that we needed to be close to the sister in law's suite as well.  We were relocated to the 10th floor, room overlooking the Excalibur, no problem there.  Sister in law's room on the other side of the building, same floor, but no where near our room.  We gave up at that point even though there was an empty room across the hallway from us.  

How was the suite?  1.  Nice deep jetted tub--jets did not work.  2.  TV in bedroom did not work.  Had to have maintenance called.  They replaced the remote control.  Still did not work.  Maintenance had to return following morning and reprogram TV.
3.  No bath robes, extra blankets, bottled water, snacks.   4.  No WI FI  5.  Toiletries Motel 6 quality 

Restaurants in the hotel---Forget it !!! DO NOT go to the Public House.  Service was terrible, waitress was picking her nose and acted like we had disturbed her in some way.  We asked for another server.  

Boarding pass service--Had the tickets printed day before check out.  Clerk would not release both passes to my husband because I was not there.  Said they would hold them for us to pick them up.  Go to pick them up and different clerk has no clue about the tickets.  Needs to reprint them.  Computer jams, needs to reboot and then opens  drawer and guess what??There are our tickets printed and ready to go!!

The deferred maintenance in the hotel, spa, and restaurants is very evident.  The service is no where near a 5.  If this hotel does not keep up with their competition, I will be surprised if they stay in business.

Hotel NOT clean---There was a repulsive smell in a trash can area by the elevator on the floor where we had our first of 3 rooms!!!  I called housekeeping to report it.  The next day the smell was still there.  Don't know what happened after we moved to the 10th floor.  My guess, it was never completely cleaned up.  Sounds like Brian C. was there the same nights and he noted that as well.  Disgusting!!!!

No WI FI made working in the rooms very difficult.  Charged a resort fee when their swimming pools were not in service.  No night life of any kind except for gaming.  Buffet is low end and boring.

Let's hope that the CEO's and management of this hotel reads these comments here.  Wondering if the survey I was sent from the Luxor will be noted as well.  Based on the lack of interest while at the hotel, I doubt it.

There was a lady complaining that the electricity was out and that there was no running water and highly suggested that we try to find another hotel.  We found a nearby Starbucks so that she could try to call the Luxor instead of standing in a line that was easily 30 minutes long.  She tried calling and Luxor was having all of their calls routed to another hotel (I forget which one) who could do nothing for us. 

 My friend ended up going over to the check in area and speaking to a employee who apologized and upgraded us to a room in the West Tower.  Ehh, the bed spreads were the old school quilted ones, there was no coffee pot and no frig.

The Great Recession does not appear to have been kind to The Luxor. 

Marred carpets, questionable janitorial, paint chipped and scratched off doors in a fury to get luggage in an out of slanted rooms - it's a partial pyramid, the property. Try as they will to cut costs, your money is still sorely needed in this den of dubious deception.

And boy oh boy have the basics gone by the wayside. Self-parking and the walk into the casino is a stop-and-start self questioning process of: ""Am I going the right way? Where do I go next?"" Signs appear as a vaguely pointed arrow in one direction only to seemingly disappear causing one to wonder if, in fact, that vague pointing is correct. It's easy to get lost going in and going out, a staple of Vegas gambling establishments.

Elevators (watch your step, as fries and other fatty foods randomly garnish the lift's floor, the lift of which eerily moves a bit diagonally) occupy directional aspects of quasi-pyramid, and once you reach your room, you may look down, uneasily, and see the gaming floor and hear the dull roar of 24-hour desperation droning on and on. Artificial as all get-out.

One will wonder why there are no barriers to prevent one from jumping over the easily jumpable ledge to solidify Vegas' ""Suicide Capital of America"" reputation. Splat! Take that, empty promise, bad food choices and massive gambling debt.

The room is semi-cleaned. A past tenant's free shampoo container may still occupy the shower door's ledge. So, again, janitorial is questionable, and again, watch your step. Maids will wake you promptly at 9:30 a.m. as a reminder to GTFO.

Need the free, advertised wifi? Ignore the printed instruction handed to you upon check-in, which clearly indicates how to sign on to a wifi signal that ... DOES. NOT. EXIST. So you'll have to call the non-1-800, non-local tech support hotline to find out that, rather, you must sign in to the MGM Grand's free wifi, instead. 

Because that should be obvious. Because everyone knows that the Luxor is now a part of the MGM suite of suites, which take healthy of advantage of Tesla's millions of dollars of transferable tax credits to avoid paying higher taxes to the good citizens of the State of Nevada. It helps them stay in business and keeps fries on the elevator floor.

While on tech support you will likely get upsold on a service or two. Need to make restaurant reservations? You'll get upsold on other offers you don't want. There will be ways to secure your email address, phone number, fingerprint and DNA samples ""to better serve you"" and provide you with the best, promised deals possible. 

A drinking game in Vegas should commence immediately. Get upsold? Take a shot, bro...

The clientele are a jaded assortment of tubby millennials with those easy-to-spot effeminate bro beards searching for expensive crafties at the bar, along with UFC wannabees avoiding those very craft beers to keep their cut physiques in tip-top form to meander through the casino floor looking for some roofie action, which you may or may not find at the steakhouse bar at 5 p.m. on a Friday evening. (It certainly *looked* suspicious last Friday.)

There's also the lifers and diers, those who patronize casinos for the fun and entertainment. They move slowly, jadedly, like they've turned from human to Casino Walker by various mechanisms still yet to be determined by CDC scientists. They'll be at the slots all night, thank you.

The Luxor features an exhibition of dead bodies. From, allegedly, China's black market of cadavers and organs, of, allegedly, executed prisoners. Despite this, the flow of Chinese visitors to the resort does not appear to have been hindered. It's branded as an educational exhibit, one that in an odd juxtapose, does not rest too far from the steakhouse with its nicely prepared filet mignon.

The food, however, is overpriced.

If you go to Vegas, do yourself a favor and stay off strip if possible. There are plenty of other casinos and non-gaming establishments that are easier to navigate through, at much better prices, and they are closer to mom-and-pop eateries - some of the best in the world - where your tummy will grant you hearty gratitude for not having to suffer the allure false promises and kitsch.

In fairness, the MGM is a pretty good strip resort, should you desire that experience.

A major example of how this hotel does not have its act together: we stopped at a bar right by the concierge desk, and every 2-3 minutes there would be an extremely loud static sound that pierced our ears. Some sound equipment somewhere seriously malfunctioned, and no one around us was acting like this was a major issue at all.

Could they have better towels? Yes. However, most of us are not here on business and are here strictly for pleasure with a limited amount of time spent in the room.

Dining:
The buffet was about a mediocre 3. Nothing to write home about and nothing I would revisit without the discounted coupon they gave us at check in.

The Steakhouse, on the other hand, deserves a full 5 stars. You get the full wood paneling experience and the steak they served there was one of the best I have ever had - prepared EXACTLY right!  Add a shrimp cocktail and you have a winning meal.

Casino:
I started with $200 at the beginning of the trip and ended up with something like $300 so I came out ahead and was happy. Slot players are not what makes the house money, however, as the drink waitresses barely came around to ask for my beverage. Even after generous tipping it was faster to walk to the bar and pay for my beverages.

Spa:
The spa is interesting here. I heard it used to be one of the few 24 hour spas but I think it has reduced its hours. Full nice wooden lockers in the locker rooms and plenty of clean shower stalls. Assorted fruit beverages but the large screen TV that used to be in the lounge is now removed. Must have been too much lounging going on in that room. The sink area included complimentary mouthwash, razors, shaving cream, and deodorant and there were plenty of towels to be found - including damp iced ones and iced water for the steam room. This has to be one of the more cruisier spas in Vegas - I swear some of the older men were wearing holes out in the tiles cruising between the steam room, dry sauna, and jacuzzi. Please people, try to control yourselves and make it not so obvious. Also, guys, you are in a male spa, you are allowed to not be so modest and actually be nude. It looks weird when you go in the jacuzzi in swim trunks because you think you have the largest in the world and everyone will stare.

Anyway, I digress. Overall, I had a decent experience here. The hotel is convenient to the Mini Monorail to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay and also has direct hall connector access to Excalibur and their 24 hour food court.

We've stayed here a couple of times and the rooms are ok.  They're not the most luxurious rooms in the city, but they're comfortable.  The best rooms are in the towers and not in the pyramid.  The rooms in the pyramid are older and smaller.  If you have a choice, I'd recommend staying in the hotel towers....unless you want to stay in a pyramid, which is cool to do at least once.

1) This hotel needs serious room updates in the pyramid rooms. New furniture, new wallpaper, new paint, new everything. The sheet and blankets were paper thin. I get that we're in a desert, but come on. Also, the lighting, or lack thereof, sucked. No good makeup light.

2) The main cabinet smelled. ""I didn't even wear these clothes, but I'm going to have to wash everything that was in this cabinet to get the smell out."" -My husband

3) We didn't get a code for the room internet, therefore, we basically had no internet. We couldn't get 3G\/4G access in the room. Only option was to go downstairs to the lobby\/casino for wireless. Still awful connections.

4) MOLD! Yay! Saw it on the shower walls. Almost hard to detect since the shower tiles were an ugly shade of brown, but oh, it's there.

5) Tiniest blow dryer, ever. Glad I brought my own.

6) Dirty windows! I'm sure windows at the pyramid are a bitch to clean, but hey, if you decide to build slanty walls and have slanty windows, you need to figure out a best practice to keep them clean.

7) Location! Location! Location....was the WORST. You basically have to walk through the Excalibur to leave the building. If you've been through the Excalibur, you know that's also a dump. Even when you escape the Excalibur, you're still far away from everything. We had to take a few cabs. I do enjoy walking to strip every now and then, but sometimes it can be a huge pain.

8) So many ""interesting"" people. Great for people watching, bad for everything else.

9) Asked for extra towels and pillows. Waited for awhile, but had to leave. Not sure if they ever came to the room.

I can't speak for the pool area cause I never got to use it. I took a quick peek and it looked like a large space, but the lounge chairs definitely needed a power wash. The food was pretty good, but it's Vegas, so it's overpriced. We ate at the Cafe (understaffed and slow on a Sunday morning), the pub bar, and the Mexican restaurant (everyone seemed to enjoy their meals and drinks there). Besides all that, the casino was fine. Nothing special.

Look, my husband and I only paid $176 for 4 days\/3 nights (we shared a room with friends). So it's not like it was expensive. Just, don't be fooled by the decor. The Luxor looks cool from the outside, but it's something else on the inside.",2,1,0

The room was standard, but I needed nothing more. I ate at Tenders, the pub, Deli & café.

We had reservations for a king bed in the smoking section of your hotel. we arrived at your hotel at around noon aware that the room would be open at three but wanted to verify our reservation and the possibility of it being available early. after waiting in line for 20 minutes or so, which seemed a  long for such a big hotel, we encountered the front desk receptionist. We weren't greeted in a welcoming fashion, she seemed bothered with us from the very beginning we moved up to her desk. As I tried to inquire about our reservation she ignored me or answered in a very rude manner. It was frustrating to have to deal with some one who made it seemed as if we were a nuisance and our questions apparently annoyed her. After speaking for about two minutes being very dismissive of any questions I would ask she tried to change our reservations to two queen beds, without refunding the 5 extra dollars that the king had cost us, we were able to get a king but in a non smoking section. After this we learned of the never mentioned resort fee that you must pay even if you choose to never use their pool or any other service which seems to me is just a way to charge $15 extra dollars on to the room charge and i do not understand why it is not included in the room rate. Through out this check in she was rude and unwelcoming which made my girlfriend and I question our hotel choice. Your Front desk receptionist is the first image, and the first person everyone has to deal with in your hotel and I find it unacceptable that a world class hotel would treat us in this manner. For my Girlfriend and I is specially difficult to travel, we don't have a lot of spare time to enjoy of vacations and it is costly for us to do so since we are both working students. We put a lot of effort in being able to afford small vacations.

I haven't been back to vegas within the last 4 years or so. I honestly don't remember the Luxor being this horrid at all. This hotel definitely went down hill, they honestly did NOT up keep this hotel at all. Reading the prior reviews from other customers - this place really took a toll on the strip. No wonder it's so cheap to stay here~!

I stayed at the Mandalay Bay which connects to the Luxor. On my first day in Vegas, I checked in and decided to grab a bite to eat somewhere close by. So my boyfriend & I decided to grab late lunch at T&T. On the way to T&T, there was a small booth near the showbox or whatev. The booth were swarming with pushy representatives from the hotel trying to sell timeshares (I guess? I didn't get that much far into the conversation with them). At first the rep asked how old I was, I thought I was getting carded from the tone of his voice. But actually, he was trying to get my boyfriend & I to go on this 2-3 hr tour and we would receive two free tickets or whatever. NO THAAAANK YOU. Time is money, I'm on vacation. But he would not stop after we told him we weren't interested. They were pushier than car salesmen! They were practically demanding us to put a deposit with our credit card. They were seriously harassing everyone. And they kept trying to give us a deal to stay at the luxor, excalibur, golden nugget for free - NO THANKS. And they were still trying to sell us stuff on the last day of our trip when we told them we didn't have time to speak with them because we only had 2 hours left! 

I honestly don't know how customers who stayed at the luxor deal with these folks!

I've never even stayed on a main floor at a no-tell-motel and never would have thought a Vegas hotel offered rooms there.  First problem was that our doorwall faced a side street so there was traffic a stones throw away.  The doorwall had bars on it, an obvious safety feature, which made me feel the opposite of safe.  And the room was disgusting.  Everything was old and worn from the 70's, no lie.  The sheets were worn, the blanket was paper thin and it ALL looked like it came from a closed down joint from the old Vegas area.  We complained and was told it was sold out and there were no other rooms.  Sure. For whatever reason Wi-Fi didn't work in our room so when I called they had maintenance come and bring me an Ethernet cord to plug in.

* Great ambiance. I loved the decor and overall theme of the hotel. 
* Amazing view - at least my room had a superb one. Could not ask for better. 
* Comfortable bed. 
* A flat screen television that actually worked - many of the other hotels on the strip that I have stayed at had 2-5 working channels. This one had plenty to choose from. 
* The buffet downstairs is decent. 

Cons: 
* The elevators are terrifying. Seriously. I felt as though I would potentially die in those elevators - no matter which one I was in. They shake SIDEWAYS! 
* Popcorn ceiling. Am I being picky, now? Perhaps. 
* The first set of room keys I was given did not work. It took over 30 minutes to get through to a representative (calling from my cell since I did not want to drag all of my luggage down to Registration again). Finally Security let me in and mentioned that its a common occurrence. 
* The elevators (yes, back to those again - I know), were just very inconveniently placed, to say the least. I had to walk a mile every time I wanted to go to my room. I also had to use my room key in the elevator - they are programmed to be room specific. 
* The sink in the bathroom made a loud gurgling sound all night long - had to keep the door shut.

I was here a few weeks ago for a conference and was happy in the beginning to be staying in a giant pyramid.  I was a little underwhelmed by all the dinge.   Also a little creeped out by ""Carrot Top"" constantly being portrayed as a sex symbol.   It took me about a day and a half to figure out there was supposed to be an Egyptian theme.    But, hey it's Vegas, and you didn't really come to stay in a room the whole time.   So have to give it some credit for being affordable.

However, I'm writing this review about a poor experience I had at the blackjack tables. During my last night in town, I played BJ in the Luxor, before I left for the airport. For some reason, almost every table I went to, it felt like I was losing 75-85% of my hands. So I had to keep moving tables and cut my losses.
I moved to an empty table, where a dealer named Pil was standing. He dealt me a couple of hands, and I won them. In my strategy, I start pressing my bet once I win a couple of hands, to try to get on a winning streak and actually start making money. After my second of third straight win, a new player came to the table and bought in some chips. I asked him if he could please sit out a hand, to see if my winning streak was good. He agreed to sit out, and I won that next hand. So then I asked if he'd mind sitting out of the deal until I lost a hand - again, he agreed. 
All of a sudden, the dealer Pil got in my face and told me that I can't talk to the other player at the table, that I can't tell him not to play. Excuse me? I didn't order anyone, I asked the young man to please sit out - and he was ok with it. So all of a sudden the dealer is upset at me for a reason I'm not aware of, and I'm getting upset that he's accusing me of things I'm not doing. I had to leave the table entirely just to cool my head, and I didn't even get to ride out my winning streak. I spoke to two pit bosses working, and both of them told me I was in the right, that the dealer was in the wrong. They were nice to me; however the dealer never apologized to me, so I wrote everything up in a comment card, and gave it to the pit bosses. To say the least, that experience soured my perception of the Luxor casino, and I hope people read this comment and consider it before playing at the Luxor.",0,0,0

I attended a conference in neighboring Mandalay Bay.  Because it was sold out, I found myself over at the Luxor.  Wow, I forgot how bad this place was

First - it's really showing its age.  Run down rooms, run down common areas.  Everything about it feels dated

Second - the rooms.  Uncomfortable beds, elevators that are broken, and take forever to get up and down from your floor, and the worst as a business traveler:  Despite advertising it, the internet service was not working in my room

Third - the scene.  Just not a lively mix of people.  No matter how much sex appeal they want to throw into their marketing, there is very little sexy about this place (unless, of course, you're into old and stodgy).  Maybe LAX is ok as a nightclub, but that's about it.

Finally - location.  It's pinned down on one end of the strip, near tropicana, excalibur, nyny, etc.  While Mandalay Bay is nice, and MGM is ok too, you're just a bit too isolated there.

Next time, I will register for conferences earlier, just to make sure I don't end up in another dump of a conference overflow hotel.",2,2,0

This time I stayed at The Luxor which was a long time coming because I love Egyptian things and the theme is my favorite one there. Based on some of the reviews I saw I did not know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised by my experience. Despite it being one of the older places on the strip I still enjoyed it very much. Time to break it down. 

Check in: 
I arrived in Vegas about 5:00 so the line to check in was very long since it is a popular time to check in. I thought I would be standing there forever but it moved very quickly because they had plenty of people working to accommodate the line so that was a plus.  I originally booked a standard pyramid room but upon check in the guy checking me in upgraded me to a room in the east tower for free so of course I took it. He asked me if a room on the 13th floor was ok just in case I was superstitious or something and I am not so it was ok. I thought it was nice for him to think of that and ask though. He was very polite and he checked me in quickly. I was happy with that process. 

The Room: 
I stayed in room 13307 and honestly it was a pretty standard room but it was a nice room. They stayed true to the theme which I like. That's part of the fun for me., The bed was very very comfortable. Huge fluffy pillows which I love and the sheets were very soft. The bathroom was a very nice size and it had a separate tub and shower which was cool. The water temp and pressure in the shower was good. No complaints there. . It was pretty hot there so I used the AC alot and it worked great. In fact at times I had to turn it down or off because the room got so cold. Overall I enjoyed the room very much and was pleased with what I got. 

Customer Service:
I ordered room service on the first night because I was beat and I got that quickly but the food was just ok though. It was the steak sandwich with some coleslaw. The coleslaw was nasty and the sandwich was so so but I was so hungry and tired I just ate it and went to sleep. Before  could order room service I noticed my room did not have a menu so I called the front desk and they sent one up promptly. The customer service I received at the hotel when I needed it was good. 

The Pool:
I was not too impressed with the pool. They have two pools but one you have to pay to be in and there was like two people in that one. But the free pool was so crowded and there was barely anywhere to put my stuff I almost should've went to the paid area, The water was pretty cold but once you got used to it it was not so bad. I did not stay very long. 

Casino:
The casino was like any other. Very easy to get lost in this place but fun nonetheless. I played alot of blackjack and for the most part the dealers were cool. There was one that pissed me alot though. She tried to say I asked for another card when I didn't and had the nerve to yell and raise her voice to me. I would not budge and they ended up taking my side. I loved the part where she said they could review the cameras if they needed to and I told her to bring it. I said yes let's review the cameras so they can see that I put my hand forehead and did not put my hand anywhere near the table to signal that I wanted another card. I knew what I did and I knew I was right so bring it. I loved how the cameras were no longer something she used to threaten me after that.  I just find it unbelievable that she spoke to me that way and would not own up to her mistake. Then when the relief came to the table she starts talking shit to about me to her in Vietnamese thinking that I don't understand what she is saying, By the way she was staring and the hand gestures toward me she was making I could figure it out. She was very very rude and should learn that when someone puts their hand on their forehead that does not mean ""hit me"" She needs to get another job that does not involve people. Other than that moron I had a great time in the casino. One rotten apple did not spoil the bunch for me. Only regret is I did not get her name and make a formal complaint. 

Other:
There are alot of restaurants and plenty of stores to get the little things you need throughout the casino. There is a food court up stairs if you are looking for something fast, cheap and easy. There are two little convenient stores called Essentials and 24\/7 that are open 24 hours for your convenience if you need anything. They have Starbucks as well. So basically anything quick and extra you might need is at your finger tips here which is great. They also have alot of shopping here as well if you want to get gifts or souvenirs. 

Overall I really enjoyed my stay here. The price is great and I just like this hotel and I will definitely be staying here again once I get through my list of places I want to stay. If you are looking for a good room for an inexpensive price then stop by her",3,3,3

To start our stay, they downgraded our premiere suite and tried to put us in the luxury suite. Completely insulting since we paid for a premiere suite. Then when they changed it they tried to tell us that unless you've stayed there and know the difference they give you the smaller suite. Is that even legal? Isn't that flat out stealing from your guests? Then the premiere suite was plain and boring. Didn't even have anything in the bar. Like actual empty cupboards, nothing to purchase like every other resort offers. Plus the in room amenities if you can even call them that were cheap and only a shampoo combo, lotion and a body wash. Nothing for the giant tub, no shower cap, no slippers or robes. Anything you would expect basically they didn't have which is super disappointing since not only are we paying for a suite room, we're paying $20 a night resort fee plus tax on the resort fee. So that apparently doesn't cover fancy amenities, decent tv service for games you might be betting or housekeeping. Which brings me to the point that our housekeepers didn't empty the trash out of our bathroom for 3 days. So for 3 days it sat with dirty diapers in it. They also never vacuumed our room or bothered to wipe any surfaces. We even requested them to return to empty the trash on multiple occasions and it still never got done. I wish I could give them the benefit of the doubt that their housekeeping staff alone is just incompetent but I spoke with 3 separate managers, AJ, Brendan and one other whose name I don't recall, and I told all of them and they all said they would put in an order to have housekeeping return. So since the managers knew this and never made sure it got taken care of even though one manager claimed to have visited our room himself, I'm blaming poor management for this.
Now most people come to Vegas to gamble and like most people we placed bets particularly on the Thanksgiving weekend games which we expected to be able to follow on tv in our room. Well the 2500 TV they have doesn't get a clear picture. Not clear to the point that we couldn't even read the scores! The 3 ""engineers"" who came to fix it claimed first it was a setting issue, then said it looked normal, then blamed the cable provider. Even though the tvs in the hotel came in fine. Very upsetting and again dissapointing. 
Then our 2nd morning here I was woken in the bedroom by Marijuana smoke coming into our room from an ""unknown"" area of the hotel and after opening our bedroom doors our entire suite smelled like a drug house. Wouldn't have bugged us that much if we didn't have our baby and I wasn't pregnant but we did have a baby and I am pregnant so having that smell overwhelm our suite for the rest of our stay was bullshit  to say the least. Their managers resolution was to move our room, again, which wasn't ok for us since we'd been there already for 2 nights and moving our baby and all of our unpacked things sounded awful. They then reimbursed us for 1 night stay and gave us a food credit which was a nice gesture but couldn't even come close to making us ever ever ever want to return to this hotel.
Besides our awful stay, here's a quick review of the food situation.
Tender steakhouse: upscale but overpriced for the quality of food and service is slow.
Public house: Justine was our server and she did such an amazing job taking care of us and our baby we left her a $20 tip on a $40 check. The food was ok, greasy bar food but decent happy hour prices for vegas.
Starbucks: lines are always long and takes forever.
Crepe place: awful. So slow and not even close to edible. How do you screw up a frappe? Don't put ice in it.
Backstage deli: open 24hrs. French Toast was pancake covered. Gross. Scrambled eggs quesedilla was good the first time but second time had way too much cheese. Cheap food no coffee drinks.
Food court: terrible. All fast food and unhealthy food. Krispy creme, McDonald's a bunch of other cheap gross places. If that's your ""diet"" then you'll love it but if you eat anything of any real substance  this is a nightmare.

We had a basic room in the pyramid, and we were all very pleased with it.  It was very clean, a little outdated ours had an old tv and a cable for Internet.  The room was also a little dark no big deal though we only used it to sleep.   The hotel itself I thought was nice, does have a funny smell, but you get used to it.  Casino was very big, and we all won some money on the slots here.  The only bar we visited was Liquidity in the middle of the casino and got great drinks\/service there.

From check-in (June, the less-than-pleasant front desk agent) charging me $20 to check in at 12:15 (I had just come from The Venetian for a conference where I checked in at 10 a.m. without any fee), to the appalling room, it was pretty much all bad. And I've stayed at Monte Carlo, so that's saying a lot!

The room smelled damp and musty, which I suspect was from the pyramid slanted windows, which actually leaked one day. I would have complained at the front desk but the line there was consistently over 100 people (not exaggerating) long. And something told me I would have been charged for the move, too. 

The furniture is worn (I posted pictures of the closet) and I wasn't sure if that was rust or blood on the light fixture in the bathroom. While I have never been to prison, I suspect the shower heads there are superior to the Luxor's. The shower doors were loud and difficult to move, as though they hadn't been used in years. 

Being a pyramid, there was a large amount of extra space in the room that was filled with a random table and two chairs. No comfy couch or large desk area for working or even a fridge for water bottles or leftovers. It's truly a waste of space.

The pool was only open until 6, which seems odd when it's sunny and warm until at least 8. Also, if the pool is open until 6, why would you close half of it at 5:15? They should say that SOME of the pool is open until 6 to be honest.

Best thing about Luxor? The gym, which seems to be the only place any money has been spent since Dubya left office.

Not only deal it feel dirty in an ""hasn't been cleaned"" way but it is just run down, strange considering it's only 15 years old. The ""comforter"" was a small blanket sandwiched between two sheets. Cheap. The elevators NEVER worked. At one point only one elevator was working out of six. I counted over 30 people waiting at one point. After waiting through 3 elevators we were finally able to make it back to our room. 

And the best thing that happened...the lock on our door got stuck with the dead bolt out. Luckily we were testing it so we didn't get locked in the room becuase who knows if we'd even be out yet. We called the front desk asking for someone to check this out immediately as we had reservations we were going to be late for. After waiting 20 minutes and then being on hold for another 20 we fortuantely had another group of friends staying there so we could put our luggage into the next room and trust the door would be fixed when we returned.

When we went to the front desk after we got back and asked if the door was fixed no one had any idea, ""But they hoped so."" And instead of upgrading us or even offering to comp a meal or something we had to argue with them to wave the stupid resort fee. A fee no one even uses anyways as it covers wired-internt. And it's not even like this was a particularly inexpensive hotel. I would have rather paid $20 or $40 more and stayed somewhere 10x nicer and with better service.",1,0,0

What better way is there to gain an authentic experience by staying in the Pyramid? The angled exterior wall added to the quirky lure that is LV. Our room was clean, and the amenities nice. Check in was quick and easy, we arrived on a Thursday afternoon and departed on Sunday evening. I am not familiar with the peak days or times, but there was no line for check in, and check out was pretty busy yet efficient and problem free. They even checked our baggage for free for the few hours between check out and our flight later that evening so we could go and shop, gamble, eat, and log in a few more Elvis sightings. The staff at the desk very friendly, and helpful.
   The pool area is very clean and lovely - seating was a commodity so go stake your claim before lunch! Bar waitresses regularly checked in on everyone.
   Buffet was amazing, and good! Not like Bob's Big Boy food. I tried a little bit of everything of course, and was not disappointed by any of it!

Having wandered through many of the other hotel's gaming floors, I have to say I liked the Lux's the best! It was not as bright and flashy as the others - it was just as busy, but still felt more intimate and less distracting overall. Being just close enough to the action to walk everywhere, but not right in the middle of the chaos that is ""The Strip"" was a definite plus! 

I highly recommend this as a first timer's stay to get your feet wet, and for the return tripper as well. Be prepared, yes there is a resort fee added when you get there, but that is standard when one books hotels at online bargain sites - they don't add that to your total price, and it is called Occupancy Fee at other places. I have found this staying around Pittsburgh, Roswell, NJ, etc. Don't fault the hotel(s) for that.

I really wasn't sure what to expect and had gotten mixed reviews from friends and sites. However, I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. People make remarks about it being old but you really can't tell. Our room was large and spacious with nothing wrong. There is plenty to see and do, although the casino is a bit boring. Overall, if you're on a budget, it's a great place to say. Keep in mind that it is at the end of the strip, but we love to walk and found it to be an exciting walk to the main part of the strip..after all, people-watching is one of the best things to do in Vegas. 

I recommend. Don't let other reviews fool you. You will be pleased unless looking for a top notch, luxurious experience. I'd definitely go back.",1,0,0

As in all cases for making the Vegas run, hotel rooms are there for the few hours of required sleep.  We had a Luxor room overlooking the strip, very southern end, view of McCarron Airport.  Paying the exorbitant daily resort fees and adding a parking fee on top it, just made future visits blurry.  Since we were there during the winter time, I expected the resort fees to be lower since the pools were not open whatsoever.  We will be back, someday~hopefully, but as resorts charge over the top resort\/parking fees, the Vegas thrill empties your pocket(s) before you are even there on-site.

The hotel - Stinky, outdated and geared more towards children than adults. Lots of McDonalds and fast food in here. 

The room- I felt like I lost money before I even got to a table. The carpets were sticky and the bed was damp. Upon entering, I imagined CSI Vegas were familiar with the place. Under black light, I bet this place lights up like the fourth of July.

I'm going to mention something now and come back to it later: COCKROACH.  

I stayed in the second floor in the pyramid, right off of the elevator.  To get to the elevator you had to go through a total maze including passing by their back office areas. Weird, but whatever.

The quality of the actual room was maybe worth a 3 star review.  Larger than I was expecting, but definitely nothing fancy.  It would be comparable to a Holiday Inn or something.  

I'm convinced the maids do nothing when they ""clean"" the room besides make your bed without replacing the sheets and give you new towels.  Nothing else was touched.  Oh, except for the TV which the station was always changed on.  My thought is they go in the room, make those basic changes, and then sit and watch TV for 10 minutes.

All of that is forgivable.  What wasn't forgivable was what happened on the morning I was checking out.

I woke up to find a cockroach crawling all over my stuff on the bathroom counter  (makeup, brushes, etc.).  After trying not to cry I got my phone and snapped a photo to show the manager, then tried to kill it but it got away. Grosssssss!!!!

I got ready, packed up my stuff (shaking out everything I owned for fear that my new roommate brought friends), and headed down to talk to the manager.  I told the manager what happened, and he didn't seem too phased. Like this happens all the time.  He said he'd take off the resort fee of $20 per day.  Hold on now, I was not informed that I would be charged $20 a day, I was told it would be a hold put on my card, but there was no way I was paying for amenities that I wasn't even informed exist! Not to mention I was in town for a convention and not paying for my hotel, the company does that! When I told him that he said he'd also take off the charge for the room service too, a whopping $29.  He didn't seem to think anything else was necessary. And in case Luxor management actually reads these (doubtful) I think his name was Mark or something.  Check your records for who the manager was that took off the charge for room number 2127 on January 11, 2013.

So after all that I now have to throw out all of my makeup brushes, because God only knows what that cockroach was doing on the counter and what diseases he carried with him.  All my brushes are MAC and cost around $20 each. I have 5, so that's $100 I'm out.  In addition I'm currently living in fear that I'm about to bring some other vermin home with me. As Yelp as my witness, if I get bed bugs after this, Luxor will be hearing from my lawyer.

What really bothers me is I know that if I appeared to be older than I am (I'm 23) I'm sure that he would've been more accommodating to me.  I've been discriminated against for my age before, but just because I'm young doesn't mean I don't know what I deserve.  

You'll be hearing about this from me soon, Luxor.",7,4,1

We ended up having a pretty great experience there.  Checked-in later Friday night, it was 11pm, and no line to check in. We used the North entrance because that is the Tower Room Check-In.  We had gotten a decent offer from the hotel, so we were staying in a tower room.  We requested a smoking, king-bed room and after reminding the woman of that, we were upgraded to a suite-sweet!  Our room was really nice.  I know it was recently updated(past few years).  6th floor, nice size and set-up.  Flat screen t.v. on wall, soaker tub with stand-up shower in bathroom, Bath & Body Works products in the bathroom that smelled yummy, and a wet bar in the room with a mini-fridge and a coffee set up.  My biggest complaints:
crappy lighting in the rooms, scratchy sheets on the bed and the casino is being renovated-which on one hand is great because there's already lots of new restaurants and more modern bars\/lounges, but there were several parts of the casino roped off that you had to walk around, so it's a little annoying, but I didn't really care. 
We were in the West tower, so it's a little bit of a walk to get to the casino\/restaurants, but everywhere is a long walk in those casinos because of their size, but this might not be great for some people I guess.  One plus, the Spa and Pool entrance are right off the West tower, so that would be convenient!
 
The Valet guys at the North entrance were all really great and friendly and remembered my husband's name half way through the weekend-that was a nice touch!

So, all in all, we had a pretty nice experience here.  It's on the strip, affordable, clean, connected to Mandalay Bay and is catering to a 20-30 something crowd now!

I was not given A ROOM*** with a view, well OK we had the view of the black pyramid- I wanted the Excalibur side-would've been more fun for her guests to look at ...
I also requested  the highest room possible and I was given the 7th floor and because of College Basketball no other room was available or they were just lying to me!!!
I know, I know - I understand that no rooms are a guarantee but as a customer I'm allowed to whine a little....
We got the premier suite with an adjoining room. It was nice & about a little over  1500 sq ft all together. Some of the lights did not work and as I was decorating a service man came in because the cleaning lady said the automatic curtains don't work. I told him about the lights and he said he'll send someone up - no one ever came and I was too busy to care.
The kitchen  is too small and the refrigerator is a mini one and doesn't cool very well so bring lots of ice.
The room served it's purpose for us....
The kids or should I say pre-teens loved THE POOL *** I think they felt like they were on an episode of MTV's Spring Break. There are a few concrete squares in the middle of the pool to lay out in the sun or as the kids and adults were using it for - to dance on. There was also a female DJ out there spinning her beats....
There is a waterfall in the pool area that tricks everyone because it looks like a waterslide- it's not!!!!
THE HOTEL ***itself looked fine-not run down like some people thought..
It was just so damn busy - lines forever- bad for us because of the wait and hellah good for them for the money. 
It was hard for my guests to find us and we didn't use WIFI of course but I think it is stupid to charge for that....

I was only stopping through on my way to Yellowstone. I was excited to stay here as it was my first time at the Luxor and all my other stays in other hotels in Vegas were fabulous. I was told my reservations could not be found even though I took screenshots of the information with my phone and could provide confirmation numbers. I was told that we would need to wait 3 hours for the system to update before we would be allowed to check-in. That was not possible as it was late and I needed to put my 2 children to bed and be up early to continue with our roadtrip. I was told the reservation office was closed and would not reopen until 7 am the next morning. As an added bonus I was told i could possibly lose my rooms since they were at -6 when I arrived. 

I immediately called Priceline who was so helpful, they confirmed my information and explained that my reservation had already been sent to the Luxor. He tried phoning the reservation office and no one picked up, I went back to the desk because the gentlemen wanted to speak to the manager but 3 people refused to talk to him.

The staff kept insisting that I pay a second time or risk losing my room. I was told that it might be corrected the next day but no one could tell me for sure. At this point they were resistant to taking the call from Priceline (Agoda) not honoring my reservations, not checking the reservation office for my information, and providing me a horrible experience. I had to get an attitude with one of the staff before they gave me a number to fax the reservation to (again) I never act that way so I'm even more appalled by what occurred.

Even the agent I was talking to over the phone was shocked by their behavior. Long story short after someone finally answered the reservation line I was able to check-in to my room 2 hours later. 

But that's not the end of this wonderful story...They made me pay an additional $28.00 resort fee (not agreed upon) a security guard immediately followed us as we were looking for our room and told us to leave the floor and suggested we stay at the Excaliburn instead, the room was not cleaned and contained a loaf of old bread and other disposable food utensils and there was only one towel to shower with (I have pictures)

Thank you Luxor for your very off brand experience, for never trying to rectify the situation, for stressing out  two parents of 2 special needs children even further, and for having your staff suggest we stay somewhere else.

The casino floor is easy to get around without getting lost since the building isn't that big. There's a decent sports book, & poker room toward the back of the casino, & a good amount of table games. The casino is also connected to the Mandalay Bay, & Excalibar so you can stay indoors to avoid the heat & walk right over to either one if you wanted to walk around & check out other casinos.

The pool & gym here (that's part of that $25 resort fee that you're forced to pay everyday) are pretty basic. Nothing great, but the pool is ok enough to hang out & enjoy the sun (as long as the sewage smell from the parking lot isn't lingering in the air). The gym is a typical hotel gym with a few cardio machine, some free weights & a few machine, just good enough for you to not hate yourself for pigging out of buffets & getting loaded on free beach while you were playing black jack the night before.

We've been to Las Vegas several times but have never stayed on this end of the strip. We figured that staying in the pyramid would be kind of cool. 

We were wrong. 

Nothing to do with the hotel, but our trip got off to a bad start. We took the shuttle from the airport and the driver ended up giving our bag to someone on a stop before us. When we got to our hotel, he pulled a bag out that clearly wasn't ours. He assured us that he'd get the bag back, got our number, and then left. I called the shuttle line to file a complaint and then wondered if he'd ever be able to find those people. It turned out alright and an hour later we got our bag back. Nothing missing and probably was never opened. This is the first time I've had this issue with the shuttle. Nevertheless, not a good start.

The hotel smells of stale cigarette smoke. Every hotel allows smoking but the quality of the filtration system is what counts. This one was sorely lacking.  The room was even worse. It was either a former smoking room (they're all smoke free now) or the filtration system just pipes that $hit directly into the rest of the systems that also condition the room. Or people ignore that they can't smoke in the rooms. All are plausible. 

The room itself reminded me of what I might get if I stayed at a Motel 6 or something similar. It was incredibly basic.  There's no hint of luxury anywhere. The bed was not comfortable caused my back to ache. The linens looked like they'd been using the same ones since the 90's when the hotel opened. The bathroom was very basic, the water didn't drain properly in the shower, and everything was in need of an update badly. 

The entire hotel needs an update.  The Titanic and Bodies exhibits have been there since I've been going to Vegas, which is more than 10 years. The hotel theme isn't bad, but they really need to reimagine the entire thing. They're getting left behind very quickly.

Oh...the elevators. They're horrible rickety old death traps. They sway from side to side, the doors are about to fall off, they're dirty, and they're loud. I feel like they are super slow or so fast that they pass their destinations and have to double back. And only about half of them work. If they had personalities, I believe they would be bitter old baby boomers screaming at you to get off their lawn. 

I said all that and then I'm going to say this: I shouldn't be surprised. This is a budget strip hotel. It seems to have picked up where the Sahara left off before it was imploded. I never stayed there but I visited.

Right now you have to be asking yourself something: Are there any positives?

Why, yes there are.  There are two, but I'll give you a list of three things. But wait...that math doesn't add up. Yeah, well...half credit for two of them. 

1) It's cheap. Real cheap. Someday I'll actually learn from my cheap ways. Maybe. 
2) The Tacos & Tequila restaurant has some decent street style tacos.
3) The poker room isn't half bad.

The reservations desk took my information, had me hold for a few moments, and told me that the charge would be...ready?

Naturally, I asked how they came up with a figure that was more than twice as much. ""You gotta factor in your resort fees and 20% tax per night,"" they said.

So we got the keys to our room on the fourth floor. Right when we walked in my husband just started coughing all of a sudden it was really moist and humid in the room. The furniture was scratched or chipped. And instead of getting a view of Vegas we got a view of the statues ass. 
As we kept staying in the room for the last couple nights my husband just kept coughing and we couldn't figure out why then on the 3rd night of our stay when it started raining. The window yes the window was leaking and it rained in our room, when I laid the towels down I noticed a black substance on the towels which I have realized that there was black mold underneath the carpet this has happened before and was never addressed. That's why my husband was coughing. We recorded the leak on our phone and the carpet!!!! We immediately went downstairs to let them know. They didn't show an ounce of concern, only said that we were checking out in a couple hours that they would look at it after we leave. 
Now that we are back in town he now has to go to the doctor because he has a blood condition in his upper respiratory, to make sure there isn't a infection. So no I am not happy with this hotel. He didn't get any sleep because of his coughing and I didn't get any sleep because of his coughing and me worrying about him.

Us being college kids on our own we did have a budget, and I will admit Luxor had a great price for Hotel\/Air for 8 days. I looked at EVERY other Resorts for Hotel\/Air and the price was crazy!

I did NOT feel comfortable leaving our bags there so, we took all 4 bags & walked ALL the way around the resort (having no idea where we were going; first time) to find the entrance of the Luxor. We found the bag line, which had no roping or organization & stood in the long line. We trusted this though because people were getting tickets & bags were carefully taken into a room. The man taking the bag was very nice\/talkative which was a breath of fresh air from what we just experienced. We ate at the food court waiting to check in (Arrived at 11am!) 2 pm we tired 2 check in early & we were able to get a room, the lady who checked  us in was fine, she didn't go above an beyond to make it great experience, it was just fine. I wrote in the special notes when booking the room we were celebrating a 21st birthday. (which they prob see often) But that was not acknowledged. Anyways, our room was on the 5th floor, & was a Pool\/Mandalay Bay\/Back of Pyramid  view. It was a pleasing view, very pretty to watch at night. I will note the guy that dropped of our bags to the room was SUPER nice, he was talking to us, asking how long we were staying etc. as well as giving us trips on what to do.  We did call front desk in hour into being in our room for more hangers, (hey I'm a girl I packed a lot!) My boyfriend asked for 15, & and they came within 30 mins, & bought 25. Which was nice as well. The room was very clean, no hairs\/ junk on the floor... the carpet felt clean & didn't look old or stained. The bathroom was good as well, weird that a phone is right next to the toilet but it gave us a laugh! The bed was verrry comfy & we got lots of pillows (a big plus for me!) When I first walked in I automatically knew I would be happy spending a week in this room. The cleaning lady was ehh though, she was super friendly always say hello in the hall when we were leaving the room, but if we left the room after 5pm, no1 came in 2 clean it. (We are spoiled by Royal Caribbean cruise liners; they make your bed in the morning, and turn down your bed ever night!) So though-out the week we only had our room cleaned maybe 3 times. We never ran out of towels or anything, but it was little disappointing coming in at night to a still unmade bed. Walking though the casino was no problem either, we both look to be 17-18 & still no1 carded us. We drank his first drink at 21 in Centro Bar, the lady serving us was kind & said happy birthday. It was a nice location to be in the enter of the Casio to see all the action. We even used the pool 2x, so relaxing I took a 4 hour nap on a layout chair! We ate at, Pyramid Cafe, Back Stage Grill & More Buffet. All were fantastic!! Pyramid cafe (Breakfast) gave HUGE portions & was very fresh. Back Stage Grill, I no joke, ate at least 5 times. SO fresh, amazing ingredients! More Buffet is a GREAT value, 1 of the cheapest buffets on the strip & just as good food, ate there 2x. Overall, YES we would stay there again, the location is a little far at the end of the strip, but we took taxis\/walked anyways. I would mainly stay there again because of the price was unbeatable if your on a budget, because come on, everything else is SO expensive in Vegas. We really never had any huge problems at Luxor, so they earned our business again in the future!",1,1,2

The rate for a Saturday night was $140 (last minute)...They let us check in early which was cool. The Luxor is at the end of the strip but at least it is on the strip, easy access to the MGM. So we check in...the process is quick and painless. The hotel isn't too big so it was easy to navigate. We found our elevator in the back corner by the pool. The elevators are SCARY...they feel very unstable and I think I fell over a few times...but I am pretty clumsy. 

The room walls are very thin. I could hear everything going on in the rooms next door. very irritating. We were on the 17th floor with a poolside view. They played music near the pool and we could hear it loud and clear like it was just outside our window. But the pools are excellent! Big and lots of room...my favorite part of Luxor. I don't think I will stay here again. I couldn't wait to get out of there.

This hotel is a 3 star hotel & I had no clue it was. 3 star hotels are not the best at all, but anyways when I walked into my room, the bathroom was not cleaned well at all. The shower was surrounded by long pieces of hmhair & the hair was also clogged in the drain in the shower. The shower was making this aggravating noise because of the leak. They fixed it on the day before I left. The tub was not cleaned either. The bottom of the tub had bacteria spots. I thought the toilet was clean, but it had dirty spots when you lift up the toilet seat. The sink was not cleaned well either, dirt was left inside the sink.

The TV was very strange and weird. The tv goes out after a while because I guess if the signal or something that o don't know. Both of the beds had pieces of hair under the pillow & on the sheets. The first day walking into the hotel room, the room was very icky & grungy. It was hot in the room until the day before last it was fixed. The buffet was just OKAY. It wasn't extraordinary, fantastic or wonderful like the other hotel buffets. The breakfast in my opinion was the BEST THING at the buffet. I loved everything about the breakfast buffet. The breakfast food had a better taste than the lunch buffet. 

The lady did not say clearly that the breakfast buffet was $24.78. When she said it sounded like she said $21.48, but wasn't. Anyways I paid $24.78 for the Saturday weekend brunch. I went to the lunch buffet on Monday & it was only $19.99 + tax which was good but the food was not great at all. The strawberry cheesecake is the best dessert to eat at buffet. The other desserts was soooo nasty. I would not recommend eating the other desserts at all, but if you want to then go ahead. The desserts but the strawberry cheesecake taste like sugar free desserts.

Last night 8\/7, my sister found a living moving roach next to the chair by the curtains in the room. If you see one roach, of course that means there could be more but thankfully we only saw one roach. My sister could sleep at all because of seeing what we discovered triggered her & me. We slept with the light on for a while until we both felt safe to turn the lights off. This hotel is a roach infested hotel so please BE AWARE & CAREFUL",2,0,0

Oh, Hotwire, you crazy.

Long story short, rooms in the Luxor are similar to those at a Best Western.  Except, you're in a weird-ass pyramid.  I will say the beds are very comfortable and the room was clean.  The inclinator (not elevator, since it climbs the pyramid at an angle), however, is scary old.  Pieces of it were shaking while moving and I sorta feared for my life.  It also looks like it was crafted in 1989.  Time for upgrading, methinks.

The rooms and bathrooms are nice, but a bit below the bar for Vegas.  Alot of the rooms seem a bit outdated, but once again, not to the degree that you feel dirty.

The casino floor is typical.  Drink service is slow.  Even at the card tables, you dont seem to get much attention.  Dont even wait for a server if your on the slots.

The workers were friendly and luxor was hosting carrot top when I was there last, which is a suprisingly good show.

I actually had hoped for more hieroglyphics on the walls of the shower, tub, and bed ceiling! We learned over time to make sure we invested in ourselves during any vacation time by not going cheap on rooms or hotels. So we booked a suite and I had the curtains open as I sat on the chaise lounge sofa with no ""heat"" issue coming through...on the 28th floor! The night view is amazing! 
The decor in the room made me feel like a little kid in a Disney themed room...love it!!!
There were some very minor visual issues that I will not allow to affect their overall rating as it did not affect the functionality of any part of the room. I'll communicate it to them directly through an email.

If you are on a high floor you can look straight down to the casino floor - might be kind of dangerous - watch your little kids.

As you go into the rooms everything is beautifully done. High quality all over although not very large. If your like me and like to look out the window you are almost guaranteed to bump your head - multiple times. Its not often you have to deal with a window on a slant.

Tip: the hotel tower rooms are just as nice I believe a bit larger too - or it could just be an illusion of them being bigger since the one wall isn't on an angle.

Why two stars? I don't like the southern location. It feels very isolated. Long walk to center strip. I believe on the expensive side. Come stay here only if you like the club.

I have been a loyal guest of your hotel and have alway appreciated the excellent guest service you offer,  yet my recent unpleasant experience at your hotel has shaken my belief in your ability to provide top notch guest care at all the time.
Over the past months, I have stayed at your hotel on my business trips. In my last trip on August 03, 2017 I booked a room for one of my business client (room #3208) thru Southwest airlines, which included a resort credit up to $25.00 per room stay. At check in I was helped by Mr.Raul who was rude and unprofessional.At check out, I was helped by Ms.Apena. when  I asked Ms.Apena if she had issued me the resort credit, she started to give me a high tone of voice and an attitude. Ms.apena told me that she couldn't give me that resort credit because she had already checked me out. I ask to speak to a manager on the floor, but my request was denied. I try to approach Mr.Brad Clark (front desk assistant manager)who portray himself very arrogant and rude.Mr.Clark avoided to assist or help me with my issue. I waited for a chance to talk to Mr.Clark, but at one point  I sense that he had call security on me, as a female guard came to the window where I was waiting for Mr.Clark
For now, I'm stopping and suggesting my family and business partners to stop doing business at Luxor hotel.Mr.Brad Clark is the reason of this action, he could easily de-escalate this issue with an apology.
Mr.Clark, it is important to remember that you represent a business and that the hotel exists because of the guest only and if guest no longer stays at the hotel due to poor and dissatisfaction then there will be no hotel.
A part of the front office's responsibility is to serve the customer well and this is evident in the way the employee's handle problems or issues that come with the position.

(Maybe due to the price or demands from friends who want to see the slanted windows in the main building, but never without significant prodding.)  The casino's fine, but there's an overall worn feeling.  It's also overly dark, feels much smaller than it is, and over the years has seen significantly increasing clutter with the massive additions to the atrium level.  I will say that the hotel gets some amazing exhibits and staff is very friendly.  But for now it'll mostly remain for me a brief stop to see what exhibits are there on my walk to or from Mandalay Bay.",0,0,0

I play this game on Facebook called my vegas you play and earn coins and chips, you don't have to buy chips unless you want to, all you have to do is play pretty much every day and you can earn a room in a few months then you can spend your money on drinking and gambling instead of a room you will barely stay in. OK now for the review.
Before looking at other reviews for the luxor I thought we had a 3\/10 experience but after reading some of the reviews I now think we had a 7\/10.
As I said I earned the room through the Facebook game I only had to pay $22 in resort fees for a room on the weekend. With that said check in took at least 30 minutes waiting in line then at the desk, we didn't get offered an upgrade because the room was booked through the game. We got in the elevator.... Oh girl they are scary because they go up sideways! When the elevator doors opened the walls were covered in construction putty, there was plastic tarps hanging on some walls, I got scared thinking if the hallway looks like it's under construction what will the room look like? Well the answer is the same! The room was cleanish, the bed had been made, the bathroom had been wiped down but half of our towels looked like they had already been used and just hung back up. There were no bedbugs (thank goodness) but the pillow cases had makeup on them, the lights were dim, the carpets were dark (probably so you can't see stains), the furniture was all dinged up and stained. But we kept reminding ourselves we were only paying $22. We went to bed around 4am and we were woken up around 6 am by the clock radio then at 8 am by drilling and hammering from all the rooms around us! It sucked!
But there was good stuff about the hotel the casino looked like fun they also have a cool looking pool, staff was pretty helpful and friendly, free parking, we had clear running water, cold and hot water, working  electricity, good air conditioner\/heater, and best of all no bedbugs!!!!!!",1,4,1

We booked a double queen pyramids suite that included a bathtub, refrigerator, and a separate living room from the bedroom area for specific reasons. We were traveling with our baby and sister in law and needed 2 beds, a fridge to keep the baby's milk cold, and a tub to bathe the child in, and a separate living area so If I needed to breastfeed I could have some privacy. Upon arriving at Luxor we were greeted with a very long line to check in. Ok-fine, it's a holiday weekend and they have every available desk for checkin full with people diligently checking in guests and a greeter to direct traffic. A fairly efficient system given the volume of people. I waited about 40 minutes in line with my very restless and tired child (we drove from Los Angeles) before finally getting to checkin. All was well until I handed over my credit card and gave him the names of the guests in the room. Suddenly, the gentleman checking us in looks at his computer and his face goes blank. Without explanation He says he needs to step away for a minute and disappears through a door behind him. I'm a pretty patient person, even with a restless child. I waited about 5 minutes before I started getting concerned. I ended up asking the greeter to get someone to help me. Meanwhile the other window had checked in 2-3 people in the time I was waiting for my worker to get back. The greeter comes back and tries to get another employee to help me. This guy looks for a second at my reservation and says I need to wait for my original person because something is wrong with it. Well, I waited another 5 minutes and finally the manager comes over and states that they ""don't have my room type available."" He says he can upgrade us but we can't have 2 queen beds. He could give us one king and a twin rollaway. Um, no thanks, we have a 4th person coming the next day and we booked 2 queens. I asked him if we could have 2 rooms in that case and he said yes but we would have to pay an additional $58. Um, no thank you again, this isn't our fault. The manager was VERY rude to us. He basically said FINE I'll take care of the $58 only when we started to get really upset. His demeanor was cold and unsympathetic to our situation. But really? Why should we have to settle for less than what we booked and even put a deposit down for? It doesn't end there. We finally get to our downgraded rooms and wow, they really were downgraded. No fridge, no tub, and very run down. Furniture was worn, the window looked out at a wall, and I got small bites on my legs from who knows what. Maid service didn't even come until after 4pm. Even the hallways leading to the room were gross and had a sewer smell. All in all, I am severely disappointed with Luxors service and rooms. Oh and they gave us a $20 food voucher but it was only good at the most expensive restaurants in the hotel so we didn't use them knowing that it wouldn't even cover our meal. All in all, I would avoid this place at all costs!",0,0,0

amenities in the hotel were mixed: no good food options (a mini-food court with some nasty fast food, about six starbucks, and a buffet), an ok spa, and an ok pool.  they have systematically removed anything that might cast a shadow from the pool area to make the non-fee area as uncomfortable as possible and encourage use of the $30 ""private"" area with umbrellas, cabanas, and shade to spare.  best $30 i spent in vegas.  seriously.

The room in the pyramid was gorgeous, faced the sphinx and the strip, and was very cool.  No, it didn't smell like cigarettes.  No, it wasn't rundown.  And no, there were no bed bugs at all.  The beds were extremely comfortable, and the architecture was thrilling.  When you go to Vega$, you expect a certain amount of classiness, and a certain amount of cheesy kitsch.  The Luxor has equal parts of both, and I like that.

And the elevator (""inclinator"") was a treat.  No, it didn't feel like I was going to die.  Seriously, some of the reviews must be from people who never leave the house!  I really don't get all the bad reviews.  I think people have unrealistic expectations.

I was there in July, so it was very very hot and I don't think the AC worked all that well. The room was pretty stifling. But maybe that was because the entire hotel is a giant window??

I used the spa and got a massage, which was pretty good. Using their spa gets you a free day pass to the gym. That was nice. The pool was pretty great too--except there's not much shade. So be prepared.

Earlier this month I wound up staying one night and had an easy check-in.  Was upgraded to a suite that was large, clean and comfortable.  Separate sitting room had a couch, club chair and wet bar.  Nice touch.  The view from the East Tower was pretty nice, too.

Had breakfast in the 24 hour cafe that was fine and actually better than at other Vegas hotels I've been at.  

On my second trip, approximately 10 days later I wound up getting to the hotel very early in the morning and had to check my bag with the bellman.  No real issue there other than there was a bit of a line to do that but no drama.    My room was similar to the one I had during my previous stay only with a better view from the West Tower.  Only real complaint about the room was that it was someone dim due to the flourescent lights which made it hard to read.  TVs should also be updated.

Luxor is an easy walk to the Mandalay Bay Convention Center and is certainly an economical alternative to Mandalay.  It's also a nicer environment than at Excalibur.  Went to LAX, the niteclub, one night but was too crowded to stay.  Hotel guests get in free, a nice perk.

Plus, it's family friendly (we had ages 5 to 75) and there were deals EVERYWHERE!  

While this wasn't my first time staying there, this review is for my most recent stay in July (yes, July!) 2016.  We drove here and for a cheap rate, we could self park behind the pyramid.  The walkway brought us across a bridge over the pools which we could not WAIT to get to!  From the moment we walked into the casino floor (looking for the elevators) we were approached by their friendly staff welcoming us to Vegas and offering us specials on shows.  Had we known that, we'd have booked our shows through them. Unfortunately, we'd already booked our show before arriving.  

We found our rooms which were extensively upgraded since my last stay (12 years ago). The rooms had super comfortable beds, tubs AND large showers. There were no mini-fridges, but we didn't miss them.  We'd already signed up for M-Life rewards (good at any MGM-owned properties) but I admit beyond getting credit for the hotel stay, I didn't do my homework and take as much advantage as I should have.  Next trip...

WAYS TO SAVE MONEY:  
1), Book your show through them: They had tons of great shows from Criss Angel to the Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show!  The discounts vary based on how old the show is, but probably worth it no matter what!
2)  3 for $57 Attraction Deal:  https:\/\/www.luxor.com\/en\/entertainment\/entertainment-specials.html  Each attraction was around $30\/ea so really even if you only see 2 of the 3 attractions you choose - you still got a discount, the 3rd is gravy!  You do have to know which ones you want to see when you walk up to the counter to get your admission tickets so be prepared.  Also, your whole group can do different things - everyone doesn't have to do the same!
3)  Eat in the food court:  For the group we had with the variety of palates, and the addiction to chicken nuggets, the food court offered a lot of delicious options. Also, many restaurants that you recognize may offer extended menus than you're used to - like Johnny Rockets offering breakfast.  They also have healthier options like salads and stuff.  EACH tray that you get your food on has a liner with coupons for your next meal to get buy one get one 1\/2 off.  We ate there at least 1 meal a day.
4) Plan ahead for water and coffee:  PROS: While in the 109 degree heat, I didn't think twice about paying $10 poolside for a 1L bottle of ice-cold Fuji water.  Because I'm a Starbucks Rewards member who gets stars for every dollar spent, it didn't really bother me that the prices were inflated because I'd accrue my next free drink faster.  CONS: The prices are inflated for these two things I use the most.  So plan ahead.  Buying a water bottle from their fridge in the lobby or filling one of the reusable water bottles in their gift stores with ice water is a much better option.  Coffee - you know what you'll tolerate as far as substitutions for your coffee, so I'll leave that to you.  I'll admit, I didn't substitute - perhaps just decreased the size of my drink.

The pools were refreshing but in July, it doesn't get too tolerable until 7pm - when the pools close. However that is exactly the time they close the pools so that you'll go gamble and see shows and such.  My advice, make that a family hour only as they're not going to be the prime gamblers and show seers.  Plus, nothing will make the high-rollers get out of the pool and to the tables quicker than a bunch of screaming kids cannonballing into the pool!

A few things that could use work - the check-in line was HUGE! 

Our Three-Thumb review is 3 thumbs up!  My teen son loved the tram and the moving walkways to the nearby resorts so he could ""wander"" a little farther.  My tween daughter and my kindergarten niece loved the electric art wall right outside of the ticket booth where you can control how much light and what colors.  Seriously - grab a Starbucks and sit and let them play for a bit!  Great breather!  I loved how wonderful the employees were.  I come from a Disneyland school of customer relations and they didn't disappoint.  Finding the proper elevators was challenging our first time. But an employee went out of his way to walk with us to the proper elevator.  Every employee we encountered was so friendly and said ""Good Morning"" or asked how our day was.

The first time was bcuz it was my first time in Vegas and I wasn't well informed about the hotels. I had no idea what i was going to expect nor dis i take time out to do more research. The second time I stayed a night just bcuz we arrived to vegas at Midnight.. so basically gave them free money just to have a room. 

Everything is outdated and colorless. The rooms look like a granny's bedroom with nasty bed sheets.. 
Luxor is located by MGM and Tropicana. The casino area is depressing! The crowd of people is not so pleasing! 

I honestly don't recommend anyone staying here.. You might as well spend the night at a newer resort a little further from the strip.

Really the worst part were the horrible speed bumps getting to the self parking garage. Parking is only 2 levels so it was a bit of a pain depending on what time you were coming. The lobby and casino have good ventilation but there is a strong fragrance that I could see bothering other people. Didn't bother me at all. Checking in was really easy. We were on the 24th floor in the pyramid which gave us a pretty cool view. It was a hike from the entrance to the opposite side of the casino for the elevator and then the other side of the floor to our room but because of that it was really quiet on our floor. The room was very clean and spacious and had no hint of smoke in it. Being in a pyramid the windows are slanted which was super cool! It's connected to Excalibur be moving walkways but there was a 50:50 chance that they were actually working. The gambling isn't that great at Luxor but it was pretty good at Excalibur. Both have cheap tables and games. The dinner buffet was really good. Not sure why they get so many bad reviews on that. The staff kept everything fresh and the food itself was really good. It's on the edge of the strip too so it isn't too crowded with all the people walking through it which is great if you're staying there. While there we saw the Criss Angel show which was absolutely INCREDIBLE! Highly recommend it if you're there.

From the outside, this hotel stands out like a sore thumb.  It's a bit eerie overall, but one of the cheapest nicer hotels on the strip.

If you stay, DO NOT stay in a room inside of the pyramid.  Being buzzed and drunk will get you feeling even sicker since the exterior window tilt at about a 45 degree angle.  Pay the extra few bucks and get a room in the new and NICER towers.  Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.  Pleasantly surprised, but not wowed.

Ironically, they have an awesome pool.  Lots of young people too which is weird for this hotel.

The coffee kiosk here is really bad, so if you need java, go to the Chocolate Swan store located in the mall between Luxor and Mandalay.

TIP: The Luxor offers a free shuttle which you can catch on the second floor in the front.  This shuttle will take you to Excalibur (ewww), but realize that you will be in the middle of the strip to venture elsewhere like NYNY and MGM, Aladdin, Paris and etc.",1,0,0

When you're a guest at the hotel, you get in free, which is nice since covers are so pricey in Vegas. The Cathouse is one of my fave little go to spots . They have a few rooms and a hookah lounge inside. It's not a big super club, so you don't have to worry about balancing your drinks or finding a place to dance or even stand. The VIP areas are usually not sold out and you can usually grab a seat in one of the areas. The music is standard vegas - top 20. LAX is a bigger club, the clientele is 20 somethings, while Cathouse might be closer to 30 somethings. There's a food court in Luxor that consists of a McDonald's (always packed), a sandwich place, pizza and i think a wings place. There's also frozen yogurt and starbuck's downstairs.

The hotel is a basic spot to sleep. It's not fancy or nice and it's hard to describe the smell.  The casino is ok, and the time share people have a booth in the casino and people at every entrance.  We unfortunately fell for their scam and wasted four hours of our trip. But we did get free tickets so that was a plus after being hounded and harassed by a timeshare. Being our first time we didn't realize we were getting into and the Luxor allows these people to have a booth right in the middle of the casino which made me believe that it was them that we're offered free tickets but I was mistaken. 

The hotel is so far south it makes it hard to get to the strip and downtown. 

On Saturday night the water got shut off and we had no water in the East Tower. I was told They had an incident and had to shut it all off.  the only thing  they offered to do is to allow me to shower or use the restroom in a different hotel room.  Which would be in the other tower or pyramid.  It's a big place and would have taken about 15 minutes to get to.  They didn't offer any compensation or discounts.  

After going to many other casinos and watching shows you really can tell the difference.  Others are nicer, cleaner, smell better, and have a better clientele. 

It was our 1st time to Vegas so we learned a lot.  We will go back but not to the Luxor",6,1,0

I couldn't envision a scenario where I would ever stay here again, but lo and behold, one arose.  And you know what?  The place isn't half bad.  They totally redid the inside, casino, common areas, bars, etc.  Not nearly as cheap and cheesy as it used to be.  Actually it's, dare I say it, pretty nice.

Oh, the rooms still suck.  And the whole elevator thing is completely maddening, probably the main reason why I swore never to come back.  But to be fair, when I booked they said that the rooms in the tower were newer and much nicer, well worth the extra ten bucks, they said.  That also would have solved the elevator thing.  But I declined b\/c I thought Aly would get a kick out of staying in the pyramid. (She did)

It was strange that they gave us three room keys (there were two of us) and stranger still when only one of the three worked.   On the positive side, ordered room service breakfast the night before to be delivered at a certain time the next morning and it was right on time.

I don't really see myself staying here again, but I have to say if I were looking for Vegas on the cheap this place is an incredible value without being cheesy or disgusting.   Speaking of cheesy and disgusting, my appreciation for the Luxor dramatically increased when, on our way to the roller coaster, we had to walk through the Excalibur and New York New York.

Well it was paid in full after they hit me with a $20 resort fee. When I checked in I was given room 5155 on the 5th floor only to have a broken leaky A\/C unit. After 3 phone calls and waiting 3 hours a guy came to fix it but I had been told my room would be changed. Funny how my new room would take longer to get the keys for then the A\/C guy would come to work on the A\/C. Poor guy had to sit in a pool of water to fix the A\/C. When I finally got the keys to the new room 20145 I found that the tv remote was missing. You can't change the channels on the tv without the remote. An hour after calling the remote arrived. In that hour I noticed the wall paper falling off the wall and major water damage to the bathroom door. The room wasn't very clean. I don't know how MGM runs their hotels but when Circus Circus owned the Luxor it was never this bad. After all was said and done and all the complaints all I got was a crappy breakfast buffet. I asked if I could get a perk for liking them on Facebook and was told no I asked what about yelp? Nothing. I was having a great trip till I got to Luxor. I paid 3 star prices for a 1\/2 star stay. I don't think I will ever go back to Luxor. Well off to Facebook to warn people there.,0,0,0

Given that it's one of the more affordable hotels on the strip, we stayed there for 3 nights last weekend.  It was overall a good experience.

We lucked out and got a nice, standard room in the pyramid.  The room was clean, the furniture was in good condition and the beds were comfortable. The room was large enough to be comfortable for our family of 4.  Beware, though, that the beds seem to be doubles and not queens.

We went to the pool which was adequate though not particularly exciting.  We ate at the Pyramid cafe, which was OK.  The best part of our stay was the ancient Egyptian theme of the hotel, which the kids really enjoyed. I'd say the worst part was the location, too far from the hotels in the central part of the strip.

Also, it's a little far down on the strip, so next time in Vegas I'll probably try to stay a little more in the middle.

Cons: rooms are outdated, everything is old. No refrigerator either. The bed comforter wasn't even a comforter. You just got a sheet and a brown blanket. The bed wasn't even comfortable.  I stayed in the deluxe tower room on the 14th floor btw- these are the rooms that are claimed to be ""updated"". Cleanliness was a big fat 0. It's actually pretty disgusting. Bathroom floors don't look like they get mopped at all. You will realize this all throughout the hotel. Shower head is horrible, doesn't adjust and the pressure of water literally hurts you.

That shouldn't have been a problem bc we are staying in the hotel, but the man that does the valet told us he can't park it Unless we wanted to be ""vip"" in which we had to give him $20 to park it. I call the front desk about this in the morning since it was weird to me, and turns out they had no idea this was happening. There were so many cars outside that night that were all charged money by the valet which the guys just put straight in their pocket. The customer service is horrible. Nobody looks happy there at all. There were 2 nights were the cleaners didn't even touch my room. (I stayed for a total of 5 nights-if they weren't gonna take my money i would have checked out after the first night). 
The buffet was disgusting. The only plus side was they had really good salads. That's it. We ended up leaving the hotel every single day we were there. Dining in different places, visiting all the other hotels. You really notice a difference right away. 

When we left we made a quick stop in LA and stayed at a cheap inn. I kid you not, the room there was wayyyy Better. Comfortable bed, roomy, refrigerator, better shower, wifi, and it was CLEAN! We paid $60 a night.

Our room was in the pyramid, 20th floor. First bad thing about is that the elevators are in one corner of the pyramid and if your room is not close to the elevator, get ready to walk! In the pyramid there are no windows, so the air is not really good, A\/C must run all day long. In our room, the dust was all over, when I realized it was way too late to call the housekeeping people and I was way too tired after traveling from LA to Vegas and spending the day walking around like crazy. 

I decided to clean a bit around my bed with a wet towel and notice that the fire sprinkler by the bedside had about  1\/2 inch of dust, it seems that nobody looks up when cleaning, plus the headboard, lamps and nightstands had a lot of dust. After cleaning and seeing the white towel become nasty, I decided to hang it in the bathroom, in the vent that was also nasty with dust, to call for the housekeeping attention.

To my surprise, when I returned to my room later in the second day, the towel was still hanging in the vent and the dust was still there. I took a picture and sent to the hotel management, from whom I did not hear back until now. I know how hotels work, instead of resolving the problem; they try to please you giving another room, so I did not go to the front desk. Resuming, the dirty towel stood there until my check out. I showed to the front desk attendant my picture and she was nice to cancel the resort fees and apologized, which was nice of her, but still did not make me change my mind.

Overall, the Luxor has seen better days, the pyramid is dirty and in need of attention inside and out, from my floor you could see those ""buildings"" they have put as decoration in the middle of the pyramid and on the top of them the amount of empty cans, cigarette packs, and litter is ridiculous. Clearly there is no attention to maintenance, cleaning and guests well being.
 
Other hardship I had , we went there to meet a friend who was staying also at the Luxor coming from Brazil (so he had no local cell phone). Nobody could find him by his name, I tried the front desk person and by phone. They do not show much good will in helping you. I had to find my ways using contacts in Brazil and everything was good. I could later contact him from my room just dialing his room number. When I did my check out and left to Excalibur's buffet, I called Luxor to speak with my friend and asked for his room number. The operator said that it was an invalid room number... WHAT????? Not only I had been there but also called many times from my room!!!! She asked for his name, I spelled last and first name and she said that he was not at the hotel... WTH?? 

Again????????? I got REALLY mad and decided just walk back there to meet him, since the lack of interest of those people in helping is just ridiculous!

When I first rode up on it, I thought it was weird because I didn't have anything to drink yet, but I was off balance.

The nice thing about the room was that from my window, I had a direct view of the pool area, but too bad there wasn't a balcony or anything so I could try out my new zoom lens... :D",1,1,1

I have a pretty strong immune system and deal with sick patients all of the time so for me to get sick it takes a lot. 

Also a few days after getting home I received an email survey from the property. After  filling out the survey and letting my concerns be known, all I recueved in response was a BS email from someone who didn't seem like they cared much either. I left my email and phone number on the survey for someone to contact me, they obviously didn't care to talk to me to find out what they could do to improve so the generic email is what I got.

Check-in was pretty quick, and the lady extended our check-out time by an hour for ""courtesy"".... personally, if my check in is at 3 PM and I'm getting in 10 hours later, I should get more than an hour! 

For me, the room did everything I needed it to do. A bed, bathroom, and shower. No fancy view, just one night and I'm out of there in the morning to head back home.

Check in was easy and we opted for the suite upgrade as we were told it had a coffee maker and fridge in the room which we really wanted. Sadly to say the coffee maker was just one of those tiny single cup things that did not heat up or really make coffee. That was the first time I called maintenance. The room was nice, had actually a door between the living area and bedroom with the bath off the bedroom. There was a table with four chairs, a comfy couch, desk, bar area plus comfy chair. No microwave even though we were pretty sure we were told there was one. Bedroom had a king sized bed with side tables and a clock, bathroom was large and broken into two parts, no door in between, there was a soaking tub and a glass shower, the spray did not work well and either trickled or spray only upwards (second call to maintenance). Double sinks and a commode with a underpowered hair dryer and light up mirror. Toiletries were decent but tiny and no conditioner.
All in all the room was fine, but had its downsides. The couch was not a sleeper so we took turns sleeping on the king bed. I am up and down a lot so didn't want to share. Every morning there was lots of noise and activity in the hall (it seems the maid was an early riser) and she knocked on our door even when the do not disturb sign was out of we didn't leave by 9am.  Really?? This is Vegas!!
Elevators were quick and there were six of them. Vegas requires a lot of walking so we knew the rooms were not close to anything. 
Even with our many calls to maintenance nothing ever got fixed, we don't think they even showed up even when I called back twice more.

That was the catch phrase that kept coming up while drinking at 3am with some guys we met at the Liquidity lounge in the middle of the casino floor. The cool, yet scary thing about the Luxor, is in fact the Inclinators: not escalators, not elevators... something in between. Imagine: you step inside this normal looking elevator type thing and then all of a sudden you get thrown to the left because of the sideways inertia you weren't expecting.

It was really, really, really bad to ride it hungover!

Another cool, yet scary thing is that your rooms almost feel like there's nothing below them, like you're just floating in mid-air... not so cool, when you're 17 floors above the casino floor, but oh well. :o) So you don't look down... lol

I liked the fact that this place is affordable, has a walking bridge to Mandalay Bay, as well as a free tram that you can take to either Mandalay Bay or the Excalibar. This place also has complimentary bag check so that if you have to check out and your flight doesn't leave for like 8 hours, you can leave your bags there and are free to wander the strip with no worries.

A few downsides to staying here:  My room seemed to always be musty... I don't know if that was standard for all the rooms or not...., the onsite LAX nightclub and the onsite restaurant were both closed while we were there, so we basically had to go other places to go have fun. 

As far as good & bad: it's basically on the end of the strip, so it's a bit of a hike to get to other parts. The good news about that is that ""The Deuce"" (the double-decker transit bus) hits each stop on the strip every 6-10 minutes 24 hours a day and it's only $5 for a 24-hour pass.",5,2,4

I'll just try to summarize things simply:

1.  The folks at the bell desk are pretty awesome and helpful.  I arrived at the Luxor at 800am flying in from Hawaii on a red eye flight.  I was advised by a friend to leave my suitcase at the bell desk since regular check-in time was at 300pm.  They were courteous and very polite.  When I finally got to my room and called down to ask for my suitcase to be brought up, my bag was sent to my room within 10 minutes of my call.  Overall, great service provided by the bell desk staff.

2.  My room was kept immaculately clean and tidy by the housekeeping staff.  Yes, I admit I was only a guest for two nights, but I still feel they did an excellent job.  The room was always pristine looking after I returned in the afternoon.

3.  Checking in was very efficient.  Although the staff member that assisted me was a bit frank, she was helpful and very skillful at her job.  

4.  The pool area, which I had never used before, was very spacious and adequate.  There are separate paid areas that have cabanas, a private paid area for adults only , as well as a general area for guest use.  The pool staff was friendly and provided towels and info.  There is a bar (of course) and snack bar available.  For those not wanting to leave the comfort of their chair or cabana, there are servers walking around taking orders.  One aspect I appreciated that there were multiple lifeguards present\/on duty.

We checked in late the first night and they tried to get us to upgrade to a different room for $20 more a night, but we said no. Then the guy said he could do it for $10 a night so we said yes! The walk to the room was a little far. The room was nice, nothing super special though. Had a great view of the mountains which was nice during the day, but it would have been cooler to have a view of the strip at night. The staff was great, always very friendly and helpful. Air conditioner worked well and everything was clean.

The shower was a little weird. It worked fine but the shower head looked a little odd, and compared to other shower in hotels I think they could do more. The pool was nice too. Great atmosphere. The casino and everything inside the hotel are great additions too. 

My only complaint would be how far away everything is within the hotel. It took us about 10 minutes to walk from the car to our room. We stayed in one of the wings, so unlike other hotels this one is more horizontal than vertical. Everything just seemed far within the hotel. 

Other than that it was great! Great distance from the strip and it was nice to not be in the middle of everything. Overall I would definitely check the Luxor first before going to any other hotel. Thank you Luxor staff!",0,0,0

The main hotel floor in the pyramid was under reconstruction (rumor had it that the foundation was sinking) and the noise of the jackhammers got so noisy that we felt compelled to complain to the front desk to see what could be done. We got moved to one of the newly completed towers and were given a discount for our next stay. That was good enough to get me back. 
Our next trip was peaceful. I fell in love with the 3 swimming pools and could only be dragged away to eat at their fantastic buffet or to gamble a little (enough to try and win my money for the buffet). 
My mom and brother were blown away by the inclinators (elevators that go up at the same angle of the pyramid). We also love the Egyptian decor and the gigantic statues in the entrance. 
Scared of heights, both stays in the pyramid, I was scared to death by the hallway to our room, considering the rail is only about 3 feet high and overlooks the casino floor, (in our case, 20 floors down). Not that it deterred me. I just made my way to my room, inching along the walls. I probably looked crazy, but most people in Vegas end up doing something crazy, hence the phrase ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. 
The hotel has a video arcade and IMAX theater, for people who don't gamble or bring their kids along with them to Vegas. I found myself in the IMAX one evening, too hungover to go out. We watched a documentary on Mt. Everest. Man! That ""Hike"" would be even scarier than our hotel hallways! ha ha 
When I was here last Club"" LAX"" was called ""Ra!"" It's huge and their dj's play the most current music. They have a dress code, so gents - don't wear sneakers. I was in love with the cool cobra faucets in the bathroom. 
The location of the hotel is pretty good. You have the Mandalay Bay next door, which houses concerts and boxing matches as well as a the monorail. It goes from the Mandalay Bay to the Excalibur (passing the Luxor). You then cross the overpass to the MGM and it'll take you all the way to the other end of the strip, to the Sahara). 
All in all, I would totally stay here again. Not just for nostalgic reasons, but because of its uniqueness.",1,0,0

There was mold in the shower, a very noisy bathroom fan, gaping space between the carpet and the tile near the jacuzzi with sharp edges exposed.
Sal, from in room dining was great as was the food!
The nightlife in the Luxor was fair though I didn't get a chance to experience Cathouse (the food smelled GREAT). Patron platinum was on the menu for 40. per shot. T&T was a decent eatery as was the Pyramid cafe which had reasonable prices.

This review is for the pyramid deluxe room.

Hotel atmosphere is a little bit too dark for my taste, but what can you expect for a pyramid-themed hotel, really. 

The room is mostly clean, except in one area. We found that the marble table has a lot of bread crumbs (a little bit hard to see in the pic).... all the way down to the chair.

Resort fee
I see people complain about resort fee. However, it is not am issue that is unique to Luxor. This seems to be the new 'custom' of Vegas hotel (started about 2 or 3 years ago), where the hotel management 'forces' customer to pay the fee that provide them access to the gym and the internet access.

Bathroom was clean. Water temperature was responsive. Just remember!! Pyramid tower does not have bath up, as far as I know. It only has the stand-up shower.

Bed was quite comfortable.

As any other M-life hotels, Luxor provides you with coupon booklet that has discounts for food, play, show, etc. 

Overall, it was a decent experience. We had a comfortable stay for the amount of money we pay. If it was not because of the bread crumb on the table, I would've given it a 4-stars.",5,0,0

It was very nice though- had the Egyptian theme, which I liked alot (I loved Ancient Eqypt as a child, and Indiana Jones was a favorite too). The elevators were also angled, which was very unique, even today. Locals can get room rates as low as $32 a night- check the website under ""promotions."" 

Years ago, the Eqyptian theme was a big deal- it wasn't done before, for that matter. Now, most of what was the attraction\/theme is long gone- the statues, the costumes, the decor.

Staying in their hotel does not get you free parking. Parking is an additional $10. Random parking is $10 a day. Guests also must pay for parking. Buffet meals included were for breakfast and lunch only. Something that is in the fine print of the confirmation email only. The email and booking information states ""Two buffets per night included"", however only after you receive the confirmation email you learn free buffets are only applicable to breakfast and lunch. When I argued it the check out clerk said the wording on the advertisement is subjective and that I need to read the fine print. I could have stayed elsewhere that was cleaner and more organized for the same price or maybe just a few bucks more. Windows in our room were filthy and towels were only changed once in a four day period. No shampoo when we got to our room and we had to request it. The list goes on.

Let the overgrown kid in you loose and go in, take a look. The people working the valet parking IMHO are some of the nicest valets I've used in Vegas. When you step inside remember you're in Vegas and it's OK to gawk and look around and especially look up. Yes, it's cool. Yes those are hotel rooms up there. And the elevators you take to get to those rooms are cool in their own right. But whatever you do, don't look down. The carpet like a lot of stuff in the Luxor could use a refresh. And no if you take the elevator up you can't get to the megabeam of light at the very tip of the pyramid. You can't even get close, go outside and just look up instead and save yourself the time. 

I've never checked out the clubs as I'm not one of the cool kids anymore, but I just liked the overall feel of the Luxor. When I had an issue with my MGM Rewards card the staff took care of it fast. I also liked the feel of their casino better than Mandalay...I stayed longer and played more at the Luxor. 

The hotel rooms need a refresh...they are barely a cut above being at a Days Inn or Motel 6, and the rooms I've been in needed some work. You might be better off looking elsewhere for a room unless you really want to say you stayed in a giant pyramid. 

I definitely recommend checking out the Shoppes at Mandalay Place which connects the Luxor to Mandalay Bay. But that's another review (The sock store is AWESOME though) for another time. 

One Tip: Thinking of seeing Criss Angel: Believe? Please look up the reviews for it before you do. Not all things by Cirque du Soleil are golden tickets.

I'm torn between great experiences and not-so-great experiences. The Luxor is not a bad choice, but there's definitely better hotels out there. Though, few will have room rates as cheap as Luxor.

My first stay here was fantastic. Rooms were comp'd, check-in was fast, services was friendly and accommodating. The rooms were standard, but clean and fairly nice.

However, my subsequent stays at the Luxor have never reached that same level of satisfaction. On my last visit, nothing would be comp'd. (This is due more to the new Mlife Player's Club program the casino group runs instead of the Luxor itself). It was also difficult to get rooms close to my friends. The front desk personnel don't have that warm, happy-to-see-you feel that they used to.

I've only stayed in the Tower Rooms, which are very slightly bigger than Pyramid rooms and are suppose to have newer furniture, fixtures, etc. The rooms are small, yet adequate in size. The plumbing is horrible. Every time I stay here, the sinks always get backed-up. This gets to be pretty nasty.

The casino is great. Lots of table games and a large selection of slots. They have some pretty good bars. The more upscale Aurora Bar and Liquidity Bar. I preferred the Playbar near the Sportsbook. It's not glamorous, but the bartenders are pretty good and all my drinks are comp'd as long as you drop $20 into one of the video poker machines on the bar counter. Another patron paid for their drink, but was pleased to find that this bar did not add tax to the drinks.

The buffet is decent the food is not incredible, nor is it horrible. And they have a deal where you pay $32 for the entire day of buffet. This also includes the buffet at Excalibur (if you're looking for a change of scenery) and VIP line access. If you want to spend a bit more, their steakhouse called ""Tender"" is phenomenal. Some of the best steak I've had in my life. But be prepared to spend around $40-$60 a plate. And for those want late night eats on the cheap, they have the Pyramid Cafe, McDonalds, and Nathan's Hot Dog open 24-hours a day.

They have the Cathouse and LAX, if you're looking for nightclubs. Cover charges are ridiculous, as are the lines. Either get on the guest list or have a 2-to-1 girl-to-guy ratio. (As one person told me, ""the hotter, the better"")

It's in dire need of updates and its otherwise pleasing architecture leaves one walking a city block if your room isn't located near one of the elevators.  That being said here is a small list of my complaints: 

A. Use the elevator;  our front desk person may have been having a bad day but as we got on the elevator with a few different parties who all hit the floor buttons and then rode up and down the elevator waiting for the doors to open on the floor only to be sorely disappointed to discover it had zipped past everyone's floor; it was getting frustrating until someone got on at another floor and explained you had to use your room key to get to your floor and showed us the not obvious location to insert the said key;  I'm guessing that keeps the professional ladies from walking the floors but I thought it was ridiculous; 

B. Finding the food court area is a bit much you can look into from the upper levels of the hallway (it's a cool view) but once you find the correct entrance you need to walk the stairs\/ramp or use and elevator. It was a bit much after a long day of walking my tourist friends around the strip.

The rooms aren't bad and you really shouldn't be spending too much time in them anyway but the WiFI package they try to talk you into didn't work correctly and even when we called down to ensure we had the correct login it was advised we could always jack into the system using the USB cable; we gave up and just used our cell phone internet. 

The Casino itself was great; fun games live and video; but being a local and wanting my friends to see more than that we used the Valet a lot.  We had to wait 10-15 mins once but otherwise my car was in and out in less than 7 so they are top notch;  I don't know if I will ever stay here again and they won't be high on my recommendation due to the list above but it is a cool place to visit.",4,0,0

Pros:
-Free soaps in bathrooms (well duh, who doesn't take advantage of those things?)
-Connects to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur, very convenient if you wanna go shopping or dining.
-Hotel rooms have a great view of Las Vegas outside.
-Has a tram if you don't want to walk to other hotels. Very speedy.
-Rooms have nice layout, with a TV.
-Box office with many shows to choose from, but as far as I know, they don't do discounts.

Cons:
-Elevator is rickety, and especially if you have claustrophobia (fear of small and enclosed spaces), I wouldn't recommend going on the elevators. Although, the only other way to access upper floors was the emergency exit stairs.
-No coffee maker or microwave in the rooms. Not really convenient.
-Luxor trams only go to Excalibur. Wish there were more hotels to choose from.
-Food court needs more variety, and if you want more variety, you have to go to other resorts.
-Pool is closed during the winter. Couldn't there be heating?

The room was booked under a special rate, that wasn't so much of the reason to make us stay here, it was mainly due to it was very close to the business activities. Under the special rate, we discovered the hotel business is really all about service equals to the dollars you spent. They really could not find a room any worst than the one they gave us, according the Heather at the front desk, it was the LAST room available when we checked in. When I inquired the possibility of changing to a room, she managed to hang up before I finished talking. I told myself ""you get what you pay for"".

After talking to Heather, after getting rid of a fly in the room, after picking some hair, small pieces of litter, not to mention the countless stains on the chairs and bed sheets, I told my husband that there was no way I could stay here.

My boyfriend and I decided to take a roadtrip from the SF Bay Area to Las Vegas and unfortunately we made reservations at the Luxor. After a long day driving through Death Valley (which is absolutely beautiful by the way. If you ever get the chance to go do it!) we checked in and hauled all of our luggage up to our room. Upon entering we notice that, although the bed was made, the room was a disaster. The furniture was strewn all about and there were wrappers and empty bags everywhere. This non-smoking room stunk of cigarettes due to the poor architecture of the place and it was incredibly dark and dingy.

I immediately called the front desk and spoke with a manager who apologized for the mistake saying that the room was listed as clean in their system. He offered to upgrade our room for free to a tower room which we accepted. The room was slightly nicer and clean but very dated (hey, I thought they recently remodeled this place). We had a glorious view of the parking garage from the window and a small tube tv. The ""free wi-fi"" was not free and impossible to figure out. The bathroom was spacious and bright but there was mold in the shower.

On checking out after spending two horrible nights at this hell hole we were charged a $27 RESORT FEE! WTF?! I guess all the hotels in Vegas have resort fees but the Luxor is about as far removed from a resort as a place can get. They say it covered our free newspaper in the morning (which we had to pick up god knows where, it wasn't delivered) two complimentary bottles of water a day (about 6 oz each) and use of their gym (who the eff uses the gym in Vegas?)

Two of our friends arrived 30 minutes before the rest of us. One of them was resting (not sleeping) in the room alone for maybe ten minutes when she heard a rustling sound. She walked out, and there was a MAN IN OUR ROOM going through our purses. She screamed, and he took off, but not before robbing us of $1000 and taking our friend's wallet and ID. She NEVER heard a door, and those doors are LOUD and slam shut.

We had to call security THREE TIMES before anyone came upstairs. They accused us of being on drugs and hallucinating the incident. They accused us of propping the door open with the deadbolt. They dismissed the idea that someone had a key. They accused us of bringing random guys into our room. UM, we've only been in Vegas for 30 minutes, jackholes! We were up until 4am with the police roaming our rooms and the hallways while they investigated the report.

We had to call the front desk FOUR TIMES to get moved to a new room. They refused to move us until five women went down to the front desk and threatened to tell everyone in the check-in line that there might be a dude hiding in the bathtub waiting to rob you. We NEVER got an apology or even the slightest bit of empathy from the management. Trying to get our room comped was a joke. It was like we were a huge inconvenience to them and the eye rolling we received was astonishing.

And where ever else that did have light, it wasn't bright at all. The lights did flicker too with a brightness then dimmed down again like it was some sort of power surge going on.

Obviously, if there was a king then we know that the suite is meant for a cpl who'll put it to good use but in a family suite with a two grandmas, a mom, a dad, and a child, it's simply a waste of space. No one will be getting naked in front of everyone in middle of the room. The fitness center was quite small but clean and not many people are using it.

Aaaanyway, I had a big networking fancy-schmancy cocktail party to go to, and of course the hotel hairdryer in the bathroom broke. So I called housekeeping for a replacement, they said they could bring one up in two minutes, but 30 minutes later, I gave up and went to the salon downstairs.

The stylist insisted on doing the opposite of what I asked for: she added a bunch of spray when I told her my hair already had product in it, and used a straightening and curling iron when all I wanted was a round brush. She also turned the chair away from the mirror so I couldn't keep track of things. In retrospect I should have insisted that she do as I ask, and not let her insist on doing it her own way, but I was trying to be ""nice"" (I know, very uncharacteristic of me; what can I say?)

Almost an hour and a half later (much too long for a basic blow dry), I turn around and she has made me look like a French poodle. It was horrible! I just stood up and said, ""I'm sorry, but please hand me the blow dryer and brush; I have to fix this myself."" She was offended, but too bad. Of course, it took me a while to salvage what I could of it, and by that time I had really missed the party, AND guess what they charged me for the privilege of not listening to my simple requests?

That is kind of where I lost my excitement here because if you are in either of the towers you feel so far from everything. It was a trek to the casino or even just the doors to get out of the casino, mind you it seemed like there were 15 different exits and they all seemed far. It just got annoying walking all over the strip and then having to walk even more to your room. Now if you were in the pyramid itself, I don't think you would have that problem because you were right in the middle of the action. The rooms were nice though and very clean and as I said the casino was nice nothing special but not a slum by any means. I got a groupon deal to stay here and quite frankly the price is about all that made it worth it.

However, this is pretty much the same for all Vegas hotel and the Luxor has a lot of families guest that handle this well. Kids love the pyramid building and the pool. I expected the pyramid room on 9th floor to be noisy but the door does good job isolating noises from the casino and the air conditioning being on all the time blocks anything external at all. Non-smoking room with King sized bed was very spacious, clean and with no cigarette smell (you do get smell on public space areas because Vegas hotels allow inside smoking). While the 20 something room has some old stuff, everything worked fine and comfortable.
The hotel has a very nice pool, 3 open to all guests, one for VIP reservations which I founded needed but full of people! Pools are 1ft to 3 and half feet deep, so no risk for the kids and 2 life guards are on at each pool.
Hotel has lots of options for eating, since fast food\/breakfast places to Japanese and tex-mex types. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful.

Two things could improve. First is ground staff staking you out all the times to buy tickets to shows. For a 7 day stay, I have been asked about 20 times. There is no need to bother quests or visitors so much. Something minor, would be good to have little fridge in the rooms to store outside purchased food.

Check-in has long line but it moves quickly and check-out can be done on machines or by envelope which is quicker.

It was a good location for wanting to explore other areas and not travel too far. Had a designated area for Lyft & Uber which was very convenient. All in all it was just okay. Nothing bad and nothing great to report. Check out way easy and painless so that was good. We wouldn't stay there again just because there are some better, cheaper options (that we found out about while on trip), but it did the job.",0,0,0

According to all of the other reviews the room should have been filthy the staff should have been rude and everything should have been falling apart. The room was very clean the staff was very friendly and attentive and nothing was falling apart. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean. It is an older hotel (I remember watching it being built in the early 90s) and you can see the wear and tear a few places but it was nothing that took away from my enjoyment of my stay. 

One big tip is to check in online before you come to the hotel. You will wait in a line with maybe one or two people in front of you rather than the regular check-in line which had probably over a hundred people in it. 

The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I am still upset over having to pay a resort fee and now having to pay for parking it's something that I just cannot agree with.

Other than that we had an enjoyable stay here at the Luxor",0,0,0

-Pyramid Suite layout is awesome; oversized tub, comfy sitting room with TV, a nice sleeping area with TV, a fridge and plenty of space for everyone. if you do not like your view, request a move. We always enjoy the view of Mandalay Bay and the Delano, and the Luxor was obliging.
-Elevator to the Atrium, Casino and Buffet: If you bring a child in a stroller, this elevator will be your best friend. Centrally located and so convenient.
-Reservations area has comfy sofas with plug-ins for your devices. 
-Housekeeping took very good care of us with extra blankets and a light cleaning at 2pm, long after they had cleaned the other rooms. 
-MORE buffet has a helpful, gentle way with accommodating children. 
-Entertainment: Carrot Top is a MUST. He is the reason to stay here. 

Cons:
-Broken lamp knob, a toilet that required three tries to flush, very dim lighting in the bathroom, and one of the two TV remotes did not work. These things should be checked and maintained, esp. in a suite. The sofa in the sitting area should also be thoroughly cleaned after each checkout (we found a few fluffy bits and lint)

-This is our SECOND consecutive trip in which we've had to wait hours at Reservations for our room to be ready, and the view for that room was horrendous (literally a graveled roof and a wall). Fortunately, we were moved to a much better suite. Waiting to check into your room after traveling is a huge inconvenience if traveling as a couple or with friends, but it's a hellish nightmare that will make you question your life choices if traveling with kids. We are always respectful of a hotel's checkout time; time to credit your waiting guests, and penalize late-leavers. Which brings me to my next con:

-If I've had to wait, say, three hours for my room to be ready, shouldn't I get a noon checkout time without any pushback? I hate to get assertive with someone just trying to do the best they can to uphold policy, but if our room was not ready because the occupants ""had not left yet"" well after 3pm, then please don't tell me that we need to check out at 11am to get the room ready for your next t guests. I finally got my noon checkout time, but I did not appreciate the ""we can only do this once"" speech. If you keep making mistakes, then you're going to have to keep fixing them. We stopped going to Excalibur because of similar treatment, and we can always go somewhere else if Luxor doesn't work out.

-WiFi is TERRIBLE in the room, but comes in handy in the casino and the buffet. If I'm having to use my mobile data for Internet and etc. in my room, then I'm not quite sure what I'm paying for in resort fees. 

All in all, the Luxor is a good place to stay. It's quiet and they seem to have gotten rid of the timeshare militia who usually hold fort at the foot of the Luxor-Excalibur bridge. We used to really be in love with the Luxor, but this recent trip puts them in our Friend Zone.",1,1,0

1. On the strip
2. Rooms were spacious
3. Owned by MGM and we could park at any MGM lot. When checking in you get a parking pass, this way you can go in and out of the parking lot as you need. 
4. The pool is large. Although we weren't able to swim, because of timing, it looked nice. 
5. Easy check out

I was not there for the check in process, my mom said it took about 20-30 minutes to check in, because it was a long line. 

We were unable to swim in the pool, because we ran out of time. From the looks of it though, it looked nice. I noticed that ""non-hotel guests"" can pay to ""play"" too and that's pretty cool! I don't know how the hotel guests feel about that, but I think it's nice. 

We did not eat at the buffet.. honestly, I would rather eat somewhere on the strip or in town. Like all buffets at Vegas hotels, it looked expensive. 

We stayed on the first floor, right near the 3rd elevator. When we first got to the room we thought it was unfortunate, but it was actually convenient. The only downside was, the Starbucks near our room was only open in the morning. 

The pizza restaurant in the hotel (cannot remember the name) was pretty good. Unfortunately, we ran into ""dumb"" people who decided to throw rocks off the balcony of the floor onto the people in the food court. Very dangerous! They did it twice. 

Check out was very easy! We got online and paid in the room. For parking, if it's not added into your room total... You will pay for it before leaving the parking lot. For 4 days it only ended up being 30 dollars for us. 

The hotel room was pretty nice. You can tell it's no BELLAGIO, but it was clean and the housekeeping was prompt on cleaning and getting us the items we needed. 

My sister and her boyfriend stayed on the 20th floor in a one bed room and it seemed a lot nicer than ours... although, our room was more money. I believe that's because we had 1 additional person in the room (Starting at 2 people). They had a siting tub and stand up shower. Also, a pretty nice view.

My sister did experience one weird thing.... they were on an elevator and there was a dog and it's owner with them.... well the dog peed right on the floor of the elevator with them in it and the owner looked at it and walked out.  This is not the hotels fault, I am sure it was cleaned up fast... but, come on guests. 

Also, the casino seemed smaller than others, but it was nice and not crowded.",0,0,0

The beds at Luxor felt like beds from a run down motel on some random highway in the Nevada desert. We even got an ""upgrade"" to the towers and I kid you not, my friend was like ""THIS, is an upgrade?"". Not sure how the rooms in the pyramid were but if our tower upgrade was so crappy, I feel sorry for the others.

When my wife got to the room the door was ajar and it had been used. I went down and complained and they upgraded us to another room. The room was nice, it was quiet, a little dated. 

First thing we noticed, in the basic room, there is no mini-fridge, that is extra, but for the extra one could just upgrade to a better room. 

The bed was standard hotel uncomfortable, we could not wait to get back to our own bed. 

The stale AC or old smoke saturated in the room set off my allergies big time, by the last day I was dying. 

I love how hotels can get away with things like a $28\/day or whatever ""resort"" fee... to maintain the pool and such, $28\/day times 4000 rooms is a lot of money to maintain the pool. I bring this up because the pools, well of the 5, 1 is fenced off and requires guests to pay extra to use, then 3 of the others were barricaded off as closed, which left everybody to the one free pool. All the lounges were full and one could stand in the water of the pool, as it was so full there would be no way to actually swim... what are the lifeguards for? oh yeah, to constantly blow their whistles and yell at people for not having their drinks covered. 

The buffet sucked, but that'll be a separate review. But it seems that the $20 voucher can only be used on all day wristbands, which is one way I guess to keep people at your hotel. But it only covers half of 1 person's wristband. And since we were not there to eat and gamble, the voucher went to waste. 

Valet was nice, we used it constantly on our stay, until the last night, we had to run to the drug store, and they would not take our car again, I had to park a mile away in the back of the back lot and trek at 2am, after a long day. 

We visited the Excalibur on the last day and had Brunch Buffet over there... we liked the entire experience at the Excalibur better, and ironically, the Luxor costs more. The people were friendlier, the food was better, the gaming was better, overall a much better place, and where we will likely stay next time we are in Vegas.",6,2,2

I like the Luxor, it has a great building and a great theme but doesn't do much to attract the young crowd.

Our room was a Tower King room and had a king bed, A\/C, great view and a 40"" HDTV. The room was ok for what it was. I was a little frustrated their was no Coffee Maker or Fridge.

The bathroom was great though, full shower, full tub!

The pool is great except all the free lounge chairs are taken, forcing you to lay\/sit on the ground or pay more money for a reserved lounge chair.

CarrotTop's performance was AMAZING. I will be back to see him.

* we got an AWESOME rate booking with the EDC groups. and when i say, awesome, i mean A-W-E-S-O-M-E! almost 50% off anywhere else. PLUS, this was a fight night (the night PacMan was robbed), and there were a couple of high profile conventions too. 

* the layout, although different having an open atrium thingy, was not too difficult to traverse. after a couple trips, i knew my way around.

* the pools were cool. not too hard to find seats out there on a saturday afternoon. the cocktailetresses were on top of things. music wasn't bad.

* check in was originally slated for 3p. we got in at 10a. after checking back at 11a, we got a room. sweet. 

* the room was clean, on a floor i requested and the view was of the pool. i didn't even have to drop a tip to the front desk. the bathrooms were very impressive. not like what others have mentioned. plenty of stainless towels and functioning toilet\/shower. 

* beds were comfy, plenty of seating and writing space. we had a flat screen and lots of storage. 

other than the location being at the far south end of the Strip (hence no 5th star) and a weird gravitationally non-compliant elevator, absolutley NO quams on this hotel. and the drink coupons i put to use right after i got the bags down in the room. all 4 of them! we may consider coming back here.",0,0,0

The rooms are dated, so are the elevators, hallways and other common areas. Management is also extremely non-responsive and in need of taking refresher courses in customer service. I am a mlife Platinum and was supposedly 'upgraded'. My room was dirty and old with mold, broken shower handle - which fell on my foot twice in two days, old warped table and stains on couch to name a few problems. Sent an email to customer relationship the next morning after I checked in - no response. Complaint to the first front desk manager the next day and his excuse was that sometimes we miss things in rooms. Not true, as a number of my colleagues were also staying in the same hotel and all had one problem or other. Complained to other manager that evening and he promised to get back to me after checking with his boss and will leave a message for me. Of course no follow up message or communication. 
There are a number of really good hotels in Vegas - I will be avoiding this hotel in my future trips until the management and hotel get their act together.

Reply to Luxor Guest Relations:

Dear Lori P. at Luxor,

Thank you for your reply via Yelp. Unfortunately, I had already written to the guest services email address that you provided and got no response back. As I wrote in my initial review I even went to two front desk managers two separate times and their response was ranged from not caring to false promises which never materialized. I am not sure what good it will do at this time to write back to guest relations when you never replied to my original email during my stay.",0,0,0

I had heard it's glory years were over quick since it really is a gimmick hotel. But I got in cheap as a part of a a package deal. Strangely I was placed on the 13th floor (didn't think hotels had them...) but my luck held. 

I give this 2 stars for a few primary reasons: room amenities - mattress was weak, accouterments outdated, standing shower only which leaked, no flat screen TV (i know, who watches TV in Vegas..), the pyramid acts as an inverted funnel diverting smoke into the smoke free rooms. 

On the plus side, room was very clean, 3 Starbucks in the pyramid. Seriously. Late night food available.

At first, I have to admit that I was a bit scared after reading that it was haunted, but let me tell you right now, it is definitely NOT, so there's nothing to worry about. When we first arrived, valet was very accessible and the staff were polite. We arrived at around 11:30am and were hoping we could check in early, but since we booked the Pyramid King Suite, they told us that it wasn't ready yet. We were willing to wait since we realized it was pretty early. They told us our room would be ready and we would get a call between 1-2pm. We didn't check in our baggage and just went to gamble for a bit. 2 hours went by and we still didn't get a call. We finally decided to ask and my boyfriend encountered a rude lady at the front desk who told him to just wait for the call. My boyfriend asked some other staff for help and he was a lot nicer, the man called the manager and asked about our room. The manager told him that our room wouldn't be ready until about 3 or 3:30pm so we were disappointed since we had been driving for 5 hours and were just ready to rest. However, at around 2:20pm we got a call saying our room was ready. We were so happy! Our room was in the 30th floor and as soon as we walked in it had an old smell. It was a lot smaller than we expected. It didn't have a living room or a refrigerator like it was advertised in the pictures. We didn't want to make it a big deal since what we really cared about was the spa tub. 

The cleaning staff were very friendly and attentive, although we wouldn't wake up early enough to get our room cleaned, the cleaning ladies would still ask if we needed anything. 

We feel like the rooms could use a little renovating because the walls seemed to be peeling and every time we would walk into our room it still had that old smell to it. The shower head wasn't the best. The pressure came out too rough. I didn't like that there wasn't a full length mirror. The bathroom was spacious though. The spa tub was the best part of the room, although I wish it had jets. 

There wasn't that much variety of restaurants inside the hotel. 
Gambling was great. We won about $300 at The Hangover machine. Try it!
LAX club was fun! It's a small club but there's free drinks for ladies and if you get on the guest list (which you can do by just asking any of the gentlemen standing outside of the club during the day) then you go in for free before 12am. 
The Oasis pool was kinda small although there are about 3 pools, only 2 of them were open and they were super packed! There was plenty of pool chairs to sit and tan on but not enough room in the pool to go in and enjoy the water. There were way too many people on a Friday afternoon.

Overall, our experience at Luxor was pleasant. We got the king suite for $60 a night being an Mlife member, and for the price, I would say that it was definitely worth it. We would recommend it if you are on a budget and can get discounts. My boyfriend and I will probably stay here again in the future.",3,0,0

We didn't choose the Luxor expecting the Four Seasons - we chose it to get the typical Vegas venue feel (which in my mind includes some grandiose tackiness and kitschy 1950s atmosphere) for a decent price, and weren't disappointed. The room although old-fashioned looking (refurbishment needed for sure) was large and well designed (a desk, a safe, luggage space, many electrical plugs). Same for the bathroom (all key amenities were there including scented shower gel and tissues! Sounds stupid but it's not a given) - the shower flow however could have been less haphazard. The pool area was all right, the pool more of a plunge pool than a swimming pool - and we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the pool bar food: chicken sandwich was really nice and fresh, and so were the chicken tenders, coleslaw and fruit cups. Drinks were more mainstream - not a fan of their margarita slushie. 
NB: I found that all shops inside the hotel sold their goodies at stupidly high prices including Starbucks and Blizz.
Service was good: each time I phoned guest services or housekeeping, I got a prompt answer and the query was answered\/ request was followed through.
Overall, I'd say the hotel and casino are quintessentially Vegas - the fact that they need freshening up doesn't deprive them of their quirky sphinx like charm.

Last weekend, my wife and  stayed at the Luxor for two nights in the East Tower, Room 8304, for a very reasonable price.

Arriving late in the day (or early, depending on perspective) at 2:30 AM, we found the check-in desk to be poorly staffed at that time of the morning. Only 3 stations out of about twenty were open and there was a line. It took perhaps 20 minutes to get our room  keys. I'm thinking that the Team Meeting on Guests' First Impressions was not well attended.

Beyond the arrival experience, the room  was spacious and lovely - nicely appointed, sparkling clean, and very quiet. The bathroom was particularly impressive with a BIG shower and a DEEP bathtub. Perhaps a second trash can would've been useful, and the absence of a wi-fi connection needs to be addressed. (There is a hardwire connection off the TV available for your laptop.) And the absence of an in-room coffee maker didn't make my wife happy, but I don't drink java so couldn't have cared less. Besides, there are at least three Starbucks outlets in the hotel, and maybe more for all I know.

Perhaps those that have reported backed-up sewage, bedbugs, and brown grunge on the walls have an ax to grind. I mean, if one was unlucky at the casino's crap tables, one could subsequently write anything about the room experience whether it's true or not. Since we weren't there to gamble but attend a showing of THE LION KING at the Mandalay Bay Theater next door, I have no beef.

Our two meals at the Pyramid Cafe were well-prepared and tasty. The service was attentive. Our hour in the hotel's fitness gym on the morning of departure was well-spent; the room is well-equipped, though somewhat hard to find (adjacent to the Spa) as the facility isn't given exposure in the hotel fact sheet available in the room.

I'd stay at the Luxor again without any qualms, though I would try to arrive earlier in the day.",0,0,0

What appealed to me was the price and the Internet that was advertised, so it i didn't hesitate. First of all the ""Checking In"" line wrapped around  the whole lobby, and it ended up taking 30 mins to check in. We were assigned our room on the 15th floor in the Pyramid..NOT good. It was disgustingly HOT. Oh man. We tried to ignore it and wanted to unwind in the room, but it was uncomfortably hot. So hot, we had to call some AC tech guy to come check out if our AC was working fine, and it was, but he said that the sun rises and sets on that side so that was the reason for it being so hot. He was making it seem like our comfortability didn't matter because ""the sun came from that direction"". Well, if it does, then why not lower the thermostat!! Geez. So, we decided to cool off and go downstairs and also find a place that had free Wi-fi. False advertisement. When we booked on expedia we were advertised that Wi-fi was included in our resort fee, but failed to mention that it was only available in spots like the cafe and restaurants that required you to purchase something to utilize their ""free"" Wi-fi. Ugh...

On a brighter note, we went back to our room after using the ""free"" Wi-fi, and found the room to be unbearable. I had advised my husband to personally talk to someone at the front desk and rest assured, we were assigned to another room. Much cooler room, and more comfortable!",2,1,1

The architecture is great, the place is huge, there are tons of clubs, bars, restaurants, slot machines, stores, and anything else you would really need inside. The general store even has some good innexpensive souvenirs if you need any. Can't beat mark downs on items for only a buck or two!

The hotel staff was friendly and helpful, we got an awesome deal on our rooms, and my one friend even got upgraded to the tower without any extra charges! The place is a bit tricky to navigate, but after one day, you get the hang of it.

The only thing that was unfortunate is that the rooms look really nice, but the beds weren't that comfortable and the bath tub nob broke off while I was gently turning it off and the entire unit fell out, causing water to spray and not turn off. The repair guy came quickly and turned it off. Not sure if this is common, but I barely put any force on it. It was pretty funny after the fact, because it added a funny story to our trip.

Fast forward to last weekend, on a last minute plan to go to Vegas, I finally had the opportunity to stay at Luxor.

The place doesn't really have the same awe to me like it had back in the 90's, and from what I've heard, after a couple of years it has toned back a bit on the Egyptian theme throughout the casino.

We stayed in the West Tower (unfortunately, not the pyramid, damn), so we couldn't try the inclinators. I assume it's probably not big deal, but I'm still curious about it anyway.  The rooms we stayed in were two doubles, and all in all the room looked pretty clean. The room isn't big though, it seems to be around 400-500 sq ft and isn't the best place to stay if you intend to have 4+ people to stay in the room. Also, everything in the room seems to be updated recently, and besides the samsung lcd tv, it doesn't have the things you would expect at the newer hotels in the area. 

The rest of the casino is pretty much standard, there's a small food court area that has a McDonald's, there are two clubs Cathouse and LAX, and the casino offers connections to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur (which leads to the rest of the strip).  So it's an okay place to stay, but if you are looking to see the rest of the strip, try staying at the hotels a couple blocks north.

We booked our lodging online in November because Luxor emailed me with a great promotion for January. ($59\/ night). I booked a Pyramid Deluxe Room, but don't be fooled, its just your average run of the mill hotel room (nothing deluxe about it, really)... which is all I really wanted because I wasn't going to spend too much time in there anyway. 

In the daytime, the room is pretty bright (with the curtains pulled open). However, at night, I could have all the lights on, but the lamps in the room felt too dim. I invited my friends to kick it in my room before hitting up the strip club and at one point, there were 5 cigars being smoked at one time in the room and it got really smokey, but what can I say, I asked for a smoking room, it would have probably been okay if 2 were going at once... but 5 is a bit much. Anyway, at the end of the night, to get the smell of strippers and cigars off of me, I took a shower... but tell me why the water wouldn't go down the drain. The water level would reach my ankles by the time I was done with my shower. It wasn't a very pleasant feeling.
Each day we'd wake up around noon, go get lunch, gamble, drink, come back to the room and it was always tidied up by the time we got back. No gripes there.

The video slots were really good to me here. I got really lucky here...  and the cocktail service was great too. If you were gambling in any part of their casino, there was always a waitress walking around to serve you rum and cokes (my fave) or drinks of your choice. 

On top of that, they have a pretty nice bar that we frequented, Aurora. It had a great design, was well stocked, the bartender and the server were really nice, and it was never over packed which was a plus... that way we didn't have to shout over each other to have a conversation.

The fire alarm (for the entire hotel, not just our room) went off in the middle of the night and woke a lot of sleeping, irritated people.

I was VERY impressed with the rooms inside the pyramid.  They were clean, beds comfortable and the service was overall good!!!   Even the bathrooms were spacious and had a decent sized shower.

My only negative to this place was the ""resort fee""($17), paying to use the fitness center and be able to use ""wired internet"", if they seriously want to charge a resort fee then they need to start providing decent things, atleast WiFi!!!!  By the way, if you have a mac,  just set up a network with your computer and VOILA instant wifi for you and your friends in your room!!

my poolside experience was great, wasn't overrun with kids and not too much of a crazy party scene. It was just right! and well maintained. 

Our rooms were spacious and clean. Unfortunately the room my Bf and I had  didn't have a pretty view, we saw ugly grey flat rooftop between our room and the pyramid but at least we got to admire the pyramid from our windows and not be disturbed by the sun in the morning. I would've given the Luxor a 5 star rating, but the shower was very disappointing. The shower head felt like it barely worked. it sprayed out water as if you held a hose and blocked part of it with your thumb..The water pressure was very weak. But it had excellent temperature control and the layout was nice and the bathtub was lovely. 

House Keeping at the Luxor is amazing. They are The Bomb! they promptly brought us extra towels when I called and asked for some. And when My bf and I left to the pool, they folded all three shirts my bf had left on the ground and put them on the bed. sooo nice :)

Let's start with the obvious: this hotel is old! The motif is outdated (it reminds me of when I would go to Vegas as a 12-year-old, enchanted by its unfamiliarity), the furniture is outdated, the amenities are meh... And for $90\/night? I would rather stay off The Strip! That wouldn't set me too far back, considering the Luxor requires a cab ride for pretty much any activity. 

The room made me sad. We were put in the pyramid, which sounds like an upgrade, but is really... smoke and mirrors. You can hear EVERYTHING going on in the casino just outside your door, including the Nickleback they decide to play at ungodly hours (preferably while you're in some stage of deep sleep). The lighting is a girl's worst nightmare and not because the mirrors add 10 pounds (that's a separate issue), but because you end up looking like a clown by the time you're done slathering your makeup on. And charging me a $15 resort fee and not even giving me internet? No, thanks!

I know they're trying to advertise his show, but must they use his face??  It's bad enough I saw RuPaul shaking his titties on some commercial advertisement on one of the moving walkways.  I mean, I'm from San Francsico.  Not many things freak me out.  But Carrot Top's face on my Do Not Disturb sign and every other piece of hotel propaganda in my room as well as all over the hotel and casino.... It was frightening.

UPGRADE YOUR ROOM.  Staying in the pyramid (from previous experiences) is very disappointing.  The upgrade is disappointing.  But do yourself a favor, and pay the extra $25 or whatever it is a night.  When you get to the ""upgraded"" room, you will ask yourself what the ""downgrade"" looked like, and then thank me.

I am so OVER dirty hotel rooms.  Sticky residue on the floor of the entry way??  How did housekeeping pass that up?  Not to mention gross substances on the sides of the bathtub and shower.  The shower was soooooo grimey.  Walking in the room barefoot really opens your eyes.  And makes you want to wear flip flops everywhere.

Then there was some stupid blinking light on the room phone.  It said we had a message.  We did not.  The hotel operator could not turn the flashing red light off.  I had to unplug all the phones in the room so that we wouldn't have to deal with the stupid lights blinking in every room at night.

The good things about the Luxor?  Good promotional stuff.  Go check out a timeshare if you have time.  You can get hooked up with a free hotel room, a free cruise, cheap show tickets, etc...  I heard Chriss Angel's show was pretty stupid so don't waste your time or money on that.  Personally, if you're going to Vegas to party, I say stay less time and stay somewhere nicer than the Luxor!

OMG I posted this and then remembered the worst part!  The TV!  It made this awful humming noise after it had been on too long.  So when I woke up at 6am and couldn't fall back asleep, I had two options: lay in silence, watch TV with an obnoxious humming noise.  You only get 23 channels, 2 of them are in Spanish and 4 of them are advertisements for Vegas.  And there was no way to order Showtime so I could watch my regular Sunday evening shows before going out.  Stay somewhere else if you plan on spending any time in your room at all.

Corridors and rooms are dumpy. The heat that generated in my room during the day from the direct sunlight beaming on the all glass pyramid was unbearable - and the air conditioning at full blast just barely worked. The colors - paint, carpets, wallpaper - are all the beige\/brown colors hotels use to hide dirt. I didn't even want to investigate. 

If you're bothered by smoke, I thought the air circulation in Luxor was the worst of any hotel or casino I went in during the week. In fact, we ventured over to Mandalay Bay to play in the casing because the air was much fresher. 

Too many cigar smokers especially at the Aurora bar. There service there sucked, too. Every time my friends and I sat down for a drink, our waitress would serve and then say she was taking her one hour break and they had no substitutes so we had to self serve at the bar. The drinks were costly as well. 

This place is for the 20-something set that comes in over the weekend from LA or Phoenix that wants cheap rooms. If you want that then I guess the place is for you.

It was, well, a bit underwhelming...

Upon arriving, I was greeted by some friendly people offering tourist help... Great I thought! Until I realized it was merely a timeshare pitch. Grrr... Turns out these people are everywhere! Not really the Luxor's fault, I suppose, but it was just the first annoying piece of the experience.

The wait to check in was long, the place is hard to navigate, and the room was nowhere near what I was expecting... The wallpaper was literally coming off the way, the sink was chipped, and the carpet was, well, interesting...

Now, with that out of the way, you get what you pay for! After getting accustomed to the surroundings, I realized it was a fun, entertaining, low-cost Vegas experience. They're remodeling a bunch of stuff, aiming at a younger crowd, and I think they're doing the right thing.

In a year or so, with the remodeling done, I think it'll be a much better Vegas destination, hence the 3 star rating!

The staff that I came into contact with where friendly and helpful and they always had cheaper prices on table games for some late night gambling. I also liked the theme glad I stayed there once.

I call the bell desk and they say they have no record of us requesting a bell hop!! Omg.. so I tell the lady we will NOT be charged a late fee for their mistake.

BUT there were 2 spaces left so if I ""took care"" of the valet guy he will valet my vehicle.  After looking for a spot in self parking for 30 minutes,  I gave  up and went back to valet hoping it was open again. But it wasn't. I ended up ""taking care"" of the valet guy. $20 wasn't enough, and  I did not have change. So I ended up paying $40 for complimentary parking.  I probably could have had a better room at the Holiday Inn.  The Luxor is old and there has not been any renovations done to the hotel probably since they opened.  The shower head does not have any water pressure and the water goes all over the place.  The blow dryer is so ancient (no pun intended) it blows out in 30 seconds and I have to turn on the fuse again. There is no refrigerator in the room so I cannot keep my waters cold.  The AC only had 2 options: ON or OFF because the other settings do not work. 
I would also like to add that my room  smells so badly of smoke.  It is a smoke free room.....
I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.",0,0,0

They'll hold you up from check in for about half an hour, and at the very end of signing up you find out that they are a time share. They only target first timers, so they'll ask if you just checked in and if it's your first time in Vegas. Just avoid these people. Although the tickets were significantly discounted, it was NOT worth the SIX HOUR presentation and tour of the property...which they claimed would be only 2-3 hours, and they'd ""feed"" us brunch (turned out to be stale pastries and juice that tasted gross).

I love this place. You def. get the Vegas experience here!
Since I am not a millionaire, the hotel rates per night is affordable. 

It has a bajkdfjlsd;fdlfsd casino machines...I am not a big on gambling and mostly go for the club scene, but while waiting the $.25 cent machines are a good bargin to kill time. I won myself $.50 cents! Yeaahhhh boii! 

Luxor has L.A.X inside and you can get in for free if you stay there or are rollin with fine bitches! When I stayed here, L.A.X is probably the only club we didn't end up at. Ha ha and every time I go to Vegas I always plan on going to L.A.X, but never happens. One of these days though, one of these days...who wants to take me and pop this cherry of mine =)

I gave it 4 stars because our room was such a pain in the ass to get to. Had to go up down and all around just to find our room. Now, I think they designed this place like this on purpose as pure entertainment for all us drunk folks! Watching us run around in circles, knocking on wrong doors, passing out in random places. THANKS. 

One thing that I love\/hate about the Luxor is that it is at the end of the Strip. But when you are on the strip at night, Luxor looks so cool! It is this tall, enormous pyramid shaped building with a flashy beam of light shooting from the top. LEGIT! It is like the north star in the sky! So easy to find!

My biggest complaint was the 2nd hand coming through the vents of my bathroom. And at one point there was weed. I didn't mind it, but my Fiance was pissed off. The room is decent and clean. Overall with the room I was pleased.. We were only there to sleep anyways, how special does my room have to look?? I had a view of the parking lot but I also saw the pool so its fine. Also, most importantly was the beautiful sunrise I woke up to every morning, and the beautiful lights i saw before I went to sleep.

Parking was hell because there's only 2 floors..  its a long chilly walk from parking lot to the casino...The elevator was annoying because every time we go up.. I tilt sideways... hmm poor sense of balance.. but still, the elevators aren't straight.

If you don't know, there is easy access to your room.. you don't need to cut through the casino to get to your room. After parking, before you go down the stairs to the casino area, there are rooms on your right or left hand side. Just walk straight down there and go around the corner to get to the elevator. Had we known this earlier, we wouldn't need to cut through the casino in my wet bikini.

I'd stay here again, I don't mind. Too bad it was too cold for the pool... only jumped in once. This place is def better than Circus Circus & Excalibur. Also this was so convenient to all the shows i wanted to watch: Fantasy & Criss Angel. I wanted carrot top but wth he was on vacation the week I came :'[

Also bumped into the comedian from Fantasy in the casino.. HE IS AWESOME! 

FANTASY beats PEEPSHOW! more boobs & more laughs!!!!!!!!! Fantasy was sold out, while Peepshow had many empty seats... You only get glimpses of boobs for a few seconds. Fantasy is HOT! WOOOOOOOO

When we checked in we were greeted by a friendly person behind the counter.  She got the job done.  Nothing spectacular but nothing horrible,  I will say that even waiting in line to check in a guy was soliciting for people to go to a club for that night.  I expect it out on the strip but not while I am waiting in line to check in.  Security should have taken care of the guy.  I thought that was a little tacky but whatever.   Also  the 8 dollar charge for parking.  That to me is kind of a jerk move.  You know we have to park at your hotel if we are staying there.   Charge the people that want to cruise over for the day but don't charge the guests. That would be my suggestion.  I might be able to look past some of the flaws that I will mention later if the parking was free :)  

So on to the room.  Yes they are remodeled.  I never saw a unremodeled room so I cant compare but I can say that the bathrooms were nicely done.  The room we had only had a shower no tub.  Don't know if that's the case for all the rooms but my guest was surprised to only see a shower.  Also housekeeping was nice enough to leave a hair on a hand towel in the bathroom.   Back to the staff in a second.  The AC made a horrific noise every time it shut off.  It woke us up until we figured just keep it to fan setting and it wont shut off.  The sheets smelled like cigarette smoke and the windows were dirty.  remodeled on a budget that's for sure

Now on to the staff.  Housekeeping was terrible at their job as described with the hair on the towel and as we walked down the hallway someone had left a rubber glove on the ground.  I hope it was housekeeping that dropped it.  The cocktail waitresses seemed disenchanted and not happy to be working there.  This is a shout out to Ed the dealer.  Ed was a jerk simply put.  I hated his attitude and the way he talked to multiple guests while I sat his table.

I personally suggest the Tower Premier 1 Bedroom Suites. For the same price you would pay for a simple hotel room at other strip properties, you get over 1200 square foot of living space. I wll say that no hotel is perfect, but when problems arise, the management takes care of addressing the issue.It is on the end of the main part of the strip which offers the convenience of being near NY NY, MGM, Mandalay Bay, and within a 5 minute drive of any of the other main attractions on the strip. I like the convenience, but I also like to get away to serene area when the day is over, and time to get a couple of hours of sleep.

It still remains one of my favorites. I recently visited, and thought I would share some of my experience. 

Pros-
Gambling - the electronic blackjack was surprising loose, banked some good money in 20 minutes and received multiple blackjacks. However, I did bust an inordinate amount of times after awhile (receiving a 10 on a hand of 12). Oh well. 

Clean - smoke smell is almost non existent. Floors were tidy and building as a whole seemed well kept. 

Titanic exhibit - my favorite. They still host the Titanic exhibit (will be moving out soon however) and it's always a must see for me. Bodies is also worth a visit. 

Negatives:

-TIMESHARE SALESMEN - I can't stress this enough. They are extremely pushy and rude. Will literally follow you to get you buy in. They are also annoyingly placed at all the attractions and will peddle their brochures while you stand in line. Seriously - if anyone from Luxor is reading this, put in place a policy for them to stop being so aggressive. I avoided looking up constantly just to try to avoid their attention. 

-Parking - can be a bit challenging unless you are willing to park at the nearby Excalibur.

As for the rest of the hotel and casino, we really didn't take advantage of it much. I think I ate at the deli one late drunken night, tested out the pool on the last day, and saw the Jabbawockeez show. Oh and the food court, ate there a bunch of times. Pretty standard offerings there.",1,0,0

Since I'm a light sleeper, the staff member suggested that the West Wing may be my best bet since its further from the pyramid. I took her suggestion and decided for a room out there. The West wing is nice and quiet! Plus, the decor is modern and quite accommodating. I also like how its so close to the spa and gym. My only grip about the placement is that its so far from everything. It's about  a 5-7 min walk from the west wing to the front lobby. I don't mind the walk but when you're running late for a meeting,  its quite a distance to make the walk. Another perk about Luxor is that its connected to Mandalay Bay.

Being a Mlife gold member, I usually stay at the Mirage, Bellagio and New York New York. Luxor really impressed me with what they had to offer. Being one of the lowest tier hotels in Mlife (next to Excalibur), I'd say it was worth it. But really, all you need is a clean and safe room while you're in Vegas unless you want to splurge a bit. 

All the staff we've encountered were very friendly from the reservations agent to the check out clerk. The hotel lobby was clean and inviting but thank God I didn't have to wait in regular long check in line. Our newly renovated Cleo room on the 22nd floor was a total win. I've been reading reviews about the outdated rooms so I only upgraded for only $24 USD a night. Our beds were comfy, lots of lighting and storage for clothes. The bathroom was ok with the walk in shower but the fan was super loud! 

My favorite spot in the resort was the casino! Lots and lots of options for slot machines, much more than the Mirage where we usually stay. The annoying part are the ticket redemption machines located in odd parts of the casino. There's a connected walk way to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur, so no need to walk outside unless you want to take the free tram that runs till 1 am.

I booked 4 nights at the Luxor in Feb. of 2012 for mid June. When I made the reservation  I paid up front in full. Nice lady told me that I had paid for everything. In addition to booking for 3+ nights, we would get 1 free buffet (for 2 people) on the house. 

Here is where the WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE EVER begins! 

Arrival: get to the Luxor. Check-in line is literally around the whole building - there must have been over 1,000 people in line. Apparently the new 'system' had crashed. 3.5 HOURS later we finally checked in. Got a free drink in line for the 'inconvenience' ...lol, are you serious? No discount? No nothing!?!? Not even a sincere apology. RIDICULOUS! 

Upon checking in - wrong room. We had ordered 2 queens - they had1 king in the system. hmmmm.... strike #2 ... can't even keep a simple room reservation. Another failure of the new 'system'?

Ok, so what about the free buffet we were promised? Oh, I'm sorry sir, we don't have that in our system... WHAT??? Are you kidding me? I actually had to ask for a manager and get heated to get a free buffet comped. (buffet was a joke anyways - good grade dog food) 

Grand Finale! So, looks like you owe us another $120 in fees and taxes... WTF??? Are you people for real??? $15 a day 'resort fee' + $15 in daily taxes. Don't you think you should have TOLD ME THIS WHEN I BOOKED THE ROOM!?!?

We checked in on Friday and the line was long but it went really quick I was pleasantly surprised! We stayed in the pyramid and after reading some of the reviews about the quality of the room I was a little nervous. I was happy to see our king room was clean, had a great view of the mandalay bay, and had a really nice spacious bathroom. The bed was nice and comfy and the room was perfect! I loved the variety of food places that could be found in the pyramid. 
The reason for 3 stars were for a couple different reasons. First we were disappointed to see that they had two smaller areas of the pool closed off on Saturday. It was HOT that day and we found chairs near the closed off areas (word of advice get there right when the pool opens because chairs go quick) and it was inconvenient to have to find a place to stash our belongings near the main pool so we could keep an eye on them when trying to cool off. Then on Saturday night we took our car from valet to head downtown and when we came back that night we noticed the valet was full. We pulled to the drop off area and asked a luxor employee if we could leave out car in valet because we were staying on site, he said we could to just pull around to the valet again and show the valet guy our hotel card.  We did so and when we asked the valet worker if we could leave the car he snapped that it was full. We explained we had talked to another employee who said we could leave it and he asked who and he we showed him and he just said yeah well its change of shift. We ended up parking in self parking on the opposite side of the hotel but it was a little frustrating. The persistence of the staff when it came to promoting cheap show tickets was a little much too.

 Das Zimmer selbst war bereits etwas abgewohnt aber dennoch sauber und sehr geräumig. Beim Füllen der Wanne sollte man jedoch Geduld mit bringen, 10-20 Minuten dauert es schon bis diese gefüllt ist - in anderen Hotels geht dies schneller.

 Einige der Rezensionen hier sprechen von DER ""Körperwelten"" Ausstellung, dies ist so nicht korrekt. Es handelt sich NICHT um die Körperwelten nach Gunther von Hagens sondern die Ausstellung im Luxor unter dem Titel ""Bodies"" ist nur ein Abklatsch.


 Alles in allem ist das Luxor ein typisches Vegas Themen Hotel mit einem eigenen teilweise düsteren Flair. Da es relativ am Ende des Strips gelegen ist macht es sich gut ein Auto zu haben, parken kann man hier wie in den meisten Hotels in Vegas kostenfrei.",0,0,0

The casino floor has always been clean and open and inviting,The lounges have been really cool to chill and drink and the Luxor staff make you feel like home.

The only thing i was not happy with was that the Pyramid Rooms A\/C was bad,it was cooling,but not super cold as in other places i have stayed,and i have to admit,my room was facing the strip (21st floor) right above their statue entrance,and i am thinking that its the old unit that was the problem plus you add the sun beating down on that side of the pyramid,so yea,but you see,i have stayed in other hotels that are facing the same direction and their A\/C was super,so not sure if it was a hit or miss,but next time i stay there i am going to either ask to be facing a different direction or get a tower room.

The rooms are okay,it would be nice to see bettter bedding,but then again the value was worth it,the restroom was basic.

The only thing i did not enjoy was that the corridors were dirty with leftover room service carts and just stuff lying around,it might be me,but it was at all times of the day,not just one specific time.

Anyhow,who goes to check the rooms right? Hahaha

Splurge on a upgraded tower deluxe room. It is worth the additional fee as the rooms are newly renovated and beautiful with very comfortable beds, floor to ceiling windows (I had a view if the Oasis swimming pool), huge soaking tub and separate shower. It feels very Lux. The spa was also reasonably priced.

The pool was family friendly, all ages were welcome. They did serve adult drinks though and music blared over the speakers, the overall vibe was very low key, they weren't catering to the party crowd while I was there which made it relaxing and a nice break from the craziness of the strip. Be prewarned though there is no shaded areas unless you reserve a cabana, I believe they are $100 for the afternoon. 

I am not much of a gambler, so I can't really speak to the games but there appeared to be many different slot matchines, not many tables. The casino lacked pesty time share sharks so that was refreshing as nobody likes to be harassed within their own hotel.

Upon checking in the guy at the front desk offered to ""upgrade me"" to a larger room (by 50sq ft) in the tower building. I asked if the tower was a further walk from the Mandalay and he said ""no"". I then walked to my room to realize it was a SIGNIFICANTLY longer walk then if I had stayed in the pyramid building. 

I immediately called down to the front desk to ask to switch rooms and was told they were not allowing any more room changes tonight (this is at about 6pm). I explained that I just checked in and was misled and would rather have my originally booked room in the Pyramid building - but she was not even the slightest bit friendly in telling me ""too bad, you can check out tomorrow and switch rooms then if you'd like"".

Trying to save some money for my company, Luxor was the cheapest option... in hindsight, I wish I had made my decision to stay elsewhere (Mandalay Bay or Delano.)  Even at a ""discounted"" rate from the conference I was attending, the total was $1500 with varying prices for almost every night; the most expensive being a Tuesday night at around $350!

While travelling to Las Vegas, I received an email very early in the morning with mobile check-in instructions, which I took care of immediately, thinking that within the 11 hours it took to get there, by the time I arrived, the room would be ready.  Check in time is at 3 p.m. and I arrived around 2:30; the check-in line was insane and I still hadn't received my email with the bar-code I needed to scan at the mobile check-in station.  It took another hour and half, so 4:30, until the email came through and I was able to get into my room. 

My real grip with the Luxor isn't the hotel itself, but rather the rooms.  They are extremely outdated and show many signs of wear and tear through the years.  And while the room wasn't filthy, I could see the dust and finger prints on the furnishings and even found an old razor in the shower.  Really?  The beds aren't comfortable, at all, but the pillows weren't bad.  Also, the heating\/cooling system didn't work on high, so it got quite warm in there during the day, especially if I left the blinds open. 

The hotel itself is clean and while there are plenty of staff, nobody was incredibly helpful or friendly, except for the bartender at the pool area, which by the way, closes at 5 p.m. and is way too early in my opinion.  There are a couple of convenience type stores, one of which is open 24 hours, but get ready to dish out some serious cash (I'm sure this goes without saying at any of the hotels on the strip.)  I dined at a couple of restaurants within the hotel itself, which weren't bad, but again, overpriced.

Checked in to the Luxor Hotel and Casino this afternoon.  Long line at registration, but it did move quickly; there was a representative at the front of the line to greet people and she was very personable.  I overheard her talking to the group in front of us about all the different things that the registration clerk would let them know (Buffet's, Show's, etc).  However, our clerk was strictly by the book.  He was very un-personable and we had to pull info our of him.  Not exactly setting a good first impression.  However, he did upgrade us to a tower for free.  

We self parked and walked back to our room.  The parking garage is behind the casino and we had to walk back to the front door just to find our way to our room.  There needs to be a better path to your room from the parking garage.

After we finally made it our room I had to call the front desk to ask where is the ether net cable to log on to the net.  Common sense would put it at the desk in the room but no...it was behind the TV.  Right now I have it stretched across the room so that I can use the net.

When I was on hold for the front desk; I heard a recording about having a refrigerator sent to my room so I called back to inquire about the price...$25 a day.

The Ice Bucket is big enough to fit one bottled water in it and that's all.  So I had to use one of the trash cans as an Ice Bucket.

If you are a germ-a-phob then don't look in the bathroom.  As I was standing next to the toilet I looked up at the vent and notice that it hadn't been cleaned in months (at the least).

It was very very plain and there was basically no Egyptian theme to it.... There was like one pathetic Egyptian painting on the wall and thats it. The beds were very thin and we could easily feel the springs in the mattresses. (The pillows were nice and fluffy though.) The spa was dirty and we had to thoroughly rinse it out before we decided to use it. The ceiling had an ugly stain on it that was very unpleasant to look at whenever we were laying down on the beds. The TV was a small, non-flat screen. There was a second room that consisted of an even smaller TV set and a hideous purple couch. On the plus side, the window next to the spa overlooked part of the strip which was pretty @ night. The bathroom was clean but ugly like the rest of the room. Basically the room sucked. I've stayed at many Best Western's and La Quinta's that are cheaper and nicer than this room, which is sad!! Also, I was being really nitpicky because I knew I was going to yelp about this place, so I checked out the conditions the door handles, doors, and furniture were in. Everything was extremely beat up and chipped. It looks like nothing has ever been fixed or even touched up. The door was dirty and the wallpaper in the bathroom could use some help.

Now to the CASINO. The casino was horrible and outdated. The dealers were all dicks too. I watched dealer after dealer treat people rudely at the roulette and black jack tables. It was sad. The crowd consisted of either trashy looking people or old people. I like old people, but I don't picture them when I think of an exciting time in Vegas! The casino was super ugly and made me depressed because I love gambling and wanted to do it in a beautiful vegas atmosphere. You will not find a beautiful casino at the Luxor. They need to redo it.

She definitely represents the Luxor in a positive manner. Our room had 2 queen beds and it was clean and ready. The only issue I had was the valet.  I asked where we should go and he ran off. I waited for him to return and my daughter grabbed our luggage and we ended up flagging another valet person down. He did apologize for us being left and directed us. I would stay here again and the kids had plenty to do.,0,0,0

Watch your card charges for  obscure, deceptive fees. When booking on Priceline, adding additional $50 to price paid for resort charges and parking, tips not included. 

The pool, gym, and hot tub close early and open late. For business travelers, this leaves little opportunity to relax and get in a good work out. This really sucks, given the mandatory $29 resort fee on top of the parking fees and taxes, resulting in double the quoted online price to stay here, not counting tips.

The $29 mandatory resort fee (per the check-in clerk) is for the pool, hot tub, fitness center, and wifi, none of which I was able to use. Valet parking costs $13 (self parking was full).
The beds were lumpy and miserable. The furniture was good quality, but worn and threadbare. My room featured a genuine 1990s popcorn ceiling that was waterstained and coming down in the corners.

Every single employee from the Valet attendant to the maintenance workers riding in the elevator were very friendly and helpful. We used valet several times and they were great. We got there too early to check in so we used the bell hops to hold our luggage for us until we checked in and then when we checked out, they held our luggage until we were ready to leave that afternoon. Nothing was lost or stolen. 

We ended up checking in an hour early and we're not charged early check in. We stayed in a pyramid deluxe room on the 14th floor and it was great...Very clean and nice! The ceiling above the shower was peeling but that wasn't a problem to us. There is a safe in the closet to keep all our valuables in it so it was nice not having to with about them. The ac worked so well we had to turn it off it because we got so cold. When it was off we could hear a little of the noise from the first floor but it wasn't bad. Yeah there isn't wifi in the rooms or cell service in general but if you can't live a couple days with out it, that's sad. My phone did get some signal close to the window. 

Saturday morning the cleaning lady just walked right in without knocking and we were standing there in our underware...little awkward but she apologized and said she'd come back later. 

The inclinatior is fun to ride. You can tell you are going at an angle and if you look through the slits in the door you can see out. They should put air conditioning in them because it gets really stuffy when it's full of people. 

We visited the Titanic and Bodies exhibits and both were great. If you get both, it's cheaper. 

The Luxor is at the far end of the strip...far away from everything... so you end up doing a LOT of walking. bring comfy shoes. 
 
And all the time share people in suits that bombard you every time you walk through the hotel (they're in other casinos too) aren't as annoying as people on here say. Just keep walking and don't make eye contact with then and they don't bother you. If you give them a second to talk to you, you're stuck. Don't be tempted by the offers of free tickets they dangle in front of you. It's a trap. Only one lady was super aggressive and almost pounced on me and I said a firm ""NO"" and she slunk away. So just ignore them and they back off. Simple.

The pools were big, the weather was perfect, and the drinks were flowin!! 7 bucks for a beer I guess is expected in vegas. Chris Angel usually performs here but he was on vacation not that we wanted to see him anyways but since he was gone we got 25% off Cirque De Soleil ""KA"" which is what we wanted to see anyway. (I mean we would have if we took the time to look at the flyer in our room, oh well we're dumb) One con was that we asked for a non smoking room and we got a non smoking room but it smelled as if someone had been smoking their the night before.

The $10.95\/day additional service charge irked us, cause they never tell you about it beforehand. The room was decent; a bit dark, but was large and did the job. Bathroom was adequate, large shower was a plus, although our shower backed up our second day there. We asked for it to be fixed, only to have it back up even worse the next day. After the second fix, no more problems. We're not incredibly picky and didn't spend a lot of time in the room so that's probably why we were willing to let some of the minor annoyances slide. 

The Bodies exhibit is pretty awesome; my gf is a medical professional and was thrilled. Tix are a bit pricey, but you can easily spend 2-3 hours in the exhibit. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon if you don't want to gamble. As everyone else has said, the design of the hotel is definitely unique and quite a sight to behold when you first walk in. Since I'm a huge gearhead I spent the better part of the first day trying to figure out how the damn inclinators\/elevators work. Pretty cool. 

The More buffet was mediocre; breakfast and lunch at the Pyramid Cafe were surprisingly good and reasonably priced.

Don't for a second think that it's a four star hotel...not even close. I think Motel 6 would have been cleaner.  But let me start from the beginning....I hemmed and hawed for nearly a week online searching for the best place to stay on our honeymoon.  Based on the 4 star status and good reviews I saw online, it sounded like the best place for a suite with a jacuzzi, which was specifically what we were looking for.  I was ready to book a room with MGM or Bellagio, but became convinced after reading good reviews that we'd get more from our money with a Celebrity Suite at Luxor, which sounded really cool and looked amazing from the pictures....so we booked the room. 

We get there and immediately get accosted by time share people in the lobby, which was really tacky and obnoxious. And they made it sound like they wanted to give us comps and gifts because we were getting married, never mentioning until the very end of the whole schtick that it was a time share thing. I was pissed. Then we check in. We are on the 15th floor in the Celebrity Suite. Get into the elevator and it's my fiance and another lady. Immediately the elevator sounded and felt like it wasn't working right, really rickity and scary. No big deal, I tell myself, it has to go up on an angle. Okay.  Then as it's going toward the 15th floor we hear a big crash sound and it stops abruptly and drops down at least a floor and bounces, getting stuck. It scared the living CRAP out of us. The lady grabs my fiance and screams. We all think we're going to DIE.  The elevator is stuck and we sit there bouncing back and forth with it feeling like it's about to crash any second.  My fiance hits a button and we drop down to 7th floor and the door opens. We get the hell out of that thing fast!  We're all seeing our lives pass before us...I'm thinking we're going to die before we ever have a chance to get married.  My fiance, who is a very tough guy compared to most, said it was the scariest thing he has ever experienced in his life. He thought he would die.

So.....after that, we are ready to run from the place but decide just for curiosity sake to check out our room. We go in and WOW, what a shock. It was smaller than the pictures and description made it look and the most dramatic issues were the SMELL and the horrific stains on the carpeting, along with areas of the carpet that were pulled up. Totally disgusting. I mean seriously.....I've stayed at Motel 6 that was cleaner and nicer.  At that point we just laughed and thought we must be on a show like Punk'd or something. It must be some kind of a joke.  

We went down to the front desk to tell our story to the manager.  I explain to him about the scary incident on the elevator as our number one issue....his response?  ""We haven't had any other complaints"".  Oh, okay, then it must be our imagination....  I tell him he needs to have someone check out that elevator as something is WRONG with it and please address it. I could tell he wasn't interested in doing that.
Nice.

Then I explain my dissatisfaction with the room and all he can say is....""what would you like me to do?"".  Um..........  At that point, I told him we just wanted to get the hell out of there and give our money back!  He did so without ANY attempt to fix things or give good customer service.  Unbelievable.  The attitude was almost as if he's hear this so many times he's tired of dealing with it and just immediately refunds people and gets them out.  Which is probably the case.

We quickly took a cab over to Bellagio, which is where we should have stayed in the first place, and had a wonderful time there.  It was like going from hell to heaven.",5,3,2

What a crappy place! First off the AC was not that strong and the room was tiny... to even be called a suite... are you kidding me???

For full reviews and pics go to http:\/\/www.kats9lives.com\/2008\/08\/fallen-from-grace.html

The only thing that was going for the suite rooms was that you get Bath and Body Works condiments.  If you ask for more then you get the same stuff everyone gets.  I have to say that the walls are super thin too.  We got a really good deal for the weekend, lie $200 a night.  You would THINK that it would be a decent room but it was pure crap.  If it wasn't for a friend who annoyingly whined that she had to stay somewhere nicer with a pool then we wouldn't have bothered to come here.  I just came a week prior and I rather pay 1\/5th of the price to stay in a crappy motel.  It's about the same in my opinion! At least the walls there weren't as thin as here!

This was at least entertaining but a lil disturbing as well.  One morning I woke up hearing my friend giggling and I asked what's going on.  Apparently the people next door are going at it or he hired a 20 minute and she will be in your room call girl.  We all bursted out laughing.  Later that day it happened again and my friend was so entertained.  She was in the shower and missed the show.  She glued her head to the wall to listen.  That's what they call a suite huh?  Your neighbors can hear everything and have a laugh about it too.  Look for better deals and go to the Mirage! It's a lot better! If you have the dough, I recommend the Venetian or Bellagio.",0,0,0

I had to go to the check in counter THREE TIMES before finding my room because the incompetent staff had given me completely WRONG directions. Mind you we were hauling all of our shit around this crappy place for 45 minutes Trying to find our room

The elevator I was directed to had NO INDICATION of what it was.. Nor admist the construction was there any indication of a ""detour"" seriously?

PROS:  
1)  The room rates are very reasonable for what you're getting.  If you're on a budget and don't want to stay in a dumpy place, try Luxor.  
2)  The beds used to be uncomfortably hard.  They are much better now.  
3)  Rooms are clean and comfortable with a decent amount of space.
4)  Nice bathrooms
5)  The inclinators are fun to experience at least once in your life.
6)  Good housekeeping service.
7)  Concierge was pleasant and helpful.

CONS:
1)  Needs updating, and the walls of the atrium look like they could use a coat of paint or at least a thorough cleaning.
2)  The frickin' time share people who accost you at every corner.
3)  Not as many in-room amenities as there used to be, and the shampoo bottles aren't cute little pyramids anymore.
4)  Not many restaurant choices.
5)  It's getting kinda sad...  their little shopping center has hardly any shops anymore.  
6)  The toilets are poorly designed -- the toilet paper doesn't always flush down!

In the film ""Up in the Air"", George Clooney's character says something like ""Luxor?  That place is a s**thole.  Nobody stays there.""

So, I didn't really have what you would say ""a lot of time to spend there."" But let me tell you, that one night was GREAT! Before I stayed here, I read the reviews here on Yelp and there were SO MANY bad reviews that I was deathly afraid to stay here. I think I know why there is bad reviews. Let me explain my story.

GOOD PARTS: 

So, I checked in at around 1-1:30 pm. There was a little wait. Possibly 10-15 minutes. I think this was a GREAT time to check in because I went back down to the lobby the next 2 hours and there was a HUGE line. So, I suggest if you can, coming in at around the time I did. The line moved fast, checking in was perfect and everything went well.

GET A ROOM IN THE TOWERS. All of the bad reviews come from staying in the Pyramid rooms. The reason why is because the Pyramid rooms are not renovated, old, gross. Even though The Towers are not exactly in the big Luxor (they are right next door), IT IS WORTH IT. My room was clean, there was a walk in shower, big, spacious, PERFECT. 

The lobby, room, hotel overall was very CLEAN.

SO MUCH TO SEE. Take a lot of pictures. It's pretty amazing when you walk in. 

BAD PARTS:
So, in the room, when I went to turn on the TV, the remote wasn't working. The TV worked, but not the remote. My guess is that there were dead batteries...? Anyways, I call the front desk and tell them my remote isn't working. So, a guy comes up in the next 15 minutes and gives us a remote. Turns out, that remote didn't work EITHER! He's standing in the doorway so I tell him, then he goes ""Ok, we'll get you a new one."" Well, we leave the room. 2 hours later, there's a new remote sitting on the bed. We go to check it. IT DOESN'T WORK. They never came back to check or anything. So overall, a remote isn't a BIG deal, but I still think they should have fixed it. It was a very minor problem.

There were a lot of people working at the Luxor coming up to you and asking, ""Are you staying here for another night?"" ""Do you want free tickets?"" ""I have some free tickets for this show. Come over here, etc.."" See, now I'm 17 and this is only my 2nd time to Vegas, so I don't really know if people in other hotels do this. It did get a little annoying, but whatever you do, if you here people are giving away free tickets, DON'T TAKE THEM. I've heard of people doing that and getting a totally different thing then what was expected which gives this hotel bad reviews. So, if people are coming up to you, just say no and walk away.

The shower pressure could have been better (I'm a little picky with shower pressures. I like A LOT of pressure).

The bed to me was a little too soft for my taste. I kind of sinked in when I sat in it.

The lobby was very noisy but I mean, what do you expect? It's Las Vegas. (Again, little picky things.)
------------------
OVERALL:
Very good stay. The reason it gets 4 out of 5 stars is because of what happened with that remote situation and just little picky things here and there. It does have some things to work on, but listen to my advice and don't pass this hotel up! It's really a big, beautiful hotel. TRUST ME!",1,0,0

He went on to try to scold me and when he wrote out and made it like I was such a burden I took his name and opted to take nothing . As anyone who reads my reviews knows I do my best to be fair , I worked in customer service and management for over 12 years almost 15 in service period and the fact they gave me such a hard time over a current promotion when I clearly was not being difficult nor was I even trying to get something because I messed up because if you see my uploaded photos you will see I did have that promo applied .

Over scolding me like a child instead of wanting to help me try to fix a obvious system error they have guaranteed I will not buy one ppv movie nor order room service or even stay and drink at any mgm property because I was made to feel I don't matter . So I now regret leaving my credit card on file for incidentals . It's a shame really because my kids are going to love this room but they guaranteed I'm heading elsewhere in the future

We opted to stay in the pyramid section, and it was the biggest let down from the interior.  All the tones are muted, the casino was painfully small, it had little to no attractions, nor any good food (avoid the buffet at Mor!) I found it so disappointing that the Luxor had absolutely no luxury to it. It just seemed depressing.

The check in process was a bit of a pain as this hotel charged a ""resort fee"" that was $30 for 2 nights. Had I known prior I would have picked a nicer place with that extra money. A heads up! this fee is not advertised on any 3rd party site (expedia, travelocity...), so be sure to budget this before you go.

The layout of the hotel is horrific. There was only one way to get to my room. Each time I entered and exited I was lead through a dark maze of dust colored carpets to an elevator that often didn't function, and felt like a rickety roller coaster when it did operate.

Not too bad of a room - decently sized: a king sized bed, a living space area with a small table, a fridge, a small TV, a mid-sized bathroom with a shower and a jacuzzi tub right next to the bed. The bed itself wasn't too bad - I think I've stayed in places with better beds, but it served its purpose. I did like the pillows. Also, the Luxor was pretty well connected to the rest of the suites through walkways to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay (very good for our Fleur de Lys reservations). I think that was about it for the goods...

Unfortunately, there were a lot of things that didn't impress me much:
- Old wallpaper - you can totally see where there USED to be paintings hanging on the wall =\/
- The view - maybe we got an off side, but we didn't get to see much of the strip from our room.
- No sofa - with a suite, don't you usually get a sofa?
- The fridge - we didn't use it, but it was placed atop a rolling cart. wtf?
- The bathroom sink - the cold water handle was broken. If you didn't turn it correctly with enough pressure, you could potentially not shut off the water again.
- Towel service - Oddly enough, there were no signs about keeping your towels. In this day and age, to have a huge hotel clean towels every day and not give your guest the option to be a little more green is VERY DISAPPOINTING.
- Spamming - Right when we walked into the hotel we were accosted by folks trying to sell us time shares. Granted, they were all over the MGM properties, it's a bit annoying to run into those kinds of people every time we walked in and out of our hotel. Also, they called us at 9:30am to advertise a show. REALLY NOW??? 9:30am SATURDAY MORNING, in VEGAS.... have you no respect?!

The room could've used a bit of remodeling, but our stay there overall wasn't too horrible. I think the place is starting to show its age and needs a bit of remodeling, but apparently they're working on it as some of the signage says.

Now is 3:50 A.M... I still can NOT sleep because I'm waiting for housekeeping. By the way...I called housekeeping like 30mins ago. One manager is waiting for them with me together about 15mins...

Bad experience!! Our company booked 20+ room this time for business trip. EIGHT 8 nights! How can we stay in this kind of hotel for 8 nights... what should I do for next Seven days!!?? We come to Las Vegas every year during this time. I think we should change to another hotel in the future.

Beim 'garantierten' Check-In um 15 Uhr wurde uns gesagt, dass das Zimmer noch nicht fertig sei und wir uns noch eine halbe Stunde gedulden müssten. Die Koffer konnten wir allerdings schon am Bell Desk abgeben und per Telefonanruf später aufs Zimmer bringen lassen.
Die halbe Stunde haben wir genutzt, um uns einen ersten Überblick zu verschaffen. Das Luxor ist riesengroß und wenn man nicht aufpasst, biegt man einmal falsch ab und ist an einem völlig falschen Ort. Im Luxor gibt es diverse Restaurants und Bars, von denen wir nur das 'More' ausprobiert haben. Dort konnte man für 30$ pro Person den ganzen Tag so viel Essen, wie man wollte. Das Essen selbst war ok, die Auswahl war riesig; abends konnte man aus italienischen, amerikanischen, mexikanischen und asiatischen Gerichten auswählen.
Unser Zimmer im Luxor war geräumig und gut ausgestattet. Wir haben uns dort sehr wohl gefühlt. Das Personal war freundlich und hilfsbereit.
Negativ aufgefallen sind uns die diversen Stände, an denen man Tickets für Shows buchen konnte. Im Endeffekt wollten uns die Verkäufer nur einen Ausflug zum neuen Luxor aufschwatzen, die Tickets hätten wir dann rabattiert am Ende der Veranstaltung bekommen. Wenn man an der 'Kaffeefahrt' nicht teilnehmen wollte, bekam man auch keine Tickets (nur die Auskunft, sich an das jeweilige Boxoffice zu wenden).

-I like how the hotel is smaller meaning you don't have to walk so long to get from the entrance to the elevators to the food court like other hotels can be such a maze sometimes. Everything is centrally located inside this pyramid.
-Pricing. Luxor is very inexpensive compared to other hotels on the strip.
-Decent clean room with a clean bathroom and comfy beds

Cons:
-Rude customer service to my friend multiple times at the concierge when setting up our two rooms.
-it rained during our stay in Vegas and water was leaking into the room. The curtains were wet and the ground where some of our stuff was wet too. Called to complain and nothing was done.
-Floor set up for the hotel is weird. I get it's a pyramid and all the rooms are on the outer edges. But there's only ONE elevator on one corner of the pyramid making it a long walk for rooms on the opposite corner. Can they have two elevators running at opposite ends at least?
-Elevators are creepy! They make a loud whistling rattling noise every time. It gives off a cheap run down vibe and creeps out your guests!

Luxor has been around for awhile and I think it's time they are due for some renovations. The overall Egyptian concept of staying in a pyramid is still great but can be done a lot better! One of the cool things can be less creepy glass elevators where you can see yourself moving diagonally across each level to get to your room. Just my 2 cents on how Luxor can feel more like a luxury hotel..",3,0,1

Unfortunately, the reality of actually being in a pyramid room was sad and nothing like my fantasies of living it up like Egyptian royalty.  Luxor cannot compete with the big luxury hotels like Wynn, Belagio, or Mandalay Bay- its just a little too old and tired for that.

So, let's start with check-in - as someone else has said, if you are trying to check in anywhere close to 3 pm, you are doomed to stand in a long, long line.  It took a good thirty minutes to check in and while their lobby looks great with huge, faux statues, there is nowhere to sit down if you're waiting for the check-in process.  When you do finally get your room keys, its a long, confusing walk through the casino to the inclinators.  The weird angle of the inclinators throw off your balance, not violently, just subtly, like you're drunk.

The rooms are okay, but not anything exciting.  We had a great view of Mandalay Bay though.  What really annoyed me about the room was that there was no full-length mirror- how is a girl supposed to check what she looks like before she walks out?  And the towels smelled like burnt toast...yeechhh....  

Overall, the Luxor has started to feel more like a cheap motel than a hotel on the Vegas Strip.  Its a good thing that the Mandalay Bay hotel is just a tram ride away because its much more fun being there.",2,2,3

I even asked if we could get an upgrade--upgraded to a room to the west towers near the pool. AND to top that off he was able to waive our resort fee! By then, I was swooned. 

The room: The room was exactly how it was pictured in their site. Linens were clean, bathrooms cleaned, beds nice, and most importantly i saw no evident of bed bugs. Quite spacious i must add. Although no fridge or anything like that but the ice machine was near by. 

The only downside was us getting deactivated for our  room keys---that was the worst thing that happened lol. Other than that everything was good! I would totally come back--free or not.

I told him I was charged to a king size room since I had to pay $30 @ arrival & he said he would look into a credit but nothing happened.
We checked out early.

I notified customer service relations & they asked me what could've been better and I listed below.

1) hire more  Front office staff to accommodate a number of people on holiday weekends.
2) Hire sufficient staff to accommodate public needs of concierge & bell men 
3)  guarantee the rooms that were ordered in the reservation, or keep your word on what was promised.

The casino is lame and doesn't have a cool buzz like the other ones do. There are no really cool clubs in the hotel. The shows are pretty lame - c'mon, who wants to see Carrot Top? The guy is so annoying. And there's the topless show Fantasy  - that they advertise this thing so much that you'd think they would pay you money to go see it. Rooms are okay but nothing special (I was in one of the towers) but the AC was so weak. I was sweating the whole time since I had the AC on high but it barely felt like it was on.

The few good things about this place: (1) central to the Vegas Strip on the South side - very near Excalibur, Mandalay bay, and MGM, (2) it's directly connected by a mini mall to Mandalay Bay which is a really nice casino, and (3) you usually can get the Luxor at a lower price compared to other casinos. 

Bottom line: Luxor - yawn. Stay here for the convenience and price. Don't stay here if you are expecting to impress anyone.",1,1,1

Every hotel charges you a resort fee in addition to the regular hotel charge.

First and foremost, this hotel is awesome! We stayed in a Pyramid room on the 6th floor and the room was ice cold, we actually had to turn off the AC at night because it was freezing.  Bed is super comfortable, nice spacious bathroom, lots of drawers and a nice wardrobe cabinet. Customer service is A+ they really go above and beyond to make you feel welcome upon arrival.  Use the email Check in if you can, I did and only waited in line for 2 minutes for key.  The normal check in lines were huge and looked like more than an hour wait.  There were only 2 small things that were less than perfect, the elevators and the walk to the car.  Elevators are always full and sometimes long waits.  The foot bridge to the parking lot is not air conditioned and the walk is very long to the car in the heat.  These 2 things are not deal breakers, I can overlook them both and definitely stay here again.

At first I was excited to stay in this hotel that my friend booked until I looked at the reviews. Because of the reviews, I went in knowing exactly what to expect. The reviews were all pretty spot on. Found a little water damage in some of the rooms and each room smelled like terrible air freshener. It appeared that they were pumping air freshener through the vents to cover up the cigarette smoke from the casino on the first floor. It was TERRIBLE. My friend has asthma and had two asthma attacks while she was there. We spent some time at the hospital because of the lack of air quality in that hotel and because of the mold. We changed rooms 3 times. Each time there was something wrong with the room we moved to. The third room had a clogged sink (GROSS). The bathroom, however, was the nicest part of the room.The bed sheets and pillows always had some weird brown stain baked into it. 

There were three positives of staying in this hotel (hence the 1 star rating I gave - I think they deserve at least 1 star...even if it is the default minimum):

1. The hotel has great shows (Criss Angel\/Blue Man Group), bars, and a club. The lobby and everything BUT the rooms were nice. 
2. There were no bed bugs in each of the rooms we stayed in. I checked thoroughly. 
3. The gym was nice! The free weights went up to 100lbs and they provided free water bottles and towels. 

Bottom line: I will NEVER ever stay here again. I don't care how cheap the rates are. We stayed in the East Towers.  Our tub never got cleaned. I decided to never use it. I heard the rooms in the pyramid are even worse!

Also, the check-in lines are insane! Stay here if you don't care much about cigarette smoke (other hotels have casinos but the cigarette smell isn't as evident in other hotels), if you don't care about quality rooms, and if you don't care about customer service as much. Customer service wasn't the worst but it also wasn't the best. The hotel is also all the way on the very end of the strip.

What a mistake! I usually stay at the Wynn when I go to Vegas and recently we stayed at the Mandalay Bay and thought that hotel was a let down, but compared to the Luxor, MB is more than spectacular! You really cannot compare Luxor to MB, much less the Wynn. What you can compare it to is probably a Motel 6 (although I've probably seen Motel 6's in better shape). 
This place is so seedy and gross. We got a non-smoking room, however when we turned on the light\/ventilation switch in the bathroom, smoked just filled up the room.

A few pieces of mismatched furniture were scattered in the room, but there were vast sections that were empty, and not in a ""tasteful and stylish"" way, more like a ""why the heck is all this space there, it looks lost and scary"" way.

I suppose if what they wanted was to get us OUT of the room and into the casino, they succeeded, but we didn't gamble in the Luxor hardly at all so they probably didn't succeed in the way they hoped.  The bed was comfortable enough, and the bathroom was large but without sufficient towels.  And what was up with the huge klunky old CRT televisions in the suite??  Are they planning to upgrade to the late 20th century any time soon?  The whole place seems sad and dark and tired, we couldn't wait to leave the Luxor each morning to go somewhere else to gamble.  (And if they think Carrot Top is a draw, they should think again, we made ""oh barf"" faces every time we caught sight of an ad for his show.)

For the price we didn't complain, but we won't be staying at the Luxor again.  Unless it's for free.  :-)",0,1,0

But my family flew in from China, I can't exactly afford the Venetian, and I figured staying inside a pyramid would be a great experience. That much was correct. A very friendly agent named Rich gave us rooms on the 23rd floor, which was a fabulously dizzying view. I paid the small amount for a basic upgrade, which seems to be worth it, though I have no basis for comparison. Room was clean, bathroom was basic but also clean and very acceptable. Would definitely stay here again. A lot of other hotels have better rooms, but who goes to Vegas to sleep?",4,3,1

Very spacious, comfortable bed, and I loved the Jacuzzi in the room. However the room didn't have a coffee machine. The Luxor is one of the smaller hotels on the strip. The restaurants at the Luxor are so-so, definitely not what you'd expierence at Ceaser's Palace or the Venetian. I prefer the private cabana pool at the Luxor over the public pool, it's a lot less crowded and has few children.",0,0,0

Luckily, Luxor still has enough class in it to make it relevant in this bustling town of new dreams and fading glories.

DECO\/DESIGN: 3 stars

Like most of Vegas, this place isn't much to look at during the day. The crust of paved walkways and gawky Egyptian facades fill the day light. However, once the night settles in, all that is left is a pyramid etched from black glass, smooth and reflective of the calm before the storm. Indeed, with light escalated into the heavens, this is one of the most iconic attractions on the Strip.

The interior is fairly impressive. At this time of the year, the second floor is mired with large quantities of construction and overhaul. The place should look impressive once again once they finish all the building. However, in the area that holds remnants of the Titanic, anatomical bodies, and ""comedy"" (does anyone find Carrot Top funny?), the place is still a sight to behold. A hotel that actually contorts to the shape of a pyramid? Still impressive to see from the inside.

The bottom floor is where the casino lies and it is expansive. Although showing its age on the outskirts of the main floor, the place still buzzes with patrons. The music from various live bands play in swells in the background, and the lighting is never too harsh. However, the grand ancient sculptures at the entrance and obelisks all around the interior is a oxymoronic way of reminding you of both the theme, and the age of this casino & hotel.

CLUB SCENE\/PEOPLE: 4 stars

With the introduction and growing popularity of LAX (the nightclub), it's easy to see lots of eye candy fill this place once the night gets late enough. With beautiful people pouring out from the desert and into this pyramid, the place transitions from the older crowd\/tourists in the morning-afternoon to young and restless at night.

ROOMS: 2 stars

Although the modern marvel that is Luxor is amazing to behold, the consequences are also obvious. The rooms are musky, never taking out the stench of smoke and use. They aren't as lavish as some of the newer hotels, and with each level being just over the busy casino floor, staying in the lower floors can definitely attribute to insomnia from noise.

CONCLUSION

Luxor is one of those casinos that are better to meander through, and gamble for an hour, or to come to club. As far as staying as a hotel guest, it might be better to search for other options. The slots are loose compared to some of the higher end casinos (Palazzo, Venetian), but you quickly grow weary of the casino floor after an hour or two. Come here to play, but not to stay.",2,1,4

It was a great hotel for us. Our room was a pyramid spa suite and we had a hot tub overlooking the strip.

The decor was a mish mash of Egyptian artifacts and motorcycles. The buffet was the only downside. It was way overpriced for what you could get. 

We haven't been back to Vegas since, but we do plan on it one day. We would stay there again.",2,0,1
