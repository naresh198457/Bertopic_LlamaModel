Arguably,this is the finest Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. (I am not counting the over-priced tourist traps at Strip hotels-I care too much for the health of my lungs to venture inside). El Dorado has a lovely interior and lots of free parking...the latter courtesy of the huge ""Gentlemen's"" Club adjacent to it. Actually the security around the place is formidable,so there should be no worries about your safety or that of your vehicle in the otherwise seedy area.
 The dining experience was scrumptious: easily the finest guacamole-prepared table side-that I have found north of the Rio Grande. I did the Tropical Mahi,my companion the Salmon...both brilliant. Also had an authentic Mexican soup with pork that was wonderful. The deserts-especially the flan-recipe courtesy of the chef's grandmother was sensational. Lots of gaudy adjectives here...but the food is truly deserving of them,and the prices were equitable. The only other Mexican restaurant in Vegas close to this level is Mundo,but I prefer the warmer atmosphere of this place. I shall return.",3,1,2

We went for lunch and the food is AMAZING! We didn't come in expecting too much, but was pleasantly surprised with the friendly and fast service.

We got the tableside guac - which was yummy! We  also ordered the beef empanadas and they were really good.

Our entrees were beef enchiladas and the carnitas street tacos. The quality of the food here is amazing! Our servers kept checking in on us and made the whole experience memorable.

Their drinks here are nice and stiff too if you opt to get a margarita ( pineapple).

They have 50% off for locals on Mondays - so check em' out! Their executive chef - Paco is super friendly! I wish more restaurants were like them! It is truly a gem!

I used to adore coming to El Dorado as I have always loved the food and the service until recently. They have this new lady called Maria who is HORRIFIC!!!!!  She is the craziest person I have ever seen. We complained about a piece of metal in our food to Maria and after we showed her, she called us liars!!!! And then when we asked to see the piece of metal again so we could take a picture, She threw it away and acted as if we put it in there ourselves. This used to be my favorite restaurant but if they keep someone like Maria, I will never be back.  I cannot believe Maria took that piece of 
metal, disregarded it, and she did nothing to remedy the situation. I hear she is a manager. Wow, just wow! With someone like that, I can see this place declining in sales. Good luck with Maria El

Been coming here for months and one of the first crews to do so. Then, this place got popular I guess. We tried getting a table for two at 6:30pm and the hostess let a group budge in front of us possibly for the last table. We were then told that they've been ""booked for a week"" and were refused service. I think I've had enough of this place and the problems associated with it, time to find a new spot. Even when we do have reservations, it seems to take them forever to clear a table and we wind up waiting 30 minutes or more. Heading to Rollin Smoke down the street!

Dropping my review to 1-star after noticing I'm a victim of a tipping scam at this restaurant. My bill from 04-29-2015 was $24.86 and I left a $6.00 tip making my total $30.86. Upon checking my statement, it looks like the waiter decided to write himself a $60.00 tip instead!!! I am furious right now as my credit card statement shows that I was charged not $30.86, but $84.86 instead!!!

I've been here at least ten times now and I have to say, pleased 90% of the time. The only time that I wasn't happy involved the AVN convention having booked the entire place out and El Dorado not having space for us. 

In general, every item on the menu is great. My favorite is the fajitas, all different meats. The guacamole is a must get for your chips, and the margaritas are pretty amazing too. I think the only item I didn't like from here was the enchiladas.

And everything is organic and GMO free!",4,0,0

I have a few food restrictions (low carb) and they were more than accommodating of substitutions.  Their, at the table, guacamole was amazing, you can add ingredients as they make it.  Service was VERY attentive.  The manager, I believe her name is Martine,a very lovely woman came to our table and made sure everything was up to standards. She even had the hostess come over and take numerous pictures of us as we celebrated with our camera.  Our whole group was thoroughly impressed with the food and atmosphere.  Prices were comparable to other areas in town to eat. I checked out their menu on line before we went.

First, let's discuss the location: it's RIGHT next to the strip club...like, in the same building.  This is amazing.  Amazingly hilarious.  Did you know that the dancers order from El Dorado and they deliver to their dressing room?  Amazing.

The food is on point and very affordable.  Less than strip prices, more than a taco shop - it's *just right.*  They USED to have half off for locals every Monday, but now that's a thing of the past. :( 

Their margaritas are great - no stock sweet and sour, everything is made in house.  The carne asada is yum, the lettuce wrapped tacos are surprisingly delicious and filling, and their trio of salsas is SO legit.

It's attached to a strip club, and it's not abundantly clear where the restaurant entrance is. There are parking lots on either side of the building, and my taxi dropped me off at the one opposite the restaurant so it took a bit of searching. The restaurant is pretty nice on the inside. Service wise, my server was nice but working the cleavage and throwing out a lot of ""baby"" and ""hun"". Seems the strip club vibe has bled over...

The chips and salsa were OK. None of the three salsas were particularly tasty. I wanted to order the guacamole but was eating alone and it was $16. $16? Seriously? I wonder how many avocados they use...

I got the Carne Asada burrito, and while the flavors were spot-on, it came out at room temperature. Could've been awesome if it was actually hot but was almost cold by the time I finished.

Not a bad meal, but probably not worth leaving the strip. Somehow doubt this is the best Mexican food Vegas has to offer.",0,0,0

The two things that stick out in my mind are as follows:

1. The bar tender gave me a free drink for the few minutes we sat at the bar waiting on a table to open up.

2. I went with two friends. Their food was brought out in reasonable timing. My food was brought out so much later that they were both finished eating. The waiter stopped by a few times, he was definitely very busy. But never let me know they were understaffed in the kitchen or to just give me a heads up he hadn't forgotten.
Just after we asked for the check, someone finally brought my food out.

The food was definitely 5 stars, as everyone else seems to agree.

The name sounds like a strip club where a fallen NBA star might be caught by paparazzi. But it isn't. (It's only next to one, apparently.) I went there because I was looking for tacos on Yelp, this place popped up, and it was located on Sammy Davis Jr. Dr. 

I really wanted to do a review from Sammy Davis Jr. Dr. (How cool is that for an address? Can you imagine seeing that return address on your Christmas card?)

Moravian pendants suspended from the ceiling? Red walls? Naugahyde banquettes? What's not to love? It's how I imagine Vegas used to be back in the day. 

And the food was good, too. Local, sustainable, and non-gmo are not attributes I usually associate with Mexican food; but yes, it's good to have a delicious alternative that doesn't sacrifice taste. I'd never had an organic strawberry margarita before, but I'm a believer. 

And the flan? I don't like flan. But everyone was right. This place is different. It has a much firmer, denser texture that is very pleasing and doesn't feel like a mouthful of separated yogurt. I'm believer.

Our waiter was the rudest most foul-mooded server I've ever encountered.  We were nothing but friendly and I honestly can't think of why he would be so rude except for the fact that we used Living Social (or Groupon, I can't remember which), coupons to save some money.  We brushed it off, but over the course of the meal it became almost awkward when we would ask for another cocktail or whatever else. The chef\/owner came out to check on us. He was extremely friendly and kind.  We told him, kindly, as we thought he would like to know, that it seemed our waiter was in much less than a happy mood to be serving us. The chef seemed genuinely concerned and offered to give us two free flan desserts. We thanked him sincerely. He asked us to return and to spread the word about the restaurant and tell our other colleagues to come out to enjoy a meal.  Upon receiving our bill we noticed that we were charged for one of the flan's.  It was strange and awkward and at that point we just paid without saying anything further and left.  

With regards to the food... It wasn't memorable. Not bad, not great. There was a man singing for entertainment of the guests, as many restaurants have, who was very awkward.  We were one of two small groups in the restaurant and he was singing his own acoustic, silly versions of pop songs like Britney Spears' ""Hit Me Baby One More Time."" It totally didn't go with the cantina atmosphere of the restaurant and it was so loud and honestly a bit obnoxious.  It was funny at first, but then just... annoying. We didn't complain. We smiled, we applauded, we engaged with him when he engaged with us via the microphone from across the restaurant.  

I never write a place off due to one rude server who may have just been having a bad night. (Granted, he seemed to be very friendly with a couple of local gals having a drink at the bar.) Anyways, I don't think I would ever return here being that the food was average, the service was far below average, we were charged for an ""on-the-house"" dessert that was intended to ""make up for"" the bad service, and the musician providing the tunes for the night did not fit the vibe of the restaurant... at. all.",2,0,0

First off, this restaurant is NEXT TO the Sapphire gentlemens club, not in it.  So don't let that spook you away.  We took our 10 and 13 year old there and were a little scared walking up to the place since the huge Sapphire sign was screaming at us ""are you sure you wanna take your kids here?"".  Answer: YES, YES WE DO. They have a kids menu and the server was more patient than I've ever been with my OCD and ADHD 10 year old.  So don't shy away from this place because you have kids.

Second, BEST FLAN EVER! Got the free flan with Yelp check in deal, and I'm really glad I did. Although this may be a crack dealer trick because now I'm going to have to go back there every time I'm in Vegas to get that damn flan. I believe the chef said it was his grandmother's recipe and it was awesome. It's got a very creamy texture as opposed to the usual vanilla jello stuff I get everywhere else.

Third, I've read some concerns over the salsa here.  Not sure if that's just an old review and things have changed since then or what, but they gave us 3 different salsas to choose from and all of them were very good.  The two more mild salsas weren't that hot at all, but very tasty.  The habanero salsa, too hot for my weak butt, but I'm assuming it's right up your alley if you like your salsa spicy.

Fourth, I wish I was a local.  This place has great locals deals on Monday (everything half off), and Thursdays (all you can eat street tacos and draft beer $20). They get pretty packed for those nights, so either go off peak or make a reservation.

Lastly, the service was really very good. Like I said before, our server was very good and awesome with our kids. The chef came out at one point and spent a good 5-10 minutes just talking with us about the food, our visit to Vegas, and future visits. I believe the manager also came over to check on us as well.  All around you could tell they were making the effort to make sure everyone was having a good dining experience.  

-If you're going to Sapphire anyways...GO HERE
-if you're a local...GO HERE (especially Mon or Thur)
-if your visiting and want something off the strip and different...GO HERE
-if you enjoy a creamy, custard-like flan in your face hole...GO HERE

Thanks for a great night out for my family.  You totally earned this rave review.",4,1,3

El Dorado Cantina comes in at a prestigious #28 in this year's Yelp Top 100, but my experience during a Saturday dinner was one that's routinely eclipsed by both contemporary and traditional Mexican restaurants across the country.  

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

If you're not already aware, El Dorado Cantina shares a building with Sapphire, the world's largest strip club. That's not at all a strike against the restaurant, but it's just something to be aware of. 

Once you're inside the atmosphere and service at El Dorado are both excellent, with attentive servers who bring the food out quickly. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

So it was here that things started to get a bit off. After downing some mediocre margaritas I reviewed the menu, and was a bit surprised to find that an order of three street tacos came to $12.00, or $4.00 each. That is, by any standard, expensive for street tacos, which even at sit down spots often run me no more than $2.50 or so in Dallas or Los Angeles or elsewhere in Las Vegas. I think I might better understand that price point if El Dorado were on the Strip, but they aren't, and at the end of the day these were still pretty basic and normally portioned street tacos. That's simply too expensive a price point. No Star Granted.  

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

I opted for three street tacos: one carnitas, one pastor, and one carne asada. All three were good, but none of the three were great. The meats were clearly of high quality and the peripheral onions and cilantro were well portioned, but the tortillas (flour) didn't taste as fresh as I've had elsewhere and there was a lack of salsa options to accompany the trio. Had these been cheaper or larger I think I'd have a different opinion here, but given that they were neither, I can only define these tacos as having been 'okay'. Single Star Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

Maybe spending the past four years in Dallas has permanently skewed my view of how good tacos should taste and cost, but I'm honestly just confused as to why my dinner experience was in such contrast to Yelp's consensus. For now, there are better Mexican options in Vegas in my opinion. No Star Granted.",7,0,0

The only reason my wife and I walked in was because we took the time to drive off the strip and the reviews were so good.  It was quiet and completely separate from the strip club no direct entrances.  The Food was mediocre and the service was unacceptable.  The salsa was awful,  the guac even worse.  I had shrimp tacos and I will say the chipotle sauce was good but the rice was white steamed rice.  Wife had street tacos the carnitas were good but the carne and chicken were lacking big time.

First of all no one really mentioned it is sort of attached to the strip club sapphire so getting there\/parking was a bit confusing. As for the food, I wasn't really impressed by anything. The carne asada tacos tasted pretty dry so I didn't finish them,  the queso dip was ok but not as flavorful as I would've thought for the way it looks, the carnitas tacos were ok but boring in terms of flavor. Maybe if I would have added a lot of toppings to each taco it would've been better but I shouldn't really have to. The best tacos for me were the cochinita because of the pickled habanero\/onions on top adding to it's flavor and texture. The salsas were also good.

That brewing said, certainly not the most family friendly of locations...we gave them a shot seeing as it was just the wife and I. Stepping in right around 5:30 p.m., we were seated without any wait. A quick look through the menu drew immediate attention to the inflated prices throughout the food and drink selections. I suppose it's to be expected in Las Vegas, but their off-strip location would've suggest otherwise. Chips and salsa came out in due time, and we ordered the tableside guacamole after reading the rave reviews. The guac was flat out spectacular; a huge offering, perfectly seasoned, fresh ingredients, and definitely one of the best I've ever had. With the complimentary chips, salsa, an order of guacamole, and a pitcher of perfect Margarita, we were near full, and ended up splitting a Carnitas burrito. The burrito came out already cut in half, and strangely enough some differences were noticed. My half was scalding hot, an obvious microwave job. My wife's came out luke warm, and almost seemed to be prepared differently. We almost questioned whether or not they cut our burrito and someone else's, swapped halves, and sent them out. Either way, my half was solid. Quality ingredients, excellently seasoned, tasty carnitas...my complaints would be they didn't use a burrito tortilla...more of a wrap, and it was microwaved until scalding. Hard to deny the flavor, and some of the quality food and drink we enjoyed. Bottomless  line, keep the kids at home, bring your appetite and checkbook. Solid Mexican food a bit off the beaten path.",1,0,1

First of all, it's location is kind of hidden and a little awkward, being in the same building as a strip club. I have a lot of experience eating at Mexican restaurants, and I have to say that the food was overpriced for what it was (even by Las Vegas standards), and that it is much more of a Californian Mexican style than traditional Mexican. 

We tried the table-side guacamole -- very fresh, but needed a lot more spice and salt. The complimentary salsa was similarly bland and lacking heat. 

I have always wanted to try Mexican corn, so I was very excited when I saw this on the menu, but unfortunately I was not a fan. It was covered in chipotle spice, which is something that I very much dislike. But my father ate it instead, and he liked it. 

Overall, the whole thing was good, but not great. My shrimp burrito was meh and flavorless...dad's street tacos were fine, but nothing amazing. We both liked our cocktails, though -- frozen strawberry margarita and jalapeño margarita.

Chips & Salsa - Quite possibly the least eventful thing on their menu...easily passable.

Tableside Guacamole - Good but not the best i've had

Queso Fundido - Amazing 

Chapulines aka Grasshoppers - I aint gonna lie it was hard to pick this up and eat it but once you do its not that bad. It basically taste like a seasoned sunflower seed shell. Would recommend trying once just to try it. 

Quesadilla - Fire! If you don't like quesadillas then you need to rethink life.

Chicken Bowl & Carne Asada Bowl - Fire. Most favorite thing on the menu and that sauce is el fuego. Chicken Bowl is better than the Carne Asada Bowl though...

I love Mexican food and have struggled to find really good Mexican restaurants here. What originally drew me in was the advertised organic and non-GMO ingredients. That's SUPER hard to find here! I was even more impressed that a Mexican restaurant was offering this kind of quality. So, of course, I had to try El Dorado Cantina.

I've had a few different items here, and all have been excellent. I would agree that the service can be spotty, but it's usually pretty good. Be sure to book a reservation if you're planning to go at a busier time. I tried to drop in very early on a Saturday, and they were booked for the entire evening!

I don't think you'll go wrong with any of the food, but if you like flan, you've got to give dessert a try here. I had not had good flan since leaving California 6 years ago until I tried El Dorado Cantina's version on my very first visit to the restaurant. The server strongly recommended it, and WOW!

Off the beaten path of the Strip and located next door to a gentlemen's club, you would not expect to find such a classy, well maintained restaurant offering so many fresh, GMO-free, vegetarian choices... that is also open 24\/7!

For starters, the food is outstanding. I'm a vegetarian, my mom is a strict vegan with nut allergies, and my dad, boyfriend, and brother are big ol' dinosaurs who love meat. There is literally something for everyone, with vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free choices identified on the menu. The signature veggie tacos are the best, with the cheese grilled right on the tortilla and overflowing with sautéed veggies like zucchini and squash. The table side guacamole is massive, but we somehow still manage to devour all of it every single time. It's a must-order!

I've been to El Dorado Cantina several times and have always had consistently good service. The restaurant is clean and well-tended to, albeit a little dimly lit\/straight up dark. It's perhaps better suited for a date night or dinner with friends than a casual family lunch, but eh, no big deal. When they first opened, they had lots of good deals for locals and those in the industry, but I think those have tapered out as they grew more popular. Still, the prices are reasonable, even without the heavy discounts. 

My only complaint is that I've yet to get a good, solid margarita from them. It's always too weak or too strong. (I'll keep trying! Ha!)

Needless to say, he was rather surprised when I told him I couldn't wait to try El Dorado Cantina for dinner while we were visiting Vegas. While leaving the airport, I spotted a billboard for the restaurant, showcasing their use of organic and non-GMO ingredients. I was immediately intrigued! Since I'll only eat meat if it's organic, I was really excited to know that nearly everything on the menu would be available to me. On the first page of the menu, they list all of the vendors for every category of food they use in preparation of menu items. I love that kind of transparency! 
We started with the red sangria, which is one of the best I've ever had. St. Germain is one of my favorite liqueurs, and that is one of the unique twists they have as a part of their sangria recipe. They brought us a complimentary basket of fresh tortilla chips, with a trio of fresh, delicious house made salsas: habanero, green, and red. For dinner I ordered the pulled chicken enchilada and my husband ordered carne asada street tacos. Both came with a side of black beans and cilantro rice. They were out of this world! My husband, who has gone to Mexico countless times on business, attested to the fact that this is truly authentic Mexican fare. We closed the evening with flan for dessert. Chef Paco himself delivered our dessert, spent a few minutes talking with us, and let us know the flan was his grandmother's recipe. Never before have I tasted a flan & actually wanted more than a bite or two. We cleaned the plate, and I actually contemplated ordering a second serving! Although it is off the strip, this is a destination well worth traveling the extra mile! Our server, Enrique, was charming, funny and knowledgeable.

The service is SUPER SLOW!!!

The food is not to die for in any way. The corn was very good. The shrimp taquitos are just shrimp wrapped in a corn tortilla and fried with salsa\/guacomole. Nothing inventive about them and edible with a 3 star approval. 

The triple mole pork plate is slopped onto the plate, terribly presented. The chocolate mole was the worst I have ever had. The cilantro one was a two star. The other was edible and the only one I tried to finish. Overall is WAS AWEFUL.

El Dorado, located a bit off the strip but near strip clubs, seemed to fit the criteria. It had good reviews and it was also open late, which was necessary because we were heading for an after-drink meal. 

Our taxi found the spot okay. It was already around midnight when we arrived, so the restaurant wasn't too busy, but there were a few people there. I had looked at the menu a little before and was aware that the food is sustainably sourced (one of the reasons I chose it as well) so I knew this wasn't a cheap Mexican restaurant but I was honestly shocked at some of the prices. The guacamole, served with chips, was $16 and the ghost chile salsa, $20. I sense that ghost chiles aren't something you come across every day but that seemed really high.

Having just come from a bar, we didn't get any drinks and went straight to the food. 

Veggie bowl- $14. Comes with portobello mushrooms, zucchini, & onions over you choice of beans (I got black beans) and rice (I chose brown) and topped with guacamole, three cheese blend, queso fresco, and salsa. This was heavy on the rice and zucchini. I really didn't taste too many mushrooms. I had hoped that there would be fairly sizable pieces of the portobellos but no such luck. The toppings were good though; the guacamole was tasty, made with perfectly ripe avocados, and the serving of cheese was pretty generous. It ate all the topping and had a lot of rice left. Overall, okay but not something that wowed me. 

Breakfast burrito- $12.50 Comes with choice of meat (chorizo, ham, bacon, or grilled veggies), eggs, and cheese. The burrito was perhaps a little smaller than I expected but it was stuffed with egg. My husband said that there wasn't that much chorizo, however. The best part of the meal were the house potato chips served with the burrito; they were fried potatoes and were wonderfully crisp. Definitely the highlight. 

Neither of the salsas served with the chips were particularly spicy but the green had a better flavor than the red. I'm a fan of slightly greasy, salty tortilla chips so I found the ones served here a little too thin for me (and in need of grease) but that's more of a preference. 

In terms of price, comparable restaurants in LA seem to be cheaper (yes, I compared menus). The server was attentive. I was really excited when I found this on Yelp but the experience was somewhat of a letdown.",2,0,0

It's really nice when Management takes an interest in their guests like that.

Now we do Margarita Mondays at El Dorado.  Mondays are 50% off everything for locals.  The house margarita is made w\/ good clear tequila (not some cuervo crap like most places).  You can get a pitcher (which is normally $32) for $16!  Two of us got 2.5 margaritas out of the pitcher.  So $3 per delicious organic margarita?!  Yup, I'm sold!  You can also add some organic fruit to your drink for a little more.

The food is fantastic as well.  The shrimp tacos were the bomb, my friend had a dish where the shrimp was served in 1\/2 a pineapple.  Amazing presentation and soooo good.  The flan is TO DIE FOR.  Seriously, try it!  If it's your first time, you get a free flan when you check on Yelp.

When we walked in, we were asked if we had reservations. No, but the place was not full, and we were told it would be 20 min wait. Okay, so the four of us went and sat at the bar. We ordered water and got menus and chips and a trio of delicious salsas. Not two min later, we were whisked away to a nearby available table (five feet away). 

It felt like the first server kind of pressured us to order, in the manner she phrased if we were ready. That was just the vibe I got. 

The empanadas were TINY! Delicious though, but lacking much sauce and the side salad was tasteless and an after-thought- it seemed superfluous. Why bother?

After waiting for what seemed like ages, one entree was served- my husband's steak fajita platter. Gradually the rest of our group got served; but my husband had to point out they didn't bring the corn tortilla option he'd selected. So we all sat and waited for those to come, because we weren't going to eat in front of him. Maybe five minutes later the tortillas arrived and we started eating.

I'm an enchilada aficionado. Although they espouse to use fancy organic ingredients, neither variety I ordered was any great shakes, and too spicy for my taste (I like spice too). I didn't care for the refried beans nor the cilantro rice (both bland). 
For about ten minutes I waited for the server to come back and ask how we were (those enchiladas needed sour cream). Finally I flagged a server down. 

The worst part was having plates cleared from some of us while others were not finished eating, ""Are you done with this?"". I felt like they took my girlfriends plate away before she was!

I first saw this restaurant when I was driving around in the area, and just wanted to try something new. Even though it had just opened, I wanted to see if the high ratings were legit.

It actually took me a few passes to find this restaurant. For some reason, it said that it was right where the Sapphires gentlemen's club was at, and I couldn't believe it. But once I pulled into the parking lot, it was indeed right next to Sapphires. But, keep in mind, these are 2 totally separate businesses.

When walking in, you can tell that they put a lot of effort into making the dining room look amazing, and it does. The lighting, placement of tables, the bar area.. Everything was really thought out very well.

The current happy hour menu is a lot different than the items I had before on my last visit. The new happy hour is $1 tacos, well drink, and cheap beer specials. I was able to order one of each of the street tacos, about 5 in all.

While waiting for the tacos, we were given their chips and salsa. We were given a tomatillo salsa, a habanero , and chipotle one. The chipotle one was my favorite, I liked the smokiness of it. I also thought that the habanero one was really good, especially from the heat of the peppers.

We ordered a guacamole and ghost chili salsa for some side dishes, both of which are made table side. The guacamole is great, and the server seasoned it extremely well. The ghost chili salsa was extremely spicy at first, but the more you eat it, the more you will get used to it. We couldn't eat it at first, but by the end of the night, it had been demolished.

The tacos then came out. On happy hour, the street tacos are a really great deal. They are big and full of wonderful stuffs. My favorite of the evening was the al pastor taco. The sweetness of the pineapple contrasted with the smokiness of the tender pork. But, I have to say that all the tacos are really great.

I would say that the prices are pretty good for what you receive, for the most part (except my friend didn't think the $17 shrimp cocktail was worth it). Happy hour is great here, so for those who want to give this place a shot, that would be the best time to go. The chef, Paco, was even kind enough introduce himself to us, and asked us how everything was, which we all thought was pretty good. If I'm in the mood for some upscale Mexican cuisine, but will still give you great value for how much you pay, El Dorado Cantina will be my spot!",11,4,5

The food here was great. I opted for some street tacos because it was considered lighter fare and I wanted to be able to move afterwards. But I could have easily eaten more.

One star loss for service. It started out pretty great. The bartender was friendly and inviting, and was able to answer some questions we had about the menu. But that was about the last time we talked. It was NOT busy, one other group of four came to the bar. We had mentioned we were in a bit of a hurry, and when it came time to get the check, everything was a snails pace.

Even on the busy nights, we seem to always get taken care of right away! We've come here for locals night (Monday's where you get 25% off the entire bill - BAR SEATING ONLY) and on a weekday during lunch. 

Personally, the discount is great, but I prefer to come here for lunch on a Wednesday when it's not so packed and I can enjoy my meal. You'd imagine since it's by a strip club that the place would be raunchy, but it's nothing like that! It's clean, professional and just like a normal restaurant. 

El Dorado Cantina is located just off the strip on Sammy Davis Jr. Drive. It's right next door to Saphire. There's ample parking, but you may have to walk far if the strip club is busy. When you first walk in there's a nice hostess who'll take you to your seat. They also accept reservations if you call ahead. Besides coming on Locals night, we typically sit at a comfy round booth that can seat up to 6 people. 

FOOD - We had the following: 

1. Tableside Guacamole w\/ Chips: This is my favorite. It's so simple yet complicated at the same time. The server makes the guacamole right in front of you. However, you can give the server feedback on what you want in your guac. You get to taste test it and they'll adjust it! Take however long you want. Definitely have fun w\/ this and try different mixtures. For your first try, I'd go w\/ what the server recommends. Then you can tweak it the next time you go. For me, I always want extra lime! 

2. Imperial Shrimp: Wild Pacific shrimp wrapped in bacon & lightly fried, stuffed with seafood. Served with chipotle ranch dressing. The shrimp was cooked perfectly (I hate overcooked shrimp) and the bacon wrapped around the shrimp was crispy. What really completes the dish is the chipotle ranch dressing. It's soooo good! I wish I could take this home w\/ me and put it in all my sandwiches. 

3. Cactus tacos: Not my favorite. I wouldn't get this again. We wanted to try something new that we'd never had. I don't like the texture of the cactus. The flavor was good, but it was lacking a crunch. If I could get this taco on a hardshell tortilla then I believe I'd enjoy it more. 

4. Chile Verde Pork w\/ Chicharron: This is one of my favorites. It comes w\/ two pork tacos. The pork is so tender and I love the added crunch from the chicharron in this taco. This is big enough for two to share when you get an appetizer or you can enjoy it by itself as a full meal when you add the cilantro rice and beans on the side. 

5. Chapulines: I never knew how crunchy grasshoppers are!! Like I said earlier, I love lime so we always get the garlic lime grasshoppers. It's a great dish to munch on while you wait for the rest of your food to arrive and it won't fill you up too much either! 

6. Paco's Grandma's Flan: HIGHLY RECOMMEND. It's a great way to end the meal! It's a fairly large piece of flan too. It's denser than most and the syrup on the flan isn't too sweet. It's just right! It's also gluten free and vegetarian. 

SERVICE 

Excellent service from beginning to end. :-) 

PRICE

Some of the items are a bit overpriced, but I can understand why since they're a non-GMO restaurant. They also have a huge selection of vegetarian and gluten-free items. 

For the Chile Verde Pork Taco plate, they charge $14 for two tacos, which is pretty steep! Then you have to pay an extra $2.50 for the rice and beans. The place is good, but I sometimes don't feel everything on the menu is worth that much. I don't recommend you come here if you're on a budget. 

Overall, I give this restaurant 4 stars. The food is good very tasty w\/ many unique dishes that you can't get in Las Vegas, but it's overpriced. This restaurant is great for vegetarians and those who desire great tasting gluten free dishes as well. The service is excellent. The location is off the strip so it's not busy or in a high traffic area. There's also free parking too!

Their pozole is delicious, the table-side guacamole is flavorful and delicious and also large enough to be a meal in itself along with their 3 salsas, their mole was a massive portion of 3 moles and they were all very good. The ingredients all seem very fresh and the flavors of those are very good.

Over the last 2 years though and trying more menu items, the food has selective things that are good, but some things, for example, like their buttered rice, is just gross. I've never had buttered rice at any Mexican restaurant or by any family in my entire life. I could just have never experienced it, but it's bad and overpowers everything if it's by itself or in a burrito.

They try to have integrity with their ingredients by offering grass-fed beef, free range and organic meats, and all organic everything else. But with that in mind I think some of it should be a bit better and more impressive if they go the extra mile to get it all organic. It should also be highly advertised all over their menu for their own benefit, otherwise it looks like they are massively overcharging for pretty much all of their food. Especially because their locals discount and their happy hour has gotten far worse.

Also the newest bad thing is the graveyard Manager. She is absolutely AWFUL. She is downright rude and unpleasant and easily could turn people away from the business permanently, us included. She treats people with massive disrespect and she handles problems atrociously. 

Short version:

Positive things: some of the food like pozole, table-side guac, and mole are good, and the bar staff are amazing! It's great that they are 24 hours also.

Negative things: the manager at night is AWFUL, it's pretty overpriced with not super impressive food overall. Atmosphere has gotten worse because they're not as busy anymore.

ED has Excellent Mexican food. We had one of each of the street tacos, as well as guacamole and a salad.  Everything was high quality, particularly the al pastor and cochinita tacos.  The chips weren't great, but otherwise, everything was very good. 

For those who care, the place is very nice on the inside.  They seem to have a lot of specials--happy hour, etc--so much so that the servers forget some of them.  In fact, our $1 tacos special didn't actually make it onto our ticket. 

This strikes me as the kind of place that, in a different city, might have started out as a well-loved food truck and then transitioned into a better spot than where it actually ended up. (I wish that it were in downtown, for example.) That being said, we'll definitely be back.

To find El Dorado Catina, literally look for Sapphire as this restaurant will be right next to the entrance (co-owned? not sure).  I walked from Trump although the walk isn't exactly in the friendliest of areas so just be aware.  

Come in - the service was pretty quick at around 7PM on a Friday night.  My server was very kind and knowledgeable.  To begin with, there are free chips and a few different sauces.  The sauces were really delicious and you're given a ton of chips.  Although one of the sauces I thought lacked flavor, one of the green sauces was awesome with a good spice and kick.  I then went onto the friend grasshoppers as it was a free Yelp check-in item.  Again, you're given quite a plentiful amount.  As my server told me - it's a very peculiar taste and very salty like a potato chip.  Definitely doesn't look as appetizing as it tastes but pretty fun for the adventurous\/those that are fans.  Then I got the chicken bowl which came with rice\/some veggies\/chicken\/guac.  The bowl was okay - I've had similar tasting bowls at other restaurants and for cheaper prices so I wasn't too blown away.  The house margarita too was just okay - you're given a pretty big cup for about +$10 but the taste wasn't too unique\/distinct.

Husband and I chose the street tacos. You choose any three out of 6 different tacos and served with rice and beans. Friend ordered the chicken enchiladas and her husband ordered the carne asade bowl. The green sauce on the enchiladas was good but spicy! The bowl was huge and tasty. Also order the grilled corn as it is the bomb!

The food (at least what I tried) was quite ordinary.  Maybe I am so used to New York Mexican places that I can't tell authentic Mexican when I taste it?  The quesadillas were bursting at the seams with cheese.  The complimentary chips and salsa however did hit the spot.

Don't worry, you can still come here with nana and little Tommy - El Dorado's entrance and dining room is separate from Sapphires and just a couple of steps to the left of the strip club's entrance. 

Parking: If you see the massive blue glowing Sapphires building, you're at the right place. Turn into their parking lot, try to dodge the shitty cab drivers all lined up at Sapphires and snag yourself a parking spot right in front. 

I'm embarrassed to admit this, but ever since I moved here from Southern California, I pretty much wrote off Mexican cuisine, until now. I've had way too many terrible experiences and disappointments - I couldn't find any of the juicy and spicy flavors I was looking for.

Well, that all changed when I tasted El Dorado's trio of salsas, I knew from the very first bite, that my dinner would follow suit with how incredible the salsas tasted. They have 3 different spice levels mild (roasted green tomatillo), medium (charred chipotle), and crazy spicy (habanero). They don't mess around here! The spicy habanero salsa had lots of smashed chunks of habanero chilies; so let this be your warning, it's spicy but also so damn flavorful. I didn't have a favorite because they were all so incredibly flavorful. The best salsas I've had in a while. Flavor rating: 5\/5

Here's what we ordered:

Tostaditas de Tinga $5.50 (Gluten Free) - Flavor rating: 5\/5
You can order these from the small bites\/appetizers menu and they are crazy good! Super moist and flavorful chipotle marinated chicken with grilled onions, served over fresh crispy tostadas, topped with flavorful refried beans, queso fresco, sour cream, and (mild red) salsa cascabel - comes with 3 for $5.50 or $2.75 during happy hour! It looks simple, but the flavors are explosive! Top them with any one (or all) of the trio salsas they give you, for an extra added wow! 

Al Pastor $9.50 - Flavor rating: 3\/5
Marinated pork with pineapple chunks, cilantro, onion & lime. Comes with three tacos per platter, served with moist and perfectly seasoned cilantro rice & your choice of refried or black beans - get the refried beans! Typically, I wouldn't care for beans, but they're very moist and packed with amazing flavor. They aren't the best or most authentic al pastor tacos I've ever had, but the tacos were very moist and everything on the plate tasted freshly prepared. The al pastor meat was a tad mild in flavor and spices for my taste. Yet, everything else on the dish was seasoned perfectly. 

Chicken Enchiladas $13.50 - Flavor rating: 4\/5
Slow cooked chicken breast marinated in chiles, wrapped in fresh corn tortillas & cheese, topped with mild and flavorful green tomatillo sauce, sour cream & queso fresco. 
Served with delicious and well seasoned cilantro rice & your choice of refried or black beans. The portion size is generous and filling. We enjoyed the flavor of the moist enchiladas and with added dollops of salsa of each bite. 

We also tried the Strawberry Agua Fresca. It was refreshing and not too sweet, but I think it was slightly watery for my preference. It's still perfect for warm weather, spicy food and I enjoyed it. Flavor rating: 3\/5

I'm a huge fan of this place! The chef truly shines at his talent and you can really taste the care that went into each preparation. I can tell it's been taste-tested before served and I'm a fan of restaurants that pride themselves in quality control. Plus, the service we received from KAI that evening was top-notch. He went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of. 

Other important details: 

Happy Hour twice a day:
* 3pm - 6pm - $1 street tacos, 1\/2 off bottled domestics & wells
* 11pm - 2am - 1\/2 off all appetizers, 1\/2 off bottled domestics & wells

Pro tip: during the day it's more-so family friendly and during the late-night-owl hours and onward, there is more of a mature crowd with a sprinkle of girls off the clock grabbing their dinner after work.",20,13,12

There location is right next door to a strip club so I think they may have recruited some of their employees. 

As soon as we were seated the chips were brought out. I like a Mexican restaurant where they bring out the chips before you have to ask. The chips were a mix of blue and yellow. I found this very tacky especially because they claim to be an ""upscale"" Mexican restaurant. I was not thrilled with any of the salsas, in particular the yellow one which had no flavor only heat. I ordered the albondigas soup, lettuce wraps, and steak & shrimp fajita platter. The broth of the soup was subtly seasoned but the vegetables in the soup were cut sloppily, and the meatball was dry and flavorless. Accompanying the soup was a pile of chips, why would I need more chips when you give unlimited baskets of chips? The lettuce wraps were difficult to eat because the guacamole was on the bottom making the lettuce wrap bottom heavy. Guacamole tasted like mashed up avocados with no type of seasoning. The fajita platter looked like a typical fajita platter. The guacamole was flavorless and the sour cream was so runny that I doubt it's homemade. Steak was well cooked albeit salty and the shrimp were jumbo in size but not deveined. And once again, the black beans were garnished with a chip. 

I can't see why this is considered an upscale Mexican restaurant except for the decor.",10,3,3

We arrive and its doorway is under the lights *SAPPHIRES GENTLEMANS CLUB* Worlds largest strip joint!!!
Not quite the scene I was looking for with a four mth old baby in tow. Further inspection yields the revelation that ok, they share a roof with a seedy joint, but inside the cantina is an assortment of families eating like any given Sunday. The place is cavernous and we are invited to sit in the back where it's quieter. 

Service was attentive and food came out pretty quickly. Pollo al pastor was decent, but if you've been to Mexico you won't be impressed. I haven't been to Mexico but the Mexican food in my imagination tastes better than this. I Also had chipotle chicken dish with onions, peppers, queso fresco and black beans . It was tasty but no chipotle detected. A Yelp checkin gifted us a flan which was basically baked condensed milk. 

The menu states their farm to table, non gmo, organic gospel they're preaching outchea in the dessert, followed by a sober disclaimer that they can't guarantee they'll always have organic available. \/side eyes",0,0,0

Their tacos lived up to the hype as authentic street tacos (just enough seasoning, but not over the top).

I'll pay the extra cash when I'm at the grocery store, and I realize that non-gmo food is definitely NOT the norm when ordering from a restaurant. so this whole non-gmo- Mexican- restaurant idea was appealing to me.

I had no idea until we arrived that this place is  located directly next to a strip joint. but it was no problem. I didn't have trouble parking at all. I arrived on a Monday (Presidents day) around lunch.. I  decided to try this place, as it was on the 'Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in the US for 2016' 

The food was just ehh OK. I buy corn tortillas that are non-gmo from whole foods, and even those are handmade with better quality\/taste.

I ordered 3 tacos: 1 chicken, 1 carne asada, 1 cochinita, to get an taste of the array of meats\/seasonings they offer. Also had carne asada burrito and albonidigas soup. None of these items were spectacular enough to return back here for. Maybe this place is more of a lounge than a restaurant, but it appeared quite the opposite.

It's nice that this place is open 24\/7, but I'm sure there are more Mexican restaurants where I can get exactly what I ordered for better flavor under  $45 bucks... (That's how much our total was, not including tip) And unlike any other Mexican restaurant I've been to, chips and salsa refills aren't free.  I just don't understand the hype of this place. Using non-gmo and organic ingredients doesn't mean the flavor need be sacrificed.

If you end up at this place keep in mind it's 25% off for locals on Mondays and checking in on Yelp is necessary as the free flan was the only highlight of our visit. Usually flan I've tried from Mexican restaurants are a waste of calories, not the case here.",1,0,0

As a long-standing fan of Mundo Haute Cuisine in the Las Vegas Design Center for the high end and Taco Y Taco for the low end but high quality, I have to admit that foodies should gather up outside a strip club to get Las Vegas's most reliable top quality mexican.  Wow, there.  I said it.  24 hour opening is great.  

Only one star deduction for one reason.  Service can be a bit spotty here.

I have been there when 5 different people asked me how things are going in 5 minutes - interrupting conversation and chewing each time (annoyed).  I have also waited to get my order taken way too long on other occasions.  They need to get the staffing right.  

Once they do, this place is a rocket ship.  Also - note to management (and I hate to say this as a consumer): we want you to stay in business for a long long time.  Charge $1-2 more for every entree.  With reviews as top quality as this on yelp and everywhere, we are more concerned about your financial stability in the future than your pricing.

They make you make a reservation but they still tell you it's a wait and then reserve it for bigger parties. It's all about how much money they will make instead of customer experience. And after 40minutes they tell us they have a table for us in the back somewhere behind a wall where it was dirty! Come on! Little do they know we usually spend a lot and have a huge tab on alcohol alone so we would have spent what a big party spends alone! So if it's just 2 people going there on a date you better forget it! Try taking more people because you won't get a table! We decided to leave and go somewhere else. It was ridiculous. End of rant. Went to sushi instead.",1,1,1

Nice booths surrounding a U shaped bar. Main issue was service tonight, busboys and water service was solid but strangely waiter was nowhere to be found most of the meal.  When we did see him he was checking in on other tables in the close to empty restaurant. Check in for drinks and to order and didn't come back until after we were done eating. Could have used some tapatio..... luckily bar tender \/ bar back helped us out in getting check etc. Food was ok and drinks ok, service was the weakest point.

Anyways, we ended up getting tacos. I got the al pastor and carnitas and I wasn't that impressed. Coming from California, we know good tacos and I can definitely say those tacos shouldn't be worth 13 bucks. They were terrible, but they weren't great either. However, the one redeeming factor were the free flans that we got through our Yelp check-in. Everyone agreed that the flan was some of the best flan we ever had.

The sign is there in plain view, but it's attached to the Sapphire Nightclub\/strip bar, so at first we missed it. Circle back around by Circus Circus, and yes, there it is, the Cantina's front door is next to the Sapphire front door. It was noon-ish on a Sunday so you could see the guys in the black suits at the door were relaxing before it got busy. 
However, walking into the El Dorado you forget for just a moment that there is a wall separating you from the Sapphire and you are greeted by a pleasant hostess who takes you to one of the many large booths surrounding the circumference of the room, with a few high tops in the middle. There is a large bar with star shaped lanterns above illuminating the wide assortment of liquors and beers. The red rose ""wallpaper"" and old, rustic mirrors lends a Mexican Bordello theme. 
The waiter brings you a generous amount of tortilla chips and 3 salsas, verde, roja and a yummy orange-habanero that packs an after punch. 
The regular margarita we ordered was nice, I asked for less agave and it was just right. 
We ordered street tacos (carne asada) (it comes 3 to a plate with rice and beans), pozole soup and a chicken bowl (marinated chicken with brown rice, black beans, lettuce, pick de gallo and guac). Everything was super good! I'll definitely be returning. Total bill for 3 food items and 2 margaritas was $68 and change.

The wait time for a reservation was 30 minutes. This always makes me wonder what the point of a reservation is when this happens. We were waiting on another party, which is fine. But there are so many places where I've had a larger party and have been seated immediately. Or within 10 minutes. We had a group of 10. 

The service wasn't great. We had 3 people have to ask for drinks 3 times and ended up walking to the bar to get faster service after 40 minutes. The guy seemed overwhelmed. Maybe they were understaffed. He was very friendly, just hardly attentive. 

The food is good. There's nothing spectacular about it. I had the Cochinita Pibil. It's an insanely large helping of food, but for me, it's just good. The only food I really enjoyed was a friends carne asada. So I definitely recommend that dish.

I ordered the chicken fajitas, and they weren't bad but it was nothing to rave about. My bf ordered the street tacos that our waiter had recommended and he also wasn't impressed.

You'll likely be amazed to see such a spacious and attractive spot (dimly lit, very dark red and black, very Dave Navarro's bedroom) next to a strip club, full of couples, groups, and families, packed even on a Monday night.  And no poles.

Service was very good at the bar.  The award-winning menu was creative but maybe too fancy for some folk (i.e. you won't find the #2 two hard shell tacos, refried beans and rice).  The two complimentary homemade salsas were too runny and smoky for the chips, but perfect for the food, especially on the yummy chorizo and egg burrito with thick homemade potato chips.

I was pleasantly surprised when we entered by the posh decor. I really liked the feel of the place and I could imagine it having an even cooler vibe at night. We specifically came on Tuesday for the taco specials. I waited for our server to let us know the Taco Tuesday specials and when she didn't (just asked for our drink order) I asked about the specials that were available and our server quoted us an incorrect price. When I questioned her about it, she said she wasn't sure, but she would check. Upon her lengthy return, she did correct herself, but still never mentioned any drink specials. (Later I found out they did have a special on margaritas, had I known this, I would have ordered 2 - her loss) The chips and trio of salsa that were served free were pretty good. The red one is my favorite. The green one (tomatillo) was nothing special, even borderline flavorless. The pink one was way too spicy. You couldn't taste anything but the heat, which is not enjoyable to me. The tacos we ordered were smaller than I expected especially at $3.50, but they were filled with lots of meat. I ordered two carne asada and one cochinita. I liked them both, but thought the cochinita was better as the flavor was fantastic. Although we were pretty full, we did take advantage of the free flan with the Yelp check in. Both of us are not huge fans of flan, but figured we didn't have anything to lose. We are so happy we got the chance to try it, because it was the best flan we have ever had! Chef Paco delivered it directly to our table himself. A nice touch. I think we would have had a much better experience had the service not been so lacking. We had to beg for refills and that was when we could find her. I don't know exactly what the issue was, because we were one of the only tables for the first half of our meal. There was a large party going on in the back room and I don't know if she was more concerned with them or what. We will definitely visit again when we are in town since there were many things I would like to try on the menu. I just hope the service is much better.",0,0,0

     However the garlic shrimp was bomb, I love the beans here also.  I had the fried chicken I forgot the name, it was good however if it came with sauce it would be better so I added there chipotle cream which made it right.  Taquitos and imperial shrimp apps are delicious.  You have to order the lemonade agua fresco, so bomb I had about 5 glasses.  I'm not a big Sangria drinker but even that was tasty. Desert the churros are so good, they come with a little cream filling and a banana foster sauce to dip them in.  Flan has a cheesecake like consistency which I like, because I don't care for traditional Flan and the eggy taste.  I will definitely go back. So many good dishes and Chef Paco can custom make dishes to your taste. 

     Some dishes are $25 and I think they could be a little cheaper however on average dishes are $10-$17. Its good for groups and even coming in by yourself has a nice open layout and friendly staff.  If you come to Vegas for Mexican food near the strip or just good flavors, try it.",1,0,1

Tacos are garbage
Mahi Mahi was really average 
chips and salsa are some of the best in town.
Chicken Milanesa is seriously legit, very unhealthy and very good.  

The biggest problem is the mamalukes who work here. Out of my 10 visits or so I'd say the service was awful 8 out of 10 times. One time we sat at the bar in front of the bartender for almost ten minutes and he never said a word to us.. figured he was a barback. Then another couple walked in and the guy could not have been friendlier to them .  Was one of the strangest Encounters in a restaurant  I've ever experienced. The staff is constantly rotating I've only seen one guy the whole time that I've been coming here that's still there everyone else is always new each time.
However, for 24 hour Mexican food that's organic and non-GMO I'll continue coming back and paying the extraordinarily high prices and enduring the shitty service because overall there is some really good things on the menu. AND great chips and salsa. Lastly, I want to mention even though some dishes are average everything is high quality ingredients.",5,2,0

So far I have had to drive here especially from my hotel on the central strip. I'd hoped I could walk but it's a 15 minute drive so kind of out of the way.

So anyway, I pull up to where the navigation is taking me and I hesitate because everything is lit in blue and the vast majority of signage on this middle-of-nowhere place says this is a strip club. Highly dodgy.

El Dorado Cantina has a small sign and and entrance of its own next to the strip club entrance and as I am here in my own I must have looked really suspicious parking up and walking towards the entrance.

The doors are all blacked out so I wasn't sure what I'd get when I opened them but I'm glad I came in.

Boom!

Instant atmosphere! The place is buzzing and I am greeted by Kim, the general manager, who suggests I sit at the bar as I am on my own and starts up a friendly conversation. He asks how I heard about the place and I tell him I saw a sign on the freeway and it said it was rated one of the top 50 places to eat so I pretty much came straight here. He tells me if I check in I'll get a free flan dessert.

Double boom! :)

As soon as I sit down I'm presented with a menu that looks delicious, and a really big bowl of tostadas with 3 types of salsa that all taste delicious. Proper tostadas too, not at all like the ones I am used to in most places back home. They gave me a glass of ice water without asking as well. This is rare for me.

I see the Mahi tacos and order some. They arrive and are a bit bigger than I am expecting for the price, but that's cool.
First bite... Delicious. So are all the other bites.

Half way though eating them Kim returns to ask how I'm doing. He addresses me by my name! Dang it! How does he remember my name? Anyway, I tell him it's all good :)

And then I finish my tacos. They suffered catastrophic containment failure half way through and I had to finish the second one with my knife and fork... But I don't care. These are the best tacos I have had since I was in Mexico. I don't know for sure but I am pretty sure these are freshly made soft taco shells.

Just as I am about to write ""I'm now stuck in an awkward situation where my taste buds want more but my stomach says no"" I'm asked if I am ready for my free flan. Decision made for me.

This is awesome!

I'm waiting for the flan right now. I have high hopes for it and I'm sure I won't be disappointed!

But wait, there's more! They have TVs. Lots of them. And they are showing the Steelers game. And the Steelers are winning! Here we go Steelers!!

And I still have most of my bowl of tostadas left, so I can munch on them until that flan arrives (they said it will take 5 minutes or so).

Just as I am thinking I'm done with the tostadas, my flan arrives. And it's just right! Absolutely delicious and the portion size is perfect too.

So there you have it. Until now I didn't think I could possibly have a reason to return to Las Vegas, but now my favourite Mexican restaurant is here. The only way this place could improve is to be located on the top floor of one of the big hotels on the main strip, with a view of the Las Vegas skyline (but still be as accessible to regular customers as it is now).

Can you open a branch in London please? :)",2,2,2

Aside from the obvious entertaining costumes that walk through the door because this location is next to a strip club, this place is just average if not below. Every time we come to this restaurant (and we've given this place a HANDFUL of tries..) there always seems to be a problem no matter how well the staff know us.
Almost every time, we strenuously express our food allergy towards avocado and even after 5 minutes of explaining and expressing our allergy, they STILL serve avocado on whatever we order and have to take it back.
If you LIKE to be fed whatever they want to feed you with NO say so over what your allergic or sensitive to, this place is wonderful...

The ambience is nice.
The service is TERRIBLE and VERY CARELESS.
The Mexican food is almost one of the best in Las Vegas but that's NOT saying much if you know original Mexican food or even Tex Mex. 

I'm sitting here writing this review as my fajitas are getting cold because they had to take our sides back...

Ugh... Would have rather gone to a more well known place on the strip...(not saying any names). We thought the STRIP was expensive but fajitas for ONE person here are $26.00... and on the strip they are $20.00. At least on the strip the food is higher quality and the waiters don't try to send us to the hospital every time we show up...

I eat Mexican food everywhere I go and never have I seen a place put jalepenos in everything and avocado on EVERYTHING...very annoying and working with a careless staff for a normal Mexican meal completely ruins an appetite that's for sure.",1,3,0

We are big fans of fish tacos and we were not disappointed. The mahi was fresh and grilled, not fried as at so Many other restaurants. They were delicious. 
We also has a bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer which was fantastic .
Our waiter Chris was pleasant and professional. He told us things about the food and the menu and made our dining enjoyable . The place is a little hard to find as it shares the parking lot with a strip club, but it is no big deal.

I start the review this way because I had I not seen a mention of it in someone else's review, I'm not sure we would have ever found it.  :)  The signage for the strip club way overwhelms the signage for El Dorado.  

It is literally right next door (same building) as the strip club.  It's also open 24 hours which to me is usually a sign of Waffle House\/Denny's quality but this idea is actually genius.  People go to strip clubs at all hours of every day.  Having good Mexican food mere steps from the door is a stroke of brilliance.

The service was good the last two times, we walked in were seated right away and offered drinks.  On this very last visit when the chips and salsa were brought to the table the chips seemed hard and stale tasting which at first seemed odd as we've never had this before.  

The rice, normally amazing buttery flavor with cilantro both this time and last week was really dry and not flavorful like it used to be.

Last week I had the steak fajitas which were seasoned really well, the rice was bland and not like usual.  Last night I got the ribeye deciding to try something new and it was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing, however the rice was again dry and bland, not like it used to be.  Also my daughter got the fajitas this time and the guacamole they brought with her dish looked old and dry.

My wife's dish which was the soup and a sandwich, also did not taste like it was seasoned the way it used to be.  I really like this place but my wife was not happy the last two visits which is really sad.

The staff is amazing, on top of everything, it just seems like the kitchen is not the same.  I hope we will be back but it's up to the boss, two bad visits for her normally does not go back for a third disappointment.",15,7,11

My friends and I went here to eat after a late night out. Usually the food comes out quickly, however, on this particular morning it took quite a bit. One of the guys that came later and ordered after Us ended up Getting his food first. I gave the bartender a hard time about it thinking he must've forgotten the rest of our food order. Well, in all my years of working in hospitality and the service industry, I know how frustrating customers can be. Perhaps I was frustrating this morning, however, when the bartender told me to ""shut the f**k up"" (exact words he used) my desire to ever set foot in this restaurant disappeared. I was in shock. This caused a huge commotion among myself and my friend and we were asked to leave the establishment. As I left I happily gave him a piece of my mind. Hopefully no one ever experiences what I did. 



Have to give another poor rating to this restaurant. First of all, after being told to shut the f*** up by the drunk bartender on duty there one morning, I have yet to hear a peep out of the managers of this restaurant. But whatever, not too shocked about that. However, this bartender continues to talk about that night and lying about the facts of what happened. He continuously talks bad about my friend and I to whoever he thinks will listen. I'm sorry, but I don't know what kind of business owners are okay with having a person like that- classless and rude- to be employed and represent their brand the way he does. Keep on coming with the rude comments about CUSTOMERS, who got cussed at and thrown out because we were upset about our delay on our order. I happily returned the insults To him on my way out the door. In any case, the longer he tries to smear my name and my friends, the longer I will continue w the Yelp reviews. Hope he gets drunk at work again tonight!. Good service can make up for bad food, but good food CANNOT make up for bad service.

Because any restaurant in Vegas that is willing to stand against using GMO food deserves five stars! There's so much organic food on the menu, I feel like I'm eating at a whole foods.

That's the catch. The location of this restaurant is not ideal. My mom flew in to town for my birthday and of course she wanted to take me out to dinner. I chose this place because Mexican food is my favorite! My husband was driving us. I see the gentleman's club, Sapphire. I say, ""where the heck is this place? We should be close."" My husband shouts out, ""it's here!"" And he turns in to Sapphire's. I thought he was joking. My mother was mortified. She even evoked my middle name and asked what I was thinking!

Long story short, we went in to the restaurant with our eyes down for fear of what we might see. Low and behold, we saw a restaurant. Even though it shares a building with Sapphires, the two are separate. 

The food is extremely delicious! Fresh tasting-which makes sense when the food is GMO free. Their mole sauce... No words can describe the richness. Try it! Pay no attention to the building next door.

Our first time was Friday night last week after we checked in at the Palms and hadn't eaten all day. Honestly we were expecting a Tex-Mex type theme but were pleasantly surprised to find out that this is the real deal. That's right folks, genuine Mexican fare not that wanna be but never will be Mexican slop. We opted for the mole sampler and the street tacos as our entree. We chose to try the quesadilla as an appetizer and although it wasn't anything amazing it was good nevertheless. Now getting back to the dish I had which was the mole sampler.  The plate has a mix of 3 different types of mole, 2 red and one green. They all have there own unique flavors and characteristics about them but I found myself especially enjoying the green and the darker red of the two.  The lighter red has a genuine mole flavor that reminded me of both my moms and mother in laws mole which are both excellent.  I must say however that the darker one which I understand is made using both Chipotle peppers as well as Guajillo chiles had a very earthy, smokey flavor that really hits the palate and makes you appreciate all the labor that I'm sure goes into making this dish.  The green mole was just as tasty but obviously prepared using tomatillos and green chiles which by the way I totally love green salsas. Combine all three of these with their delicious white rice and refried beans and your choice of corn or flour tortillas and you have a meal fit for a king or queen. Long story short, if you're going to Vegas anytime soon: Don't miss this spot, oh I almost forgot to mention to not be freaked out when your cab driver or Lyft or Uber pull into a parking lot of a strip club.

We had a larger party so staff set up a foldable plastic table that came from the night club from next door. You might ask how did we know it came from next door? There was black sharpie on the table said ""sapphire."" My first thoughts were I hope this table is sanitary. Staff then placed it next to the corner table and had us use the waiting bench as our table chairs. This would have been fine except for the fact other customers would sit right next to us while they waited for their table, ""very awkward situation.""

We came on a tuesday so they had a special on the street tacos  ($3.50 each) and I believe ($6 each) for signature tacos. I ordered an al pastor taco and carne asada taco. Tacos were fairly small but tasty. 

Al Pastor (4 stars) 
I thought this taco was above average but not as good as taco y taco or tacos el gordo's al pastor. Taco was fairly small. There was plenty of pineapple on the taco which definitely added to the flavor. Out of the two tacos I liked this one the best. 

Carne Asada (3.5 stars) 
beef was slightly dry. Fairly well seasoned and quite a bit of meat on the taco. It came with limes which I used to help moisten up the meat. All in all decent taco, but would not pay full price for this taco.",0,0,0

The service was very welcoming and the starter chips and salsa were bomb. Honestly, I could have just been satisfied off of that and their amazing salsa.

Based solely on the Yelp reviews, a group of 4 of us went to dinner on Sunday night-very quiet inside, maybe 1\/2 full with not one person sitting at the bar. We knew something was wrong when it took 15 minutes to get the chips and salsa and  a few chips were in the basket- not your typical ""overflowing basket o chips"" as is usually the case at a good Mexican restaurant. The salsa was actually quite good.

That unfortunately was the highlight. It then took another 15 minutes to order drinks and Table Side Guacamole and place our entree order,

After another 15 minutes and after us asking, we got our drinks- but no guac yet. We waited about 20 more minutes and asked for the check. Never got the guac and didn't care to wait for the entrees suspecting they'd be as bad as the service- plus we didnt want a 3 hour meal.

Clearly they were understaffed, but we felt that the whole place did not live up to any of these suspicious Yelp reviews, It also looks nicer in the pictures than it really is- pretty cheaply decorated.

On the cab ride back to our hotel we told the cab driver the reason we went was the reviews. He too said he recently went and had bad service that took forever and he has no idea how they got these reviews.

The drinks were okay, nothing exceptional or unique. I ordered an ice tea. It was instant.

Always make an Open Table reservation; sometimes you need it, sometimes you don't, either way you get the 100pts from Open Table. My only complaint is that the lighting isn't conducive to taking food pics. I may of may not have purchased a foodie light just for the purpose of taking pictures here. (I did.)

My favorites: 

Veggie burrito, it's on my ""last meal"" list. Make sure you order the black beans if you are a vegetarian.  Get the rice. I don't know why it is so delicious, but it is. 

Al Pastor tacos- I always suggest these to out of town guests, because most of mine are from WV and have never experienced it's pork and pineapple deliciousness. 

Cheese enchiladas, soooo good on the rare occasion I'm not feeling the above two items 

Chilaquiles, they will sub al pastor meat if you ask nicely, and scramble the eggs for you

Free flan with Yelp check in. I love that Chef Paco brings it out if he is there. Sometimes he will even send you out special things too that aren't even on the menu. I don't like flan, but this is like a cheesecake texture, it is divine. Order it, just trust me.

Mangonada margaritas with chamoy and chile rim - not on the menu but they will make them for you if you ask. A server suggested them when I was here with friends for my birthday (actually I came here twice for my birthday last year, with two groups of friends...anyway....) and I have been obsessed ever since. 

My mom loved her food so much, she and my aunt had me bring them here twice during their 5 day visit. I've never brought anyone here who didn't love their meal....the only item I've ever had that I didn't like was the short rib tacos, it was more like a Korean BBQ style short rib than a braised, shredded short rib like I was expecting. My mom was who ordered it, and the server kindly replaced it with another selection for her. 

When anyone asks me where the should eat while they are in Las Vegas, I send them here, and that's the highest compliment I can provide.",11,5,10

The table started off with some of the table side guacamole. The wife makes some pretty darn good guac so it's kinda tough for me to go out and be wow'd by what we buy out. However, this was absolutely delicious. Fresh as can be and very flavorful. If you like guac, make sure you try it here!

The wife went with the street tacos. She hasn't had a ton of tacos so doesn't have much to compare it to but she fell in love with them. Said they were amazing!

I got the Mole Sampler. I gotta be honest, I didn't love the chocolate Mole. But that's not because of the way they made it, it's just because chocolate on chicken was weird for me. The green and chipotle Mole's were DELICIOUS. It came with cilantro rice and I got black beans based on server recommendation. As someone else mentioned in a review, the cilantro rice is great but it could also be called butter rice lol. 

The service was second to none. The manager made our table side guacamole and later came to check on our service and how our dinner was going. Our server, Enrique, was as good of a server as I'd ever had. Chatted with us for a while, made recommendations, ran us through their other specials during the week suggesting we come back on locals Monday's for the 25% off, etc. If he's not part owner, I'd be shocked. He pitched the place like it was his own. I will certainly ask to sit in his section again the next time we go.

No! DO NOT BE DISSUADED!! The hostess assured us a quiet(er) seat in the back room, and that the wedding party was leaving soon. :) After the dubious entrance, we ordered margaritas and focused on the extensive menu.

This definitely rivals Javier's at Aria for the ""high end"" Vegas Mexican cuisine market, but the prices are way more reasonable.  Chef Paco and his staff are churning out some really good stuff.  

Want a great way to spice up a weekday dinner?  How about doing as the Aztecs did back in the day (century) and start off with some grasshoppers?  Yes, sir!  EDC's ""chapulines"" can be prepared sautéed either in garlic lime or habanero.  For the uninitiated, the closest thing to compare them to would be crispy shrimp tails but juicier.  The habanero order offered terrific heat and not in a painful, shoot me in the face kind of way.  At $7.50, it was a large portion that could have easily satisfied a party of six.  Not for everyone by any means, my wife was literally one and done, but I enjoyed it and had plenty to take home (fried rice, anyone?).

""Imperial Shrimp"" was everything I look for in an appetizer: seafood stuffed Pacific wild shrimp wrapped in bacon and then lightly fried. The creamy heat (sounds gross, right?) from the chipotle ranch dressing that accompanied the dish was awesome.  More things in life should be wrapped in bacon!  I should start a national campaign.

We chose to split the humungous carne asada entrée.  The citrus marinated steak was medium rare perfection.  I loved the big slabs of grilled cactus that it came with.  We probably boxed up 70 percent of the plate.  Goddamn nachos and salsa....

You'd think that would prevent us from ordering dessert, but the flan and tres leches cake somehow made it to the table.  The latter was plated nicely and the rum flavor made me feel like I was on vacation.  It was a great end to the meal and I can't wait to try more.",60,29,44

Al pastor tacos $3 each were very tasty, the tacos were filled with meat, guac, and onions. The pulled pork was very juicy and enough fat balanced the fresh and greasy side. 

On the other end, carne asada was too dry. Very hard to swallow. But good portions. 

Rice was very unique. Tasted a little bit coconuty with buttery taste. I finished the whole plate of rice, which I had never did with red Mexican rice.

The highlights: friendly staff and the queso fundida.
The lowlights: confused staff, bland entrée, bland side dishes, and runny salsa

I can't stress how disappointed I was in my entrée... tacos al pastor, one of my favorite Mexican dishes. Heavily seasoned, sweet and spicy, a little crusty outer layer of meat with juicy, tender insides, layered with the complex flavors of chilis, pineapple and onion. Well, that's not the dish I was served. I must have accidentally ordered bland, rubbery disappointment.

Service was great...they were very attentive...the waiter and bus boy kept our drinks and chips\/salsa full all night. Speaking of salsa....oh my. Addicting!!!!! Once you start, it's really hard to stop yourself from eating the entire first batch. They give you 3 different kinds of salsa; roasted, mild, and habanero. I can take spiciness...but the habanero slowly creeps up on you! Before you know it, half of my water is gone. But the flavoring was sooooo good though!!!!!!!

We ordered the beef enchiladas and the seafood enchiladas. Each comes with rice and beans. You can modify your sides if you like. I'm not a cheese fan but mmm...their cheese just melts in your mouth. Our entrees came out fresh and full of flavor. We were very pleased with  the quality of their food.

Chef Paco even personally came out to meet my boyfriend and I. The flan dessert was out of this world. Not overly sweet but just the right amount to satisfy your dessert cravings.

We initially sat at a booth until we noticed everything we wanted to eat was significantly cheaper at the bar. The Street Tacos are the way to go here! Especially the carne asada! 

My only gripe is the flavored Margaritas...while they were good, adding an additional $2 per serving on a pitcher of margaritas is a bit absurd, (No matter how many people are drinking from the pitcher you will be charged for 4 servings.)This caused the $32 pitcher to ultimately be $40. I live in NYC and understand things but honestly an $8 additional charge for flavoring is bogus at best! Especially since the flavoring is done artificially and not with fresh fruit purée. Also waaaaaaay to much ice was served in the pitcher. With all that said fix this margarita issue and you'll be a great find...off the strip!",0,0,0

Our server was very knowledgeable with the menu and didn't give us any grief when we asked for our free taco\/margarita with yelp check in. You know how that can go sometimes. 

Now the food. Wow. I mean, wow! It's rare to enjoy Mexican food without the aftermath of indigestion due to all the grease and heaviness. The quality of food is on another level; ""Clean"" food. I don't feel like I need a nap when I leave this place. It's not greasy, it's not heavy, portions are perfect, and the flavors are dynamite. Basket of chips and salsa when you sit down, Table-side guacamole and a server that knows his sh*t. What more could you ask for?! Oh and all their meats are free from abtibiotic, pesticides and steroids. So awesome. 

The first time we were there the chef came out and shared his grandmother's flan dessert with us. That was thoughtful and delicious. 

Eat here! It's good! Trust me ;)",6,2,1

We were aided with a spectacular server that help choose perfect dishes for us and provided top notch service. I knew this place was on another level from the time we sat down and had chips with salsas that had a different flavor compared to others. To me, there was just a little extra boost of flavor or heat with every dish that had us nodding our heads after every bite.

Chris, our server, was the difference maker. He greeted us immediately, was always present throughout our Monday night meal, and had knowledge of the menu because he's tasted all the items on the menu. He was able to describe each and every flavor in each dish which made everything that much more appetizing. He had recommendations with every aspect of the meal such as suggesting refried beans versus black for a side and making sure my friend ordered his burrito enchilada style versus dry. When I was unsure what I wanted to order, he interjected, ""Paco's mole sampler"" before I could finish my sentence asking what his suggestions were.

To start, we had a vertical flight of Patron (my choice, not Chris's) and the recommended Tostaditas de Tinga which is pretty simple, but a delicious tostada elevated with some heat from the chipotle marinated chicken and the salsa cascabel. The flight with sangrita was definitely a nice sampling of tequila as I'm a fan of Patron, but the tequilas really didn't pair well any of the food and just added to my inebriated state. I think a margarita would have been a better pairing with my food and the only thing that i would have changed. In fact, I'm going to make a margarita for myself right now to make up for my poor choice.

Although we didn't get to speak with Chef Paco because our 10 PM arrival may have been too late, the mole sampler was a nice representation of him and his food. I'm no expert on moles and haven't had many in my life, but I do know it's a painstaking, lengthy process to make in which you have to empty the kitchen pantry and spice rack. I also know these chicken moles, although quite different and distinct in flavor, were fantastic. The guajillo chipotle chile was my favorite mole with a brighter flavor that had me sweating like a mad man.

The mole, the clean and fresh product, the 25% discount for locals on Monday night, the free flan with Yelp check in, and the outstanding service makes El Dorado as good as it gets. I'll be back with hopes that this wasn't just a one time experience, but I'll put some money down that it wasn't.",4,4,4

I came on a Monday because I heard about their local special. 

We were sat almost immediately upon arrival which was nice. 

But then our server came over. And he was weird. He seemed stoned. No joke. 

They bring you chips and salsa almost right away which was nice. However, it's spicy salsa and their water glasses are essentially over sized shot glasses. I was with 3 other people and WE ALL were going through these glasses of water in less than 3 minutes a pop. I swear the poor bus boy had to fill our glasses 15 times. 

We asked for a pitcher of water and the server brought over a pitcher that was the size of a regular glass. (I wish I was kidding).

If you own a MEXICAN restaurant and serve SPICY food then the water glasses should be NORMAL SIZE! I was so annoyed by this. 

We got the steak quesadilla for an appetizer and that was very good. 

But then after that... We waited over 45 minutes for our dinner. We were seated at 8:20 and didn't get our dinner until 9:25. On top of that? The food wasn't great. We each ordered different tacos (Chicken, Fish, and Carne Asada). And all three were  bland and boring. 

The refried beans were gross. I LOVE refried beans and I couldn't even eat a second bite of these. 

The only thing I didn't try were the drinks (they looked very good) and I might come back to try them but I won't be ordering any food. I'll be sitting at the bar.",8,3,3

We also ordered the Queso Fundido with Chorizo and it was amazing. Creamy, spicy, and piping hot with pico de gallo on top - don't pass this one up! It was delicious, to say the least.

I ordered the Chicken Street Tacos while my wife ordered the Chicken Quesadilla, and both were superb. The chicken was juicy with perfect flavoring and the rice served along side of it was divine. 

Last but certainly not least, we got our free flan - and MAN, was it incredible. The chef, Paco, brought it out to us and personally thanked us for coming in.

I totally never considered this place because it is right next to the Sapphire men's club and I just assumed it would be cheesy and it is SO NOT.  The first reason I selected this restaurant for dinner was because I was trying to find a good place for dinner in Vegas that had a good selection of gluten free food.   They have this as well as serving quality foods that can come not just gluten free, but also vegetarian and vegan and the menu is very clearly marked.  

We had a 7:30 reservation and arrived at 7:10 and were seated immediately on Friday night.  It was not crowded when we arrived, so I guess that was helpful!  It was a little dark and I had to use my phone to read the menu, so next time I might ask to be at one of the tables with a light directly above, but otherwise we were very content at our high table near the bar.  The decor is pretty; love the red satin floral walls!  Great ambiance overall.  

Our service was fantastic.  Our server, Lindsay, was friendly, professional and very attentive.  At one point, one of our party of disliked the cocktail that she ordered and Lindsay whisked it away and brought her something she enjoyed more.  She also made menu suggestions and answered all of our questions.  We were visited by multiple people, including a woman I believe is the manager (at least!) and Chef Paco.  They made us feel special and well taken care of. I honestly consider our experience excellent customer service.

The menu has a great selection without going crazy.  Pricing is a little high for Mexican food, but the food is very high quality in flavor and preparation.  I personally had the aguachiles and Mexican Corn and I was very satisfied with my dinner. Some other dishes my friends had were pork (Cochinita) street tacos, mole enchiladas, and lettuce wraps.  We loved EVERYTHING.  OH MY GOSH... the corn!  SO YUM!

I found that if you check in on Yelp, you get free flan, so we all did.  I'm going to tell you, I'm not a fan of flan, but this flan was delicious.  Nice and firm and very tasty.  While we were ""desserting"", Chef Paco brought out a dessert for us to taste that he was working on.  It was a molded gelatin thing with raisins in it and a delicious rum sauce on it.  None of us were super excited about the gelatin, but the sauce was so delicious we all started scooping it onto our flan and we called Chef out again so we could tell him, he needs to put that sauce on the flan and that it is so tasty we want it in a bottle.  He's such a sweetie that he went back and poured us shots of it!!!  He said it was an eggnog rum sauce.  Whatever it is, make sure you ask for some to pour over your flan.  it's the BOMB!

Overall, everything about our visit to El Dorado Cantina was fantastic.  I will eat there again and take my friends and family!  I highly recommend you eat here.  It is a wonderful restaurant.",6,3,3

So I opted for a quesadilla where it said 10.99 or in that range and next to it add shrimp 14.99. Not so bad. When I got the bill for 25.00 I was sure a mistake was made. Apparently the shrimp add on is 14.99! I could have got my preferred meal for less. This was deceitful through way it was written. Use caution when ordering.

I decided to come in right after work and lucky for me, it was happy hour. Street tacos at $2.50 each is crazy for the quality. I had the pulled chicken, al pastor, carne asada, and cochinita. They were all delicious. The tequila list is ridiculous. The fact that they carry Corazon Sazerac Aged and Van Winkle Expressions is a plus. I'm normally a browns fan, so I'll take it.

After eating mediocre hotel food and lacking vegetarian options, friends and I found this spot on Yelp and made our way over. We were told that they were short staffed, but they did their best to give us fair warning and get our food out as fast as they could. We hardly noticed the delay.

Food: Chips and salsa to start are delicious - they give you two types of salsa and both are very fresh and house-made. I had the veggie bowl with brown rice and black beans and checked in for flan. Another friend also got the veggie bowl, but with refried beans and black beans and loved it. I thought it was very good, but was heavy on the rice and therefore almost too filling. If the rice were halved it would still be a great bowl and less food baby-inducing. Guac is extremely fresh, but bowl skimps a little on veggies. I was too full to finish my flan, but that's also great, creamy and smooth.  

Atmosphere: Next to sapphire, the strip club. You can't tell once you're inside the restaurant, though. The restaurant is dark and feels much more upscale than other Mexican spots I've been to. Servers are friendly and helpful and pretty accommodating.",1,1,0

The food quality was the best. Me and a few friends ate here 2 times a week, faithfully. We loved it. 

We made friends with chef Paco, who was very passionate about his food. Honestly I believe he still is, and this my little Yelp minions is where the problem comes to a head.

About 4 months ago one of the guys in the group was escorted out of the restaurant by some goons from the strip club next door. Over what you may ask? A basket of chips. $1.50 basket of chips. We all stayed away for a few weeks, but we eventually returned minus one for this amazing food. 

Now you may think my friend over reacted on $1.50 worth of chips but we are talking $150.00 to $200.00 bills 2 times a week easily.  Again no big deal but a customer was removed over 1.50. We returned despite sour attitude from our friend. Now we only went once a week. On a night this particular friend was unavailable. 

Fast forward to approximately 8 weeks ago. Myself and two other guys walk into the restaurant and sit down at our normal table. Yes we had a regular table. The server takes our order and makes a comment, to the point of "" Chef saw you and said you were barred, but I should serve you anyway"" to which I replied, you have me confused with the other guy, my friend Mike. We let it go and place our order. We receive our food which is the WORST we have ever received. Everyone at table agrees. But being Business owners ourselves. We also understand that kitchens from time to time have bad days. But it was so bad, we keep reminding ourselves and for 2 months we stay away. 

Tonight we return. The food which was MUCH better then last time but still far from the 100% it use to be was served. The meal was finished. We are looking over the check and there is a charge for 1.00 to upgrade to flour tortillas. I ask the waiter why, he says the kitchen says they cost more then corn, and grabs the check and runs away. We grab a menu and check the fajitas out. I ordered steak which is 26.50. It says clearly on the menu, fajitas are served with onions, peppers, rice, beans......blah blah blah and your CHOICE of corn or flour tortillas. No where dose it state 1.00 extra for flour. So again I engage the waiter to point this out. Who no doubt is disgusted and claims to not understand it himself. He said "" any enemy of chef Paco is a friend of mine"" which no doubt tells me he treats his employees as well as his customers. 

I'm done Paco. You can take your flour tortillas and use them to wipe your.......tears because you will receive no more of my nickels or dimes. You can not be so hard up that you offer customers a choice and then charge them if they do not pick what is cheaper for you. When people buy from me and ask for extra powdered sugar I do not charge them a quarter. Your really out of your mind my friend. 

Yes we honestly believe you served us low quality food because you were dumping your Paco power all over us 2 months ago. Because you can't remember who you throw out. So on the note, I fold. It's to bad it's the best flan in possibly the world. 

One more thing the chili is the worst ALL BEANS no meat. Pass on it.",5,4,0

Tableside Guac was very good but noticeably salty, while Albondigas Soup was excellent, with savory meatballs standing out in a hot vegetable-oriented broth.  Although Imperial Shrimp wrapped in bacon and lightly fried was a good starter, I believe the dish would taste better without the fish stuffing.  

My main of a slow cooked Carnitas Rajas Burrito, packed with marinated pork and Cilantro Rice, roasted peppers, Refried Beans, fresh Guacamole, a Mexican blend of three cheeses, and Avocado Salsa in a warm Flour Tortilla, featured tender carnitas and was both filling and satisfying.  But I would have liked more Pico de Gallo and a saucier burrito.  And a mound of Cilantro Rice on the side, outside the burrito, seemed superfluous.  

Seating was comfortable but there was not a heavy server presence, and the waiters who attended our table kept switching.   At meal's end I had to ask two different servers for the check, and the men's restroom was messy.  Nevertheless, because the food here is noticeably fresh, clean, and composed of high quality ingredients, and is available 24 hours, El Dorado Cantina is an asset to the Las Vegas Mexican cuisine dining scene, and worth another look.

3-1\/2 Stars overall on this visit.",8,5,8

I find this to be incredibly insulting, especially when you consider the food and service comes at a pricey expense.

Bland, generic, blah would describe our experience there tonight...and we were so looking forward to this meal, based on the reviews and the fact they are organic and non-GMO.  After sitting for several minutes, ignored by several staff members, we were finally acknowledged by Omar, who was actually pretty nice and as attentive as he could be, as it was really busy.  The empanadas, guacamole, and mole sampler were all just...bland.  Clumsy.  I should never have huge chunks of pepper in guac!  And the chips and tortillas are not homemade.

El Dorado and Ariana made my wedding day super special for my husband and I. We were looking to do a small reception for 50 guests and it was absolute perfection. They worked with us via phone, email, txt, and always catered to our every need with a smile on their face. The space is just perfect, roomy yet cozy, contemporary, casual yet fancy. Whatever you need, they can make it happen for you. They printed personalized menus for us, had a cocktail hour set up for us, and were open to changes up to 2 hrs prior to our event. 

THE FOOD- OMGOSH the food!!! Every single guest of ours, from grandparents to two year olds loved every bit of food, so tasty, so fresh, and the presentation is phenomenal. This is some of the best food I've had even in comparison to some nice places in LA. 

DRINKS- the drinks are just as fresh as the food and are all so tasty. Margaritas\/mojitos made with real fresh lime and piña coladas with fresh blended pineapple. I just can't wait to go back. 

El Dorado is a must go to restaurant in las vegas, hidden right behind the mall near the wynn and behind circus circus. So near the strip and far enough to avoid the large crowds trying catch a table. Probably a 5 minute drive away and Such a quiet relaxing place to enjoy great cuisine and drinks.

The location is a very odd choice - not only is it on Industrial Road (for people who do not live in Las Vegas, Industrial Road tends to be a very seedy access road that runs parallel behind Las Vegas Boulevard) but it is literally right next door to a higher end gentleman's club called Sapphire. Regardless of that, the food is all organic, non-GMO etc, and very good. Considering how that kind of food is normally very pricey, I was surprised that the prices were in line with other non-organic restaurants of comparable style. Our server was very polite and knowledgeable, and the atmosphere was great. There was a little bit of a wait (about 15 minutes) according to the hostess, even though we observed several empty tables. We both assumed it was due to possibly being understaffed, so we hung out at the bar while we waited. In about 10-15 minutes the hostess came over to the bar and seated us. My only objection was that there were large television screens everywhere with baseball being played, but that 'sports bar' atmosphere is pretty much the norm in Vegas now. Luckily the sound was turned off. I would recommend it to anyone - local or tourist, just beware it is beside a 'strip club', so if you tend to be conservative or prudish you may have an objection to the location.

The guacamole was made table-side with generous peppers, garlic and onion mixed in with a mortar and pestle. The best dish was the Carne Asade street tacos, these were truly above and beyond.

I ate light since it was late. So I just got the ELOTE and the CORN RAJAS TACOS. Of course, the elote will never be like the elotes on the streets, but it was close enough! I could've eaten five of them. I did like this because it wasn't as rich. Not too much butter\/mayo. Just enough chili and cheese, and that char grilled flavor is everything.

CORN RAJAS TACOS were amazing. Those poblano peppers really pack a punch in flavor. You get 2, but in all honesty the tacos were very hearty so even one will fill you fast. Well, maybe not for someone with a big appetite.

My friend got the EL DORADO MARGARITA and it was pretty delicious when I tried it, I almost drank his whole drink (oops). Could barely taste the alcohol--which could really be dangerous.

Upon entering the restaurant, I was not a fan of their decor. I thought it was tacky. Anyway, the hostess did not hesitate to seat us. We ordered al pastor, pork carnitas and carne asada. They gave us complimentary chips and three types of salsa. The chips were crunchy (yay for free NOT stale chips!!!) and the salsas were pretty good. I liked what seemed to be a roasted tomato salsa. 

Our orders came quickly! We wanted to share our tacos and asked for plates. To our surprise, the plates were dirty :( anyway, our tacos came out good. It is one of the places here in Vegas that has the closest versions of tacos in border cities. I really like how all of the meats were so tender and seasoned well. Their prices for street tacos were a bit on the pricey side, as compared to others.

Paco is so unprofessional and out of line to handle a back of the house situation like that. As someone who was in the restaurant industry for years, I knew to talk about issues at the end of a shift or on a day off, never in the middle.

The first time we went, we shared a pitcher of margaritas that are full of fresh flavor & there is NO skimping of the tequila - they are amazing.  The chips & 3 salsas that are brought to the table are super yummy.  We also ordered the queso fundido with mushrooms which was tasty.  Then there was the street tacos.  I ordered the carnitas tacos which were delicious.  The rice that came along with them was good (typical mexican side of rice).  We ordered a dessert to share - the fried ice cream.  It was really good.  I've had better versions but it was tasty.  Especially the banana sauce on the side.  The service we had this night was great.

As for the 2nd time we went, we happened to show up during happy hour.  Surprisingly enough, it was not as busy as the 1st night we went BUT the service was so much slower & worse.

My expectations were beyond met at this hidden gem. Started with tableside guacamole from our awesome server mark. It was honestly delicious, followed by a couple more appetizers which were also to die for I especially enjoyed the quest fundido.

We decided to go for a family style meal and just get a bunch of stuff and share, first off the portions are awesome, and the street tacos delicious. We had cochinita which I thought was AMAZING and that's saying alot being from Mexico City which is also where chef Paco was from so I could really identify myself with this menu that brought back nostalgia of the cooking from my home city. 

Overall rating of my experience was superb. To top it all off we had dessert. Churros is what we opted for since it was easy to share but flan was really where my heart was. This is the chefs recipe passed down from his grandmother and I don't say this often but he gives my mothers flan a run for its money. 

Top this all off with awesome locals, industry discount plus a happy hour and you got yourself a winner.

The best:

Service. Our server Layla was friendly, prompt, kind, and attentive. A better server could not be. 

Refried beans.  Often forgettable, this side really stands out here. They're delicious. 

Salsa selection. The trio of salsas are excellent. 

Chile Relleno. Damn near perfect.  

Flan. It's not what I would consider a traditional Flan, but it is delicious nonetheless. 

So-So:

Rice: Coulda been better. Serviceable, but was served cold 

Margaritas.  They're fine, but lacked spark. 

The Bad:

Tacos. Yup, terrible, what they should be a highlight at was an unmitigated disaster. Cold, flavorless, dry chicken.  Tepid , boring, al pastor, and carne asada not fit for a lunch truck.  At $4 a piece, these were a terrible disappointment. 

Pricing. Good Lord, one pays a hefty sum for some great to terrible food.  If you're local, Mondays are the day to come.  There's a discount that will make this restaurant a more reasonable outing.  At a reduced price tag, I would go to get the good bits, but I would not be interested in returning at full price.",0,0,0

Who knew one of the best Mexican restaurants in the states was next to a strip joint? I remember driving there in the cab and the taxi driver kept going oh you mean sapphire? No... I mean the restaurant next to it. I think he waited outside just to confirm I wasn't shy about it. 

That day I stuffed my self. I had tacos guacamole and sopes and I was instantly transported to my moms kitchen. 

I know a chef prides in his food when he comes out his kitchen and asks how the food is and what could go better. Nothing it was all amazing!  He suggested I check in and get a free flan. Hell yes! I'm a sucker for dessert and once again I asked if my mom was in the back cooking.

Service on the other hand. Management needs to step up their scheduling game. Having 2 servers handle a restaurant during the lunch rush hour is really retarded. You had the bartender serving tables as well which led to the servers making their own drinks. Having our food show up before our drinks and waiting over 10 mins for chips and salsa is just awful.

Everything is great - some of my favorites include:
-The house salad, add chicken
-The taco plate (the Cochinita is downright the best taco I've ever had)
-Chicken lettuce wraps (add the habanero sauce)
-Chicken or Mahi signature bowls (makes for 2 meals) -Chilaquiles (you can't beat this breakfast anywhere else in Vegas. This is not hyperbole)

The staff are all super friendly, swift, and thorough. They care about good service and give the place a great energy.

It's hard to find a non-GMO, organic eatery in Vegas. In fact, one of only two of them I know of. There's not much of a market for it in this city; the locals and tourists here aren't particularly discerning when it comes to their food.

I know that this place isn't going to be for everybody. I also know that it takes a certain type of person to walk towards the blue neon of Sapphire at 2 AM for Mexican food. The unassuming entrance gives way to a modern dining room and bar. It's well lit, yet there's an abundance of velvet and mirrors and the knowledge of what is going on on the other side of that wall that give El Dorado its distinct Vegas-y vibe... This isn't the place for children to order quesadillas while their parents drink margaritas!

There are crickets on this menu. 

Delicious, spicy, crickets. You should order them. You'll be a better person for it. 

They also serve Ghost Pepper salsa. You should only order this if you're ready. The flavor is amazing but the heat is serious and lasting! If you're not sure just start off slow and see how much heat you can take (if the habanero salsa they gave you with the chips when you first sat down scared you then don't order the ghost pepper salsa!).  This salsa is one of the most wonderful things I've ever had so if you're of a type that enjoys the flavor of pain I highly recommend this salsa!

There are, of course, many traditional items on this menu that you'll recognize and love: fresh guacamole, tacos, burritos, enchiladas... But they also have a selection of mole` and that's what makes this place special. I tried the sampler plate and found each of them unique and enjoyable in their own way. My personal favorite being the darker, chocolate based mole`.

I almost don't want to write a review, so that I can keep this my own secret place. Loved everything. Fantastic service, starting in the parking lot and ending with a personal visit from the chef. They made the guac and margaritas at the table fresh for us. All organic and gmo free. Great flavors, great prices. I've never had flan that I liked before, until we tried the chef's grandmother's recipe. Yum! A little hard to find, just go to the north valet parking lot entrance of the strip club...open 24 hours. I will be back!

And I found out on Tuesdays they do five dollar shots of Don Julio 1942. But since I came on a Monday which happened to be national tequila day we were able to enjoy the shots for five dollars as well. It's located behind fashion show mall and next to sapphire the strip club. I ordered a mango habanero margarita. And boy this Margarita is extremely hot. My friends ordered a jalapeño margarita which was delicious and more toned down in spice. A few of my other friends ordered strawberry margaritas and a Chamoye Margarita. And while they were good margaritas they weren't the best. I don't think they use fresh squeezed lime juice which is how I personally like my margaritas. The food however was wonderful. We started off with some steak nachos which were great portion they had guacamole sour cream cheese tomatoes lots of flavor. I tried the chipotle chicken which came with white rice and I chose refried beans and flour tortillas. It was so good I think I will try it again. My friends tried their very popular tacos which were small in size but flavorful. Oh and did I mention they are a non-GMO restaurant which is another plus for them. It was my friends birthday so they came out with a big sombrero and Flan which is a Mexican Custard  for her and sang to her which was super fun. Not to mention the dessert was One of the best I have had.,0,0,0

El Dorado Cantina is a great chill place to have a meal, a drink, or just hang with friends. It is a large restaurant with a lot of open space. Great bar with tons of High def televisions. 

The food here is good but not amazing, in my opinion. The delicious items were the table side guacamole, street tacos, and the conchinita pibil....oh yeah the pitchers of margaritas are pretty solid.

I like that they use organic meats and non gmo products...that is pretty amazing.

Service for us was pretty amazing. Our server Enrique was phenomenal: warm, friendly, attentive.....just great.

Prices are not cheap. The guac was $13 bucks, the conchinita pibil was 25. The real deal were those street tacos....I had the carnitas, carne asada, and conchinita pibil ( spicy baby) for 13 bucks...only bummer is they charge for rice and beans....WTF??? 2.50 extra.

What really brought us was that locals get 25% off the total bill on Mondays for locals....and no I did not go next door for a lap dance....although the bouncer wanted me to take a picture with one of their lovely employees....yeah that would sit well with my fam!",11,8,9

The food is incredible, very authentic and flavorful. The three complementary salsas that come with the chips are just a pre-indicator of the delicious food to come.

I ordered the lettuce wraps with steak and my friend ordered the fried ice cream. The lettuce wraps were delicious, however, I received chicken instead of steak. I didn't even bother sending them back because I secretly wished I had ordered chicken; it's like they could feel my desire to change the order hence the wraps coming out like they did. I got the cilantro rice and black beans which were also very tasty. I asked for their hottest salsa and they brought me out what they said was habanero but tasted like tomato. Kind of a bummer, but the salsas that came with the chips & salsa had a good flavor, though not spicy. 

My friend said the fried ice cream was fantastic, and I took his word for it as it was drenched in chocolate and it is not my flavor of choice. 

The restaurant looks neat. Red, golds, and blacks dress the walls beautifully and it's dark, which I really like. The staff is attentive and friendly. I will be back to try the pozole!

We had a very large group, and even though they booked another group over us in the back room, they still accommodated us in the front of the restaurant.   The wait staff was pretty good, especially considering the size of our group. 

They gave us pitchers of sangria on the tables for free. It was nice, but it was pretty watered down, which made it very light. 

They also had complimentary tequila shots on the hour. I think this was for the whole house, and not just for our party. 

Towards the end, Chef Paco came out, and greeted everyone. I took a picture with him and then he made me take another one with a Sombrero. Too fun!!

Ok....now for the food...I ate GRASSHOPPERS!!!!   They have them on their appetizer menu, and someone got an order.  They ordered the garlic lime, but there is a habanero version too. I was proud of myself for eating them...I actually thought it was pretty uneventful. I was worried after the crunch, there would be a squish of guts, but there wasn't. It was just crunchy and tasted like garlic lime.  

For the rest of my meal, I got the table side Guacamole, which was good. I tasted someone's Shrimp Taquitos and they were delicious. And my main meal was the Mahi Mahi Tacos minus the mango salsa. I put some of my fresh guacamole on them instead. The fish was cooked perfectly and flavorful. Oh yeah...The rice was amazing!!!!  I ate every bit of it, but was too full to eat both tacos.

Service was OK, our waiter was friendly and personable, but somehow the bar order got mixed up and took way too long.  I'm not sure what went wrong, but it was too long a wait. The waiter did try to keep up, but I get the sense it was just too busy.  I don't blame him, just was surprised by the wait for drinks.

The tableside guacamole was quite good.  Though, I didn't really like the brand or style of chips they served with it.  The chips were too thin to drip well and didn't have much flavor.  But the guacamole was very good.

My wife had the Mahi-Mahi taco and it was tasty with the mango salsa.

I had a steak\/shrimp fajita and it was OK, but a bit too greasy for my liking and the steak was a bit tough, but the shrimp was grilled very well and was really good. 

I liked that they had a Juan Gabriel concert playing on the TV.  Made it the place feel festive. 

Overall, it's a good place to go, especially for locals on Monday.  But reserve ahead to avoid the crowds.",0,0,0

The food was seasoned exceptionally well. I didn't know rice could taste so delicious. The Executive Chef, Paco, made a visit to our table twice as did the manager. I love a restaurant that understands the importance of locals. There was no rush to place the bill in front of us halfway through our meal like so many other eateries. The Flan, an unexpected treat from the Executive Chef, was excellent. As a person with Celiac disease is often afraid to try a new restaurant, or any for that matter, I was confident that my meal was gluten free. We made a reservation and I indicated that I have Celiac disease. Enrique, our server assured me that he understood my situation. He also informed us that if I wanted to try a gluten menu item the chef would do what he could to make it gluten free without sacrificing quality. We will be back. Monday's=25% off total bill.

It was slow that day so our bartender Tiffany was able to chat with us for a while. She was AMAZING! Took very very good care of us. The strawberry margarita's she made were wonderful, refreshing and strong. 
We planned on eating all this shit but didn't get around to it. We wound up having the fundido with sauteed veggies and mushrooms (outstanding!), a mexican corn (OMG, so good) and the flan (which by the way was complimentary with a Yelp check-in). Everything was great, it really was. But the flan.....I loved it. It's usually runny and very gelatinous looking. This was more creamy, like a cheesecake. Not thick and rich, like a NY cheesecake. Creamy wonderfulness. That's the way I'd describe it.

We were seated in a private little room which was ok but as earlier stated not the cleanest, waiter was okay but just kind of there not talking up any particular dish or recommending any item.

I ordered the pineapple shrimp. The presentation was amazing. Large plate. Halved pineapple with the shrimp, onions cheese and a ton of green peppers inside a nice broth. It was way too spicy for me but the actual taste was good. I was looking forward to sinking my teeth into a tasty chunk of pineapple but there were NO pineapple chunks inside the pineapple. I was a little saddened by this. I ordered an ice tea and I'm not sure if it was supposed to be flavored or not but even after I squeezed the lemon into it it tasted like toilet water. I opted to drink my plain water instead. My smile was promptly brought back though by the cilantro rice and mouth watering flan. Two thumbs up there.

The good- it had a great interior, I loved my margarita, the free chips & salsa were good, my dinner was incredibly tasty. I ordered the two tacos - vegetarian, I believe it was Arbol peppers. It was so very hot though, I didn't realize it, but oh so good. So much flavor. Not much food though, as tacos didn't have much fillings in them. I was able to roll them up like taquitos. Despite the price, It didn't come with an included side so I ordered the Mexican corn as well.. Also very good. I loved what I ate, it was just a lot $ for what it was. 
The not good - our waiter appeared to be very overwhelmed. He was pleasant but our service was slow & didn't see much of him. We saw him rushing past our table a lot. He was even making guacamole table side. I've never seen the waiter doing this job as well. I would hope that management rethinks this. Meanwhile we were waiting for drink refills. My mouth was on fire, so I just drank all of my boyfriends water and he did get his beer later. We did sit there for awhile waiting for our check as well. Next table came after us and left before we got our check. We actually had to ask for our check twice. 
My boyfriend ordered a rice burrito.. I mean a pork burrito. It was all carbs... He said the pork was tasty but there wasn't much of it in there, it was primarily filled with rice and the side that came with it? Yup more of the same rice?! So a lot of filler.

As I walked back to the table, he put one in my mouth, I took a bite, at the same time I glanced at the plates and I immediately spit it out. LOL! I'm not an adventurous eater as he is.

Wow!! We first went there about 3 months ago the food was alright decent for being Mexican food but we loved the customer service great waiter and service manager was friendly, great at checking up on us and making us feel welcomed. However we just went back last week in the morning and the service manager was a different person and she was a nightmare didn't greet us, didn't help, you could tell they were busy and she walked around looking but didn't bother to help. If I can remember clearly her name was meleny? The waiters all seem like they were new, very scattered brained. And the worse part you could hear screaming from the kitchen. Someone obviously stressed out by the rush. Not very professional at all. Just a tip for the owners get your old team back together, that was true customer service. At least that's why we went back, not sure if we will be going back with the change. Better training too, you can tell who the new people are, that's never a good thing especially if they can't keep the standards from before. Management needs improvement.",2,1,0

For dinner we all decided to order the medium sized portion meal that serves several people. The food itself was good and there was enough meat and sides to serve everyone generously. Our waiter was very attentive, but I don't think I will be returning for the following reasons: 1. We saw on their website that on Wednesday's it's HALF OFF all tequila drinks, so we ordered several margaritas as a group. When we received our tab, the drinks were not half off. We asked the waiter to correct this and she indicated that it wasn't initially discounted since it's a ""secret discount"" but it's on their website!! 2. The waiter informed us that each person that checks in on Yelp would receive a FREE flan. The majority of the group checked in and received their free flan (which was delicious). For whatever reason they decided to charge us for each flan on our tab, which we also had to tell her to remove and she did. 3. We had several empty seats in our table and we were done eating, so they asked if they could move us to the bar so another group could occupy our large table. We did not object to this and sat at the bar and continued to order drinks. When we received our tab we noticed that our drinks, tax and gratuity wasn't adding up correctly.

I cannot emphasize enough that the food here is beyond 10\/10. Do not let the gluten free\/GMO free promotional aspect taint your vision, if that's what the thought of ""healthier"" food does to your foodie appetite. We have ordered a variety of food from all over the menu- Mexican corn, imperial shrimp (oh my wow!), aguachile, milanesa tortas, carne asada burritos, shrimp tacos, flan, tres leches, agua fresca, pineapple margaritas...and not to forget the ever so fabulous gratis chips and salsa to start (make sure you request the habanero salsa if you dig spicy).

Even the sides of cilantro rice and beans are moist and packed with flavor, and we all know how disappointingly bland those traditional sides can be at a Mexican joint. 
What knocked off that last star from 5\/5 was the fact both times we went, service was a little slow.

I first came to El Dorado because of all of the billboards that say ""organic Mexican food."" At first glance, my expectations were pretty low. I mean, come on...it's attached to a freakin strip club and it's open 24 hours. When I think of restaurants that are open 24\/7, I immediately expect the food to be similar to the caliber of Dennys. 

Wow, was I wrong! I can't say that they serve authentic Mexican food, because the food I ate in Mexico was definitely not as pretty and did not have as much variety as El Dorado has. El Dorado has managed to find the midpoint between authentic Mexican cuisine and healthy. I don't know how else to explain it. It's simply healthier Mexican food. One of the bartenders explained to me that the entire restaurant is 80% organic. I also love that they offer so many veggie options. I've tried a lot of their menu, but my two favorites are the Chicken Tinga Tostadas and the Veggie Burrito. My boyfriend is a big meat eater and he ALWAYS orders the veggie burrito because it truly is THAT good. Of course their tableside guacamole is a must as well! Most of their entrees come with beans and cilantro rice...OH EM GEE....the cilantro rice is sooooo addicting. I'm drooling right now just thinking of it. It really should be called butter rice because that is the more prominent flavor, but I guess cilantro sounds cooler.

We went with a carne asada burrito and a carnitas burrito. So can't get much more basic than that. The plates comes with what they call cilantro rice (see photo) but my significant other identified it right away as Minute boxed white rice with butter (what my SO describes as ""white people rice"".. her white mother used to make it for her as a child).

Went to the bar, ordered a $7 margarita from happy hour menu. Asked for no salt, got salt on it. Figured find not big deal. Until I took a sip, it was a blended margarita I figured that it got in my drink. I had them make it over. So I waited 30 for basically 1 drink, and then the re make. When there was only 2 other tables In the place and a guy at the 3 ppl at the bar. The drink was still salty!!' So salty I couldn't even take 3 sips, mt throat started to feel dry. The same thing happened to my friend who ordered one on the rocks they remade it. Still salty!!!!  Then after we are seated eating our chips and salsa, they make us get up so they can move the table. Since, 2 people cancelled on us. They could've done that before we sat down. I ordered the carnitas burrito. It comes with a side of white cilantro rice. The rice taste like if someone threw in the half bucket of butter in it. The carnitas was so salty, I unscrewed the pepper shaker and drowned it with salsa so I can try to eat. The guacamole was good inside. I should've just gotten that and tortillas. After our meal we used the YELP in for our free flan. We had 9 people only 4 used the thing for the free flan. Then we get told by the server the kitchen told him it's only one free flan for table. The flans cost $9 so I can see why they are saying this now. If they didn't want that it should specify one per table. They gave us the other 3 if we wrote a review on Yelp. So here it is. If you want to gain 5 pounds of water retention, eat and drink here. They also don't tell you when you ask for things you'll be charged extra. My friend got charged $2 extra for her corn. The server asked on the cob or off. She said off it wasn't until the bill came we noticed the $2 charge. And the corn came after they were done with their fajitas. They asked for both types of tortillas for Charged extra.

How funny! I was thinking oh no what did I drag my friends into lol But once we entered, we were shocked at how nicely everything was decorated. Modern and clean, definitely a nice atmosphere for date nights! I loved the rose textured accent walls and bar seating.
Our server Raphael was really friendly, funny and gave us great recommendations to try since it was our first time. He let us know that they have not even had their Grand Opening yet so I was surprised at the amount of reviews this place had! He also let us know that their food was Non-GMO and were vegetarian & gluten free friendly!  Even better! We were brought free chips and 3 different salsas to start and I loved the flavor and kick that the salsas had. We went with Raphael's recommendation of the Shrimp Taquitos to start and we were glad we did. Good sized shrimp and we loved the chipotle ranch dressing that was served on top. My boyfriend and friend's boyfriend both ordered the Al Pastor Tacos which came with cilantro rice and refried beans and they were amazing! Definitely going to get those next time. Big flavors of pineapple and lime! Yum! The rice was also super fluffy and the beans were fresh and had great flavor as well. I went with the Chicken Enchiladas and my friend went with the Seafood Enchiladas. We loooved the green tomatillo sauce that came served on both. We're used to a thinner consistency in the sauce so we were pleasantly surprised at the creaminess it had along with the chile flavor. Also, there was a lot of chicken and seafood in our enchiladas. Definitely not on the skimpy side! We finished our meal with an order of Tres Leches,  which Raphael warned was a little on the small side but since we only wanted a small taste, no problem. The cake was served on top of the creamy sauce instead of having been soaked in it and it was a nice twist on the classic Tres Leches. Great flavors for this as well. 
This place is definitely 5 stars! Amazing service, authentic food that won't break the bank and a great atmosphere! The only thing that would make this place better would be if it wasn't basically attached to a strip club lol but others might say that's a pro instead of con!

The food is AMAZING, every bite is flavorful and fresh! It's always perfectly seasoned and just simply declious. I've tried the empenadas and gorditas (both beef), guacamole, beef fajitas and my ALL TIME  FAV the steak bowl (I could eat it every second day). Sooo basically the food has been perfection so far and I've heard great things about the flan and the nachos.

The atmosphere is good, it's upbeat and feels young & fun. I like the way it's decorated and they have lots of roomy booths and plenty of TVs to watch games.

Nowwww on to the service.
The first and second time (my fav visits) we had a wonderful waiter. I don't remember his name unfortunately but he had light brown hair and glasses and facial hair I believe. He was super enthusiastic and informative and very professional, he made our visit feel extra special. 

One of the last times I had food from there, I actually called in for take out. I called 25 mins or so in advance and they said It would take 15-20 for our two meals (steak bowl + beef fajitas). I got there and was told to go to the bar, when I got to th3 bar no one knew about my order and all looked confused. The bartender who was helping me (who has an almost shaved head looks like he hates life) finally walked on the other side of bar and I could see him talking to a waitress who CLEARLY forgot about my order. The bartender NEVER apologized, the waitress never apologized, NO ONE even acknowledged the mistake..at all! The manager came by and said just a few minutes just to shut me up..which was annoying actually. 
.....Fast forward 20 more minutes and my food comes, no discount, no sorries ANDDDD they still charged me $2 for my extra side of guac!!! Looool. As the manager gave me my food I told him at least they should have taken off extra guac, the 2 dollars does not make a difference in my life BUT to treat their future customers w more respect. He was like yess you're right..duhh!

I will definitely be back because of the food BUT good food can get old if the plave isn't run correctly over time.",2,0,0

We came around 2pm on a weekday and were seated immediately, food was made quickly and everything was flavorful, autumn was our server and was very charismatic and polite!

We had our 9 year old with is and they had a kids menu and coloring page with crayons. 

We ordered chili soup for our daughter, lettuce wrapped tacos for my wife and I ordered the pork burrito which I asked them to make into a chimichanga! Yum

Chef Paco came out and introduced himself, just adding to the great experience we were already having.

Let me say the food is five stars and the margaritas, well I don't believe I've ever had better.   However....

We had made our reservation through Yelp which was something new but I thought a really great idea.  Made the reservation And received an email confirmation as well as the reservation on my phone in the app and a reminder the day of.   Seemed efficient. Got to the restaurant which is right next door to a mens club which makes it easy to get a taxi back. Walked in, the hostess couldn't find our reservation and said Well, she'd find us a table. Manager was all upset because it wasn't there. I looked down at the reservations on her tablet, there was my name. One star gone for idiocy and a less than stellar table when We planned ahead. 

Got water right away, a real plus because you usually have to ask for it and the server appeared soon after with chips and three salsas. The tomatillo was the best I've had in ages. He took drink orders and then it was probably 15 minutes before we saw him again. I ordered grilled shrimp tacos, hubby cheese enchiladas. Quite a long time before we were served, ate all the chips and no one offered to refill them. Food arrives by a runner, no server in  sight. Hubby was supposed to,have cheese, got chicken.  No server in sight for 15 minutes or so.  Rather than go hungry hubby ate the chicken Ones, said they were good but not what he wanted. Server finally shows up, surprised the food was incorrect and can he replace them. Where was he when the food was served.  Lost a star for that as well.

In spite of the service missteps, the food and drink,were excellent and worth more than three stars.  The place was very noisy.  Apparently they were having some contest and because of being seated where we were it was impossible tocarry on a conversation until the contest was over.

We come to Vegas a lot and will probably go there again since it's organic and just to see if this was a one time lack of service.",5,1,1

Back in those days, when they actually appreciated their business the street tacos were like, $6.50 for 3, and came with a small side of rice & beans. THAT was an excellent value! Now that they are consistently busy they have doubled the price of the street tacos & they also now charge for the small side of rice & beans that used to come free when you ordered the street tacos. So, this place went from being good, unique Mexican food at a great value, to being decent, overpriced Mexican food. Because of this I will cut my visits to this restaurant in half. I feel like it's a real slap in the face to their regular, longtime customers who have been there since day one & helped them advertise with check in's, good reviews, etc. back in their early days when they were struggling to get people through the door.

It soon became my absolute favorite Mexican Restaurant. I always made it a point to bring new friends visiting the area there. I am very much into organic and gmo free eating. Therefore, this concept had me so excited. Yet, they have not been able to maintain the great initial momentum. The servers I had in the past were kind, pleasant, super accommodating and provided excellent service. Then I made the tragic mistake of putting together a Birthday party get together here for one of my best friends. What a complete and utter disaster. The food arrived half cold and somewhat mediocre tasting this time. The male server was just snarky, rude, condescending and would disappear for like 30 mins at a time and the place wasn't even full. The last straw was when I tried to place candles on my friends cake at the end for her birthday. Mister snarky server came back and said we could not have the cake. Even though, he saw me walk in with it. He then came back and said oh we can have it for a $25 cutting fee. i said forget this place. Im done. We just asked for the check and left. Then after all this horrific treatment the server then placed a mandatory gratuity of 18% on the check. I work in the traveling public and prior to this visit. I would tell every new visitor that whatever you do before leaving Vegas make sure to have Mexican at El Dorado. Now I make it a point to tell every new visitor asking me where to eat. I say just make sure whatever you do. Don't go to that scam rip off of a place El Dorado. If you want Mexican then go to Michoacan or Juan's Flaming Fajitas.

There was no one greeting us at the front for a while. I was confused if they were closing?  I walked to one of the table to ask the guy who just started to clean up the table if we're supposed to seat ourselves or are they closing here?  He told me, he'll be right with me.  We had to wait another 5 minutes or so.  I think, it's more important to greet customers than start cleaning a table. There are so many other tables available.

Everyone else that came after us were the same.  There were two tables that were there before us getting upset that they didn't get their food or drinks yet. The lady in the white blouse came by their table and said, ""You good?""  I think she was the manager or supervisor.  I'm sorry, but that's not really professional to start off a conversation with upset guests who requested to speak to the manager like that.  She came by our table and did the same thing.  But she added, you guys got everything you need?  I was thinking in my head, if you look down at our table you can see only 2 entrees were on the table and 2 other guests didn't have any entrees.  That should answer your question, Missy. 

We ordered. 

Carne Asada Burrito  (So Tasty!)
Carnitas Burrito  (Melts in your mouth)
Short Ribs Tacos with Flour Tortillas (+$1 for each taco, must try)
Original Margarita (the lime weren't fresh so it made my drink super bitter)   

Our server was good, I can tell she was really stressed out running around the restaurants.  She did spill my cocktail on the table when she dropped it off, because she was in a rush.  


Food: 5 Stars
Service: 0 Stars

Overall, the food was delicious.  It's definitely a place I would come back for the food.  The service needs to be looked into.  We'll try earlier on in the day next time. 

 Also, just a recommendation for the late night guests.... if you're so short on staff.  Maybe you should have everyone seat themselves and go order at the bar.  Hand out the numbers for the food runner to drop off the food and drinks.  This way it maybe better for your guests to enjoy their time here.",2,0,1

The food was definitely high quality, which I always appreciate. Our waitress who was also our bar side guacamole maker was very knowledgeable about this restaurant and even gave us information we never knew about, which is always a plus because we're locals. And we love to eat!  25% off of menu for locals on Mondays. Yes, all day! Another plus about this place is that they were able to accommodate my vegan diet. The manager even stated, "" I'll make the whole thing vegan, even the rice. It will be with brown rice instead, because our cilantro rice has butter.""  I love it! My veggie burrito made vegan was ok. I didn't like that it had big chunks of squash and zucchini, it kinda over powered the burrito. But I ate half

First off when we got there the setting was absolutely beautiful, the server was very well detailed in his menu knowledge. According to being certified as an organic restaurant, it has got to be 75%, well they are 85%. My friend and I shared a pitcher of margaritas, they were so delicious and strong. And then my boyfriend and I shared seafood enchiladas and tacos. The El Pastor was probably the best. The only thing that I think is a little strange is it is right next to Sapphire strip club. But do not be confused they are not affiliated, the restaurant is a family-oriented place. As a local here in Las Vegas I would definitely recommend this place whether you are visiting Vegas or just a local looking for a good spot to eat. Easy to get to off of the Interstate 15 and service is well and prices are great. I will definitely be back.",1,0,1

I know the place has gotten lot of hype mostly five star kind since day one. In my humble opinion feel like the food was good but nothing trendsetting or off the charts. The food would be 3stars. The service, entire staff, and Chef Paco not doubt five star experience. Everyone on the staff super friendly from the moment you walk in from the hostess, the wait staff, and Chef Paco that guy no doubt love the man passion not only for his food! See Chef Paco walking around the dining room introducing himself, asking for feedback, checking make sure everything is great, and fun friendly guy easy make conversations. I know one of his regular customers. So next thing know started short conversation talking stories about our mutual friends. He telling me about his family flan that passed on from generation to generation that on the menu Our waiter was great came for dinner with friend that also had El Dorado bookmarked. We had few questions being first timers and even asked is could get one of each empanada. He came back said it was ok. So between the two of us got in few things for first timers.....

We started with the empanada like mention the menu choice of three different ones but asked if could get one of each. The cheese, chicken, or beef. I felt like the cheese was the best one out of the three. The portion size was pretty size although was appetizer. My first thought was looks like mini pizza pockets. The presentation liked with the sour cream drizzle on the bottom and nice little shredded red cabbage salad with salsa on the side. Nothing really that was wow. The wings was ok. Just your ordinary basic fried wings with side of ranch and celery sticks. We ordered on the spicy side since my friend likes spicy food. It had not much of kick at all. Our entree we went with street tacos. We ordered one of each (six different ones on the menu) split each one. They were all solid street tacos. We finish was complimentary flan with your yelp check in. The family flam that Chef Paco passed on to him. I love the flan! It not as custard but more dense then regular one. So not as much jiggly going on. Still had nice cream, rich, and filling with every bite. The caramel crust on top was on point. 

The only thing that found odd. Every item that came out was not HOT HOT. Not in spice level but temperature. My idea of street taco you heat the tortilla! Whatever your protein choose throw that on flat top or what not then put both together. Maybe since the restaurant literally next to strip club and way back the building was LVAC. Not sure where the kitchen is or how the place is set up. It was consistent through out our whole meal. The wings thinking deep fry then out but again not even warm warm. Empanada same the filling was not smoking hot take that first bite or cut each on in half since we shared everything. It would have made the dining experience better one.

The table side guacamole or salsa. It looks cool but we never had enough room try that one next visit. They run special all the times on different days of the week. Sunday that one of the better days our waiter was telling us. The Happy Hour prices especially the food times are steal of deal. Like not been mention before might not be in the best of areas, or could get lost thinking going to Sapphire or El Dorado Cantina. Literally both front doors next to one another. If not been El Dorado Cantina place worth checking out. The bar area nice size. Lots of televisions to watch sports, decor has different vibe, and hell if feel adventurous always go next door keep the good times rolling or taking it whole another level. LoL!!!!!",3,3,5

This is not our first attempt to try this particular Mexican restaurant.  Just this past Monday, we tried for an early dinner and there were no open tables till after 10 pm.  We asked ouselves why so popular on a Monday?  Only later we find out it is half off everything including drinks for locals onlye on Mondays. We must remember resevations only for Mondays.  Well that is not going to happen anytime soon. So, we settled  for an early Friday lunch, and ordered  the following :

Chapulines (grasshoppers):  fried in chili lime sauce ... pure protein ... eat together with their awesome cilantro rice ... small sized grasshoppers and the legs don't get in the way ... haven't  had chapulines since we were in Washington DC.

Street tacos:  Carnitas, Al Pastor and Carne  Asada served with cilantro rice and refried  black beans ....  each packed with freshly cooked meats held in a triple skinned  corn tortilla taco ... deceivingly most filling and ravingly delish.

Seafood enchiladas:  two  large flour tortilla enchiladas with cilantro rice and refried red beans ... it was wanting delicious. ... had reached our capacity and most of this entree we took home with us.

As a reward for a check in on Yelp.com, we received a complimentary flan dessert... that Executive Chef Paco personally delivered to our table  ....  perhaps the best tasting flan we have ever devoured, and we are not the only ones to have said the same.

El Dorada Cantina is uniquely situated next door to Sapphires an adult entertainment venue.  At first we were a bit stigmatized while not realizing they were not part of Sapphires. The location brought back memories of a Portland Mexican eatery within a strip club. Another uniqueness is their belief in serving dairy products free of GMOs and antibotics plus all their vegetables, meats and fish sourced from farms that are free of antibiotics, pesticides and steroids.  If you want to learn more about their culinary philosophy check out their website.

Even though we missed out on the half off Monday special for locals, the regular prices were not out of line considering the upscale venue.",8,8,12

A friend visiting from out of town requested authentic Mexican food and this place was at the top of my list due to its high Yelp rating. We were lucky enough to be there on The day when stars aligned - National Taco Day and Taco Tuesday happening at the same time. Also, El Dorado was offering $1 Tacos from 4p-6p in honor of some new menu options. We'd made reservations for 5:30p, but due to needing not only a high chair, but also room for a stroller, we weren't seated for a few minutes. (Of course this place was packed on such a special occasion.) But the manager came by our table within the first few minutes and assured us that we would get our $1 tacos even though time was running out. 

We ordered guac, which is made table side. You can make it as spicy (or not spicy) as you like. We went with no spice, but there was still plenty of flavor - definitely a lot of lime and garlic came through. 

We each ordered five tacos as well as sides of beans and rice for the little ones. My favorite taco was definitely the short rib because the meat had so much flavor!

When dessert time rolled around, I was quite surprised that they let three of us claim our free Flan with Yelp check-in. Frankly, I ordered the Flan simply because it was free (I was far more interested in trying the Deep Fried Ice Cream and the Churros). However, the Flan ended up being my favorite of the three! (I guess I've only ever had mediocre Flan). This was a beautiful custard - not too gelatinous in texture (I hate that), but perfectly smooth and creamy. The flavor was sweet, but not over powering. This will definitely be my top pick for dessert when we come back! 

But don't get me wrong, the other desserts were pretty awesome, too! The Ice Cream's Fried exterior had the perfect chew and crunch and was absolutely dripping in hot fudge! And the churros had a crunchy, sugar-coated outside and chewy inside. 

The chef also sent out two VIP, off-the menu desserts for the little ones - it was a pumpkin cheesecake topped with whipped cream. Talk about about delicious!

I couldn't believe that in one evening we had the chef and the manager come by a couple times to make sure everything was to our satisfaction! And the Chef sent special desserts for the girls? And he gave us $5 off coupons to encourage us to come back and try breakfast?! AND they manager let us know that on Mondays locals get 25% off their entire bill?!? This place is an absolute steal. Especially considering the quality of the food and the artistry and flavor that comes out of the kitchen.

What I got was average food with inflated prices in a sketchy location with tough parking unless you want to valet at the strip club.  Salsas were good not great. Chips very generic average at best.  Ordered combo fajitas chicken\/steak for $26. Average sized portion both meats were average. Sides very disappointing flour tortillas were generic store bought quality. Cilantro rice lacked flavor. Beans were okay. Guacamole\/pico de gallo\/sour cream portion was small to say the least enough for maybe 2 small tacos and were swimming in the liquid from the pico that made the guacamole and sour cream mostly liquid and useless. These fajitas would cost $10 less for better quality at many other restaurants.,2,0,0

It literally is right next door. I thought my friend was joking at first. It's pretty good though, clean, has awesome service and is open 24\/7. The only caveat is that it's on the expensive side.

Within seconds, we were quickly escorted to our tables and got complimentary chips. Our waiter, Juan, was extremely accommodating throughout the entire meal. He made sure our drinks were refilled constantly and came to check on us routinely throughout our lunch. 

I ordered the shrimp tacos with refried beans and cilantro rice rice for $18.50. I really, really enjoyed my dish. The meat was super tasty and you could tell it was well-seasoned from the kitchen. I could taste the citrus marinated grilled wild Pacific shrimp with every bite mixed with fresh organic guacamole, organic cabbage & pico de gallo. There was also a dash of chipotle ranch dressing, which made it even more mouth-watering.

Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Mexican food. We checked-in on Yelp and even got a free Flan courtesy of the chef, Paco. He even came out of the kitchen to introduce himself, which was awesome. It seemed a bit staged though -- you know, us redeeming a coupon on Yelp and him coming outside to greet us.

Unless you don't mind people seeing you there, you should take this into consideration. Onto the atmosphere. It's nice and spacious inside. Welcoming and kinda hip. The menu: the prices were a little higher than most, like on par with a resort property, but located in and industrial area...next to a strip club. I was there so I gave it a shot. I'm a keto\/low carb eater so I ordered the bowl with carne asada which is $18. I asked the waitress if I could hold the rice and beans and maybe just have lettuce instead. ""No problem!""  One coworker ordered the tostada for $14 and asked for chicken (even though they served him beef).The food was nicely presented but lacking flavor. The bill came. Wow!  My sub lettuce for no rice\/beans was an extra $4! Iceberg lettuce for $4?!?! My coworker's ""tostada with chicken"" was an extra $7!

Well first off this don't let this place put you off by being right next to a strip club. They have their seperate entrance and it's no problem to bring your kids. The first time we visited I had the tropical salad. By salad standards it was so delicious. This second time dining here just surpassed all my expectations. It was National Taco Day on taco Tuesday so they had a promotion on their signature tacos for ONLY  $1!!!! I actually found this posted on Facebook. You really can't go wrong with dollar tacos anywhere, especially when El Dorado is promoting it. They had so much to choose from. However the promotion only allowed 5 tacos max per person so I had to choose wisely. 
SIGNATURE TACO CHOICES: 
- Queso Mexicano - Short rib
- Salmon - Lengua
- Cactus - Cabeza
- Chili Verde Pork w\/ chicharrón FAVE
- Octopus & Chorizo - Langostino 
My husband and I choose differently so I got to taste them all and they were all absolutely scrumptious. Cooked and made to perfection. When we got them the manager (I want to say) presented them all to us. Which is something that I appreciate. 
For dessert we ordered fried ice cream and flan. The chef, Chef Paco came out and presented the dessert and personally gave us his card. He was such a nice guy. He even gave our boys churros filled with dulce de le he. Free of charge. Lets talk about the desserts. Fried ice cream... it's fried! duh! of course it was delicious. The boys churros! Their lucky it was for them. 2 seconds it woulda been gone had I had my way. And the flan...
TIP: check in with yelp and get a FREE FLAN!!!! 
Don't miss out on this incredible offer. Incredible because their flan IS THE BEST I have EVER HAD!!! I'd come back just for the flan. No joke! 
What I forgot to mention in the beginning was that we ordered margaritas on the rocks because it was the only happy hour drink they were offering away from the bar. I hate to say this because I love this place but the drinks were really disappointing. To me it was more of a limemade with a hint of Tequila. Hopefully in the future they can get the Tequila and mix ratio right. 
Our waters were always filled and our waitress Ericka was so sweet and always made sure we were ok. Service like this, sadly isn't everywhere I dine at, so I really appreciate and praise when a business shows that they really care for their customers.

His sister had a quesadilla and she said hers was great too. They got the churros for dessert and I did not partake, but they could not stop talking about how life changing they were!

My mom, sister and I arrived on a Wednesday afternoon around 4:30, and there were barely any other people in the place (not unusual for this time and day). We each ordered a margarita ($11) and they were huge, but they didn't do a lot for us. Not much different than other places.

The food is where it got bad. The chips come with three salsas, and it's $3.50 for a refill. The salsas are okay, lacking in flavor. I ordered the tacos al pastor(which admittedly is never very good in anywhere but a taco stand off the beaten path), and the meat was extremely dry and hard. The rice and beans had no flavor. My sister ordered the seafood enchiladas, which were supposed to have pacific shrimp, mahi, and scallops. What they came with was tiny bay shrimp, literally zero scallops, and the mahi was more like canned tuna. The sauce on her enchiladas was quite tasty though! My mom ordered the mole platter, which was the best of the three dishes. It came with three different kinds, which I haven't seen done before. All three were very flavorful and different from one another, and the portion was HUGE! Two or three people could have split that one dish. There only issue was the meat was a bit dry. 

The plus side is the service was actually excellent! Our waitress even offered my mom ice for her injured knee :)

We both love Mexican cuisine, the more authentic the better.  So, we were easily sold on the place by the very positive reviews from the local Yelp community.

There's really nothing new or different that I can add on top of the nearly 1000 reviews of this place.  Service was fast, friendly and attentive.  The first round-gratis chips tasted fresh made and were crispy without oiliness.  The salsas were flavorful, spicy, and were true standouts.  I applaud the fact that they had Chapulines and our server's recommendation to have the garlic and lime over the habanero was a good call.  They were delicious.  I love pozole.  El Dorado Cantina's pozole was the best rendition that I've yet encountered.  I'll leave it to the wife to recount her experience, but suffice it to say she left completely satisfied.  Prices were reasonable and portion sizes were a solid value in relation to its price.

El Dorado Cantina was the definition of a local gem.  It served up some of the best, authentic Mexican food that I've had in a long time.  For tourists, it's a worth a trip off of the Strip to eat here.  For locals, thanks for not keeping this place a secret.",6,3,5

The bartender was really helpful in suggesting drinks, especially when the one I contained items that were out of stock. Some people mentioned that the drinks were expensive, each is around $12, but being from DC this feels pretty routine for me, and in Vegas the price is fair. 

We were seated promptly after receiving our drinks. We had a nice booth in the main dining room. Our server was so nice and very on top of all of his tables. We ordered the table side guac as an appetizer. I highly recommend it. I am a huge fan of Mexican food and I always order table side guac, and this was the best one I have had to date!

spot for our household! We've been here on multiple occasions. Last night we caught Book of Mormon Broadway show at the Smith Center and needed a satisfying and bursting of flavor meal afterwards. That's kind of hard at 10:30pm to go to a half decent spot. 

This spot is open 24\/7 and right next door to your local Sapphire Strip Club! What a brilliant restaurant owner. If you're coming for dinner it's best to have reservations. Lucky for us it wasn't too busy! (Perhaps time was on our side)

As many Yelpers could agree THE TABLE SIDE GUACAMOLE is everything. One bite and you'll understand why it's worth the $14. Also, the house FLAN is MUST so take a couple less bites of your entree to save some room! (;

The menu is pretty simple so it's easy to pick your typical Mexican dish. (Great!) The staff is friendly and excel in great service. However, like most of the great spots around time it. Service always depending on how busy they are. So it's a hit or miss but the food makes up for it. 

Overall, El Dorado Cantina is about convenience, great authentic food, great decor, great staff, great organic and non-gmo food for the health cautious eaters. 

Negatives.... Insufficient parking spots, awkward venue next door, only one complimentary chips basket that they announce so awkwardly from the start. 

If I was the judge of your potential selection of this spot it's MUST spot to check out it may need a couple visits in order to become a favorite. IT'S WORTH IT.",2,0,0

I don't even like a lot of salt but they were very light with it. They get huge points because they have vegan and vegetarian options and they are GMO free. The chef is very nice. He came out and introduced himself. Also they are open 24\/7...which is weird to me. Apparently they accommodate to the strip club next door. I just hope they don't end up losing money.

Due to location and distance the discount definitely was enticing.  We started off with a pitcher of Margaritas.  It was a good size pitcher and they were decently strong .  The good thing was the non drinking wife is my built in designated driver.   
   For appetizers we had the Empanadas, Shrimp Cocktail and Shrimp Taquitos.  They were all very good.  The empanadas were as good as my former neighbor made for me every Christmas.  They use good shrimp which are fresh tasting and don't have the weird aftertaste you get from frozen shrimp sometimes.  That made they cocktail and taquitos really good.  We got a bowl of the Albondigas which was ok but not the best I have ever had.  
  We had shrimp tacos, Cilantro Garlic Shrimp and Carne Asada Plate for dinner - note there was 3 of us.  I am not that big of an eater.  The Shrimp Tacos and Garlic Shrimp was very good and really hit the spot.  The Carne Asada reminded me of a place in Rosarita I just loved.  The meat was well seasoned and so tender.  
   We finished off this mini foodie fest with the Tres Leches Cake and Leche Flan.  They were both amazing desserts.   A perfect ending to a very good meal.  Our server was Amber and she was incredible.  Despite the place being packed and Amber having several tables she made sure we were well taken care of.  
   They can get busy on Monday's so I made reservations of which I highly recommend.  They were turning people away the night we were there.  it is an odd location as they are not too far from the strip and also next to a Strip Club they share a parking lot with.  With the discount they were very reasonable.  Without the discount too expensive as they are no better than the nice Mexican places not near the strip.",10,1,5

Everyone in my party ordered tacos and we were not disappointed!  Tacos come with a side of rice and black or refried beans.  I got the carne asada.  The meat was tender and seasoning was very tasty.  I didn't mind not having Spanish rice at all because the white cilantro rice was so good along with the black beans.  My only complaint was the temperature of my food was not hot.  I almost sent it back but was starving and tired so I happily ate away.

I had the Carne asada burrito and it was top of the line.  unbelievable good taste.  supposedly they marinate the meat in orange juice.  no fat and no nastyness.  pure tenderness in every bite.  the chips they served with the quesadillia were also delicious and homemade.  

salsa:
they have 3 salsas.  green red  and orange.  green and red are the mild salsas with awesome flavor.  the orange salsa is the habanero salsa.  on the king taco red sauce 1 to 5 scale with 5 being hotest. it's a 4.  it also has a great flavor.  they don't bring it out because people don't use it

quality\/price:
this place is all organic.  For organic food, this is very inexpensive.  the presentation of your food is outstanding.  like in a 4 star restaurant.  they also have two different stevie sweeteners for your coffee or tea.  we had a jalapeño margaritas which was interesting but it wasn't a good match for the food.  they did poor heavy on the alcohol so you got yor $13 bucks worth on just the alcohol

service:
went in last night and had Joaquin as our server.  super nice guy.  he noticed that the kitchen messed up and wanted to get us something else.  we said it's not big deal.  there was also a delay on getting the Margarita which wasn't his fault. he brought out flan for free which also turned out extremely delicious.  

went in for lunch the next day and was served by Tiffany.   she was the sweetest waitress we have ever encountered in vegas.  she made us feel like family.  she was also super efficient, polite, quick for service.",1,1,1

Don't let the location of this place deter you from trying it out because I guarantee you that you will be missing out on really amazing food.  
     The restaurant is directly connected to a Sapphire's Club strip club as in the door to the strip club is probably several feet off to the side of it which is located close to the strip behind the Fashion Show Mall in what looks to be stripper sex lane.  Pay no mind to any of that.  
     This place piqued our interest because it's 24\/7 and it just doesn't get any better than that in the city that never sleeps, but it also has a promotional free flan with check-in offer. My partner in crime has been in an epic search for the best flan out there. The decor is really pretty with satin looking crafted roses as wall paper set against a more dim setting and a spacious area that has rounded booths, elevated tables as well as a bar area. 
     We got a complimentary basket of nachos that was served with chipotle? (brownish) and a tomatillo salsa. Both of the salsas were flavorful, fresh and a refreshing change to the pico de gallo that is often served with nacho chip baskets. We ordered queso fundido as our appetizer. Flour tortillas are an additional $1, but it's not that big of a difference because the corn tortillas were delicious.  It arrived piping hot in a skillet and was quickly devoured in all of its melty, cheesy goodness.  For entrees, we chose the beef enchiladas in red sauce as well as a trio of tacos.  You can choose three tacos for $13. It may seem steep in price in comparison to the taco joints we're all used to frequenting on Tuesdays or into the wee hours of morning after clubbing,  but it's definitely worth it. We selected cochinita, carnitas and al pastor. Neil accidentally brought carne asada instead of al pastor, but he quickly went to get the al pastor and let us keep the carne asada.
     The carne asada was delicious,  but didn't make much of an impression on me. I always choose carne asada at my taco joints, but hey its way healthier here.  The al pastor complimented the sweetness of the pineapple chunks.  The cochinita was so flavorful and juicy. I have to really talk about the carnitas here. I have never had such flavorful and juicy carnitas in my entire life that is also organic. And I lived in East LA my entire life! Just thinking about that carnitas taco has me wanting to go back to Vegas. It's just taco heaven! All we were missing were Micheladas and everything would be complete.  The tacos are stacked with meaty goodness. My beef enchiladas came with a flavorful red sauce,  black beans (Your choice of black or pinto), and lime rice.  The black beans were standard and the rice was good, but nothing special for me.  I much prefer the fluffy, red rice that the suegra cooks up. Yum! The enchiladas were filled up with so much delicious beef. El Dorado also offers a seasonal variety of freshly made aguas - Neil offered us a sample of pina and jamaica (By sample,  I mean decent glass). The jamaica was ok, but the pina was great.  It had the perfect blend of sweetness that was subtle,  but delivered the pineapple flavor home. 
     Now, the piece de resistance!  We were stuffed,  but just had to try some dessert. Neil took our complimentary flan check-in and we ordered some churros. The churros were perfectly crunchy with a soft core.  The caramel filling was a nice touch and could be enjoyed standalone. I really enjoyed the bananas foster one. It tasted similar and had the same consistency of a caramel dip, but tasted much better.  Now, I used to love flan,  but had too much,  effectively killing my taste bud for it. My partner in crime was anxiously anticipating the flan ever since we yelped it. The flan was cooked perfectly.  The caramelization of the sugar was just right. The texture of the flan was closer to a custard.  We both preferred a slightly more formed flan,  but with each bite came a flooding of goodness that our taste buds greedily gobbled up. It was a pretty divine.  Even the whipped cream and raspberry decorative garnish tasted delicious and real (organic).
     I can't rave any more about this place,  then I already have.  For starters,  it's great to see a server such as Neil who is attentive and on top of his duties.  Often times,  a great restaurant can be ruined by a horrible dining experience which is usually attributed to the servers.  Neil not only was informative,  but he was ready and available to answer any questions and owned up to the taco.  He was delightful to have as a server.  Chef Paco even took the time to bring out the complimentary flan.  After 1,000+ reviews, it was so nice to see a chef take pride and joy in his work. The biggest thing about this place is how healthy and organic everything is without sacrificing or compromising taste. This is gonna be a go to place for us whenever we're in Vegas.",2,1,2

I ordered the empanadas and this red soup, sorry the name escapes me. The staff was really friendly, and attentive. The empanadas were okay, but the soup man....the soup. That was pretty killers.

I had agua shrimp which are marinated in lime.

I asked for a lime to squeeze on it and a avocado. We also had a veggie salad which on the menu claims it's loaded with all kinds of veggies. The veggies were cut into such tiny little minute pieces you could barely find them. But I will give it the fact that it was totally fresh. Oh the dressing that came with it was thicker than tomato paste which was kind of weird. Both my partner and I did like the flavors. And once again about our server she never came and cleared the plates. I guess this is a pet peeve of mine I have dirty plates everywhere when I'm eating something else.

Who knew Strip clubs are so packed on a Tuesday night.  

I had the sangria and the steak fajitas.  The best part of the meal is the rice that has been mentioned in other reviews.  It's not that my meal was bad but it wasn't mind blowing, which I expected based on the 1200 plus reviews.  Also, a turn off for me is being charged for chips after your first complimentary bowl.  Their price point is high for what you are getting so free chips should not be a problem.  Also not a fan of how they present the receipt.  The tortillas showed up as a an additional charge even though they appear to come with the meal.  The mango in the mango margarita also showed up as an additional charge as did the the wet burrito.  That's the only charge that makes sense to me because that is an order modification.  Maybe this is just the way their computer system works but they should fix it so it doesn't look like you're paying extra for everything.  That was a turn off to me.

But I was unexpectedly underwhelmed by the actual food. So much so that I don't clearly remember what I ate. I recall a great tableside guac. The taquitos were fine, nothing to write home about. The burrito I tried (pulled chicken, maybe?) was bland and dry. The tres leches cake was awesome, and I'm not usually a fan in the first place. I know I tried several other items, but I can't remember them.

Pricing is a bit high for Mexican food and for the location, but obviously the organic, non-GMO, etc ingredients cost a premium.

10 min later and we had asked to order - still waited another 5 - I think we don't know her well enough - she's serving everyone around us in excess so maybe we are not that cool. I dunno. I'll try harder ? Someone here should.

My family is in town and was hyping this place up all night. Anyways we arrive at the restaurant and Mayra was our server. We ordered our drinks and poof she is gone we don't see her again for like ten min. The bartender notices we don't have chips and salsa so he gets here to come over and bring us some. She admit it slipped her mind and we are understanding that we are human mistakes happen. So we order our food and poof she is gone again we don't see her for about 15to 20min.

One of my pre-Vegas checklist items was ""I want great Mexican food"" - and while there were plenty of options that didn't require a cab, the reviews and pictures of this place pretty much spoke for themselves.

After several hours of thrill riding on top of the Stratosphere, we took a cab over to El Dorado.  (Yes, way closer than taking it from the Delano, we purposely planned it this way.)

First off - check in on Yelp.  I stress this only because El Dorado grants you a free flan.  You may think..yeah, i'm not much of a fan of flan...but this is different.  I'll get to that, trust me.

The chips and salsa pretty much followed us to the table - and when they say ""that salsa (pointing at one bowl) is hot"" they really do mean it.  Hot hot hot, but very good.  The others were much less ""my mouth is on fire"" and went pretty quickly.

Thirsty?  Yes.  Good thing the house margaritas are phenomenal - and big enough to last most of the meal.  Highly recommended.  Sip one, down one and sip one, down two and sip one...it all depends on how you plan on getting home.  ....Cab.

Don't blink an eye when contemplating the tableside guacamole - get it and eat it all.  Definitely in the top 5 ""tableside guacamole experiences"" i've ever had.

While there were plenty of tempting options on the menu, we wanted to try as many things as possible.  We ordered fish tacos immediately, and got four kinds of street tacos as well.   All.  Were.  Awesome.  You can close your eyes and just point at a bunch of stuff, you'll be happy with whatever comes.

Now you are full - but don't forget about that flan, which leads to a conversation about Chef Paco.  The epitome of a chef that cares about the food he makes, he came out to say hi and to make sure we enjoyed everything we ate.  That's when we found out that the flan is his grandmother's recipe, homemade on the daily.  Off the charts authentic - and absolutely delicious.  

Annnnd I'm all about good churros, so, of course, I had to order those too.  These guys had some weight to them and were also absolutely delicious.  Between the food, drinks, and two desserts...we were full for the rest of the day.

Everything here is organic, non-GMO, and fantastic.  Paco really cares about the food he prepares, and this is absolutely worth the trip.  

Oh, and did I mention it's open 24 hours?  WHAT?!?

I think they are really trying to make an impression. The food is great. This coming from a dude who grew up in the San Joaquin and knows what is and is not good Mexican cuisine. The place is off strip and was extremely slow on a Saturday afternoon in January. I had the carnitas torta and it was very good. It was not awesome until I added the pickled veggies on the side to the sandwich. The carnitas is sufficiently mild and flavorful that the light seasoning is probably the right approach. However, it just didn't fire all the cylinders for me until the zing of the pickled veggies (I think it was carrots, jalapenos, Anaheims, onions, and coriander greens) was added to the kit. I appreciate slow-cooked flavor and subtle fatty mild goodness but for a torta you may as well go all in. Jesse was our server and he was awesome. He took responsibility for the place and owned the experience. Congenial, professional, personal, and honest. Jesse was a lot more than I expected from the establishment connected to one of the world's largest stripper joints! This place is not to be missed. We walked there from the strip which was about a 15 minute investment just in getting there. Worth the walk and the exercise helped to ease the levity of ""Paco's Grandma's Flan"" which was, in all honesty, the crowning work of everything we ate while in Vegas. Get down to El Dorado people.",0,0,0

Uniquely Vegas because of the location. No fear for the shy, El Dorado has their own door so you don't have to walk through a strip club to access the restaurant.

Our waitress was very attentive and was always around when we needed something. Our water glasses were refilled often and empty dishes were cleared quickly.

The salsas that comes with the chips to start were really good. That definitely set the tone for what was to come. Both the red and the green were fresh and flavorful. We also started with Beef Empanadas. They were good, but not out of this world flavorful.

The Chicken Enchiladas were really good. I loved the sauce on top of the enchiladas. The rice and beans on the side were nicely seasoned. The Mexican Corn had a nice flavor. My husband enjoyed his Short Rib tacos as well. 

Dessert that evening was the Flan that is free with Yelp check-in. Flan is not my preferred dessert, but this was really good flan.

I got the Chicken Milanesa.  Others got burritos and tacos.  Some liked it, most didn't.  Pretty pricey for okay Mexican food.

This place kept popping up on my Instagram and I think I yelped Vegan Mexican food and it came up. I looked the menu and was instantly intrigued! They have quite a few options they are able to make vegan, and gluten free dishes as well if that's an issue for you as well! Mexican food veganized is one of my favorites these days! 
The restaurant is nice inside, very spacious and has those round booths so you can just cupcake in there or whatever 
They automatically start you off with chips and and a salsa trio too. I love me some authentic salsa. The mild was actually my favorite as far as taste goes but I wish it had been the spicy one! The spiciest one was just like FIRE. Not really too much flavor in it, just HOT.
I ended up ordering the Veggie Bowl with brown rice and black beans. Unfortunately the cilantro rice isn't vegan otherwise I would have been all over that! 
They use the freshest ingredients, NON GMO products thank you very much! My bowl with FILLED with veggies and I'm eating the leftovers right MEOW! 
I love restaurants that have really opened up to being able to cater to all types of different diets! I also love that all the vegan dishes were fresh veggies and didn't include meat substitutes. NOM NOM NOM! If you're feeling some Mexican food, definitely go try out this spot!

Once we had to remind the guy server (during the day during the week) that we ordered guac. He looked put off like he didn't want to to it.

Both times our rice was cold. My husband said he will never go back. I agree, the food didn't taste the same, was barely warm and bland.

Also I will not go back here because an ex employee told me that their chips are not NONGMO anymore and the owner\/manager cuts corners and buys regular produce and items that are GMO to save money.

I've eating at over 100 Mexican restaurants and have had many Mexican friends families' cooking. This is said to be the best and most authentic Mexican food in town, but A. I wouldn't be surprised if the chef\/cooks aren't Mexican B. Although they claim to be organic it is not good. Chillis is 10 times better and it's a chain restaurant (which I don't generally like chain restaurants). The only thing I liked was the salsa verde, but I wouldn't say it was authentic lol.  The service was also horrible and the place wasn't even busy. We got there and I ordered a water and my girl ordered a juice. They brought us chips and salsa. The chips were mediocre and the like I said I liked the salsa verde. I drink a lot of water but the only time my water and I finished my glass before the food came out but I only received more water after the bill came and we were leaving. My girl doesn't eat a lot in the evening for some reason and we ordered chicken and shrimp fajitas($28\/1 before tax) together to share which came out fairly quick. Usually fajitas are full of flavor but these were bland. The tortillas were no good. The guacamole was not impressive, the black beans weren't good and I love guacamole and black beans! The server seemed nice at first and spoke to us in another language which we spoke fluently too, as well as English fluently. They brought out two plates of fajitas and dropped them off quickly, said they'll bring plates for us to eat on and ran off and I didn't see our server until we nearly done eating. At first I thought oh that was nice of them to split the order which some real Mexican restaurants have done, but then we realized it was a lot of food and we realized they brought us two orders of the exact same thing. We just ate one of the plates until our server came so we could let her know that we only ordered and wanted one order of fajitas. She didn't come check on us until we were almost done. They never brought plates, filled water, asked if everything was ok, asked if we needed anything, etc. and it wasn't even busy. When we were almost done our server came and we nicely let her know that we just ordered one order of fajitas like we said initially. She started yelling and arguing, saying we are wrong and basically calling us liars saying that we said 2 which we never said the word two at all. She said, no you ordered two. Then she's like I'll get you a box and you can take it to go, at this point I'm thinking I don't even want it, but ok maybe she'll be nice and civil and take it off the check. She boxes it up and then comes back with the check and I thinking positively, since she made a mistake it would only make sense to nicely correct it on the check at least. Sadly she didn't, so I said again that we only ordered one plate of fajitas and she yelled and argued (illogically) with us although we didn't want to make a scene she had no problem making a scene. She said that she was also the manager last night. This is by far the most negative review I've ever written. My girl and I are pretty positive people and although we were unhappy and upset, we joked about it the rest of the night. Needless to say I will tell everyone to not go here and I was expecting the opposite especially since there aren't many organic restaurants in town besides maybe the Fremont area. Save yourself and don't go here, it's a waste of time and you can find much better places.",2,2,2

We decided to sit at the bar. We sat there for a few minutes and were given water and chips and salsa to begin with. We were told so and so ""guys name"" would be with us in just a minute to take our drink order. We sat there for at LEAST twenty minutes before we had our margaritas in front of us. Meanwhile a girl comes up to us and takes our drink order and asks us if we are ready to order. We told her we wanted to start with a pitcher of margaritas and a tableside guacamole, she came over with the guacamole cart and a big lava rock molcajete to make it in. I was excited! She proceeded to prepare our guac, still no drinks! My boyfriend and I were getting anxious for our margaritas so we started paying more attention to the bartender and saw that he was on and off the computer and yes doing his job, but very visibly with no sense of urgency. The girl making our guac finished and made sure we had everything we needed. We then proceeded to eat our guac which was nothing special and still NO DRINKS! Finally we look over to the bartender and we see him on the phone and preparing what looked like to be our pitcher of margaritas. I will say it again, after at LEAST twenty minutes we finally had our drinks and you would think after a wait like that the margaritas would be awesome, but it was the contrary, the margaritas were a flop. 

By this time my boyfriend was feeling irritable because of the non professional demeanor of the bartender and the long wait for the drinks. So we moved to a table to feel more comfortable. And this is coming from people that never sit in the dining room, we always prefer to sit at the bar. Anyway, I had the carne asada and honestly it was the freaking best carne asada I've ever had. It was amazing and the whole dish was put together with perfection and it even came with a bit of chorizo which was a nice touch. My boyfriend had the tacos; his order actually came out wrong but we didn't say anything, he ended up getting one of the pastor, one of the carnitas, and one of the cochinitas tacos. He liked them and had no issues. The manager on duty made it a point to come over and talk with us about our experience and also the head chef came to our table. This is the reason I am giving them four stars. The management really cares and made it a point to come and see how our experience was going. We mentioned to Chef that our margaritas were no good and immediately the manager came back to the table and offered us a margarita on the house. We declined because we weren't going to make a fuss but we really appreciated the gesture. All in all our experience was really a three star rating because of how it started. But by the end we give it a four star rating because our food was amazing and the management really saved the night.

So we went.
#1. It's in a really sketchy part of town; it's actually attached to the Sapphire strip club although you can't see or hear any of the noise from the strip,club inside the restaurant. So the decor is ""used to be a strip club"" garish...but interesting at the same time. FYI: if you go, tell your cab driver to GPS the name of the restaurant, not the address, our cab driver couldn't find it with the address so we had to type in the name of the restaurant.
Anyway. The food is good. Very much legit Mexican food, although it wasn't ""Tex-Mex"" to me (so I take exception with the reviewer that says this place can stand with any Mexican place in Texas) but it was good. I had the carnitas street tacos and my wife had steak nachos. Very good; fresh jalapeños so a little extra zing. That's a good thing, because the salsa was just so-so. Chips were good. Service was excellent. Crowd was eclectic.

But with the Mexican food within a 2 mile radius of this place and up and down along Charleston with prices half that amount it is hard to justify that this is the number one ""Mexican place"" in Vegas.

First, don't be fooled by the bad reviews about it being attached to a strip club! Yes, you will see the people going into the strip club. Yes, you will see some of the club bouncers. No, they don't share a kitchen. If you don't want to, you never have to enter the strip club! Get over it! It's in Vegas!

When I went in, I immediately sat down at the bar. Tiffany was my waitress\/bartender. I got a sampler with Imperial Shrimp (seafood stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon), Tostaditas de Tinga, and Empanadas. Also got a plate of al pastor tacos and a side of the ghost chili salsa. Finished with the churros. Had a couple of beers with all of this and a jalapeno margarita.

Everything was...AMAZING! First, I don't like shrimp. I don't hate them, but I don't like them. The flavor of the shrimp with the bacon was amazing! The texture was perfect and they were perfectly cooked. The tostadas and empanadas were the perfect size, and everything tasted extremely fresh. They weren't overly seasoned and they went perfectly with the Double IPA I had. The tacos were also perfectly prepared with just enough of every topping that you didn't feel overwhelmed by anything. I ended up putting the ghost chili salsa on the tacos because the flavor was the perfect compliment to to the tacos.

While waiting for the churros, I had the jalapeno margarita. It had the perfect amount of kick while not being overly sweet. The spicy flavors with the salt and the tangy lime made it blend really well.

Finally, the churros. Ohhhhhhh...the churros. I can't say enough about them! They are stuffed with apple and are AWESOME!!! Wow! If you go here for nothing else, then get the churros! 

All of this comes together with an amazing staff. Chef Paco makes some killer food and is extremely funny and nice! He comes around to everyone to check on them, talk about the food, and just generally seems to love to have a good time! Tiffany was also AMAZING! She made the salsa in front of me and also made the margarita.

We initially passed by the location a few times due to a combination of the dark street, discreet signage and the unexpected location surroundings - but were pleased to receive some of the best service I have ever experienced, a great food selection in a very cool and relaxed environment.

Don't let the location deter you from trying this restaurant.

We were promptly greeted at the front door by the hostess who seated us at a back table. While the restaurant was a bit dark, it seemed chill\/cool\/clean.

Our most outstanding waiter, Andy, visited the table, discussed the menu with us and provided recommendations. He was able to name-drop the farms where El Dorado sources their meat and brought out watermelon agua fresca for us to try, be still my beating heart. I love agua fresca and their offering did not disappoint.

We opted for the:

Tableside Guacamole - Gluten Free & Vegan
Chipotle Chicken
Cochinita Pibil
Watermelon Agua Fresca

The guacamole was on point and we ate so much, so quickly, that by time the food came out we didn't have much room left. As native Texans, we both should have known better than to eat 8,000 pounds of corn chips before a meal but who can say no to avocado. Andy made it so perfectly spicy, I wanted to cry (tears of happiness).

I found the Chipotle Chicken to be on the dry side, but the sauce balanced it out a bit. It should be noted that I took most of it home and promptly stuffed my face with it the next morning. It was my main source of fuel for the Rock n Roll marathon later that evening.

The service was outstanding, the food was solid, and the environment was both relaxed and comfortable. Definitely worth a visit.",0,0,0

So why only 3 stars? The server\/service  is part of the atmosphere and can make or break a dining experience. 

Jessie our server was cold and impersonal. I have never had a server appear to be so disinterested. I am hoping he was just having an off day and that he is normally as  upbeat and helpful as the restaurants other servers.  He's attitude and demeanor greatly diminished our experience.

Defiantly maybe. The guac is amazing (and also made fresh to order) and the chicken street tacos, I could talk about those gems for days my fat friends.

Had the table side guac (except we didn't have it made table side since there were only 2 servers on and it was pretty busy, they might want to staff better) but none the less it was amazing and then we all had enchiladas, so good! and the house margarita was huge and delicious! definitely will be going back soon since they are open 24 hours!",0,0,0

Starlord was our server.  He was quick and attentive.  Our meals came to the table very quickly.  Everything was delicious.

Long story short, the chef came out and yelled at is cause we didn't like the food and found a hair. And the waitress was super snarky. Never going back. Story on the bottom of you wanna read. Just needed to let people know.
**Fun fact, my girl friend looked up the place here on Yelp and apparently a lot of the good food reviews that this place has, all come from the same IP address. 
In other words, they're fake. Yelp actually gave us a warning saying that the reviews on their site are probably fake. I'll put up the screenshot if I can find it.
----------------
Came here with friends after a long day of work because it was recommended to us. We were a bigger than normal group, 9 people.
  We ordered our food, and I put in my drink in as well. It was tequila shots. The shot was not that special that it needed to take almost 25 mins to get to the table. I got the drink as my food was coming out. My friend also prefer the same thing, his came to him AFTER THE FOOD.
  We ate, the food was okay. I had a chicken burrito. I was okay with it. My fiance next to me was not. He also ordered a burrito. Half of the table ordered burritos. 
  He, unfortunately, didn't like it. Too bland. He ate half the burrito. Giving the chef a chance, maybe the other half was better, he took a bite, but it was a no go for him. He couldn't even eat the rice that came with it because he found a hair in his rice. IN IT. NOT ON TOP OF IT. 
  He called the waitress over. Showed it to her and said that he doesn't want the food. She looked confused and we told her to take it back. She hesitated but took it back anyways.
  Not even 5 mins pass and the chef comes out. I shouldn't even call him a chef. He basically yelled at my fiance. 
  ""How do you not like my food? You don't eat half of it and then send it back. AND I DONT HAVE HAIR."" He pointed to his scalp, he had small hairs. But the one we found was small. Whether of not it was his, we found a hair. And my fiance and I both have extremely long hair. So no, it wasn't ours.
The chef stormed back into the kitchen complaining out loud, not caring who heard him and threw the plate back on to the dolly with the other used plates. He did this in front of the entire table. All none of us. It was super embarrassing. I don't even want to think about the other patrons on the other side eating and drinking.

My fiance also works at a restaurant though. He knows that behavior like that is not permitted ANYWHERE. Especially where he works. (Cooper's Hawk, check it out). The waitress apologizes. But then she says something snarky. ""You do know what happens next dont you?""

Yes, the chef will get written up for the bad food. That's why my fiance complained, he didn't like it and it was literally dirty. We're not going to keep our mouths shut because this will probably happen to someone else. The chef needs to hold that. And the waitress is in no place to be telling us to sympathize or to not say anything. His job is not our problem. Especially with the attitude he showed us.

The manager came out to apologise and took off the burrito. We left immediately and didn't look back.

 Going to put this up on Yelp as well.  People need to know what happened.",3,0,0

But hey if you like that no judgement haha. Anyways I've been wanting to try this place for a really long time so finally today on a very random night we decided to go.

We didn't want to drink so we sat in a table. Right away he brought us chips and salsa which we enjoyed a little too much as they were gone before our food came out. Huge mistake because I was so stuff by then. I usually don't like to eat meat, but because this place is organic and GMO free I was perfectly okay with it. I had the street tacos. 1 alpastor, 1 cochinita and 1 rajas. All accompany by rice and beans. I loved the tacos! The cochinita had purple onions with habanero omg really good kick. The alpastor were good and sweet from the pineapple. The rajas were okay. My boyfriend had their carne Asada plate and he loved it! I tried a piece of it and it really was delicious.

First off, be warned that it's attached to a strip club. So if you are bringing kids, don't go here. 

Went in on a Saturday at 4pm. Almost empty, and we still stood at the front without anyone greeting us for more than a minute before we finally sat ourselves. 

Eventually someone came over and took a drink order and dropped off chips and salsa. Great salsa. Too bad I had to go steal napkins and silverware from another table because nobody ever brought us any. 

Somehow the waitress was overwhelmed by the four tables she had. The manager and I'm guessing owner, just stood behind the bar talking. Never walked around and talked to guests or tried to assist their poorly trained waitress who didn't know what a Corkage fee was. 

Food was mediocre at best. But I'm from Los Angeles where there's an abundance of Mexican food.

You have to drive into the strip club parking lot to see it. We drove around a few times looking for the entrance as there are no road signs or any indicators of the restaurant visible from the street at night. 

Overall, I think it was mediocre Mexican food and what you're really paying for is the ambiance and atmosphere, which is nice. If you haven't really had authentic Mexican you might be impressed, but living in San Diego just miles from the border, we have it in abundance and this place doesn't hold a candle to many back home. 

I had the street tacos al pastor. 3 small white corn tortillas. The pork was pretty bland and sprinkled with cilantro and finely diced pineapples. It was okay, but I could find much better at a street vendor in SoCal for half the price. It also came with a side of black or pinto beans and rice. The rice is a joke. I'm not sure what they're going for but it has no influence of Mexican flavoring whatsoever. Usually you expect the characteristic red\/orange tomatoey rice with Mexican food. This was just plain, bland white rice. Black beans were also lacking any flavor as if they came straight out of a can. We also got the beef enchiladas. They were a little better. The shredded beef was a little dried out, if it were moist and succulent it would've made the dish. Enchiladas were as expected with a pretty good kick from the spicy red sauce. 

As far as service, I thought the general manager seemed very nice but the waitress we had seemed insincere and as if she wanted to be somewhere else. It was a quiet night and we were seated immediately, but given how few people were there I think the food shouldn't have taken so long to come out. 

Anyway, in summary I was less than impressed at the quality of food for such a highly-reviewed place on Yelp. One of the very few times Yelp has gotten it wrong for me. The ambiance and atmosphere is nice but the food is not up to the same standard. I'm open-minded enough to consider maybe it was the fact it was a Sunday night and hence not their best staff. Or maybe it was what I ordered. I went for the regular menu tacos\/enchiladas, maybe the specialities were a lot better? Either way, this place failed to come close to my expectations.

I had the carne Asada burrito and it was delicious and huge.  Salsas were very flavorful and my wife had the enchilada and said it was as good as our Mexican friend mom's!  The waiter was friendly and helpful in making our lunch selection.  We met the chef and he was very nice and told us about the locals special and happy hours.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because we were seated next to a dog.  I hate when restaurants allow dogs (it was a pug not a service animal). 2nd the food runners went to 3 different tables to drop off food.  Other than that the quality and flavor of the food was outstanding.,0,0,0

You decide how much heat you want in your guac just like in your life so if you like it Muy Caliente like you like your women or men get a 10!

Now the flan. Ohhh the heavenly flan. It's like a hybrid between a nice rich cheesecake with the nice caramelized finish of flan without even a hint of egginess. If you like creme brulee this is like a thicker version with liquid caramel.

Oh yes and Chef Paco came out to talk to us.  Got to love that! Sorry to my friends stuck back in VA, it's his grandma's recipe and I'll bet it stays in the family.

UPDATE: the guacamole made me get sick. Also, or waitress tried to pull a fast one over on us! She brought our check which showed $14 then took the credit card and charged $24!!!!!!!

Not that there is something wrong with that - we all need to eat. Well, this one is right next door to Sapphire which I avoid like the plague since I know somebody who works here and I think it's just awkward to see somebody you know but not romantically involved with without their clothes on. 

The place has a cozy lounge-y feel. Make sure you enter the left door if you want tacos on a plate. The right door has dancing naked tacos. I tried all of their street tacos. They were all good but some stood out more than the others.

Al Pastor Taco:
Marinated pork with cilantro, pineapple, onion and lime. Eaxctly like what you'll find on the streets. 5\/5

Carne Asada Taco:
Marinated steak with guacamole, onion, lime and cilantro. The steak was so tender and well-seasoned. It's a safe choice. 5\/5

Carnitas:
Braised pork wih guacamole, onion, lime and cilantro. Juicy and dripping wet. 5\/5

Pulled Chicken:
Marinated chicken with onions, spices and pico de gallo. Chicken tacos tend to be boring and blah but this one was very tasty, tender, perfectly cooked and not dry. 4\/5

Cochinita:
Slow-roasted pork marinated in achiote with pickled habanero and onions. This  one definitely stood out. It seemed tame like a Catholic school girl but once you dig deeper, it's crazy! You'll be all hot and sweaty by the time you're done. 5\/5

Cantaloupe Aguas Fresca:
This is easy to make at home but sometimes, I just don't feel like making anything at home. Their drink specials change everyday.  Since it wasn't horchata day, I got this instead. a drinkable form of cantaloupe. 4\/5

I tend to get sick when I eat street tacos. Considering I had good tacos from here and didn't get sick, I would have to say I found my safe taco haven. ""Honey, I was only parked at Sapphire to eat some tacos"" would be a true and accurate statement if you go to El Dorado.

cuisine. Several of our friends own and run world class Mexican restaurants in Aspen,CO as well as Los Angeles; However... we were BLOWN AWAY by El Dorado!!

When we first arrived at the address we thought we were lost as the address for
the restaurant is identical with SAPHIRE MEN'S CLUB?.. Go figure. Well we realized the restaurant is hidden at the Saphire entrance, and so, here we where.

As we approached the front doors for El Dorado,  we where met with the warm
smile of Arianna --- who turned out to be the restaurant GM.  Her warmth and
sincerity were genuine as i commented to my wife - ""She loves her job"";

The food -- I had the Fajitas with shrimp and beef and it was exquisite.  The only place i ever had shrimp this fresh was in the Gulf of Mexico. The sauces where
exactly what you would encounter at a world class restaurant in Mexico City, yet
very home cooking style and unpretentious.The refried beans,  hot sauces (watch out for the HABENERO!!!) and garnishes all appropriate and  not your usual same old same.

My wife had the conchinita pibil and it was the best either of us ever had.
Also, the drinks were like you would pore at home -- not some watered down
tourist trap ripoff.

Two other mentions --  Chef Paco came over and introduced himself -- total class act.  He had us try the flan  -- the recipe has been in his family 80 years.  No BS --
ive had lots of flan in my time, but this was thick and creamy beyond compare.

And lastly, James -- bartender , took us around the bar and showed us some rare
tequilas in display cases.  Our advice -- dont waste your time elsewhere -- the price is way worth it!",0,0,0

IT'S GOOD.

How good? I don't know. I can't really say. I didn't grow up in the Bay Area or Southern California. I grew up in Northwest Indiana. We didn't have the best Mexican food -- although Chicago has some quality spots. 

All I know about El Dorado Cantina is they do Mexican food about as good as I've ever tasted. 

Every dish I've had (from the stuffed shrimp, Siegel plate, fajitas, table-side guac, and habanero salsa *ask for it*) is bursting with unique flavor. All of the food is organic and non-GMO. The farms from which they source are listed on the menu. 

In my opinion, EDC does everything right. They're the future of what a successful business should be: quality, honesty, good customer service, and fair (somewhat) pricing. 

EDIT: 4\/29\/17\/  ***

Like many, my original experiences with EDC were wonderful. The last few, however, have been very hit or miss.

Still much of what made EDC special remains, yet, much is changing. Lately, dishes have been served lukewarm, often times cold all together. The sizing\/portions are inconsistent  (especially with my go-to: the Siegel plate). The service is generally still pretty great.

I worry EDC might be relying on reputation a bit too much these days. But I'll continue my visits.",2,1,1

They use to offer half off to locals and industry on Mondays ... I was never sure how they managed this... But I never complained. I believe they offer 20 percent off to locals now, although... No one has ever offered it or advertised it to us in recent months...

I love that they offer organic, non gmo food and have an array of vegan options:) however, their price point is kind of ridiculous for the location and the atmosphere. $16 for guacamole? I'm not trying to be a jerk, but where are they getting their avocados? The mark up is ridiculous. I paid $19 for two vegan lettuce wraps with black beans and rice. If you go with a friend, only one of you should order the beans and rice. They upcharge and there is enough for two.

On a cool Saturday night in Las Vegas I finally decided to check out the very popular El Dorado Cantina. I was not prepared for what was going to happen this night and I will give you nothing but my honest opinion here. I enter the restaurant and I request one seat for myself. The hostess said the bar is the only available seating for me despite the place being half empty. I do not like to eat at the bar since the space to place your food is limited. But I said ok might as well sit there since this place looks cool with its red walls and star lamps up above the bar seats.

The Piña Colada that never came. 

I did not know who would take my order...the bartender or a waiter ? Niether seem to notice I was holding a food menu to my face for over 10 minutes. Finally I waived at the bartender and asked who was going to take my order and said he would. I ordered Red Chilaquiles that the menu said it had tomatillo red sauce (remember that) and carne asada and some chicken empanadas. I clearly said I wanted a piña colada and the bartender said ok and never saw the drink and he just gaved me another round of water...I was not happy with this and continued to eat my chips and salsa which were OK. Sadly my piña colada never came


Red Salsa Deception 

I changed my mind on the piña colada and before the food came I decided to order a Cadillac Margarita which the bartender finallly ended up doing for me and it was tasty but lacked some punch. My food arrives and to my shock I noticed the 3 empanadas were all bite size...for $9.00...really??? I ate one and mostly tasted maza not chicken. At least the chilaquiles were looking good by I was in for an unpleasent surprise. I tasted the chilaquiles and something was not right, the sauce was not tomatillo red sauce, it was ENCHILADA SAUCE! I know the difference between red tomatillo sauce and enchilada sauce, and this was not what I expected. The egg, the cheese, the sour cream could not save my chilaquiles. The one star is for the carne asada slices which did have good taste.

The Piña Colada that never came Part 2

So I leave half my food on the dish and ordered a Piña Colada AGAIN which at this point I was craving for. I ordered one and bartender asked me what kind of beer I wanted and I responded with a ""What?"" Since when does a piña colada come with beer I asked. He looked at me confused and I said a corona I guess. The drink I ended up getting was a MICHELADA...how?...why? I waived to the bartender and said this is not a piña colada and he said I thought you said to me a michelada. He ran to get it made and I said forget about it give me the check I am out of here. 

In Conclusion

After this experience what can I say? The rave reviews of this place were high and the expectations were higher...all gone to waste in one night. If you want to be the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas than act like it. I was truly frustrated with my experience here. That is my honest opinion.",1,0,0

Cute decor and good sized venue. 24 hours is definitely a bonus, although not I'd ever go there at 3am, but good to know if I ever want to, it will be open.  

Service was friendly. I did remind the hostess to check me in for my opentable reservation but she didn't. My server was spot on and nice. She makes really good table side guacamole but you also see her running around behind the bar and clean up things everywhere. Short staffed perhaps. The exec chef, Paco, came to our table and delivered the complimentary flan (free with Yelp check in) and was very friendly and passing out breakfast coupons and introducing himself. 

Food is good, especially knowing it's all pretty healthy and all non GMO products. I'd say the taste is pretty average, not spectacular, especially with all the hype about this place. My fish and shrimp tacos tasted healthy but both proteins were over cooked. Fish wasn't juicy and shrimp was a bit rubbery. The rice is special, not your typical orange loose rice like other Mexican joints. 

We went on a Monday so was able to partake the 25% locals discount. 

Although with non GMO products, i do feel like it's quite overpriced considering what you get (rice and beans are all extra charges). The locals discount make it more reasonable and I'd probably never go there on other days.  Too $$ of a casual Mexican place for me.",1,0,0

Ok so I just finished my meal, the margaritas aren't that good, but the food is honestly amazing. The best part of the meal was the cilantro rice, it was soft and had a sweet touch to it which made it really appetizing. The server was great, his name was Mark, very nice guy and would check on us very often to make sure we're happy with everything we ordered and he made sure that our experience went well. I ordered the steak burrito and it was pretty good, we also got shrimp tacos and they were amazing, the shrimp was grilled so it was a light meal.

We came here to celebrate my sister's birthday as she had requested Mexican food for dinner. We were seated quickly and our server was friendly and attentive as he kept our drinks filled. We were able to order promptly and the food was delivered rather fast (we were dining on an off hour, so this was somewhat expected as there were only a few other people in the restaurant). However, the food was way below average and actually kinda gross (with the exception of the table-side guac). The cilantro rice was a sticky blob of mush and smelt foul (it tasted worse than it smelt!). My burrito was lukewarm and my husband's carnitas burrito had so much liquid in it, we joked that maybe he had actually ordered soup. At the end, they did bring out a sombrero for my sister and presented her with a small portion of flan that was actually very good.

I should note that I live near a town that has a large Mexican population which means I have access to incredible authentic Mexican food, so maybe my expectations were a little skewed.

We were also somewhat surprised that they do not allow any substitutions. This is more for future patrons to be aware and was not included in my overall rating as I respect their policy. My sister wanted to order the chicken enchilada platter with one chicken and one cheese enchilada (willing to pay the full price for the chicken enchilada platter), but was told that she would have to order everything a la carte. I understand not giving a discount for the lesser item or not allowing her to add a more expensive item, but we've never encountered a situation where they wouldn't allow you to sub for a cheaper option. A la carte would've been way more expensive.",2,0,0

Do not let the location fool you, just because it is next door to a strip club...literally RIGHT next to it...you have to go! Our waitress was so friendly and sweet! There was also live Spanish music, awesome.

First off, you MUST order the table side guac. We ordered it medium spicy and it was delicious. I ordered a jalapeno margarita which was not too spicy surprisingly. As a table we ordered: fish tacos (delicious! try them!), chicken enchiladas (very big in size!), and a special slow roasted pork taco concoction with a banana leaf which my coworker said was the best thing he's ever tasted. 

We're probably going back in a few days...

Once sat at the bar, it took at least another 5 minutes for someone to come by and ask us for a drink order (although there were 3 people behind the bar already). Once we ordered our drinks, the server asked if we wanted a refill on chips for a small charge. A CHARGE FOR A REFILL ON CHIPS?!? What fucking Mexican restaurant forces you to pay for a refill on chips and salsa?!?! 

Food from the HAPPY HOUR MENU took 45 minutes to get as the assistant GM talked to the table behind us for 20 minutes (about where they were from) totally disregarding if we needed anything.

My friend was in town who loves Mexican food but not a breakfast person.  Where do we go at 9:30 in the morning? El Dorado that's open 24 hours.  Plus I enjoy the shock factor of it being connected to a strip club.  Kinda freaks people out.  Walking in during the morning hours give you your choice of seating.  We sat in a clean and comfy booth to enjoy our meal.  Service was great.  Our waiter was so funny and very attentive.  

Chips and salsa were brought out immediately for a good starter.  The green and red salsa have great flavors.  I probably chowed down on way too many chips.  Of course that wouldn't stop me from ordering the combo fajitas of chicken and shrimp.  The sizzling skillet is generously filled with meat and veggies.  The chicken and shrimp have a good flavor with much leftover to take home.  Since I am a fan of heat, I asked if they had hot sauce.  Strangely they have none to offer.  Their option is their habanero salsa.  The fact that I have to pay extra for this was another oddity.  

Now my friend ordered the Queso Mexicano tacos.  She immediately mentioned how spicy the taco was and didn't see any indication on the menu that these had a flare.  I was thinking to myself ~ she's from the midwest and just can't handle a little spice.  I was wrong.  She had me take a bite and my mouth was on fire.  We asked the waiter about the spice and he didn't know that they were supposed to be spicy.  After his chat with the kitchen he found out the pepper oil in the sauce gave it extreme heat.  Yikes!  If you can handle the heat then this is fine.  Otherwise douse the taco in sour cream to even out the flavor.  The habanero salsa tasted like mild after that.

It does help their dishes are served with their amazing rice.  Maybe just a hint of cilantro which doesn't bother me.  The rice is light with a buttery flavor that you can't hate.  

With the Yelp check in you receive their famous Flan.  Certainly this is the best flan I've ever had.  It's the perfect little creamy dessert to finish a meal.  

The hours are definitely convenient with great service.  In my opinion they are a bit pricey for mexican food but I won't shy away from visiting again.",12,3,7

Will definitely make this a regular visit when I'm in town.

I think a $20 worth of entree should have been a little better than what it was presented and how it was tasted. The food was just okay to me.

He was great but his ability to earn was constrained by the snail paced bartenders. It took 25 minutes to get a beer and a cocktail.  Am I being an impatient @$$ you might wonder? Last February I had a going away party for 30 guests, and I had called days in advanced to allow for proper staffing, we were told we'd have a dedicated Attendant, and there were several times we were without drinks for 20 minutes plus. The service was so bad the managers comped 4 bottles of bottom shelf house tequila and vodka and a 20% discount on our bill. We did t drink the comped bottles but it's the thought that counts.... I guess. 

So here we are, six months later and the same thing is happening with the bar. We got water, ordered our drinks, ordered guacamole, joked with our awesome Attendant but no beer and signature drink. Now I've just worked a very busy day at a strip hotel, my group had 4 big parties this night, I am hangry, dehydrated and want a beer and my lovely lady is so amazingly sweet and calm, my beacon of light, who prevented me from being overtly hangry...for too long...

Anyway, the food is still fantastic. The chicken fajita was great, my seafood enchilada was okay, unfortunately, being next to the strip club brings a clientele wearing skimpy and revealing clothing, but if you're an event planner for a corporation or from out of town and on the conservative side, this is not the place for you.

We're pretty picky with what we eat so when we learned they serve sustainably sourced and organic items this was a huge plus. When our family came in from England to visit it seemed like the great time to give El Dorado a try and give the Brits their much craved Mexican kick. 

Upon entering we actually bumped into a group of friends already seated and happily enjoying their margaritas (I'll get to the importance of this later)

Everything started well. We were seated quickly (at a high top table NEXT to our friends not WITH) and the standard chips and salsa were served. 

Then it all went down hill. The food was nothing to write home about. It lacked flavor and maybe some extra care and attention. One meal was brought out wrong and had to be returned. A second meal seemed to be MIA along with a third that never even showed up and we had to ask twice what had happened. The second meal appeared and the third finally came once everyone else had finished. Not to be defeated and to give the benefit of the doubt we ordered churros... because why not... and they were actually delicious...Hence the 1 star. 

Our bill finally arrived and we were a bit surprised at the amount. We were charged a large party service gratuity (because we happened to know the table seated NEXT to us not WITH us. - and FYI the other table did not have this on their bill) Our server then told us....""We went ahead and took off the enchiladas (the 3rd meal) but it came off of your friends bill so they owe you a margarita"" ummmmmmmm that's not how it works. So now we got stuck paying an extra gratuity and paying for a meal that technically we should have been given for free???

It was our first time here and came on a recommendation.  Sat down and the chips and salsa was good.  I was looking forward to the meal, as usually if the salsa is good, the food is good.    In this case, they bring red and green fire roasted salsas.

I ordered the pozole.  What a disappointment: it was greasy, very salty and the chips that came with it, covered the onion and cabbage.  They didn't bring lime, so used the ones from my beer.  Tried to skim as much grease as I could into a plastic container they brought with the pozole, but it wasn't very good.  Another person ordered the milanesa torta and returned it because it was dry and over salted.  Another person in our group, ordered a shrimp bowl with brown rice, but it came with  the cilantro-llime white rice.

Yes, it is next to a strip club. No, you do not have to enter said strip club to get to the restaurant. 

The wait staff here are on point. Everything was great! Drinks were brought out swiftly and waters filled before the halfway empty mark. The chips and different salsas were very tasty, too!

I had the Mahi Mahi tacos with rice and beans. The fish was cooked to perfection and was really fresh (something kind of hard to accomplish in the desert...). The beans were flavorful, but the rice absolutely made the meal! I don't know what they did to it, but it was magical! 

In addition (as of that wasn't good enough) I checked in on Yelp and the executive chef personally brought out flan for us. And I'm not talking some giggly gelatinous monstrosity that strikes fear into the hearts of people traumatized by grandma's jello molds. I'm talking a smooth, silky, creamy dessert that was, quite literally, one of the best things I have ever eaten.

Go. Get the tacos. Check in for flan.

For starters, we ordered two quesoin fundidos, one with mushrooms and the other with chorizo.  We also got an ordered of garlic lime fried chapulines (grasshoppers).  With the quesos, we were brought both corn and flour tortillas.  

For the main part of lunch, we got their Grande feast plate which the menu says serves 10-12.  The grande feast consists of two feast plates--the pequeño which serves 3-4 people and the mediano which serves 6-8 people.  The pequeño consists of steak, carnitas & chicken burritos, pulled chicken or cheese quesadillas and beef & chicken taquitos.  The mediano platter consists of Sliced carne asada, grilled chicken, grilled shrimp & chorizo with queso fresco, cactus, grilled onions & chiles.  

There was more than enough for these hungry eaters.  carne asada, grilled chicken, and grilled shrimp of the mediano were very well cooked and seasoned quite well.  I had some of a chicken burrito from the pequeño platter and it was well prepared.  The chapulines were good put a bit pricey at $12.  

For dessert, we got three complimentary flans (one for each Yelp check in) and we got one order of tres leches cake.  The flan was standard.  I really enjoyed the tres leches cake.  Too bad we had to share!

While we were eating, the General Manager, Christian Umlauf, visited our table and talked with us about the restaurant and was very genial and a gracious host.  Shortly after, Chef Paco, the executive chef, came to the table and brought a bag of spicy nuts that his mother sends him from Mexico City.  He shared a good part of the bag with us in a styrofoam cup.  A very pleasant man who explained some of the dishes.

Jesse was our server and he did an outstanding job!  He kept water glasses filled, brought more tortillas as needed, and was always available when we had a equation.

El Dorado has been on my radar since Yelp had an event there and I was unable to attend because of a conflict.  I will be going back to try some of their signature items.  The restaurant is very nicely appointed.",9,4,8

I had to share that because it caught my boyfriend and I off guard (More him than me given it was his first time in Vegas).  While it is part of Sapphire it is separate in the sense that it has its own entrance and you are not at all exposed to the scene.  

Now as for the restaurant.  Its a nice restaurant, and we were pleasantly surprised by the food.  We started with fresh guacamole, which was a bit more salty than what we prefer.  For dinner I ordered the Chicken Enchiladas with black beans and rice, and had the Torta de Milanesa.  We both really enjoyed our food.  The salsa on my enchiladas was divine.  

The Flan we had for dessert was one of the most delicious I have ever had.  It was thicker and creamier than most.  It was simply fantastic!

The servers and bartenders looked miserable and tired! Hardly anyone smiled. I could tell they were busy but, DAMN... do you want my tips or not? I felt like our bartender was so exhausted. I think he was purposely avoiding eye-contact so he could catch his breath. 
Another miss was the chips and salsa. It was exactly what you'd expect at any old Mexican place, not a gourmet place. I had higher hopes. 

Now for the hits...
The steak sopes were very tasty. I enjoyed the chipotle chicken and, of course, the flavorful rice! But our final server, Chris, was the redeemer of this place. He was friendly and attentive.

I'll also give praise where it's due and I must give praise now:  Lewis Management Corp is the best landlord situation I've ever encountered in my life and I'm pretty dang old.  If you rent from this company and need something done in your house, repairs etc. they are RIGHT ON TOP OF IT.  I've been recommending this rental company to people I know here in town looking for a place to live for years.  It's rare, but this rental company is really, actually that good.

I know that one of their maintenance staff is a man named Arnie and he is completely good at what he does and totally trustworthy.  Furthermore, If you need something done in your house, Lewis staff will dispatch Arnie within a day.  I've never seen such fantastic service from a landlord.

Really.  I'm considering a move out of state and actually researched to see if this company has properties in my target state\/city but unfortunately, they don't seem to.  Anyway, if you are in the Nevada\/California area and need to rent a home, I wholeheartedly recommend this company.  Excellent service.

Thanks, Lewis!  

Sincerely,

Twenty-four dollars for a dinner plate of pork rice and beans? It's more expensive than WEST LA. What is the justification for this price? Even with the free FLAN (The highlight of the night), it should have been less than $20 dollars.

I got the Pork Carnitas. The meat was very juicy and tendor, but came out only slightly warm. The side chips came with three type of salsa, but the chips were STALE and cold. Definitely the disappointment of the meal. Chips should be hot, fresh off the oven. If they are not, then just warm them up slightly. It was luke cold!

The black bean side was warmed up in the microwave I could tell simply because the outside was colder than the inside. I HATE when restaurants microwave their food. If I wanted a microwave, I'd would have bought some SMART ones, which ain't so SMART, and just nuke it myself.

Side rice was just ok, alongside the pickled vegetables.

The Flan was absolutely excellent. The highlight of the night, and a must have. You get one for free with your meal when you check into yelp

It is this critics opinion that he judges this place perhaps more harshly than it needs to be because he lives in Las Angeles, which has the greatest Mexican food in the world arguably.

Over the weekend, my family and I were in Vegas and decided to branch off the strip and enjoy some Mexican food. Yelp reviews steered us towards El Dorado which also happened to be a stones throw from our hotel. The confusing part is that the restaurant actually shares the building and parking lot with a strip club. Yup, nothing says 'family atmosphere' like walking through a parking lot full of seedy men and limo drivers before dinner. The entrances are so close to one another, that nobody would even know what establishment you were heading to until placing your hand on the appropriate front door. 

The Issue: Prior to even coming here, we called to find out what the wait was like and if a reservation was needed. The employee on the phone stated that ""no reservation was needed,"" but the wait might be 45-60 mins. No problem we thought, we'll enjoy a drink at the bar in the meantime. Upon arriving however, the hostesses informed us that they would not be able to seat us until 10pm (it was currently 5:30pm) without a reservation. What?! The restaurant was virtually empty and we found that hard to believe. After some back and forth, the hostess would not budge. Zero accommodations were given and she was completely rude and snarky through the entire process. 

I know your restaurant is highly rated and you probably have quite the following, but your customer service is horrible. I would not recommend your restaurant to anybody and hope you make the necessary adjustments so as to not lose more business.",5,2,0

I ordered the shrimp taco and added a side of cilantro sauce. The shrimps are succulent and the sauce is very flavorful. The cilantro rice is not Spanish rice but tasty and comes in ample portion.

We came on Tuesday so it's Tequila & Tacos. Ordered the Casa de noble margarita, I believe, was tremendous. I didn't even taste the tequila which means I got a buzz on quicker. Awesome deal, Bill only came out to be 40$.

Ordered 3 street tacos, 2 of each: Carne Asada, Al Pastor and Carnitas. Honestly, these were almost as Devine as my boyfriends mothers street tacos & hers are never compared to. My favorite was the Al Pastor, adding the pineapple made the taco just 10x better. We even ordered 5 more tacos, like the first 3 weren't enough. It was just so amazing we couldn't resist.

For dessert we had flan. Such a light but fulfilling little dessert. We both shared one & at the end we  were completely stuffed!! Like so stuffed I had to hide my food baby with my coat lol

& what totally tops this place off is that most of their food items are organic & from different farms that don't harm the food we're eating.

- The table side guacamole was excellent.  Chunky, salty, and just the right touch of lime
- The shrimp taquitos were pretty good.  The shrimp was tender (and I could taste it) and the plate had just the right amount of salsa, guac, and cheese
- The carne asada street tacos were average at best
- The carnitas street tacos were great

I probably won't be back because the neighborhood skeeved me out a bit, but I could be forced back if someone really wanted to go.",1,0,0

Any local knows that the best places are often off the strip and this is no different. As far as Mexican cuisine there is not a place I've been to that is better. Chef Paco has created a menu that everyone can enjoy while still capturing the true flavors of Central American cooking. Counting in the prices and the specials that they run it's a no brainer. The ingredients for every dish are from premium organic sources and prepared by people that care. Anyone who works in the service industry will tell you some people are impossible to please and those kinds of people should just stay home..forever. Forget those grumps. If you have any common sense along with an appetite to match you better be stopping by here asap. Plus it's open 24\/7. Skip the late night street meat that might give you botulism. El Dorado is a real slice of Mexican pride.,1,0,1

So we were visiting Vegas for a weekend long Bday party and couldn't get babysitting. Yepp- the crack monkey's came with us. So much for the evening festivities. Alas, we had to be parents. Again. 

We love to ""Yelp"" places when we are not at home. The hubs found this and pulled the trigger. We head over and as we are approaching the address....DOH! A STRIP CLUB??? Our 13 year old daughter quickly got out her iPhone spouting off how she LOVED new experiences and was ready to video tape this. I was like... Slow your roll, tween-bop! As long as I am alive you will continue on your path to cure Cancer, and keep the ass-shaking to the professionals. We saw a separate door for the restaurant, THANK GOD. She still took photos of the signage for the club and quickly texted it to her friends. Great. As soon as the other Soccer Mom's see the pics, I will have to relinquish my Mom o' the Year title. 

It was Sat night, approximately 7:30pm, on April 18, 2015. We waited 10-15 min for a table. The Hellions were thrilled with the seating (a high table with stools) and we were thrilled with the kiddie menu's! Red velvet walls... felt a little naughty being next to the strip joint. The décor... CUTE. I even loved the drinking glasses. 
Pricing is important to me. If dinner is bad, the first thing I think about is how my $100 could have bought me a few more shares of my fav stock. However, this dinner was nowhere near $100 and it was REALLY worthy of a higher price point. DON'T TELL CHEF PACO. Our  bill was $38. (No alcohol.... KIDS. REMEMBER?)

Here's what we had; The Heathons- kiddie flat steak, and they LOVED it. It came with potato chips (homemade). I tried both. TOTES DELISH. The portions were generous. Our daughter ordered off of this menu, (she looks 10, so I make her). She thought it wouldn't be enough food, but she was stuffed. Our son couldn't finish the steak, as it was just too large a portion for him. He is 10, but a petite eater. I had the chicken street tacos with black beans and rice. I asked for a keg of salsa to flavor my tacos because the salsas' were REALLY YUMMY. I felt bad leaving it there but the tacos were seasoned so well, that I just didn't need any. I should have taken it home so I could drink it later. Even the rice and beans were really tasty... authentic Mexican. Kid's meals came with dessert. FAB cream filled Churros w\/ Mexican chocolate dipping sauce. We also got a free flan for ""checking in"" on Yelp. 

Now, when it comes to flan, my white azz hubster THINKS he is THEE Mexican tasting authority. He swears most flan sucks, but he is a big lover of the dessert, and will try it EVERYWHERE in his quest for the RIGHT flan. I will be damned if Jesus didn't personally come down to bless this flan, as Hubster swears it was THE BEST flan he had ever had. For me, it was the CREAMIEST and TASTIEST flan I have ever had. As if this isn't enough, we find out, it's GRAMMA'S RECIPE! Yepp- Chef Paco uses his Gram's flan recipe. If I wasn't already married to the Albino fake Mexican stud that I am, I might make sweet love to Chef Paco in a vat of his Gram's flan. I mean, how sweet is that? He came by the table, by the way, and he IS, AS SWEET, as the flan. TOTES ADORBS! I believe our server's name was Marco. To quickly sum him up, he let our 10 year old ramble on about rollercoasters without the slightest irritation... on a Saturday night... TOTES AMAZEBALLS. GREAT SERVICE. GREAT CHEF. GREAT FOOD. GREAT RESTAURANT. We told all of our local friends about it. 

Next time I visit, I plan on leaving the hubs and kids at home and getting drunk with these guys. How much trouble could I get in? I already lost my Mom 'o the Year status.",4,3,4

Not American Mexican flavors

I had pork cooked in banana leaf.
Wife had lettuce wrap tacos.
Freshly cooked onsite beans. 
Our plates had small cups of palate neutralizing acidic vegetables to accent the flavors between succulent bites. 


noteworthy. 

Wife ordered two lemon drop martinis. 
Both were clearly made with margarita mix. 
Either lazy bartender or our order was miscommunicated. 
Wife didn't want to make a stink. 
I would have. A 14 dollar lemon drop needs to be made with lemons. Not cheap margarita mix. 

Weird entrance virtually shared with a gentlemans club. 
Building surrounded with ghetto lighting and ghetto music. I would not have come here if it were not for the great good reviews 


Thanks Yelp. 

Don't let the exterior chase you away. 

I suspect the owner is related to the club owner. Thus the weird entrance.

If I was solely rating the service it would be 1 star.  I arrived on a non-busy week night with my boyfriend for some food and drinks.  The hostess greeted us and sat us at a good table.  Our waitress came soon after and took out order.  We had a coupon that she presented to us.  After she got done rolling her eyes, she said that she had to ask the manager about the coupon.  The coupon was approved and we ordered our food.  While we were eating, we needed more fixings (sour cream, guacamole, tomato) so we asked out server for more.  She failed to mention that it costs extra for more sour cream!  As we were finishing up our meal, I guess it was taking to long for us to leave, so the server decided to put our check on the table and hover around until we put a credit card down.  Keep in mind we were only at the place an hour tops!  As we put the credit card down we again reminded our server that we had the coupon.  She took it with the check.  She came back and placed our receipt on the table.  We looked it over and she had not used the coupon!  When asked about this she simply said, ""Sorry about that. You can use it next time.""  -Really Chick-  Never mind that we were from out of town.  I was beyond annoyed at this point!  For me, service can make or break a meal!

The best part about it is that it's in a strip club -- keeps all the super-pretentious squares away. It does have a separate entrance, so you don't actually have to go in the strip club...but you still have to park under the electric blue neon glare of the Sapphire signage, among all the strippers, bros and pervs. Not a big deal, tho! 

The second best part is the food -- I had carne asada tacos, and they were OUT OF THIS WORLD! The black beans and rice that came with them were also EXCEPTIONALLY delicious -- they had a delicate flavor to them that I can't even describe, but I could have eaten  10 plates of each :-) I also had a house margarita, which was basically like any other margarita...only presumably GMO and organic, blah blah blah.

Prices are a little high -- for my 3 tacos it was around $15. But I don't mind paying a premium for bad ass food, which this is! Service was OK -- everyone was friendly and helpful, but our waitress did fudge my friend's order twice. (Minor stuff, and my friend did not even bring it up, so no harm no foul.)

I'm only docking one star because of the chip situation. They bring you a basket of chips and some salsa when you are seated, but then the waitress gives this weird legal disclaimer-type spiel about how the first basket is on the house, but additional baskets are $3.50 each or something like that. I thought that was kinda miserly -- for $5 a taco, ya can't throw in some friggin' tortilla chips? The fact that they announce this at the very beginning of your experience kinda creates an awkward vibe.

Other than that, a GREAT place and I will be back for sure!!",23,13,13

I first experienced this spot when I was working at a near-by high rise, and I would get it delivered via Post Mates. That's when I fell in love and knew I had to dine here in person. 
Little did I know, it's attached to Sapphire strip club and I freaked out the whole family when I pulled in the parking lot. Don't let that fool you, minors are indeed welcome. However, from personal experience, I would NOT bring them before 11 AM when the drunk strippers next door just got off work, or after 10 PM when the guys are pre-gaming before hitting the club. Again, simply a local's bit of advice and nothing more. 
I have sent my boss here, my mom here, and again my kid and always get positive feedback. It is a little pricier than your average Mexican restaurant. But when you go to Whole Foods, or Sprouts, it too, is above average in cost. Like the very true saying goes, you get what you pay for. 
The offer vegan or vegetarian options, like cactus or veggie tacos. There are also some unique signature dishes such as the Siegal plate or lettuce wraps. I feel like this place is a mix of authentic, fresh-mex, and  health food all in one, with liquor. Did I mention the alcohol yet? Or how delicious the jalapeno margarita is?

This place was an utter delight the second we walked in.The decor rivals anything any of the casinos can offer. We were seating promptly, with a smile, to a huge round booth.We felt truly welcomed immediately.

Then our waitress came out beaming with positive energy and took our drink order. I ordered an Iced Tea, which was great, and in a big glass. Wifey wanted water, as we had already had our fill of alcohol our short Vegas jaunt.

She returned with chips that were purple, and served with 3 different types of salsa. We were warned about the spiciness of the orange habanero salsa, but it wasnt so bad. We enjoyed it. The salsa verde was good. But we devoured the delicious red salsa casera, which was quickly noticed and refilled. Awesome.

We shared a chicken Gordita plate as an appetizer. They came out smaller than we expected. No worries though, we enjoyed them. Very good.

Wifey ordered the Carne Asada Nachos. They came out with great presentation, and plenty of meat. All the fixins. They took Nachos to another level. Portion was big enough to share.

I had a Carna Asada Burrito. I would place this Burrito in the top 10 all-time Carne Asada burritos ever. I found myself eating slowly to savor the goodness. Fantastic.

Chef Paco came out to greet us, and thank us for our patronage. We showered him with compliments and thanked him for making us such delectable food. What a nice, geniune Hombre.

We recieved complimentary Flan for checking in on my phone. My Wife has HATED Flan since childhood, and reluctantly tried some. SHE LOVED IT! Because this is the worlds greatest Flan! No joke, this is the best Flan either of us have ever had BAR NONE. If you try it, try to incorporate some of the mint leaf into your bite, it adds a little extra to the indulgence.

The location is deceiving, so when you are pulling up off of Industrial you will pull into the parking lot for Sapphires. My husband and I circled around several times until we pulled in to what appears Sapphire's parking lot, and spotted that there was an entrance and a somewhat hidden\/obstructed sign next to the entrance to the strip club.

We were pleasantly surprised by the decor and the classy vibe inside of the restaurant. There were comfortable booths and tables, along with a nice bar area which seemed packed. It seems to be a hot spot for younger, professional looking crowd and I can see why. The ambiance, service and the food would prompt me to take a client here for lunch.

They have a pretty extensive cocktail menu which I did not really go over. The server mentioned that their margaritas are not made with any pre made mixes and is sweetened with agave nectar and was offered in several flavors. I went with the Raspberry flavor per his suggestion. I enjoyed it, although still felt it was a bit sweet and the raspberry chunks kept clogging up my straw which got to be annoying. Get wider straws if you are putting chunks for fruit into the drink. Overall, I could taste the difference but I just wasn't in the mood to drink so I couldn't recommend this place based on the cocktail alone.

The chips (first round is complimentary) are decent, but nothing like what some people are raving about. I found them to be an unnecessary filler.

We ordered the Carne Asada, Carnitas burrito enchilada style in red sauce (choice of red of green) and al pastor tacos (comes in a set of 3, you can mix and match the flavors). The Carne Asada and the burrito were extremely delicious. They were served with cilantro rice that was so light, yet packed with flavor. I seriously could just eat the rice alone there and be happy. The meat was high quality with great portions. The burrito was filling, but given the nature of the ingredients it did not leave me feeling stuffed, instead I felt satiated and full. The tacos were not impressive to me because the al pastor tasted dry and I had to use one of the left over salsas from the chips to pour over them. I am accustomed to juicy and flavorful al pastor and this just did not deliver. It tasted as if it was under a heat lamp for a bit too long.

The prices are not cheap, but you do get what you pay for. The burrito was around $16 and the Carne Asada around $25. The service was attentive and pleasant. Overall we felt it was money well spent and intend on coming back soon to sample more of their menu.",16,11,19

Things have changed a lot - it seems the staff is smaller and the excitement is gone .. the main woman seemingly running the floor looks miserable and has a short temper , no customer service skills - Maria I think is her name 


I choose to only sit at the bar now with some of the classic workers who have been here and know how to treat a repeating familiar local guest 


I hope the local family vibe isn't gone forever. Feels like a corporate business now - sadly my friends don't even come back because of the service 


Hopefully this changes caus the food is great and so is Tuesday, 1942 special",0,0,0

There are a couple of items on the menu, for example a salad that qualifies as vegan and a few others.  The atmosphere is gorgeous, but what is funny is that on our first time here, we had my husbands parents and my son and when we arrived we had no idea it was in the Sapphire Gentlemans club building. That was a shocker.  

My husband had to go in to make sure it was appropriate to bring our son and the parents.  However, keep in mind that when we were going into the door, the music blaring from the gentlemans club outside was saying something to the effect of ""co*k and Bal*s"" so that was absolutely not appropriate for my 9 year old. 

This is what everyone tried, the fruit margartias (not very flavorfull or sweet) the mexican corn (fabulous) the chile relleno (tasted cooked earlier and heated up) chicken salad (gorgeous and flavorful) corn Raja tacos (very good) Chicken Lettuce Wraps (good)  Quesadilla (my son - good, but he ended up getting sick after and threw up all over my husbands truck on the freeway home - we think that may have been the 6 maraschino cherries he ate though, we are not sure) it did ruin our 300 dollars we spent on Rock of Ages tickets either way because we had to leave 1\/2 way through because he was sick as a dog.

I wanted veggie fajitas, but I hate mushrooms and they already had their veggie mix, so were not able to make it customized.  This really bothers me because at this level of pricing, we should be albe to order anything we want.

Bottom line, there are too many other good restaurants in town in my opinion to go out of the way to go tho this area and be exposed to the rif raf and not be able to get a meal I love.  I will say one thing, our waiter was amazing. He figured out how to get me veggie tacos with no mushrooms made and was a great at satisfying the customer.  Thanks to him, it was a better experience that it would have been.

PS: the kitchen must be small because the food comes out one plate at a time.  I wish I could say better things, but  a lot of negatives here.",0,0,0

The flan (for dessert) was hands-down the best flan I have EVER had! And I have had some darn good ones, believe me. 

To top it off, the executive chef (Paco) came to our table to talk to us and spent several minutes engaging us. We were truly gratified and wowed. He shared with us stories, including how the recipe for the flan belongs to his grandmother. He gave us his card, which contains his personal contact info. WHO DOES THAT?!

I came here 11:30 pm on a Saturday night. Walked in and there was only 1 other table. The server greeted us right away and sat us. I didn't catch her name but she really sucked. I don't think I've ever had service this slow in my life. Took 10 minutes to get our drink order in and the complimentary chips, and another 10 minutes to get our food order in. Then we had to wait 30 minutes for an order of street tacos and 2 orders of enchiladas. On top of that we had to wait 10 minutes for a sauce the server forgot to bring out when we asked for it when she took our order. Then we ate our food for maybe 20 minutes, she didn't check on us at all. We had to flag her down to get a refill for coke. I had ONE glass of water the whole time I was there that NEVER got refilled. After we were done eating I realized she had 4 tables. She asks us if we want dessert and I say yes I want to use my free flan from my check in. She says okay and then we wait another 20 minutes for it. At this point I am irritated with waiting and thought she forgot about it so I just wanted the check and then she brings out the flan and says ""sorry that took so long"" so now I'm forced to stay. We ate the flan and then ask for the check, she drops it off and comes back in 10 minutes and I ask her to split it. She tells me ""well I have to make 2 guacs so if you want it split you have to wait 10 minutes."" What the f*%$. That was the cherry on top of it because I could tell she was just being lazy. So I tell her fine just put it on one card and comes back and had the nerve to say ""you guys were awesome"" just to get a tip out of us when she knew her service was horrible. I even heard her tell somebody ""you're going to have to wait before I take your order so if you just want to leave that's okay"" and he was appalled she said that to him.

The food was better than the service. I tried the chicken enchiladas and I thought they were good. I had the street taco plate, my refried beans were waaay too salty. I didn't like the taste of the rice because it was sweet, it reminded me of coconut sticky rice without the sticky. The tacos were good, the meat was cooked perfectly but honestly for the price they weren't anything amazing. I still prefer Taco El Buen Pastor for $2 a taco instead of $4.50 at Eldorado. The flan was really good though, that might be the only thing I would consider coming back for. For 3 people, no apps, just 3 meals I paid $69, which to me is expensive for Mexican food that was just mediocre.

We didn't get out of there until 1:30 am when this was supposed to just be a quick bite for us. My problem is there were 2 bartenders and nobody sitting at the bar and more tables with 1 server. The bartenders should've stepped in to help her so that service wasn't slow for everybody OR management should know better to have more servers on a Saturday night in Las Vegas, especially when they are next to a busy strip club *rolls eyes*

My partner had a caeser salad that she found ""odd"" and needed more dressing (and this is a person who doesn't like a lot of caeser dressing on her salad and usually asks for it on the side...) 2 other guests in our party found their soups to be ""too salty"". Here's an awesome incentive for locals: 25% off your bill all day Mondays when you show your local ID. And Taco Tuesdays with $2.50 street tacos and $5 margaritas. That's pretty cool. Will we return to El Dorado? Perhaps. But IMHO, our neighborhood Lindo Michoacan (while not ""organic"" or ""non-gmo""), remains undefeated in our hearts as the #1 mexican restaurant in town.",1,0,1

As we looked over the menu were happily munching on the bottomless chips and salsa they gave us which were complimentary. I kid you not, by the time our server came to take our order we were already working on our second basket of chips! Damn you good tasting chips and salsa! Also, damn you servers who are constantly walking by refilling the chips and salsa! We both agreed to share a meal since we definitely overdid it on the chips.

What we ordered was the the Steak n Chicken Mixed Fajita Platter ($25). It has sliced green, red, and yellow bell peppers along with sliced onions. The shrimp were some pretty sized good chunks. The cut up pieces of steak were tender and very juicy. If you just sat down and get a whiff of this dish as the server walks by you, that alone will pretty much entice you to order it. Comes with a plate of sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, and your choice of black or refried beans. You also get either flour or corn tortillas. Im glad we shared it for we barely finished it! We finished up with a free flan as the special for checking in on Yelp. For you peeps with a sweet tooth, this dessert is rich.

Our second visit we decided to go on a monday to take advantage of the locals 50 percent off on the entire menu. We were strongly recommended to make a reservation for you just might wait awhile before a table opens up.

As we showed up for our 7 pm reservation, the place was packed! People were waiting to be seated but not us. We proceeded to our table right away. We wanted to try different things so being the carnivore that I am, I went with the Carne Asada plate ($26) and wifey went with the Conchinita Pibill ($24). I was also curious about the Mexican Corn ($5) so we got that as well. For dessert, we got the Flan ($8).

This time we kind of went easy on the chips and salsa so we can make a dent in our individual meals. Again, we were wrong. We could of shared just one meal and still be fully satisfied. Oh well, my oldest son could not have been happier when we brought home the leftovers!

The Carne Asada they give you 2, that's right, two nicely sized marinated skirt steaks. Comes with a scoop of some type of steamed buttered rice (no, its not like rice pilaf) guacomole, and your choice of refried or black beans. But wait, there's more. You also get a grilled jalapeno and another grilled type of red pepper. They even give you some kind of pork sausage as well. The steak I requested medium rare and it was spot on! It was perfectly seasoned with whatever marinade they use. I can even taste a hint of lime in it. It is some of the best asada I have had in a long time.

The Conchinita Pibill was highly recommended by our server Amber. She said it was one of favorite pork dishes. It is basically carnitas but with some different spices. It was so tender and juicy that I was alternating from my plate to hers.

The Mexican Corn (elote), is a roasted corn on the cobb coated with mayonaise, queso fresco, and sprinkle of cayenne powder. Comes with a couple of slices of lime for you to squeeze on to it.

To complete our meal we got the flan again since we know that it is very good. Now remember this second visit we only paid 35 dollars instead of 70 and we still had plenty of leftovers

Service. As luck would have it, we ended up getting the same server as last time which was Amber. Now she is very efficient. Not only does she serve other tables, but she is always looking at our table to see if we needed anything that was commonly asked. She did this every time she walked by carrying other customers' orders. All her other co-servers did their part by picking up empty plates as they walked by. Not once did I ask for a refill on our waters and sodas at all both visits. Now that is great service.

Some random useful info. Besides what I mentioned above, they are 24 hours, They have numerous GMO free and organic menu options not to mention gluten free and organic items as well. Oh, did I mention that they are right next to Sapphire, one of largest strip clubs in Vegas? Guys (and gals) how many times have you gone to a strip club but had to leave later on because you were starving? Yeah, I know makin it rain on them strippers makes me hungry too. Just do the hokey pokey and turn yourself around. Just like that you are feasting on great Mexican food no matter what time of day it is. They even have giant flat screen tv's strewn all around the restaurant so you dont miss the ""big"" game if it so applies. Sometimes, the master chef Paco will be walking around making sure everything is ok. Dude is very friendly.

In closing, even though they opened just last year, I am still mad at myself for not checking them out sooner. I cant wait for my next meal here and I will definitely let other foodies know!

Now let's get to the good stuff, the food.  El Dorado serves authentic, flavorful, unique dishes. From veggie tacos to seafood dishes to fajitas, everything is fresh and full of flavor.
The ambiance has a beautiful Spanish flare with dim mood lighting accompanied by upbeat Spanish music. And for dessert? Don't get me started on the Flan. It is creamy, smooth and delicious. If you are in Vegas and in the mood for Mexican, this place is a must!!!",1,0,1

Lovely server, delicious free flan.
The food was OKAY.  I don't know why everyone raves about it except for the fact it is organic and\/or GMO free.  It tastes like any Sharkeys, Rubios or Baja Fresh but for three times the price.  We got the enchiladas, street tacos and albondigas soup.

We were thrilled with the crickets and jalapeno margaritas.
Staff seemed scattered tonight, and the new manager was present but pretty much not engaging with customers a lot. A few times my husband attempted to wave for assistance and got the eyes- averted skillfully response.
We had the lettuce wraps with marinated steak, the appetizer which is like spicy shrimp ceviche, and the Tinga tostidas.
Food was good. Drinks were very slow.
Our server was ok but seemed new and maybe was a bit hesitant explaining things to us.
Not enough to keep us from returning but the evening staff on duty at 6pm were somewhat disconnected I felt.

My group slowly trickled in within about a 10 minute frame so we sat at the bar. I sat right in front of the hallway leading to the bathrooms and immediately I could tell something was off. It smelled heavily like stagnant water. I tried to ignore it unless it bothered someone else too. 

We sat at the bar for a good 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged by a bartender, additionally there was a tray of dirty glasses sitting in front of us that the bartenders didn't bother to move, eventually someone in my party moved it away from us. It took someone who was working there another 20 minutes before they removed it from the floor completely. Let's also preface in saying they weren't busy by any means. 

Eventually our drinks came and we ended up moving to a table across the restaurant because we came there to eat and there was no way i could have eaten in the seat I was at. We're about 45 minutes into being in this place when we finally get our food order taken. Which is annoying. 

Only half of our table got the complimentary chips and salsa? So 4 out of 8 people. It's not like we all could have shared because we were at a long table. It was just poor service. 

I ended up being 3 margaritas in by the time any food hit our table, which is crazy because it's not like the drinks we're coming at any timely pace. When we were finally done we weren't offered boxes, the server just took our plates away without saying anything. 

To top it all off there was some kind of mishap with our bill? They had to bring us 3. By the end of our experience everyone was just frustrated and extremely underwhelmed with our service.

We sat at the bar, where we commiserated about our shared national despair with our bartender, Nell, who whipped up some potent white sangrias for us.  I think El Dorado makes the best sangria ever; no limpy, wimpy glass of fruit juice, it's full of fresh fruit and a generous helping of alcohol spiking the wine. 

All that talk, chips, and tasty salsa got us hungry, so we shared a Signature Bowl, choosing the grilled steak with cilantro, black beans and cheese.  It was delicious, and half the bowl was more than enough to eat, especially after all those chips we scarfed down.  

We also shared one of the complimentary flans that we both got for checking in on Yelp, saving the other one for another time.  It's among my top three lifetime flans in terms of creamy deliciousness.

Nell was a great bartender, server, and post-election shrink.  And another thing that I love, though my patriotism might be questioned, is that not every TV in the joint shows sports.  The one right in view at the bar treated us to a Shakira concert, followed by one by the late, great Selena.  Not to worry, sportsaholics, there are other TVs that cater to your obsession.  Just choose your seat carefully.

To the uninitiated, El Dorado Cantina, which is open 24 hours, is physically connected to that famous blue neon gentlemen's club, Sapphire (though not connected otherwise).  Neither of us had ever been there, so in the interest of providing info to tourists, we popped in for a quick look-see.  Locals don't have to pay the big admission fee.  

So go to El Dorado, and if you don't want to have that fabulous flan, you can go next door for your ""dessert.""  You CAN have your cake and eat it, too.",15,12,12

Red velvet walls with an awkward layout. There were allot of guys in there so I'm guessing they eat then head to the strip club next door. They are open 24 hours so they are working that card.

Tacos are a tortilla filled with meat, cheese, cilantro, pico de gallo and folded over once. It comes in a hard or soft shell. Enchiladas are tortillas filled with meat with cheese, onions, sour cream etc. Burritos are....you get the idea
El Dorado uses the same ingredients as Robertos except they use different spices and PRESENTATION which makes a big difference not mention that it shares wall space with a gentlemens club ( strippers is the operative word here ) and a wait staff that will kiss your bottom so well you are obligated to leave a nice tip. 
Expensive? Definitely. Prices are almost triple than off strip joints that serve great food. 
Alcohol? Yes, again priced heavily 
Ambiance? It's just ok
Gluten free and something else....I forget. Either way it's an excuse to charge more. It's like overpaying for stuff at Whole Foids because it's organic. 
 Bottom line is I was not impressed with the taste of the food. The presentation was nice. The  fresh guacamole made at your table was good but way overpriced. $16 for three avocados and ingredients. Please. Margaritas were very good even if you only have three sips through a straw before you were finished. They were very strong. 
Would I go back? No!
 If you want to impress visitors from out of town this would be the place to take them. And if you time it just right you might catch a glimpse of a whole table full of strippers I just got off the shift enjoying their shift meal before returning to the laps of luxury next door.

The table guac and salsas are amazing.... However that's all I had after an hour and a half! Not joking. Not even a refill of water. Finally had to leave. No dinner, and my drink that took 30 min to even get ordered never came. When I told the waiter that finally came around to take orders after 1 hour and 25 min being there that my drink never came and that I had to leave because my ride was on their way and couldn't even order now he said ""ok"" and went to the next person. That's it. Wow.
Instead of being able to order a dinner at that point I asked him for at least more chips and water since our table had our salsas and the whole order of guac just sitting there with nothing to eat it with and all of our glasses empty... And had been for quite a while.... Nope, never showed even after another 15 min. No one ever once came by to refill water, to check on us, no one watching the fact that there was no chips to eat the table guac...  Never saw a person to even ask. Watched another table get seated 30 min after we were seated get ordered and served their food before the waiter even came around to take our order. Ride came, Had to leave. 
I am beyond disappointed as I was starving both when I got there and also when I left. Service is awful, no staff to be seen. Waiters attitude was beyond terrible. 
Btw, this was a party of 20. Special bday celebration. They knew we coming, and this was the service that was provided. Not cool. 
Second star is just me being courteous. 

***FOOD IS COLD!!!!***** can I take away a star please!?!? 
Yep, went back again only because the girls I was meeting chose the place.... Again the salsas and table guac was great. This time our waiter was pretty good. 
Party of 3, ordered margaritas and when they came, woah! So much lime juice and ""agave nectar"" but little to no alcohol. Second one came in a rocks glass instead of margarita glass because they ""ran out of glasses"" really? I'm certain if I poured the amount of liquid in my glass into a shot glass it would not have even filled it. So much ice and, yep, more lime juice! Ugh my stomach!
Ordered the street tacos. One shrimp, one (spicy)pork. Plate came a la cart. Would have been nice to know that. Shrimp was very strongly fishy smelling (I know better than to eat anything that smells fishy) and cold and my pork taco had exactly 2 pieces of meat in it. One piece was approximately 1\/2 inch of actual meat and the other was an equal amount of complete fatty nothingness, inedible. Neither taco was even remotely warm. It is beyond obvious that all food is prepared well, if not days, in advanced and then only partially warmed to order. I'm not sure with how many multiple reviews of this place complaining of the same thing it is not yet rectified. And honestly I'm not sure how the health district is not yet aware of the problem. It's amazing no one has gotten sick yet. 
Our party moved to the bar after dinner for one more round and even after asking for ""light on the lime juice"" was served an extremely acidic margarita again with no alcohol. When I asked for a solution, the bartender handed me a shot glass full of more ""agave nectar"" as the solution with no explanation. I tried a drop or two of that and then added more ice from my own water glass to try to solve the problem but really it was just way to sour and acidic to drink. As of now, 5 hrs later, my stomach has still not settled either from the ""fishy shrimp"" or the acid margarita I'm not sure but ugh. 
So basically this place just has consistently given me a bad experience. I will not be going back. And I will tell and share my experience with others. Disappointing to say the least. Again I will say the idea of a organic and non gmo would be nice.... But not this place.  Save your stomach and go to any other hole in the wall for a better plate to be sure. And guaranteed it will be cheaper too! I didn't even go there, but our bill was $87 for 6 street tacos, table guac, and 6 drinks (little to no alcohol!). Pretty Pricey dontcha think!? Robertos and a six pack would be step up from this experience.",0,0,0

I've tried the al pastor, carnitas, carne asada, & shredded chicken street tacos - all were very tasty. My personal favorite is the al pastor. Plates are served with beans (okay)and cilantro lime rice, which is a nice change to the normal Mexican rice. 

The chicken lettuce tacos were also very good. At first I was hesitant to order them, fearing it wouldn't be enough to fill the belly.  The tacos are large and served with diced chicken in bib lettuce with some toppings. As it turns out, they are actually quite filling and delicious. A hungry male might be inclined to order a street taco on the side, but it should be plenty for the average gal. 

The empanadas weren't extraordinary, and for the price it wasn't much. I probably wouldn't order this item again. 

The flan was definitely the standout item here. I would forgo the appetizer and save room for this instead! 

They serve red and green salsa with the chips (first basket is complimentary), both are yummy. They also have (had?) a spicy habanero salsa. When I first started coming here it was served with the chips- but the last couple of times it hasn't been. Not sure if you have to ask for it now or it was taken off of the menu?  

Service here isn't the greatest, thus the -1 star. I've been here several times when they are busy and slow. Its always a crapshoot. They forget to go orders, take a long to take customer order, etc.

The food here is fantastic!  Once inside you'll see the place is not terribly big but all and all it has a very good atmosphere.  All the food on their menu is organic and you can certainly taste it.  I personally ordered the carne asada burrito which came filled with very tasty meat as well as fresh and very green guacamole.  The burrito itself did not have beans in it but I had them add refresh beans which tasted amazing.  The plate had a side of cilantro rice which I typically don't like but theirs is quite flavorable.  

My wife ordered the three taco plate, all of which came topped with pineapple and sided with the cilantro rice and your choice of black or refried beans.  

Coming from so cal is highly recommend the food here as a must try in Vegas!

Cons: for some famalies they may find the fact this restaurant is housed and sharing a wall with a strip club off putting. They also share a common parking lot.

The house salsa was very tasty, but after the first small dish they charge $3.50 for additional salsa which seems a bit excessive.

The last cons for me was prices were a little high. The asada burrito was $16.50 and the taco plates are $13.00.  

Service was very polite, but refills took a bit of time to arrive and considering it was not horribly busy if be concerned about this should the place be handling a full crowd.",0,0,0

This would be considered my third visit and probably my last. We came in with an open mind and a craving for Mexican food. Ordered our appetizers; nachos and shrimp taquitos. The nachos were so dry we might of as well just ordered chips and salsa, I will give them a gold star for the shrimp taquitos they were amazing and they are served with plenty of guacamole. 
After the appetizers we ordered our meals; I had the carnitas tacos which had so many dry pieces it felt like chewing on beef jerkey. My other half ordered a chicken burritos chimichanga style, it looked and tasted like a giant hot pocket. There was no exquisite flavor in either meal, I asked for the salt and pepper to add some pizzazz to the meal. No love was given to making the meal",1,2,0

It looks like liberace may have decorated the place after a trip to mexico. Vibrant red walls combine with more traditional mexican lighting accents.
The food here is fantastic but kind of expensive. So come on taco tuesday when margaritas are cheap and tacos are only $3.50. Some places offer cheap margarita specials on tue or happy hour but the glass is half the size of their regular margarita. Not here at el dorado. The margarita is full size and the tacos r the same.

Establishing a 24\/7 Mexican restaurant next to a busy strip club has to be one of the best ideas ever. Drunk ass people and tacos are match made in heaven. All right, let's get to the review:

First course: Guacamole and chips - This was the only first course option offered. I was expecting an individual serving of guacamole and chips. Instead, I received a tiny serving of guacamole and had to share a bowl of chips with the rest of my party. 

Second course: I went for the lengua street tacos, but there's the option to choose whatever kind you desire. Except you can't mix and match. The platter comes with three street tacos and a side of beans and rice. The tacos weren't bad, and thankfully I didn't taste any of the ""texture"" that's sometimes left on lengua. The rice was one of the best parts of my meal, to tell you the truth.

Third course: Churros with Mexican chocolate sauce was the only dessert option offered. The warm, deep fried churros were filled with caramel, and the sauce was cold. Not a fan of the combo.

Other: Orders were coming out at different times. My guess was the restaurant was understaffed and only one person was in charge of delivering orders to the tables. 

Overall: El Dorado isn't a restaurant that  I would drive out of the way for, especially considering the variety of cuisine offered nearby both off and on The Strip. But hey, this spot is especially convenient if you want some grub and booze after visiting the strip club.",2,1,1

I suggest the chicken quesadilla and the Mexican Burger, both very VERY well-prepared dishes. The margaritas are humongous and the flan- OH MY GOODNESS THE FLAN- is exquisite. 

If you ever find yourself on the Las Vegas Strip, please make it a point to stop by and say hello to Chef Paco, he's so sweet.

We were seated right away and the staff was very friendly. The reason for the three stars is because of the food. It tasted okay but I really don't believe the food is ""100% organic"" as our server claimed and for me that's a big deal. Being that we feed our kids organic meats only we know not only the taste of the different meats but we know the cost that comes along with it. 

The nachos were delicious but the chicken tasted more like turkey. The carnitas were very tasty but there's something about them that makes me skeptical that they truly are 100% grass fed. Maybe it's because I know the challenge of finding truly organic pork and the fact that they served a huge pile of it raises red flags for me. The eggs didn't have the fresh taste like the ones we purchase from our local farmers markets and why would a place that claims to be organic not offer more organic beverage choices i.e. Stuff made out of fresh fruits in house? 

Again, the service was wonderful and the experience of dining here was not too bad. If you're not concerned with eating organic this place is not bad at all. If you are seriously concerned about eating organic I'd stay home.",0,0,0

Guacamole - they forgot to put salt or spices in it - so it tasted very bland. Like I was basically just eating an avocado. Disappointing

It's been on my bookmark list for a while and I've heard really good things. I came here on a Friday night after the normal place I go to had a line out the door. I was with some under age people so we couldn't sit at the bar. We walked in and were seated promptly but no one came over to us for a while. They were down on servers. We sat down opened up the menu and were surprised by the prices. $20 for a burrito is a lot. $4.50 for tacos.. The twice what I normally pay. We decided to stay and try it out. We saw they have Happy Hour from 12am-2am but it said only at the bar. When the waitress was finally able to come over we asked if it was possible to order from HH at the table and she said no. She was really nice about it and asked another server if they would be okay with it but ended up being a no. I just think they shouldn't put the advertisement on the table them or offer specials for the table too. The table comes with chips and red and green salsa, green was my fav, but refills for chips and salsa is $3.50. That just crazy to me. Anyways, I decided to try some different tacos and see what the hype has been about. My friend ordered the same and the others had a burrito and salad. I ordered the carnitas, al pastor, and carne asada. My favorite was the carne asada. My friend's order came with rice and beans which were alright, nothing special.

I told my fiancé I had a new place to try for date night and you could imagine his confusion\/excitement when Google Maps took us right to the front door of The Sapphires Gentlemen's Club...

Once he got over the fact that we weren't going to have naked women dance on our laps he led me into El Dorado.

When we walked in the place was pretty empty besides one or two other small groups but when the Host found out we didn't have a reservation she told us it would be a fifteen minute wait? I was truly confused due to how open it was but before I could protest she offered us a seat at the bar since there was no wait and it was happy hour, and I do love a good happy hour!

Our bartender was nice and quick to get us a couple $5.00 Margaritas (strong and decent sized for happy hour pricing).

You have to try their street tacos. There's no other option in my opinion. $2.00 per taco for happy hour and they are so packed full of gorgeous flavors and so full of meat, they were a steal for that price! 

Between the both of us we tried the chicken, carnitas, and al pastor street tacos.

Chicken- 5\/5
Al Pastor- 5\/5
Carnitas- 15\/5

Best carnitas taco I have ever had! Probably in my life and I've lived basically steps away from TJ.

I would have gotten another round but my tummy was to filled with Margaritas and Carnitas for even one more bite!

We will definitely be returning for happy hour!",8,7,9

Came here in locals night, so our entire bill was 25% off and they let us combine that with the Yelp check in offer for the Free flan, which was incredible tasting and I am not a Flan fan in the slightest. But I am getting ahead of myself.

My date made a reservation for 5:00 pm on Monday, Locals Night, where locals get 25% off their total bill, they also have a happy hour that runs from 4 to 6 that I want to try out. It was fairly dead when we got there, secret tip from me to you have dinner between 5 and 5:30 most restaurants have low business at that time. We were seated right away, my date had already had a gin and tonic since he was early and he was raving about the gin. Our server greeted us promptly and had a bunch of suggestions for us, we ended up taking her appetizer suggestion but not the entrée, we got the Aguachiles, which was their answer to ceviche, it was good. Not super spicy though you could tell it wanted to be, apparently it's usually very spicy and we must have gotten a weak batch? Oh well. 

For our entrée we got the beef and chicken fajitas to share and they were delightful, you get a mountain of peppers and onions and an all right portion of meat, a DELICIOUS cilantro rice, now I don't eat rice as a rule, but this was fantastic, came in a cute little shape as well. We also got rice, guac, and sour cream. The food was excellent. 

We finished with the best Flan I've ever had in my life. I pretty much hate flan. It's flavorless gelatin to me, I try it every time I'm with someone who gets it and it usually reaffirms my dislike, but this flan was ALMOST a caramel cheesecake, it was insane and I would go back just to eat that flan again. As we were wrapping up dessert the chef came out and chatted with us a bit and gave us a coupon for their breakfast. Apparently this place is 24 hours, so crazy!

The margaritas with tres generation tequila.... Can you say Ole!!

The fact that it was next door to an upscale strip joint and that it was male stripper night and the El Dorado was packed with hot 20 somethings...made for great people watching and listening!!

I really enjoyed the tableside guacamole and fresh chips. The guacamole was fresh and spicy! This is huge - because I've had paste guacamole that tastes like it is dispensed from a plastic bag and mixed with excessive lime juice. This was not the case here at El Dorado Cantina.

The street tacos were awesome. The night I was there they were all you can eat. I have since heard that the all you can eat street tacos are no longer offered. This is unfortunate. The word was the restaurant was losing money on them. Maybe management needs to think of things differently - as I came to El Dorado because I had heard of the all you can eat street tacos. 

The street taco's come in six different selection choices. They pride themselves on all organic meet, herbs, and vegetables. My favorite was the Al Pastor, which is organic marinated pork with organic pineapple, onion, lime, and cilantro. My second favorite was the Carne Asada. This had organic steak, onion, lime, cilantro, and guacamole. You can also try the Carnitas, Pulled Chicken Cochinita, and Corn Rajas.

During our meal, I was introduced to some of the fresh fruit beverage options that upon request were topped over ice cold certified organic Prairie Vodka. This is a must try!

There are large booths around a bar. Once seated someone brought  a few waters and said will return with chips. He came back and said someone would be with us soon to take our order. We waited about 10 minutes and no one returned. The same person came back and said he would take our drink order and someone else would take our food order. He suggested we start on the table side guacamole and we agreed. We watched the server go to the bartender and tell him he wasn't sure who our server was supposed to be but we had been sitting there awhile.  It was definitely awkward. The gm of the restaurant also came by but still no waiter. He came back with our delicious but spicy jalapeño margaritas and we snacked on chips and salsa. There were three provided: a red salsa with medium heat, a green salsa very flavorful, and a thin red sauce that looked and tasted like straight up hot sauce. It would have been nice if there was an explanation of the three. Next was the table side guacamole. The server came with all the fixings and asked us what we preferred in our guacamole. He went over the menu, explaining everything was non gmo including the chips. He also apologized that our server still hadn't been by. There were two small wedding parties taking place but aside from that there were only three other tables including ours. No real excuse for our ""waiter"" to not have been by in the 30 minutes we had been there. We snacked on the guacamole which needed more salt but overall was very good. You could taste the fresh avocado and freshly smashed garlic. 

Our waiter finally showed up and I asked his opinion on what dish to order. He said hmm let me see the menu and suggested the pork chili verde. My fiancé ordered a carne asada burrito. Our food came quickly, almost too quickly compared to the wait for a waiter.  The mole looked unappetizing on the plate chucks of meat under a thick green sauce covered in pepitas. I have had mole before but it never looked like this. I tasted a chuck of meat which was fork tender. It was hard to get it down. The meat tasted microwaved! My fiancé tasted it and suggested I eat half of his burrito it was that bad! I decided to taste another piece, it was Inedible there was no way I could eat it. I moved on to the black beans...horrible too! They lacked in flavor and seasoning. It was like they opened the can and put it on a plate. The cilantro rice along side tasted like uncle bens rice with seasoning.  The carne asada burrito on the other had was awesome! The meat was so tender and flavorful. 

Overall, I would probably not make the drive back to return for a meal. If in the area, maybe for happy hour which offers half off drinks and appetizer specials but the experience in a whole was a turnoff. I will stick with Leticia's  Mexican cucina in Centennial Hills which is always good.",1,0,0

Veggie enchiladas, tube-tacular.  Cedar plank chipotle salmon, dying now. Cilantro rice, shockingly tasty.

The place is pretty huge, but dimly lit, had large booths and tables, good for large parties. 

Guacamole is wayyyy overpriced..but that is because they bring out a sexy lady to make the guac at the table. We ordered Imperial Shrimp which was tasty enough, Pozole which was alright, Taquitos which was pretty good, and Chapulines (grasshoppers) which really didn't have any flavors.

With an almost 5 star rating, I was expecting some bomb ass Mexican food. If it weren't for the kindness and customer service skills of the general manager, I would have given El Dorado's 1 star. We came on Monday around 7PM, on locals night. As many others have attested, this restaurant is kind of hard to find. Parking was extremely crowded (Sapphire's must be a popular strip club). My husband eventually spotted the entrance and we walked right in. We were seated immediately and our waiter greeted us in no time. So far, so good, right? 

We were automatically given two glasses of water and chips and salsa. The water tasted gross and dirty. After one sip, I pushed it to the side. The chips and salsa were okay. The waiter recommended some kind of fruit infused water and then walked away. Hey, what about my drink order? I grew thirstier and thirstier after munching on chips and salsa while waiting on our waiter to come back. Finally, he returned and instead of taking our drink order, asks if we've decided on what to eat. Fine. I ordered the cheese enchiladas ($9.50), with a Coke please. My husband ordered Steak al Cilantro ($26.50). 

The food came out pretty quickly, but the visual presentation for both our entrees was seriously lacking. The cheese on my enchiladas looked like it had been sitting out for a while. The red sauce looked and tasted like it came from a can. I am a mediocre cook at best, and I could have made better enchiladas.The rice was bland and flavorless and was NOT Mexican rice by my standards. The refried beans tasted too meaty. The enchiladas were lackluster but I ate them anyways. Sigh.     

My poor husband's steak looked like slop. According to the menu, the steak was ""topped"" with green tomatillo sauce. My ass. That shit was drenched in it. My husband said all he could taste was that sauce. Other words he used to describe his meal were ""worst steak in my life"" and ""the first bite was pure fat that I chewed for 5 minutes"". Needless to say, he sent it back. 

Our waiter had gone MIA and never bothered to check on us after dropping off the food. The general manager is the one who actually checked on us and sent back the plate. She was totally cool about the whole thing. She recommended  the Cochinita pork tacos ($9.50), so he went with that. 

In the meantime, we were also waiting on refills. The waiter was still missing. When the GM returned with the pork tacos, we asked HER if we could get refills. My husband said the pork tacos were just okay.  

At this point, we couldn't wait to get out of there. The waiter with the disappearing act returned to clear our plates and get us our check. The final bill was a shockingly low $12.97, but that's still overpriced if I don't like the food. The manager was a sweetheart and gave me her card to let her know if I would be coming in again and if I had any comments for her. While I appreciate this gesture, we will not be returning. The food and service (the waiter) were plain bad. I was also disappointed in the so-called plethora of vegetarian options I read about in reviews. El Dorado's has the same options as any other Mexican restaurant, so don't get your hopes up.",17,5,4

After all, El Dorado Cantina is considered one of the best high end Mexican resto in the city. We arrived at 7 p.m., on time for our reservation and despite the restaurant being not busy, we were told to wait an extra 20 mins for our table - no biggie, since they then proceed to seat us on a comfy booth table, overlooking the main dining area of the restaurant. The space was quite spacious, decorated with bold Mexican flair, rather old school, but romantic at the same time - we loved it! 

They started us off with a complimentary chips and salsas, and their version of two salsas was truthfully one of the best to date. They are spicy, fresh and addicting! The chips were also crunchy.

For the food the two of us ordered and shared: 

* Grilled Steak fajita: I was disappointed with how this dish turned out when it's served to me. I was expecting it would be presented on a hot sizzling skillet, but the meat was cold... Probably, it has been sitting out for a while. The server also fails to bring us the tortillas and the rest of the sides that come with the fajita, that we have to request it TWICE! Other than that slightly big mistake, the flavors were all good!

* Octopus and Chorizo taco: Just one bite of this and I'm done... It honestly tasted horrible, super bland and the octopus was really dry and rubbery, ugh. 

* Short rib taco: The highlight of the night! I love short ribs, especially if it's really nicely seasoned and super tender like this one! Definitely one of the most stunning taco I've tried so far. 

The service was kinda off; distant attitude, missing orders and as we waited what seems like forever for our food, the waitress hardly ever checks in on us. The food was actually good, but not THAT good that we can look beyond the bad services, lol. Overall, happy to have tried this once, but don't think I will be counting on El Dorado for a splendid Mexican meal in the near future.",38,26,36

The food is Non GMO and the proteins are free from antibiotics, pesticides, and steroids. the waiter brought out some chips and salsas right away and we ordered some guacamole which is prepared tableside to you liking. I had an ear of Mexican street corn(elote) which was perfectly grilled an just enough spice along with the cheese and mayo.

This places shares the parking lot\/building with a gentlemen's club, SERIOUSLY!  When we pulled up, I was like, ""Wait! Is this place inside the titty bar?!?!? I mean like tacos & titties?!?!?"" But I quickly realized that there are two very separate entrances. I mean, I may be Gay and all, but I am NOT opposed to tacos & titties!! However, it did throw me off for a quickness!
Anyways, back to my experience with them. Once you get over joking around with the hostess regarding the location, to which she was a champ at; I assumed she's had this dialogue before. She was super sweet and awesome, and very attentive. Our server came over rather quickly and she was super friendly, sweet and nice. She laughed a lot whit us while we were there. They weren't terribly busy, however it was nice to have someone so pleasant taking care of us. 
As for our food. We started off with guacamole, which they make to order at your table. It was fresh, it was good it was just missing some salt. One of us ordered the shredded beef enchiladas and they were tasty, it was missing a little something something in the flavor department as well as the seafood enchiladas as someone else ordered in our party. The base of the each plate was there, like you taste that they could have been SUPER tasty, however they were missing just that one little flavor to make them POP! However, they were good. I ordered the chicken nachos, I'm kind of a sucker for finger foods! The chicken was super tasty and tender. The chips were great! The nachos overall, were perfect. I also ordered a jalapeno margarita which was YUMMY! Although, they attached 3\/4 of a jalapeno to the side of the glass, which was a bit of an overkill, but the drink was YUMMY! My only downside, I judge a lot of Mexican places by their beans. And their beans were a bit off. They needed to be refried just a bit more and smoothed out. However, keep in mind they refry them in animal lard, just like the way you're suppose too!! 
One thing I won't lie to you about is the price. It is on the pricier side of things especially for lunch. I mean my margarita alone was like $12 and entrees were about $12 and up, not to say they didn't have less expensive items, but the entrees were in the low teens and up. So be prepared to eat and spend if you go for lunch. We noticed that they had a lot of happy hour specials, like on Wed they offer free tequila and then their daily one from 5pm-11pm looks like they had some GREAT specials!
Definitely will keep this on my ""let's try again list"" and want to go back for their Happy Hour treats! Plus, service was great. Again, just don't let the titty bar next to them fool ya!!",2,2,0

It was not crowded at all and we were seated immediately and welcomed by our waiter. We ordered tableside guac and my friends ordered a few drinks. The guac was easily the BEST guac we have ever had. It was extremely fresh and the flavors were perfect. It was the right amount of spicy. I still dream about that guac sometimes LOL. 

My friends got sangria, strawberry mojitos, and a margarita which they said was the best they have ever had as well. 

I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito and got it chimichanga style (deep-fried). It was a very large burrito and could have been shared by two people. I really enjoyed it and would definitely get it again. My friend got shrimp and steak fajitas and thought they were really good too.

For dessert, we checked into Yelp and got 2 free flans (2 check-ins) and it was also amazing. 

The waiters then escorted us to the club next door for free which was awesome. 

Would definitely come back for that guac if I'm ever in Vegas again!",2,2,3

This is one of the few restaurants in town that uses exclusively free-range and locally-grown ingredients that are free from antibiotics, pesticides, and steroids. This is true for their produce, dairy, meat, and chips.

The food is beautiful on every plate with robust flavors and delectable textures. The chef is eager to talk with his customers to hear their feedback and just shoot-the-breeze. He's truly personable and a joy to talk with in the nicely decorated interior of the building.

While the street tacos were pretty good. The service is what really drives me away. Most of their signature tacos I did not order were expensive and were actually pretty bland. I would be careful coming here. Maria looks at customers as money bags not people. Note this place also has been flagged for multiple reviews from the same IP address so this place is as shady as it comes.

Parking
Pretty plentiful. Note that it is attached to the strip club. I originally thought it was just next to it.

Service
The worst service experience I have ever had. We came in at 2am on Tuesday wanting to try all of their street tacos. Our waitress Maria recommended we try the Chile Verde, shrimp and octopus. Which was fine but then she then passed by and mentioned something about cabeza and lengua in which we said no thank you, but it still came out anyway. She then took it upon herself to just order random signature taco on the menu without telling us.

When she brought out the tacos she only named the tacos that we ordered and skipped over everything else. Which turned out to be tacos from their more expensive signature tacos, most of which not even as good as their street tacos. We were only expecting to pay $20-$30 for this meal, walked out feeling swindled and $80 lighter.

Food
Carne Asada - Standard carne asada. 3 stars

Cochinita - I really enjoyed this one. First time ever hearing about this. 5 stars

Al Pastor - Again nothing special compared to the other various places I have tried. 3 stars

Pulled Chicken - Other places have rather dry chicken and this place does a good job of marinating theirs. 4 stars

Carnitas - Had an extra kick to it that made it stand out. 4 stars

Corn Rajas -  Just plain weird, I knew it was meatless.1 star

Chile Verde - Pretty good. 4 stars

Octopus-Chorizo - Chorizo is always a bit too salty for my taste but adding octopus made it just plain weird. It also looked like they burned the octopus. 1 star

Shrimp - Meh I have experienced better. 2 stars


Mentioned but did not agree to order them.

Lengua - Was lacking in flavor. 2 stars.

Cabeza - Again nothing special from anywhere else I have tried. 3 stars.


Tacos that were not even mentioned and came out just because.

Salmon - This seemed like a dish they had just because it was just bland and the most expensive taco ($8!) that we did not order. 1 star.

Grilled Mahi - Again nothing special. 3 stars.

Fried shrimp? - Not sure what this was suppose to be on the menu but it was like small pieces of fried something with a lot of garnishes that tasted sweet.1 star.",2,0,1

Light crispy chips served with red and green salsa. 

We ordered the table side guacamole, an assortment of street tacos, beef taquitos and albondigas soup. If I had to choose my favorite taco then I'd say the Cochinita was the tastiest. The beef taquitos were ok but, the portion size would be more fit for a child's menu. The only item I didn't care for at all was the Albondigas soup. It was very bland.

And somehow other customers that came in in the meantime were getting served first.  Um, hello?  Do you even know how to run a restaurant?  

Oh but it gets worse.  After waiting an hour they finally brought out our food and then even though I had ordered a vegan entre they had sprinkled cheese on my food and I had to send it back and wait even longer to get my food.  

But thats not all.  The food itself was incredibly bland and tasteless compared to the Mexican food I make at home....and I'm not even Mexican!  I'm just a regular american guy but somehow I know how to cook better mexican food than this place!

We came here on our 2nd night in Las Vegas and had read rave reviews about this place. We had made a reservation for 7:00 for 3 people on  a Friday night, but we weren't able to locate the restaurant since it's located right in\/next to Sapphire night club. Not an ideal location I'd want to go to for a restaurant, but hey it's Vegas fine whatever. Their parking lot is a disaster, good luck trying to get any direction or assistance with parking in that beat up flea market lot... and after all that hassle we finally manage to make it into the restaurant 20 minutes past 7:00. We apologize for our late arrival, but we had a reservation. I'm not even sure if the host had his mouth wired shut or he was just that much of a rude person but rolled his eyes and tried to mumble something t.....as if it was a problem...... there were 5 booths open. Wasn't even a busy night by the looks of it. We were greeted promptly by our waited, took our drink orders, returned with chips and salsa... standard fare for Mexican places, nothing exciting. My fiance ordered a carnitas burrito, my mother ordered tacos, and I a chicken burrito....and then we were left staring at the our phones as the time ticked by....it took nearly an hour to bring out three burritos. Prior to their arrival however 30  minutes in our server claimed our food was coming out soon, then a few minutes later the manager asks us if we need anything... We look around and nod, yes we still need our food? After this mind you, few more people have arrived and had had their orders taken, and food has arrived at their table. Now, I honestly don't think our meal took that much preparation, maybe for enchiladas or something of that nature but really, two burritos and tacos? Finally the Manager brings out our food, which is luke warm by now does not offer an apology for the delay. Burrito tasted like something I could've made at home, in less time and tasted better. My fiance and mother seemed satisfied with their choices, but nothing extraordinary. Ive honestly had better tasting food at hole in the wall places than this so called upscale Mexican place. After all that mess it took forever to get the check, and even longer to get the receipt and go. Maybe this place has more charm when you're there for the liquor and not a meal.

Mind you what really bothered me the most about this place was lack of customer service for ALL guests. Two girls from the club next to this place barely stepped in before they were whisked to a table behind us, drink orders taken before they even sat down, and their food was brought to them before ours was and we'd been waiting almost an HOUR. Ridiculous. Not a single apology was made about this delay.

AND to add to this whole issue, we made reservations through Open Table, and they flagged us for no shows and had to dispute that as well. Never coming back to this place.",0,0,0

There's no way to get around it: this trendy, swanky restaurant is connected to Sapphire's Gentleman's club. Yes, they even share the same parking lot, and the entrances are just a few feet apart. It was a bit unnerving at first to see elderly couples and young children heading towards the strip...er, I mean Mexican restaurant.

Ok, so now you have the location down, let's talk about the experience: walking into this place is truly enchanting. The word that comes to mind is sexy: from the silky-satin rose wall decor to the dark wood tones to the sumptuous and inviting leather couches and booths. My aesthetic expectations were certainly exceeded.

My friend and I came here to celebrate Mexican independence day (no, I'm not Mexican, but I do LOVE tequila), and El Dorado was offering free tequila shots every hour on the hour for 24 hours along with food specials. Bonus points for a creative promotion! 

We ensconced ourselves on one of the sexy leather couches, and were pleasantly surprised with the annotated menu which indicates which items are designated GF-gluten free, V-vegetarian they indicated their non-GMO mantra. So far, so pleased! 

The manager Arianna came over and greeted us, and Chef Paco checked on us as well. I love it when the chef steps out of the kitchen to greet the customers he's serving!  Both of them were quite accommodating, but our server was a bit absent minded. He neglected to deliver our tequila shots at the top of the hour, forgot to return with the limes we'd requested, and didn't really check on us after we tasted our food.

We ordered the tableside  guacamole because it seemed like a good idea. Our server indicated that he was not the type who smiles  (this, after I told him I'd be taking a photograph). I got him to laugh and snapped the picture at the right moment. Unfortunately the guac desperately needed salt, and there was none to be found anywhere near  our table. We were finally able to get some seasonings after we flagged down our server.

I liked the presentation of trio of salsas, but the salsa verde was the only flavor I really enjoyed. The street tacos and the chicken tinga tostadita were lovely in presentation, but the chicken was cold.  I ordered a margarita, and it was made with agave syrup. It was ok, but didn't give me any thrills.

I really want to love this place, and the attentive manager and chef make me want to come back. They're still new, and it's obvious that they need to work out a few minor details with the food, but this place has loads of potential.

5 star decor and a sexy vibe make me want to return.  Next time I'll try the entrees.

Mexican independence day was a success thanks to El Dorado Cantina.   I almost forgot they shared a common wall with a strip club. This place is a refreshing change from the greasy Mexican restaurants. 
Please keep up the creative promotions!",3,1,1

We were on our way to Area 51 when me and my friend decided to hit up a local organic restaurant, since we missed out on some Nicaraguan\/Spanish food back in LA, we decided to check this place out. 

Let me start off by listing some negatives about this restaurant, the parking and location. My friend and I, are very new to Las Vegas so of course we were somewhat surprised to see a strip club,gentlemen's club or adult store in every corner of Vegas and this restaurant just so happens to be directly in the same building of one of these gentlemen's club. We were confused on whether this was a restaurant within the facility or entirely on its own as the parking lot strictly stated that parking was for VIP club members and that non VIP members would be towed. Even though the restaurant is directly next to the club, we did not see any designated parking for the restaurant. We took the risk of a parking ticket and parked our car further down a mini parking lot for another adult gift shop even though we weren't going to shop there. 

Besides these two problems I had absolutely no problem with the food at all. We took advantage of my yelp membership to get a free flan and it was quite delicious. The main meal we ordered was the Carne Asada Burritos and they were quite delicious. The chips that came with the salsa was also delicious and there was no problem with the serving portions as it was enough for 2 people to eat and we still had some leftovers from the chips! So there's no need to worry about serving sizes for the chips as usually free chips with priced refills are served underwhelmingly but not at this place! If I'm ever at Las Vegas again I'll be sure to come back for more as this was one of the best organic food options out here in Las Vegas! Just please work on that parking issue!",0,0,0

My favorite dish is the chicken bowl but every time we go everyone walks away happy and full.  Keep in mind I would say that the price description is a little off.  It is not a cheap Mexican restaurant the dishes are from $12-$24  with the Fajitas being around $22-$26.00.",2,0,1

The restaurant itself is very nice and the service was also very good. With that being said, I was somewhat disappointed with my first dining experience. First grievance is that the music in the restaurant is way too loud. You literally have to scream at the person next to you to have a conversation. It was hard to genuinely enjoy a meal with friends because the noise level was so distracting. Second, the food portion sizes are way too small for the amount that they are. I ordered shrimp tacos ($16.00) which were two corn tortilla tacos a la cart. To add rice (plain white rice)  and beans (refried or black) is an extra $3.00. I asked for a side of chipotle sauce and that was an extra $2.00. After all was said and done I walked out with $21.00 tacos and was still hungry.

The bathrooms were dirty and it stunk back in the hallway like old fish. Turned me off so bad.  We got a spicy Margarita and it was so sweet we both were puckering up. We sent it back and they remade it.
This place shares a parking lot with a strip club so when bringing your kids they may ask some questions lol be prepared for that. Service was good except we asked if they honor a military discount with they do. Handed our ID over to the waitress and she took it to the manager. He then came back after running our card with the copy and said have a good night. No discount? So we called him back and he was like oh I must of given it to someone else lol so he had to redo it and the original charge is still on there so hopefully that gets fixed by tomorrow.

The burrito contained nice tender and lean chunks of carnitas and filled with cilantro rice. Very tasty. I am a huge fan of spicy food and always seek the hottest I can find.

So while in Las Vegas, I had to try this place out because it fit the bill. Pulling into the parking lot on a Saturday night - it was confusing. Where do we go in?  Finally seeing the entrance on the side of the building, we knew we were in the right lot.

Walking in, we weren't sure *IF* we were in the strip club side or a restaurant. Realizing after the fact, a wedding had occurred and the wedding party was in the bar part of the restaurant, all dressed up making us feel like street bums.  Being escorted to the back past the DJ and the wedding party, there were a few small tables.  It was still very loud, but we gave it a try.

The food is AMAZING. Very good Habanero salsa, and we had the Al Pastor Street Tacos and Chicken Enchilada. Both had great flavor, good portion sizes and all the salsa you wanted to put on the food as well as eat with the chips. The food really is amazing. That's the reason for the 4 stars. I think next time we'll opt for carry out, and hope it survives the trip back to the hotel.  The only redeeming quality of this entire experience was our server Miguel, and the quality of the food.

But I have to say I have never been seated by a person wearing fish net stockings and lingerie. Hours later, I still can't shake the most bizarre dinner experience I have ever had in my life.  Blaring bad 80's music, drunk wedding party antics, Nascar on the big screen, and women walking around in lingerie? I guess that's why they say what happens in Vegas......",1,0,0

Kind of a strange\/industrial location but I saw all the great reviews and thought I'd give them a shot. And don't get me wrong, I'm in no way anti-strip club. Maybe if I'd have had some boobs in my face, I could have given this place a better review. Instead I just had to settle for looking down at my own, which wasn't half bad and all but, read on...

For starters, they serve up some very strong drinks (no complaints about that), the atmosphere wasn't bad, but the food didn't do it for me here and that to me is EVERYTHING. I had the Seafood Enchiladas and they don't compare to the ones at Javier's. They were good but nothing to write home about. Maybe I didn't order the right things at El Dorado. I'm not sure. 

My Jalapeño Margarita packed a punch but again in this department, I prefer Javier's. It didn't even taste like real lime juice that they were using. Their recipe was not my fave and dare I say eerily similar to a sickeningly sweet store bought pre-mixed even though the bartender assured me otherwise. I tried to doctor it up so I asked the bartender to add a little more lime juice to my drink and even that didn't even make my drink taste better or more lime-y, so I finally gave up and accepted my defeat. At least the drinks were getting me buzzed. 

I can't really remember much about the Table-Side Guacamole but I had that too. Unmemorable is never a good sign. I think Javier's just ruined me for all Mexican food places to follow. It's possible. I'll be honest, most other places don't really compare in my eyes. I should just stop cheating on Javier's.

I'm left scratching my head trying to figure out why this place is so popular. It could be the fact that they are open twenty-four hours a day. There aren't too many high end Mexican food restaurants to choose from at all hours of the night. The chef coming out of the kitchen to greet all the patrons was a nice gesture but it isn't enough to warrant a return trip, nor guarantee a five star review from me. 

I'm sad because I really wanted to like this place. I love what they are all about with their anti-GMO stance and their pride in using top quality ingredients as well as sustainable meat and fish. That's why I'm so confused about why their food was so lackluster because normally ""the good stuff"" tastes so much better to me. Off night? Beats the heck outta me!

I will say their Flan was the highlight of my meal. That stood out and was their saving grace! It was thick and creamy and off the charts good. However, unless I have an overwhelming urge to partake in that particular flan again, I probably wouldn't retrace my footsteps back to El Dorado Cantina for una repetición.",35,21,26

The place is actually REALLY nice, but in a kind of ""old-school"" Vegas way. RED!!! If you don't like red you MAY have a problem here! But we started with a few STUPID good margaritas and then the tableside guacamole. O...M...G. Our waiter was one of the best of my 62 year life, but the guac...everything put together in a molcajete, just absolutely perfect. Then I asked his advice on what HE loved, and he did not hesitate- the Cochinita Pibil!

But all that STILL doesn't prepare you for the dessert! And I don't wanna hear people say ""I never eat dessert"". Well suck it up cupcake, it's FREE (the flan is) if you register on Yelp!

But the flan...before ANYONE says ""I don't like flan"", my wife is from NY and as much as she likes Mexican food, she has NEVER liked flan. That always made me question why I married her, but maybe it's because she's never had LEGENDARY flan!!! This stuff is TRANSCENDENT! They claim no cheese is used, but it is SO incredibly...almost cream cheesy. Sorry, I'm about to have an accident here but that stuff should come with a warning that you can't eat just one! It is, simply put, the BEST flan on planet Earth, so quit looking elsewhere.

So, are you getting the feeling we liked it?! I'm telling you, we're going back this September for friends from Holland and we're gonna show them what REAL Mexican food is all about. I'm almost glad it's there and not HERE or my 240 would balloon to 400 in a month. OK THAT was a lie, I'd deal with being a very large person...happily. See you amazing people in September with a LARGE group of crazy Dutch people!!!",1,1,1

I was pretty disappointed by the food that we ordered, but maybe we just ordered the wrong things. We got the al pastor tacos, which were pretty dry in my opinion. You can add beans and rice to your plate, which I thought was better than the al pastor. We also got the Mole Enchiladas, which the chicken was also dry. The mole sauce was good and very flavorful.

The location IS next to a gentlemens club with the same parking but it has its own entrance and it's honestly not that big of a deal. Our server was Amber and she rocked it! Gave us good recommendations that weren't your standard ""this is popular BS"" that a lot of servers do to push certain items. She checked on us often and made sure we had everything we needed. We ordered the Carne Asada Burrito and 3 Tacos ( Al Pastor, Chicken, and Cochinita). The burrito was absolutely phenomenal. The beef was so tender I though I was eating short ribs! The tacos were all really good too but Cochinita was the star! I also ordered the Strawberry Margarita was which so good and so much! It's practically a fish bowl drink and it's not full of unnatural simple syrup or triple sec. Everything but tequila is organic in that sucker and they're even working on getting organic tequila too. We then met Chef Paco when we got our Yelp Flan (which is no small portion) and he told us about his grandmas authentic recipes and the importance of organic ingredients.

The Imperial Shrimp appetizer was so good, and presented beautifully. 

The White Sangria was interesting, the liquer they added made it a bit too sweet and smooth in the mouth for me but that's just a preference. 

I found the Jalapeño Margarita a bit uninspiring; tasty and not too spicy, it was totally fine and you'll probably like it--I just have impossibly high standards. I will try the house margarita next time. Which might be tomorrow. Definitely need to get back here before we leave.

The Pacos molé sampler knocked it out of the park. It's rare to find green pumpkin seed molé in restaurants let alone of this quality. The traditional chocolate molé was hands down the best I've ever had... and molé is my thing. I get it everywhere I go. 

The flan was a table pleaser. I'm not a flan expert so I can't say much more than I liked it, but my dining companions were enthusiastic about it.

I've heard many good things about El Dorado.  Saw some billboards advertising gluten free and non-gmo Mexican food.  Healthy Mexican food......interesting.  

Their menu is pretty pricey.  You as might as well call it strip prices.  $13 for 3 street tacos, and that doesn't even include refried beans and rice; however, locals get 25% off, and there are other deals throughout the week.  

Aside from pricey, their food was very delicious.  You start with chips and 2 salsa dips.  I had a house margarita for $11.  It's a large portion.  

Ordered the shrimp taquitos and carne asada tacos with refried beans and cilantro rice.  

The shrimp taquitos come in 5 and are normally on a bed of guac.  I decided to get it on the side.  They were smaller than the taquitos I'm used to, but since there were 5, they were very filling.  The shrimp took about 3\/4 of the actual taquito.  Sauce drizzled on the taquitos were tasty and no sauce I've ever tried before on a taquito.  Also good when dipping the taquito in guac.  

Each of the carne asada tacos had a generous portion of meat.  More like it was overfilled with meat, onions, and cilantro.  The meat definitely tasted like it was healthier, less greasy, and had more flavor to it than any carne asada I've had.  The refried beans tasted authentic as well as the cilantro rice.  

If you check in on Yelp, you get a free flan!  I was super stuffed and had to box my carne asada to go, but the flan was so awesome that I just scarfed it down with a quickness!  

Next time I'll have to try the tableside guac.

The server was very friendly and although there were some issues with the bill, it was quickly resolved without question.

I was definitely ready to call this a regular spot, but the experience was overshadowed by the OUTSIDE experience.  Firstly, as others have mentioned, it's difficult to find.  We drove to the south entrance, and was directed where to go by the attendant.  After being honked at by the various strip club clientele, we made our way to the front of the building.  

Parking was plenty and easy to find, but it's still shared with the strip club.  That also meant a visit from a golf-cart parking lot attendant, telling us we couldn't hang around there.  We had finished our meal with friends and were chatting for about 5 minutes, had the parking lot attendant attendant give us the ""you can't hang around here"" response, which we responded with a ""we're just talking with our friends"", which then resulted in a ""excuse me?  what was that?"" (ie, 'are you questioning my authority?'). Fine we get it.  

We wrapping up our goodbyes, however, that was cut short as the guy came back with a cart full of a couple girls 2 minutes later and actually almost hit my friend.  I guess - what - as a warning?  Great.  I now don't want to come back to a hidden gem of a restaurant, because some parking attendant had a power trip.

I disliked the location, however it was a family friendly place and my seven year enjoyed it. I had the veggie tacos and they were great, but the veggies were a little undercooked to my personal liking. The kids menu options were only $6 which was awesome pricing. Autumn informed us on the amazing vegetarian options for us and how they use non GMO ingredients. I also loved her presentation on the table side guacamole. It was the best guacamole I have tried and went home and made it myself extactly how she made it. Overall my experience was pleasent and we will be back to eat again. Request Autumn to be your server, you won't be disappointed!!!",1,0,1

We shared the guacamole which was prepared table side by Lindsey our server from absolutely fresh Ingredients including fresh garlic. We shared a tres leche for dessert. The meat was flavorful. The dishes had great seasoning . The service was fabulous. The place is offstrip and although $82 for two, it was a great value compared to the strip. One unnerving thing to mention is that when you pull up to the place you sign to a gigantic strip club. Rest assured the restaurant had a completely separate entrance and had a great family feel.",3,2,3
