I was very tempted to order the Rossini Burger but decided against it to design my own burger.  It was so yummy and juicy and flavorful.  There are different kinds of meat, bread, toppings, fries and onion rings, cheeses, and so many other options.  You can also add foie gras for an extra $12 dollars if you don't want to spend $60 for the Rossini.  I would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas, even if it is so far from everything else.

I took one for the team, loving vegetarian wife that I am, and we headed here.  We were told the wait was 30 minutes for lunch, but oh no, it was more like 45 mins.  I hate that.  

Anywho.

We had a really, really friendly waitress and got a great booth with our own television.  My husband took forevaaaaa picking a beer, but was impressed by the extensive selection.  For food I went with the greek salad, sweet potatoes fries, and a chocolate shake.  Who would've thought that they'd have a delicious greek salad for me to eat?!?!!  And the sweet potatoes fries were just right.  And the chocolate shake!  Wowsa!  I think part of my satisfaction is due to the fact that I NEVER eat fries or chocolate shakes, but still.

Located along bridge between Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Burger Bar has established itself over the past years as a standard in higher end gourmet burgers.

The menu here has some nice selections and variety for most who enjoy a great burger, healthy and not so healthy options are available. 

When approaching with a group make sure to grab a reservation. Most nights of the week can be busy as Mandalay Bay and Luxor are generally busy but when a convention is on it can be packed. 

My recommendation is the Spicy Lamb Burger. As lamb can be little hard to find in town, Burger Bar seems to get it right. Most the burgers will come with fries, but are able to changed out for salad if need be.

One also great aspect of Burger Bar that isn't really talked about is the Beer Menu. They carry a fair amount of local and nationally crafted beers that is rotated out month.

My husband and a friend had the Naturesource burger meat and it was very, very juicy. Even though my friend's burger was very overcooked, it was still juicy. They gave their burgers a 4 star.

Me and my other friend had the black angus burgers. I asked for medium rare and it was technically cooked alright (slightly overcooked but acceptable), however, the meat had zero juice and no flavor. I had smoked gouda (one small slice) and caramelized onions on mine and the onions were the overwhelming flavor. I felt like I was eating cardboard with onions--my burger would rate a zero star. 

Before ordering I asked the waitress what was the difference between the two burger meats and which one had the most flavorful. She said the angus had more flavor--WRONG. It was tasteless.

The garlic fries were excellent.

I've been here twice, and the first time I rated this as the 4th or 5th best burger in town. But the issue was that I got one of their pre-made selections on the left side of the menu. I think I got a Peppercorn burger or something, but it was a ""good"" not ""great"" experience. 

The next time I got adventurous and made my own burger. When you mix a high quality meat with the bun\/cheese\/toppings that you like, this burger will blow your minds. It was a little more expensive with the high-quality beef, but worth every penny.

The ""Hubert Keller"" buffalo burger came with a tasty red wine reduction sauce, but the burger already soaked through the rustic ciabatta bun and made it impossible to add without completely disintegrating the bun. The burger also came with grilled onions and cooked spinach which were flavorful, but there were too much of them. Because of the toppings, the Keller burger had nice flavors that are atypical of a burger. It reminded me of a French dip sandwich more than a burger which isn't necessarily bad.

The Keller burger was better than the ""Blackjack"" burger. The Blackjack burger was too small to fit the ciabatta bun. The key flavor of the burger was the olive tapenade and also had jack cheese. Lettuce, red onion, and sliced tomato are on the side which I added to the burger, but should I really need to assemble my own meal? A pickle is also on the side, but it's a spear, not sliced. Good luck putting that on your burger. It's questionable if the pickle was house made or bought from a purveyor.

The kitchen had trouble with their cooking temps. The medium-ordered buffalo burger was medium-rare. The rare angus burger was unevenly cooked with one-half medium-rare and some parts medium. Whatever beef blend they are using, it didn't bring out the flavor of the meat.

Although called ""skinny"" fries on the menu, they are classic-cut bistro fries, not shoestring skinny. The fries had a thick crust which reduced the inner potato fluffiness, but they were less greasy than most.

I was a bit shocked that a Hubert Keller restaurant would staff and dress their waitresses like a Hooters. The waitresses clearly don't eat the burgers here.

During a slow time of year in Vegas, the restaurant was busy and required a 10 minute wait to get a table. Even though this is a burger bar, many customers had salads for lunch. The online sample menu is woefully small compared to the real menu with an endless number of choices including the ability to add truffles to any burger.

The skinny fries, on the other hand, were salted nicely and cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.

At BB You can choose to eat your burgers from booths, tables, or at the sit down bar. Despite all the seats, BB does get crowded, especially during lunch, dinner, or the weekends. This place has TV screens everywhere, in every booth, along the wall at the sit down bar, and a few others placed throughout the place. It's more like a sports burger bar...I like seeing ESPN on the screens, I'm a guy, it's in my DNA! The crappy thing I don't like is that they pump music through their speakers and since music is loud, people also speak louder. Don't expect to have a nice quiet conversation with your date or friends...this ain't the place for that.

The menu is simple. You can pick one of  their set menu items or create your own burger. Reasonable priced menu especially for the LV Strip. You can choose from different meats...Black Angus, Country Natural, American Kobe, & Buffalo. For you other people not looking for meats...they have a veggie burger, chicken, salmon, or turkey. Then you can dress it up with whatever veg, cheese, or sauces, on their lists. And you can get your burgers with fries (fat, skinny, or sweet potato), buttermilk Zucchini fries or onion rings, & beer battered jalapeno pickles (never tried these). I usually keep it simple: Kobe beef on a sesame seed bun with grilled onions & spinach, with sweet potato fries or onion rings, & a $7 chocolate shake (yes I did just order a $7 shake!). The wife likes the Surf & Turf- black angus burger, grilled half lobster, & asparagus. They also have a $60 Rossini Burger-kobe, foie gras, black Perigord truffles, on an onion bun...pretty steep for a burger but if it floats your boat-eat it.

They also have a pretty good selection of beers, wines, and cocktails. Beer is beer everywhere except when it comes to the prices and BB alcohol prices are higher than other similar food joints. We always pass on the drinks. 

For the most part we've had decent service. But we do avoid the lunch and dinner crowds because those are the times we've had hit or miss service. It's mayhem trying to wave down a server during a weekend dinner rush. And it seems like they play extra loud music to help to drown out the customers that need assistance LOL! Seriously, you can hear ESPN, loud music, people talking loud just to hear themselves...and that's going on all at once. BB has the unmistakable ambiance of a high school cafeteria.

Overall, BB is fun burger joint where you can create your ""OWN"" masterpiece of a burger. We like that they offer you many different selections of toppings, but beware on your add on's, they can definitely add up. You could easily be eating a $20+ burger. So bring your earplugs and just text away with your friends...and enjoy your burger.",5,0,0

Having made my decision to go with something quick and comfortable, I decided the Burger Bar was my pick of the night.

Place itself was uber busy on a weekday.  Multiple TV screens at the bar provide enough entertainment, although the booths and tables are squeezed in a bit too tight for comfortable conversation.  

Went with the American Classic thinking this should be easy.  I mean, how can you mess up a burger, fries and a beer?

Ok, the Double Chocolate Stout, while not amazing, was a great way to start the meal.

The wait was quick enough.  Got my burger in about 10 minutes and was truly excited to take my first bite.  Tried another one, and another, all the while thinking .... this is it?  THIS is what the fuss is all about?

I typically get my burgers medium-rare, but after the KGB fiasco (see previous review), I decided to play it safe and go for medium.  Meat was still a bit too pink for me.  The burger itself tasted bland, as with the fries, and I am not a salt-aholic at all.   Could it have been a off night?  Hmmm ...",0,0,0

I've become a bit of a craft beer enthusiast recently. I still don't know what I'm talking about, but I do enjoy a good brew. I noticed Ken M included Burger Bar on his ""Craft Beer Revolution"" list. I never would have thought of Burger Bar for that. I just pictured it as a place for expensive burgers. That's changed of course.

On my two recent visits, I ordered a Salmon Steak sandwich with some sprouts. At $8.50 (plus I think 55c for the sprouts), it's one of the cheapest things on the menu but I find it absolutely delicious. I get the salmon cooked medium and it comes out perfectly.

On the beer front, I went with the Deschutes Inversion IPA on my first visit and the Burger Bar Seasonal on my second. I'm a big fan of Deschutes anything. The Burger Bar Seasonal is currently a Hefeweizen by Tenaya Creek Brewery. Being a local brewery, I had to give it a try. I really need to make my way up to Tenaya Creek one of these days.

Burger Bar has kind of fallen off my scope in recent years. Now that I know I can get a good salmon sandwich with a great beer to go with it, it's back on my radar.",4,0,2

I so love Hubert Keller from all the cooking shows (and actually, I rode in an elevator at Mandalay with him- but couldn't get the nerve up to say anything! DOH!). I had high expectations, and felt so let down.

We sat at the bar, as the booths and tables were all full. The service was friendly. We ordered the strawberry mojitos to start. They were not good. They tasted like cherry 7-UP and the strawberries were so big they clogged the straw- so you couldn't get a sip without scooting your straw around and trying to dislodge the strawberry. 

We ordered the mix of 3 fried things and 5 sauces to share, and I ordered the veggie burger. I found it a bit daunting to choose from all the little extras for the burger. I did try a couple, and, in the end, my veggie burger ended up costing around 15 bucks (with no fries...those we had to pay extra for).

We chose the mozz sticks, sweet potato fries, and regular french fries for our combo. For sauces, we chose the spicy ketchup, the tartar sauce, the cinnamon sauce, the chipotle aioli....and I can't remember the other one. They weren't horrible, but none of them were special. Again, it's Hubert Keller's restaurant, so I figured the sauces would be sublime. The fries were also so disappointing! Just basic, frozen fries. The sweet potato fries were great with the cinnamon sauce, and I usually don't care for sweet anything. They were the highlight.

My veggie burger sucked. For one, it was huge. Hotel rooms in Vegas typically don't have microwaves, so there is no way to reheat left-overs. I don't understand why Vegas restaurants serve such ridiculous portions when you cannot enjoy left-overs! More than half of my veggie burger was thrown away.

The burger was also mushy and tasteless. I ordered some of the cool sounding add-ons, but couldn't taste them at all. The beet relish came in a little ramekin and had no flavor whatsoever. 

My sister and her friend liked their meat burgers, so maybe it's just the veggie burger. If I ever try the place again, I'll try the vegan sandwich (with the roasted veggies) on ciabatta.",1,1,0

The spicy lamb burger that I ordered was very dry and bland. The lamb tasted funny and it wasn't spicy at all. The sweet potatoes fries were mediocre, however, the pepper jack cheese shots were decent.

I had higher expectations for this restaurant. This place is more about quantity than quality, so the food is below par in my opinion. Our service kept refilling our drinks and asked if we needed anything, so service was good but not impeccable. For $20, I'd rather go BurGR or Bachi Burger.",2,0,1

I like the burgers... I like that they accomodate group parties with pre-determined menus ... and I like that they assign big groups 2 servers and multiple bussers. 

However... I don't like that it's so freakin' loud in there and that the set up (flow of tables and traffic pattern) is NOT efficient or easy to maneuver. You have to squeeze around tables, chairs and people to get through the place and then dodge the servers and the bussers who have trays of food\/plates.

I enjoyed the Buffalo Burger with Zucchini fries. Buffalo Burger was juicy and meaty and lean.  So good!  The bun was a bit too thick for me so I only ate one side.... the zucchini fries had too much batter for me. I would prefer a lighter batter... and more zucchini... rather than the other way around.

I ordered a burger with spinach, Brie, onion and aioli on a pretzel bun. The burger itself  was good (nothing spectacular) . The bun was yummy and fresh, but there were some flaws with the toppings. The Brie was mostly rind, very little creamy Brie goodness. The spinach was steamed, which I thought was super odd since it was listed in the same group as lettuce. I asked for fresh spinach and the waitress said she didn't know if they had any because they usually cook it all in the morning. Wait, so the spinach on my burger that I ordered at 3:30 was cooked early this morning? The waitress ended up bringing out fresh spinach so that was good. 

We also had a wedge salad. Nothing special and actually mediocre at best. One little piece of bacon, minimal blue cheese and the dressing was runny.

Sat at the bar: (for like 2 hours)

Round 1: (Under Chef's Burgers with skinny fries) American Classic: ""Black Angus beef, American cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion on sesame bun."" Absolutely Delicious Angus, cooked right on my prefered medium well, bacon thin but not much fat and toppings fresh. Only thing that could use a slight improvement would be adding a slightly larger\/taller Sesame Bun (because the patty isn't small, a little more bread would be a plus).. With that said, Its still was an Excellent Burger!! The fries were like McDonald's skinny but weren't as salty and had a plain potato fry flavor.. No complaints.  

Round 2: American Kobe Beef Burger and fat fries: ""This american kobe beef from Snake River melts in your mouth, tender with an unmatched flavor, the most expensive beef in the world for the most discriminating palate."" Who in the right state of mind would read this on a menu and not want to order At Least One ??!!.. As much as I wanted to try the ""Hubert Keller Burger"" or add some truffle or foie gras toppings to this burger as I planned before I made this trip, I got sucked in their brilliant description of marketing genius of having this burger Alone! I ordered it plain (coooked medium plus) to indulge its full flavor without being bloody or burnt and without any support of sauces, toppings and even cheese. I've had kobe in the past but this particular kobe patty was AMAZING! It wasn't too rich or velvety but just had and an INCREDIBLY saturated Fatty & Buttery Flavor that was Beyond Comparison of any Angus Beef Burger I've ever had. Now, this isn't the type of burger I would eat on a regular basis like I would an Angus. Because I feel this is more of a Real Treat like Gourmet or having truffle, foie gras, uni, eggs nest.. Just my opinion. Nonetheless, Definitely one of the Best Burgers I've had in my life, Bar None! The fat fries had the same flavor as the skinny but I liked these better, I personally prefer fatter sliced fries and more undercooked than crispy.

We had a party of 6 for a team dinner at a convention. They don't take reservations for parties less than 20, but fortunately they were able to seat us after only a 10 minute wait.  Decor is nothing special, but certainly comfortable.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  

Orders in our group of 6 included 3 of the Kobe burgers, 1 angus burger, 1 natural beef burger, and one salmon burger.  We shared an order of skinny fries (good, but nothing special), sweet potato fries (good), and onion rings (very good).  Everybody enjoyed their food immensely.  I had the natural beef burger, cooked a really nice medium, with jack cheese, guac, and caramelized onions (which the waitress suggested when I said that I needed something else on my burger).  Mmmm.

Very good beer selection--both on tap and in bottles.  Two people got milkshakes (non-alcoholic ones).  I got a taste of the nutella shake and it was terrific; really, really thick and chocolaty.

Somehow the over-the-top fine dining joints in Vegas always seem as faux as the facades of the grand, theme hotels. But the Burger Bar somehow manages to fold the essence of excess into a place that is casual and cool, comfortable with what it is without the need for dancing waters or gold leaf bathroom fixtures. 

The concept of the burgers are somewhat build your own, so you can get virtuous with your order if you want. Or you can go all-in with the Kobe, double orders of shoestrings and hell, they'll probably top the whole thing with gold leaf if you ask nicely. It is Vegas, after all. 

What I like most about the Burger Bar is that, although it is a casual, relatively quick eatery, it is owned by one of America's best chefs and one who cares about ingredients. The same attention goes into food quality here as it does in a Michelin starred place. So, if you want to eat the same quality of food as the upper crust, just get it served on a bun, I think you'll enjoy this place.",0,0,0

We loved Hubert Keller's more formal restaurant in Mandalay and thought we had to try this place. We walked in and and sat at the bar. The ambience here seemed trendy and cool it was a dimly lit and all the booths had TVs which was a nice added touch. Upon sitting at the bar we noticed the beer selection is huge with many options both on tap and in bottles. We decided to split a burger for lunch and decided on getting the Wagyu beef build you own burger. The build your own burger had so many options to choose anything from different sauces to different buns to cheeses, veggies, and meats you name it, it's likely an option. We finally settled on getting a Wagyu burger cooked rare with cheddar cheese caramelized onions on a pretzel bun with a red wine and shallot reduction. We also decided to get the garlic fries which were served with a garlic aioli. Our burger came out quick and they even split it in half and separated it for us which was awesome. The burger was cooked to perfection nice and juicy, and the fries were an amazing compliment for the burger. Needless to say that was hands down the best burger I have ever had.

They have the usual ""build your own"" burger option (meat, cheese, bun, toppings, sides) or their own specials. This time around I chose the American Classic for $12.75: Ridge field beef, American cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion, on sesame bun and I added mushrooms. I chose the regular fries. 

The burger itself wasn't too bad, a bit dry, but good quality moo. The fries were nicely crisp and soft at the same time. Mmmm, good food. It also looks like they make milkshakes like how they did back in the day. Metal cup\/whole milk\/Hershey's chocolate syrup....oh yeah. I need a cigarette. Oh, this part of the casino\/resort, you're not allowed to light up.

Considering the X games were happening, my dinner companions and I were talking about Pierre (forgot his last name) about doing Moto-Cross and Skateboarding. One of the really pretty waitress' (that one of my dinner companions were looking at since we sat at the bar), said, ""Oh yeah, he does both."" To which I was waiting for my friend to say something. I guess he didn't hear her. So, when she came back, I asked her how she knew. She responded with. ""I'm a big extreme sports fan."" This time, both my dinner companions looked (both confused and WTF, why is she talking to us? faces)...to which she quickly turns around and goes off to do other things. D'oh! 

Maybe next time I'll try a more expensive burger and my friend who's interested, will actually SAY SOMETHING to her instead of making her feel dumb. :) Hee.",6,7,5

Their sweet potato fries & fat fries were pretty good, but he winner of the night was the mound of ZUCCHINI FRIES ! I was setting myself up for a heart attack but it's Vegas, baby and I didn't care !

They also have a GREAT beer & wine selection, our table got the chimay & fruli  & they were both delicious ! I prefer the chimay though.

Well in actuality I am glad cus I would be 400lbs if there was a burger bar in the Bay Area.  I have been coming here for years and am a loyal customer.  Mandalay Bay is not a centralized location for where I like to stay on the strip but I make a point to come here every trip.  I like it that much.

There are a few tricks to this place though.  You get to pick your burger meat and I honestly think when a reviewer chooses the wrong meat, they feel like this place isn't good.  The trick is that you only need to order the Angus beef burger.  If you get the vegetarian fed beef selection you are simply not going to get that fatty, juicy flavor a burger needs!  Come on people, if you were in the Donner party, would you have selected the skinny person or the fat guy to eat?....lol  The fat is what makes a burger juicy and delicious.  Also, a burger is really only supposed to be cooked medium at the most.  If you really want a juicy burger, anything else will dry it out.

I love the fat fries but my friend swears by the skinny ones.  Maybe I am just prejudice against anything skinny, i dunno :)

I read a review on here about the Nutella milkshake.....OMG!  That was a freaking awesome choice.  I almost couldn't finish that and the meal.  It is almost too much....Notice I said ALMOST?  That's right, I kicked it into FAT GUY gear and took it all down baby!",0,2,0

You can get to pick 3 different types of fries (or rings). I really like the fat fries and sweet potato fries. And then you can pair that trio fries with a sampler of dipping sauces. Oh my! I do love me some dipping sauces, so I'm a total fan of this sampler. Every single sauce I've tried so far has been great.

Decent rings, about 10 per order. Large and heavily battered.

So, this was my third time here, me and my best friend go every other year to Vegas, and we always make sure to stop here no matter how far away it is from where we are staying.

First trip, I ordered the Hubert Keller Burger, which is buffalo, caramelized onions, baby spinach, and bleu cheese on a ciabatta bun, and my friend ordered the same.  Let me tell you, this was absolutely amazing, and i'm not that big of a bleu cheese fan unless its on wings.  This burger was delectable.  Cooked perfectly, and the addition of the baby spinach was nice along with the onions, and on the ciabatta bun, which feel apart 3\/4 of the way because it was so juicy.  The burger is easily a 5.  The reason I cant give this place a full 5, is unfortunately because of the fries, which were skinny fries.  Now yes they offer different fries, but ours came with the skinny fries.  These were just a 3, needed a bit more salt and 15 seconds more in the fryer.  

Drinks, this was the interesting part.  Last time, I ordered multiple beers, they have, in my opinion, a fantastic beer menu.  BUT, I ordered the Mint Choc. Chip Alcoholic Milkshake, which was absolutely amazing.  We also ordered the ice cream beer flight.  Put it this way, every single person in the place looked at us regretting not ordering this for themselves.  I highly recommend.  

Second trip here.  My friend ordered the Hubert Keller burger again, and I ordered the American Classic.  Again, both cooked perfectly, and consistant, same issue with the fries though.  And again we ordered the alcoholic drinks.  

Overall.  Easily worth going to over any burger joint on the strip.

Anyone who knows anything about meat can't help but love this place -- I see so many people talking about the topping you can put on the burgers.  Forget all that...

If you want to spend a bit less than Order the American Kobe burger and put some normal old toppings on it and enjoy the delicious BEEF.

If you want to spend $70 than order the Japanese Kobe the way its meant to be eaten RARE and learn what means to truly enjoy life...

Once you are done order a peanut butter and jelly hamburger and a glass of milk!

We started the meal off with a nutella chocolate milkshake. I'm not a big fan of shakes, but the nutella whipped cream was delicious. 

They give you the option of selecting your patty (ground chuck, angus, kobe, turkey or veggie) and then a huge array of toppings to select from.  Each topping comes with a price tag, so the crazier you get the more your burger will cost you.  They had a $60 burger on the menu that was a kobe beef burger with black truffles and truffle oil and 4 or 5 cheeses...insane!

Jeff and I both went with the Angus beef burger. I kept my burger simple with pepper jack cheese, guacomole, and jalapeno bacon. yes, jalepeno bacon. It was so spicey and so good! Definitely a great concept. Jeff got Monterey Jack cheese, peppered bacon and Avacado that was simple but delicious.

They had a ton of fry options but we decided on ""fat fries"" which were a thicker cut. fry

Was it as good as the reviews and press made it out to be? Nah. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a good burger. 

First off. They don't take reservations. This place is PACKED, so call ahead and get on the waiting list, or be prepared to wait 30-60 minutes for dinner. For a Vegas restaurant, I was a bit surprised at how small it is. We called when we were heading over there though, and ended up only having to wait less than 10 minutes.

I do love the fact that you can build your own burger and they have a lot of options. They have a few burger options on the menu too. I built my own burger with Black Angus beef, bleu cheese, caramelized onions, peppered bacon and chipotle aioli on a cibatta bun. It was a tasty burger. But it wasn't out of this world amazing. The prices are a bit high, but you do get a gigantic 1\/2 pound burger. I couldn't even finish it. Fries are extra though, and were really not that impressive.

Instead this place is everything you would expect from a stuck up gourmet who wouldn't know a great burger if it hit him in the face.  Don't get me wrong, you won't get food poisening here and you won't come away saying that the burgers were inedible, in fact for the most part the end result is a good burger.  I am certain however, Mr. Keller and his chefs have never seen the parking lot of a sporting event with a charcol grille and a spatula. 

First, what I don't like about this place.  The burgers were cooked like a gourmet would, meaning good for a steak, bad for a burger.  All the burgers we tried were underdone and we asked for them medium.  Second, the prices are outrageous.  You will not get out of here below $20.00 per person and for a burger, that is just wrong.  Third, the service is absolutely attrocious for the price.  This is supposed to be a burger place but they treat you like the fine dining establishments, meaning rude service and slow service.  Fourth, the Kobe burger is a waste of time.  The flavor is lacking and quite honestly, you don't need the best meat to make a good burger. Fifth, the bun is boring. I expect better from a 20 dollar burger joint.  The buns we had were dry inside and soggy outside.

Now, for the good about this place. 1) you can get just about anything on your burger and you pick and choose what is on it. 2) you can get just about any type of meat on your burger from kobe to buffalo to ostrich. 3) the burger is tasty if you get them to cook it right.

Ambiance - Well, when you put out a club type front person to take your reservation and then have everyone wait for a table, you kinda create your own ""must go"" type of atmosphere. Tables, booths and music, this is a long and narrow restaurant, but plenty of room.

Service - Not bad, not great. Made a few mistakes on the orders, but overall, decent.

Presentation - Food is kinda slopped onto a large plate, and if you order without fries on each plate , and choose to say, share fries with everyone, then the kitchen hasn't a clue how to make the plates look half empty with only the burger on it. I find that to be odd for a 20.00 burger. Yeah, put it on a huge plate and make it look like you paid a lot for a little.

Food - Good taste overall for sure.  Definitely interesting to either order pre-made combinations or order everything on your own.  However, the taste is okay, not mind blowing.

Price - Very expensive for the quality.  I would have to be careful when I come back, because I will not frequent this place. Getting to it is a challenge since you are going to go to a casino, park, walk and walk and walk...... For the money, without the club type atmosphere you can go to Grind Burger on Trop and it is as good or slightly better.

Overall - Good experience, glad I tried it. Would bring clients, but not sure if I would come back with the family.

Family note - Don't let your kids go to the bathroom alone. Seems that the toilets are in the restaurant, which make it safe, but the fact is the signs bring you to an exit door and you exit the rear of the restaurant and you are in the back of the public mall where anyone and everyone has access.  The door from this public area to the restaurant is open and so, BE CAREFUL.  This is a disaster waiting to happen!  Very poor security.",0,0,0

1) The mini black Angus burger was good and fairly moist still for such a tiny burger. Sometimes something that simple is so good.

2) The classic beef burger with bacon was my least favorite as it was the driest out of all the mini burgers.

3) Top sirloin burger with carmelized onions: YUM. The best one.

All the ingredients were fresh and the burgers all came on mini ciabatta bread, which was surprisingly easy to bite into. The sweet potato fries were good, but not the best I've ever had. A good handful of the fries were overdone. Next time I will be sure to make a reservation to really experience Hubert Keller's vision on gourmet burgers.

The best way I can describe the delectable burger and smooth velvety milkshake I had here at the infamous Burger Bar! Mom and I had a date to visit Lush and we decided we were hungry. I read about BB on here(yelp) and remembered it was in Mandalay Place and thought it sound like a plan! 

First off follow the sign to valet in the Mandalay Place. Go up the escalators make a u-turn and voila BURGER BAR! It's on your left hand side! We got to the hostess stand and put our name down and then had the bejeezus scared out if us! The hostess was literally SCREAMING parties names....this was beyond annoying!! We had a 15 minute wait time so we pre-shopped lush a little then went back to BB just in time for the hostess to scream my name right at my face :\/ 

We were sat near the back and upon sitting and ordering drinks I absolutely regret not just sitting at the counter! Ill explain later about our not so awesome server....Mom ordered a strawberry mojito, eh I can make better. I had the best milkshake I've ever tasted....EVER! Salted caramel o M g this thing was the best texture and flavor and creamy and sexy and amazing and every positive word in the dictionary all at once. It took every fiber of my being not to chug it in one drink! 

Now onto my burger I had a naturesource burger on an onion bun with jalapeño bacon, mushrooms, caramelized onions, and truffle mayo.the combination was perfect and the burger was juicy and messy and I couldn't stop eating it! It was cooked to a perfect medium and I've never tasted anything like it! The truffle mayo was a perfect compliment and made the burger. I ordered the fat fries which were awesome. Mom ordered the onion rings which I didn't care for...

Now onto the service. We were sitting between two side stations, both of which we got to see our very social server be extra social when we needed things. She would say I'm going to drop this drink off and come right back....after telling the other server how last night was right? The food deserves 5 stars, easily. The screaming hostess' and gossipy server take that very well deserved star away. Will I be back? ABSO FREAKING LUTELY!",3,1,3

I forgot what burger I ordered, but I think I would only come back for the Hubert Keller burger for $60.  I ordered random toppings, and it was... ok.  For $20, ""ok"" is ""NOT ok.""  Sure, the meat was tender, the fixings were fresh, but... I could also get that for $4 at In N Out.

The $7 vanilla milkshake was... also ""ok.""  Alright, I'll acquiesce that it was good.  But Johnny Rockets' milkshake still reigns supreme in my book, and a little over half the cost.  (Mind you, I'd be willing to pay... $10 for an amazing milkshake, and cost has no factor in my decision that Johnny Rockets has the best I've tasted).

Burger Bar!  This place is for the guy's guy.  Cute female wait staff and hostesses wearing as little as possible, little TVs at every booth with big ones along the wall showing manly shows like ESPN and Poker tournaments, two full pages of exotic beers and other booze, huge burgers with any kind of topping you could dream of, and five kinds of fries.  I simply sat in and soaked up the testosterone, and all those girly exfoliant soaps were washed right out of my mind.

The main focus of Burger Bar is the burgers.  This place has burgers with many options for a total customizable meal.  First, you choose your burger meat, with the basic being their Ridgefield beef for around $8.95, Angus beef for $10, Kobe Beef for $13+, and even a veggie burger for the Vegs out there.  You can choose from among 5 different buns, and the whole thing comes with lettuce, tomato, and onions on the side, for you to put on at your leisure.  On the right side is a long list of toppings for your burger, ranging from the mundane to the extravagant.  For example, you could have grilled onions on your burger, or cheese, or bacon; you could also have a half a lobster tail, shrimp, foie gras, or black truffles.  Each topping comes with its own price to add to the burger, which makes it easy to overspend.  With sauces as well, you could be paralyzed by the sheer number of choices.  

Not to worry!  Burger Bar has selected a few choice ""Chef Burgers"" for you, with toppings pre-chosen and an accompanying price.  One is a simple burger with just the meat, the bun, cheese, and some bacon on it, for about $12, I believe.  The top of the line is a monster called the ""Rossini"", which sounded like they just wanted to take the most expensive and rare items and put them all in one burger.  This burger contains the Kobe beef, along with grilled foie gras, the black truffles, and a few other delectables, for a whopping $60.  

Overall, I liked it.  The service was prompt, but tended to leave you alone most of the time, the food was really good and very filling (I made my own choices, it was good).  The coffee here sucks, though; don't even bother with it.  All-in-all, walked out paying $35 even with tax and tip for two people.  Not bad at all.

I ordered a Kobe Burger with spinach, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and peppered bacon, while opting for the Fat Fries. I went with a vanilla shake to wash the food down. 

First came the shake, which was possibly the best shake I have ever had in my life. This is probably an exaggeration, but it was very, very good. Next came my burger and fries. The fires were decent (hard to mess up fries), especially when dipped in the side sauces that I had added on. Unfortunately, the burger tasted how it looked; very average. I'm not sure what my expectations were, but a regular, messy, sad looking, lump of a burger, SMOTHERED in caramelized onions was not it (there were literally more onions than meat). Definitely a deal breaker for me.

You get to pick not only your preferred cheese of course but also the type of bread and there are MANY toppings to pick from.  Not too many places let you put avocado on top of a burger.

My boyfriend customized a Natural Burger(?) with Swiss cheese and portabella mushroom on a wheat bun with a side of onion rings, while I customized my Kobe Burger with mozzarella, caramelized onions, and garlic aioli on a sesame bun, and I got mine with a side of sweet potato fries.

Now, don't get me wrong. These were good burgers. But there was nothing more to it. They were good, but not exceptional. We were expecting in-your-face goodness but the burgers certainly failed to meet that expectation, considering the chef's reputation. Quite honestly, Umami in LA has better burgers; the patties are incredibly juicy at Umami. For what the Burger Bar is charging, i.e. anywhere from $10 ~ $16 for a burger that comes with fries, or $16~$21 customized burger and sides, they need to do better than what they are serving now.

 *Fries were great n crispy, nicely seasoned. 
 *Tons of beer selections-mostly by bottle-small boutique, hand crafted kinds. Stuck to my good 'ol Coors lite!

So, I was there with my gf and we decided to pick a couple burgers and share. That didn't work out very well for her I might add. Given it was my birthday week in Vegas I decided to splurge on the Surf & Turf burger. Yea I said it!

The perfect amount of lobster atop a prime black angus burger that rested on a healthy amount of asparagus, along with a side of mushroom sauce. Ya only live once right? This bad boy left me speechless. The fries were thin and crispy but this burger was an extreme delight. 

After biting into the S & T burger, I didn't think it could possible get much better. I should have known...the American Kobe Beef burger here is easily the BEST burger I have ever had in my existence. Period. Sorry Rocky, it's true.

You can get it however you want and add from 30 or 40 toppings. I felt like since I was a first-timer here that I wanted to make this burger work for me. I went easy on it and just added carmelized onions and some cheddah. Ya know how the middle of the burger is always the best, juiciest bite? This entire Kobe burger was the middle of the burger all the way around...in other words, orgazmic!

The service was excellent, very friendly and attentive. They seemed moderately busy but we were seated after maybe a 5 minute wait.

Since you can go anywhere for a burger, we ordered the Rossini.  The patty was cooked to order  and extremely tender.  However, the foie gras was overcooked and not all that good.

It also took a little while to get seated (though not the 45 mins they quoted us, luckily!) For the cost, the chicken sandwich was just OK. WAY too big (but really most things in Vegas are out-of-control huge anyway). The zucchini fries that were recommended to me weren't as good as I'd hoped. A bit too greasy and not zucchini-y enough, if that makes sense. I think they had too much breading. The sweet potato fries I tried off someone else's plate were great, though. I love sweet potato fries! Those at my table who got burgers seemed a lot more happy with what they got than I did... So definitely go for a burger if you go there.

Especially because on the fourth visit one of the kitchen staff waved at me.  Apparently I became a ""regular"" real quick.

1) my first stop after being picked up at the airport by Vegas yelper Myke, five of us decide to have lunch at the burger bar.  I ordered a MR burger with pineapple, grilled onions, Swiss and prosciutto.  Ill tell you what though...that decision took almost an hour.  SO MANY OPTIONS.  I was disappointed none of us opted for the $60 burger which consisted of half a lobster, shrimp, and some other expensive goodies.  You can add truffles to your burger as well and up the price, but I guess we figured since this was our first stop of a long weekend, we should be somewhat frugal.  Kobe beef was not an option for me...but it was definitely an option on the menu.  Also I had a delicious mimosa which was my first drink in 2 weeks, so it went down into my belly which was ready to welcome it with open arms.

2) Same day....other people show up to Vegas and THEY get hungry.  Now, I wasn't in the mood for another burger one hour later, but i did order my favorite beer Blue Moon.  That selection was a lot quicker than the burger, but their beer list is super extensive.  It was the best selection I found all weekend, and had i not been craving a Blue Moon, I could have stared at that list for an hour too.  

3) Still the same day...That night, I am in need of some serious food, seeing as though all i had eaten all day was the burger in the AM.  So three of us, before heading out to the club, went and ordered the fries, sweet potato fries and the zucchini sticks.  A perfect little inexpensive snack to coat my tummy with the grease it needed.

4) Saturday night, my roommates were looking for the perfect IPA.  With the extensive beer collection, they found it.  I had a corona.

Thanks again for lunch Myke.",7,3,7

my wife had a lean buffalo burger which was also out of this world.

we each had a different fries with our meals - both were great!

the toppings you chose to put on the burgers were disappointing and expensive. disappointing cause we felt they take a way from the pure burger taste and some that were over 4$ just is too much for a little bit of this or that......
my wife also took a ""salad"" side which was just a 7$ very very small ball of very few leafs(less then a hand full) of this and that.....really a joke under any salad standard and a total waist of time

I'll list my most recent experience.

I had a $50 resort credit to use.  So Brian being Brian, I order the Surf & Turf Burger.  The Surf & Turf Burger is Black Angus beef burger wit half a grilled lobster, grilled asparagus and a plain bun.  I eliminated the asparagus and kept the lovely lobster.  This was like $24.25.  Would I buy this with my own cash?  No way.  However, how often do you have lobster on a burger...........most likely never.

I always order the fat fries with my burgers here because they are so utterly delicious.

Now here are some bad things people will say.
-It's a little expensive.  Yes, there is no disputing that.  The burgers are a little pricey, as are the beers.  Guess what, who cares?  If you want to save money go to the buffet.  You could get a cheaper burger at In-Out Burger if you're so inclined.  
-It's a simple burger place, why are the people so loud?  The staff here likes to have fun.  They may be a little loud, as would the customers.  This is not L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon.  This is a simple, yet good restaurant that should be affordable for most people.
-This isn't in Mandalay Bay!  Well, technically it's not.  It's in Mandalay Place which attaches the Luxor to Mandalay Bay.  I will for strategical purposes, state that it is in Mandalay Bay.

Despite the complaints, I know though, when I come to Las Vegas...........I stop here.  The serving sizes are huge, the food is delicious and the staff is friendly.  5 stars.  *Note: I should have given this 5 stars over a year ago*",0,0,0

I had read the reviews and thought it would be a great choice for a casual dinner. My friends all agreed. The wait was about 40 minutes at 9pm on a Friday. (We used the time to grab a martini and buy bath bombs at Lush across the way. OMG heavenly, both of them.)

Anyhow. Our waitress was super sweet and very helpful. I ordered the Angus burger on an onion bun, with caramelized onions and blue cheese. She told me that was the best combo EVER and not to add anything, it was perfect. I like positive reinforcement, awesome. My friends all ordered and we spent a few minutes watching the Laker game on the TV in our booth. 

The good: My food was delicious! The blue cheese was a nice kick complimented by the perfect onions. I had also ordered sweet potato fries, and they were great. Our server had brought out ranch and mayo for dipping without us asking, which we loved.

The bad: I ordered my burger medium and it was RARE. Bloody all the way through. Normally I would have sent it back....but I was starving and it tasted good. So maybe that's not so bad then.

The ugly: As I was 3\/4 done with my burger, my friend who had gotten the sliders noticed a hair wrapped around the toothpick and bun on one of her sliders. This hair was so wrapped around and clearly not hers. Yuck. She pointed it out to the server and in seconds, a manager was at our table, offering to make a new plate or take it off the bill. She opted to just take it off the bill.

So theres my dilemma. I loved my food, I wish I could go back today, BUT I won't because hair is not delicious. Bummer! I'm still giving 4 stars though, it could have been a fluke!",0,0,0

There were a number of burgers to choose from, but most of our party chose the Kobe beef burger, where else can you get a Kobe beef burger for $16.00?! They also had a bunch of toppings to choose from including lobster tail and some high end truffles. I chose portabella mushrooms, which was stacked, and caramelized onions. DELICIOUS!! I also chose a side of sweet potato fries, which was also great. 

What was also impressive was their beer menu. I could have sworn they had every beer\/lager in the world. If you're looking for something a bit stronger than a beer, I suggest the Chimay, white ribbon.

If you still have room after your burger, try the dessert burger!! It's a warm doughnut sandwich with ice cream and some fruit I think, but it was YUM!! I thought that it was going to be too sweet, but it was just right.

The only downside is that adding on all the toppings can get a bit pricey, but it's worth it!",0,0,0

As expected, our wait took about 60 mins since my group size was 19 to begin with. They don't take RSVP's, you have to throw your name down on the wait list for first come, first serve.

I've been a fan of Hubert Keller's Fleur de Lys in San Franciso, but I was surprised to hear he also owned a burger joint in Vegas. I love the idea that you can build your own burger however way you like it.

There's 3 different types of beef you can choose to start with, $8-$16. Want cheese? Add $0.65. If you're a foie gras lover like I am, add $12. Black truffle sauce, add $5. I also ordered their sweet potato fries, they were pretty good - but I've had better at The Counter in San Jose's Santana Row. ;-)

Overall, this place is definitely worth a return visit for lunch and\/or dinner. Grilled foie gras patty for $12? Hell Yeah!!",1,1,1

The birthday girl wanted to eat here and we happily obliged. The place is located a little ways inside the Mandalay Place, which is their shopping\/mall area. Seriously, I didn't know MB had a mall area. Good to know. I arrive fashionably late and our party of six are already seated at a booth. Inside the booth is a TV turned on to the Lakers game.

We started out with some cocktails while we continue to look over the menu. The drinks were typical... Nothing too spectacular. The burgers on the other hand had an extensive menu with almost everything and anything you could possibly want to add on.

I ended up choosing the Kobe Beef Burger, medium rare, on ciabatta bread with bacon, grilled onions, cheddar cheese, and sliced avocados. Unfortunately, fries do not come with your burger so I ordered some to try out. Overall, the burger was pretty big and tasty. I'm not sure if the $16 price tag on the Kobe Beef burger was better than the regular $8 beef. 
Next time I'd definitely try the regular Ridgefield Farm\/Black Angus beef. But then again, I probably wouldn't come eat here unless someone else wanted to go. It was good, but not 'OMG THIS IS THE BEST BURGER EVER' kind of place.

I included a pic of my burger. Enjoy!

I had the pleasure of dining in upscale restaurants the entire week, and was looking for something more relaxed. Since, my ingredient standards are high, it couldn't be just any old burger place... When I saw they had a Waygu beef burger on the menu, I knew that was exactly what I wanted for dinner! I ordered it ""build your own burger"" style and added smoked Gouda and truffle mayo. I'm not usually one to go for mayonnaise, but the server highly recommend it as it is one of their house made specialties. Soooo, when in Vegas... I also added a small organic greens salad, which was lightly and perfectly dressed with a tasty, subtle vinaigrette. The burger was cooked to perfection, and practically melted in my mouth. The Truffle Mayo was an excellent complement! Rounding out the meal was a small side of skinny fries. Just like the Mayo, fries are not something I usually eat, so if I order them they have to be darn good for me to bother with the calories! They did not disappoint. I had the fries with their spicy ketchup which was a great choice! It tasted like it had a jalapeño infusion. I decided to go for one of their signature milkshakes for dessert, since I was on a serious splurge. This is where my review went from 5 stars to 4. I ordered the Nutella milkshake, which is chocolate ice cream blended with Nutella, topped with homemade chocolate whipped cream and crushed hazelnuts. The flavor of the shake itself was good. Where it fell short was: it was missing the hazelnuts (no one stopped back to check on me & fix it), and nearly half of what was in the glass was whipped cream topping, as opposed to actual milkshake. If I'm going to spend $10 on a milkshake, it better be a milkshake not whipped cream. The service was good; the server did a great job helping me pair toppings to complement my burger selection. I will definitely go back again, I will just look for dessert elsewhere.",0,0,0

I'm not much for fancy burgers but I made an exception for this place. I was in Vegas for a week (!) for work and stuck in Mandalay Bay. Now, I'm not saying Mandalay is bad place but a week indoors anywhere is rough. My birthday happened to fall that week so a group of about 35 of us ditched the company-sponsored festivities one night and headed to the Burger Bar in Mandalay Place to celebrate my 34th year of existence.

First, I will give the staff kudos for arranging seating for us. When 35 people roll up with no reservation, I'm sure it's not easy but my guess is the check for 35 justifies the hassle. We had to wait for a while but only because some large group with little kids was already in the place. Sidebar: Vegas is no place for a family vacation. Take your fucking kids to Disneyland, not a place famous for gambling, sex and getting piss-drunk. I don't fuck up your Legoland vacation by getting hammered and then hitting on your wife after spending $500 in a strip club so don't fuck up my vacation by bringing your hyper kids to Vegas and letting them run around while screaming their heads off. Deal?

But I digress, on to the food. I ordered the ""Hubert Keller Burger."" I mean, it's named after the owner (and world-renowned chef) - it's gotta be the shit, right? It's actually a buffalo burger, not beef, with caramelized onions, blue cheese and baby spinach on a ciabatta bun. It was indeed the shit. One of the best burgers I have ever had, in fact. I also ate half of my boss' Kobe beef burger, also excellent. And they don't mess around when you order rare or medium-rare. You better like it bloody if you order it that way, not like those chain restaurants that are afraid to leave any pink in the meat. It makes me nervous to order food in those places. I mean, why are you afraid to serve your food a little underdone? What does that say about the quality of your ingredients?

The sides (sweet potato fries, regular fries) were good but nothing special. I wish I had ordered dessert. They had some good looking ""Sweet Burgers"" and milkshakes on the menu. Maybe next time. The beer menu is very impressive and they serve pitchers.

The service was very good. They were quick and came by often. With 35 people in the party, I was less concerned with their friendliness, I just wanted them to get the orders correct in a timely fashion, which they did. I willl definitely go back the next time I am at Mandalay.",0,3,0

Dude, the servers were dressed like Hooter's girls without the nylons! And weren't half as friendly! No! This is not what I expected! It really was like a bar, with uncomfortable seats, blaring music, and overpriced food. I was the only PBS geek who was going through a mental breakdown as the four of us got seated. 

Ok, I thought: maybe the food belies the atmosphere. Wonderfully extensive beer & wine list. Yes, there were the creative doughnut dessert burgers. Admirably diverse burgers overall - from the kobe beef to salmon to bison...

But when the food came, nobody was impressed. My sliders were dry and lacked adequate taste, the fries were fine, and everything else others had fell into that overall category: ""fine."" The prices would have indicated one could expect something of a higher caliber.

If you love burgers and fries, but have celiac, eat here!  

First off, I have two words for you: STEAK FRIES.  Ok, let's make it four words actually: Celiac-safe steak fries.  I gotta be honest with you, I didn't even order them because I had a feeling my giant burger would fill me up (I was right - good call, Teenie!) but the waiter did let me know that they are cooked in totally separate, safe fryers, not with anything breaded or anything like that.  So again- steak fries are safe for those with celiac!

Now the burger:  It was good.  It was damn good.  And I almost couldn't believe they gave me a gluten-free bun, but rest assured, they did:)  I ordered a build-your-own turkey burger with swiss cheese, avocado, and button mushrooms.  It was one of those burgers so big you almost can't even fit it in your mouth but then you're like, ""Oh it's goin down.""  GDFR. 

Bonus:  I also got a good whiskey mule there, served in the traditional copper mug  (why do mules always come in copper mugs anyway?)

A couple things to know about this establishment:  
#1)  It's not in Mandalay Bay itself, but in the shopping mall part of Mandalay Bay.  (That totally tripped us up while we were walking around the hotel and casino looking for it next to all of the other restaurants.  You will not find it there!  Go to the shopping mall part of the hotel)
#2)  It's kind of small and loud
#3)  Our booth did have a little TV tucked away in the wall (basically at eye level) which was cool for watching sports while eating

So there you have it - a burger joint safe for those of us with celiac.  Go ahead and get smashed in Vegas and enjoy a burger here.",2,0,0

We were seated right away and instantly had our waitress at the table a couple minutes later taking drink orders. She was very good about checking up on us for anything we needed and also had a good sense of humor

I ordered the wings and made an Angus burger for my meal and shared half and half with my friend who made a chicken sandwich.  Their menu is cool because it allows you to create your very own burgers and sandwiches by choosing your meat, bun, cheese and toppings. choices were pretty broad with meat having Angus beef, buffalo, chicken, and higher qualities of beef. Buns were ciabbata, onion, sesame, and then a large selection of cheeses and toppings. If you build a burger though it does not come with fries, so keep that in mind. The burger was good and the beef was very moist and flavorful.  The chicken sandwich was a little bland even after putting on the chipotle sauce that my friend asked for but it wasn't dry which was nice.   The wings were very good but not as spicy as I was hoping for, but my friend did feel that they were very spicy. The wings also came with fries which were seasoned well and cooked well along with some carrots and celery. I did have a bite of the burger my other friend made that came with some au ju sauce which was also very good

Prices were pretty standard for a sit down burger place and the service was great. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 star was the bland chicken. I would return to try another creation if I am down in the mandalay our lucite area.",0,0,0

Spinach and blue cheese on a burger, I mean, could he really marry these ingredients on top a buffalo burger?

First off, let me preface this by saying that perhaps my palate isn't refined enough to appreciate this particular marriage of ingredients.  With that said, I thought the blue cheese was overpowering and the spinach gave the burger an unusually mushy texture to what was an slightly adventurous attempt at a traditional American flavor.  So, onto something more positive.  The buffalo meat was red and flavorful, when the taste of blue cheese wasn't overpowering.  Also, I had a piece of my friend's Kobe Beef Burger which was the complete opposite as far as ingredients, clean, simple and flavorful.

All in all, I think HK's burger was just a bit too complicated and may have worked for some, just not me.  Everyone else seemed thoroughly satiated with their meals, a Hawaiian burger and Kobe, so would I recommend coming back? Perhaps. $20 a burger is a pretty steep price, but nothing a trip to the craps table couldn't fix.

The rest of the group decided to split their burgers but my dude and I each got our own. I felt bad at first, like a pig...but then once I took one bite THANK GOD, no way would I want to share this amazing burger. 

I decided to try something different, so i ordered the baffalo burger. It's lower in calories, fat and cholesteral. By the taste you'd never know it. You order everything ala carte so it is sort of pricey for a burger joint but worth the experience. Eh it's Vegas!! So I ordered it with the plain bun, lettuce, tomato, bacon and skinny fries. YUM YUM & YUUUMMM. I swear I scarfed that shit down like someone was going to steal it. 

The rest of the table also got buffalo burgers and a black angus burger. Everyone was super happy with their meals. OH we also had the sweet potato fries and zuchini fries. Also very very good. 

Makes me really sad cuz we don't have a Burger Bar. =( If you love burgers...i def recommend this place. They have a zillion toppings to chose from and a variety of buns too. Oh man....I was stuffed but it was well worth it.

Swiss Cheese.....Good.

Bun......Very Good....Toasty, potatoey...
Fried Egg....And here is the reason for the low score...... NO YOKE....NO YOKE....I advised both the Waitress and the manager (whom the waitress sent over) and neither of them offered to have another egg made.  The Waitress even said, 'That's the best part.""  No shat!!!!!

I had the trio mini sliders which were accompanied with a side of fries. Each burger had its own little spin-- one classic, one with bacon, and one buffalo! Each one was unique enough to stand on its own. Even after finishing all of them, I could still recollect what each one tasted like individually, and that's the whole point, right?

All my friends were satisfied with their burgers too. I have to say that the fries were cooked nicely, but they weren't anything special.

I got the cheapest burger on the menu - which was still like 15 bucks.  The burger was thick and juicy but not great.  I honestly would have been just as satisfied with a Red Robin burger (now you know where I'm coming from).  The next step up is a 22 dollar burger, which to me is an obscene amount of money for a burger.  The service was good, but the dining was very cramped - which was probably the biggest surprise about this place.  The coolest part about my visit was that we got to see Hubert Keller.  If not for that, I'd probably give it 2.5 stars.  If you want a rare and expensive burger and a chance to see a famous chef, go here.

The burger came out quickly and done right.  There are several chef burgers for you to choose from but than you can select your bun, your patty of choice, cheese, and any condiment you want.

We finally get our bill and want to pay it, but again, the waitress disappeared.  Maybe I was just more irritable because I was tired and hungover.  But it seriously seemed like we waited forever.

Will I come back again?  Maybe.......they do have a Kobe beef burger...hmmm.",16,8,13

I decided to try the sliders with three different kinds of meat. Buffalo, American Kobe, and Angus. All were great and flavorful.

As for appetizers, if you're indecisive like I am, then I would strongly encourage you to order their THE FRY sampler.  It's a decent amount for a party of 2-4 people, and it has a little bit of everything delicious there.

However, the 3 stars above indicate something wrong with the experience, and that something was the food itself.

I had the Kobe Beef Burger with Provolone and my fiancee ordered the Hubert Keller burger and fries. Fries were pretty good. Nice texture, nice flavor, but nothing amazing.

The Hubert Keller burger had a solid combination of flavors, with nice play between the cheese, the meat, and the sauce. If both burgers were as decent as the Hubert Keller burger, I would've probably leaned towards four stars. However, my Kobe beef burger, despite only being cooked to medium and still nice and pink inside, was really dry and flavorless. There was just not enough fat in my burger. No juiciness. And since the burger was very basic other than the cheese, there was nothing else to mask the forgettable patty. Perhaps I should have added some truffle and foie gras to liven it up, but then I'd just be enjoying those things, rather than the burger itself.

I did try the fries, onion rings and sweet potato fries and all were very good. I really enjoyed the sweet potato fries. They're served with ketchup but if you ask for a side of ranch dressing, they'll gladly bring it to you, and the ranch went nicely with the sweet potato fries as well as the onion rings. I also tried the vanilla milkshake and it was pretty delicious. The service was friendly, it was easy to get in for a late lunch, and the prices are not outrageous. I'd return.",3,1,2

I sat myself at the bar because it was happy hour and thought about partaking in some of that, but quickly realized that I was going to a meeting in a few hours I skipped over that but did order a ""Happy Hour"" wedge salad for $6.95? Ouch! After a quick glance of the menu I decided on the salmon burger and ordered it protein style.  After a not too long of wait the burger came out and this is where some of the disappointment came in.  The burger was literally a piece of green leaf lettuce the salmon (no sauce of any kind) the salmon ($13.50) + avocado + bacon + some chipotle aioli ( now all of this is separate and added up to $7.70 Rip Off!) same lettuce tooth picked down. Not wrapped in any way or an attempt. Just a sloppy put together presentation that ended up just having to be cut with a knife and fork. But if I am going to be charged $21.20 for a burger then you better do it right. Well not this time and the only reason I am keeping this as a 3 star is because of past visits here and not entirely this one. One another note the lady sitting next to me also ordered a burger protein style as well and hers was put together just as sloppy if not more. So lesson here for this joint is not everyone likes a bun or can have one so this is something you need to nail. Maybe have your chefs go to Red Robin or the Habit to get some protein wrapping knowledge. Your flavors are great but your prices are high and if so you must deliver on everything.",0,0,1

To start, I ordered mine on an onion bun which turned out to be a good choice. The Kobe beef was nice and juicy, the grilled onions made it sweet, and the jalapeno bacon (yes, jalapeno bacon) was a really nice addition as it gave it a nice kick. And of course, peppered Jack cheese.

The regular fries, sweet potato fries and the zucchini fries were all great... I just wish they had garlic aioli sauce.  ;)

The negatives I have are:

1. The price. Being $16 for the burger alone (as each topping has additional costs) gives it a reason not to go too often (thank goodness it's 250 miles from me), but I'd say it's worth it on the occasional visits to Vegas from here on out.

2. My brother's burger somehow turned out pretty bland. He had the Kobe with Jack as well but with guacamole and jalapenos on the side, so I question the consistency of the burgers somewhat.

3. To be completely honest, w\/ all those toppings, it's hard to tell the difference between Kobe beef and your typical farm or Angus beef. Might not be a bad idea to save $5 and get that instead.",0,0,0

I went straight for a strawberry mojito.. it is Vegas by the way. The drink was not too strong and had just the right amount of strawberry flavor. 

I ordered the Kobe burger medium rare.. and it was the perfect fit for me. My burger came in nice and juicy. The meat itself was simply seasoned and charbroiled for several minutes. Each bite literally melted in my mouth. I don't remember even chewing the burger! 

The fries sampler was also pretty delicious. It comes with three different sauces that just makes your five fingers want to reach out for more!

I always have a hard time eating slowly and completely enjoying my food but I forced myself to eat slower than usual for this one. All I can say is WOW. My first bite was incredible!! As Homer would say ""MMMMMMM MMMMMM BURGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER"". The kobe patty was so juicy...truly an explosion of flavor. This is something that I could probably eat everyday during my trips to Vegas.

We put our names down and they have a system that sends a text when they are ready to seat you. Really nice! So about 20-30 mins later I get the text and I'm raring to go. We get seated and our server seems like a nice chap. I order a beer, my dad as well and my mom a water. He returns with 3 beers and no water. Not a big deal, my dad or I will just end up drinking it anyhow. It was a simple error. They have preset burgers and they have a make your own burger with several options of meat. I don't recall what my mom got but she got the sweet potato fries on the side. I got the thin cut fries on the waiters recommendation and some pepper jack bomb things. My dad and I got the Australian Wagyu style patties. He got his medium well, he was actually going with well done, but the waiter talked him out of it. The right call in my opinion. I got mine medium rare. While waiting for food I got another beer as the first one went down quick and my dad started on the extra beer already. The food arrives and the burgers have those little plastic sticks in them that indicate how they are cooked. They reminded me of Sizzlers as a kid. We dig in. The pepper jack bombs were small nuggets of cheese battered and fried well, they weren't too gooey and had a nice bit of heat. The thin fries pretty much tasted like pretty generic thin cut fries from anywhere. The sweet potato fries had a crispy seasoned coating and weren't bad. Now, I didn't get around to asking my parents how their food was. They seemed to like what they got, but I was treating my parents and they are the type to not complain in the case. Here's where things started to get disappointing. Our waiter just seemed to up and vanish. I'm not totally sure, but it seemed he never returned after dropping the food off. I cut my burger in two before starting on it. My burger nearly mooed out load as my blade fell. The patty was extremely rare, but somehow one side was cooked slightly more than the other. That half I ate, and honestly nothing about that burger was memorable or had any distinct taste. We were more than done and our waiter had still not checked on us. I ended up asking a busboy to get him for us. I pointed out the burger and he agreed that it was undercooked. The host\/manager came by and told us he removed it from the check.

It is definitely one of the best burger places in Vegas! Btw, it's located in Mandalay Place (the shopping area) of the Mandalay Bay casino. Be prepared for a 30min -1 1\/2 hour wait though. It's worth it! You can always walk around the mall or check out the great dessert place next door...

That's when I ordered the best milkshake in the world. It's the Black and White Cookie milkshake. It was like Ben and Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream, but better. It was orgasmic. I was dying over this milkshake. It probably was 1,500 calories, but damn if it wasn't worth it.

Since my husband and I are pescetarian, you would think that a burger place wouldn't be as capable of handling us. Not so at Burger Bar! I ordered the most incredible salmon burger, cooked to perfection. My husband ordered the vegan option, which was two amazing portobello mushroom caps with tons of veggies in the middle. Not only was it incredible to see a vegan option at a major restaurant, but it was a very tasty option. 

The fries were eh, but the next time I am ordering the zucchini fries. They looked amazing.

Customized Buffalo Burger w\/Pepper Jack Cheese, Jalapeno Bacon, chipotle aoli on a wheat bun and a side of fried pickles encrusted with jalapenos.

This burger was alright... here's my problem though, when it comes to burgers I believe that the toppings should compliment the flavors of the hamburger not be where the majority of the flavor comes from. The burger wasn't seasoned well or the flavor of the beef just wasnt there.

In the future, if i were here to go again, first I would not go unless there was no wait because they do not take reservations.

My first visit to Vegas and I did some hard research into what places I wanted to experience. The Burger Bar was high on that list. I didn't eat all day on our 9-hour drive to Vegas and was so looking forward to ordering a killer burger and adult milkshake. I didn't get that far.

We arrived shortly before 7pm on Friday night. It was packed. That was understandable. We were told it was about a 45 minute wait unless we wanted to sit at the bar. SURE! Let's sit at the bar. We were seated immediately and with a smile. Thanks!

We sit at the bar and was immediately addressed and we put in a drink order while looking at the menu. I had planned out burger after burger before I came here, but I decided to divert from my original ideas. I ordered a Kobe on an onion bun, with blue cheese, jalapeno bacon, caramelized onion, and a side of skinny fries. The wifey bought the American Classic.

Within a relatively short period of time our food came out...  well, her food came out and I was given a burger that was said to be mine. I looked at it and didn't see any bacon nor any sign of bleu cheese. I made mention of this, the bussboy didn't quite understand. I cut open the burger and inspected it: maybe Kobe beef with a ton of grill scrapings (these were ""grilled onions""). The burger was sitting in the window for some time for it was lukewarm and the fries cold. I brought these issues to my server and he said ""Are you sure? Are you sure there isn't any bleu cheese under the burger or bacon under the onions?"" Really? You are kidding me: look at the damn burger. Bacon and bleu cheese can only be missed by someone never experienced in eating either. FAIL.

Understand that our food was brought out by a bussboy who didn't understand the various sticks and plastic they stick in the burgers to mark them. That's why my server came back 5 minutes later trying to stuff the burger I ordered in my face to eat instead. It was obviously cold at that point.

I took bites of the first burger, it sucked. Really disgusting. My stomach was turning and I could not eat anymore. Really disappointing.

We got our bill and they were willing to charge me a fucking arm and a leg for not being able to eat the burger I ordered. They then took the toppings off and charged us for the $17.50 Kobe beef. My wife insisted that was some bullshit (of course she was incredibly polite about it) and it was stricken from the bill. We paid for her food and drink and still tipped 20%.

Pros: It was all in all accommodating. People were friendly and we were seated quickly for an insane time of night. My food was comped for their mistakes. Their attitude was positive even when we were not.

Cons: Don't have bussboys serving food. This is the fastest way to fuck things up in a food service. Have those who are in the fold of the whole order be the one's responsible for serving, that way you can cut down on fuck ups. Problem solved.

I wanted to order the $60 Kobe beef burger with foie gras and shaved truffles...but that seemed a little extravagent for a late lunch.  Also, build your own burgers always seem to fail me.  There are always too many options and I tend to add too much to my burger.  So I decided to keep it simple and I ordered the sliders.  I figured it was the best way to sample 3 different burgers.  The first was the American Classic which consisted of cheese, sliced tomato, lettuce & pickle.  The second consisted of bacon and the third had caramelized onions.  Honestly, I couldn't tell the difference of which patty was Kobe beef, Buffalo and Ridgefield Farm beef.  They were supposed to be cooked to medium, but it was well done when I got them.  The patties were a little on the cold side and a little dry.  Also, I didn't like the bun on these sliders at all.  I prefer a moist, soft bun.  These were not.

I decided to go all out with the Kobe burger with fried egg, bacon, cheese, and a lobster tail.

The burger tasted exactly how you would expect a Kobe burger with fried egg, bacon, cheese, and a lobster tail would taste....delicious!

This place has dim lighting and a bit of a pub feel to it.  The beer selection is good and i guess you can probably call this a Gastropub.  

The second time i got the buffalo burger with bleu cheese which was also quite good.  I tried some of my wife's kobe burger with foie gras and that was pretty tasty too.

I'd definitely recommend this place if you are looking to try a 20-30+ dollar burger.   :)",0,0,0

Started off with the Hubert Keller Burger and it was okay. The buffalo was bland. The caramelized onions and ciabatta bun were definitely better in my book.

Things that are good:

- Yeahhhh, burgers. I know it's become terribly à la mode to dress up your beef with all sorts of fancy toppings (burger à la mode not being one of them, I should hope, but I'm sure some molecular gastrotard has put a mustard sorbetto on top of ground beef.) Love the menu. Pick a meat (including buffalo, turkey, or veggie. How nice. But seriously. Red meat.) Pick things to put on it. Pick a roll. Pick a temp. Watch your wallet shrink. (Truffles! Foie! Lobster!) Everything was good, save the aioli. A little forward for me; couldn't really taste anything but garlic. The roll was insane.

- Really good beer selection. I picked a bad beer (I'd heard good things about Hitachino Nest but I thought it tasted like sour upper-lip sweat post-workout.) But that doesn't stop me from appreciating the overall collection.

- Our server was nice, speedy, and thorough. About as much as you could ask for.

Things that were off:

- They definitely lean more towards undercooking here, so if you're in doubt, I'd go a notch up as far as doneness is concerned. I'm of the mind that rare = good and foodborne illness = I'll take my chances, so the extremely red and wet nature of my burger wasn't so much of a problem. If you're picky, I'd say go medium.

- Waiter for the section next to ours let out a most vociferous belch while exiting the service station, and while I'm not entirely OPPOSED to a good burp, I'm also a little put off by such public displays of wanton near-regurgitation.

This place is great to hang out, have drinks and watch the games but we were not satisfied with the food especially at the price we paid. We may not be back...[34\/100]",17,9,13

The vegetarian burger is the BEST veggie burger I've ever had in the 11 years I've been a vegetarian. Boca & Morningstar, you may call yourself a veggie burger but you're really just some soy slime with a faux funky meat taste. Gross. 

The Burger Bar veggie patty is the real deal - thick, fresh, and deliciously full of vegetables. I was a little worried by the description (pumpkin puree? weird), but was so delighted by my first bite. It bursts with flavor. I would have been happy to make a meal solely from a few patties, nothing else, that's how good & satisfying this burger was. Also, the beer battered jalapeno pickles were bomb! Crunchy & fried on the outside, yummy on the inside. 

There were some disappointments - the bun wasn't really all that great. The homemade dijon mustard (one of the extra costs) didn't taste as good as grey poupon off the shelf. The cheese was broiled too long on both mine & my boyfriend's burgers, so it was thin and hard instead of being thick & cheesy.

All weekend long we planned to get the Daniel Boulud kobe\/short rib\/truffle burger but we were running out of time and so we settled on the Burger Bar instead.

The thing about this place is that even though there are endless ways of customizing your burger (choice of meat \/ bun \/ toppings \/ cheese \/ sauces), most of the time you just want to choose from a combination of toppings. There are a few combinations but none of them sound very good except for a kobe\/truffle burger and a burger with lobster in it. I chose to go custom: ridgefield beef, bleu cheese, bacon, and a black truffle sauce on ciabatta with a side of sweet potato fries. My verdict? Pretty awesome. Total damage? 30something dollars. Not too bad, the price of a buffet and either way I'm stuffed.

The other cool thing about this place is it has a very extensive list of beers. They had hitachino beer here but sadly only the lacto and hef here. I don't recommend any of those. 

The thing that sucks is it is a small place, it gets busy, and theres no place to sit and wait. There's shopping but you know Vegas and seating... only at the tables or in front of the slot machines. It's in a mall. They need beepers so you can venture away without worrying about losing your spot.

My friend got the veggie burger, homemade from lentils and veggies, etc. It was not that good. It fell apart...did not stick together the way you need a burger to. Not seasoned nearly enough. Nothing special and would not order again.
The fries tasted like they were fried with everything else on the menu that is fried. Kind of like Jack in the Box fries. The onion rings were very good, but Ruth's Chris are better.

""I stay Gucci down to the socks!"" (c) Christopher Wallace. 

I live by a motto of never believing in something because of the hype. Not that I'm too good to give a little attention to pop culture, but just because I go in it to find out for myself and walking into Burger Bar with that same exact mentality. I almost ALWAYS, ALWAYS call a restaurant when I'm on my way to let them know that I will be paying them a visit. I give them my name, ask if it's busy, and the amount of time it will take for me to go from ""here"" to ""there"" so they can expect me. And that is exactly what I did:

""Hi, my name's Aljamin. What time do you guys close? ...Late? Awesome! I'll need a seat... no... just me. Great! What was your name again? Awesome, Joel! I'll be there in about 15 minutes. Thanks again!""

99.9% of the time, my table is already set. And that it was! +1 for Joel at Burger Bar! Excellent customer service and superb follow through. The menu is EXCELLENT! I browsed through it and a bunch of stuff made me ""oo! and ahh!"" First thing I noticed was the most expensive burger on the menu: Kobe burger with foie gras (duck liver), black truffles, caramelized onions?! Mmmm.... I couldn't afford it at the time, but hear me Kobe burger! YOU WILL BE CONQUERED! Haha!

If you know what a salad bar is, you get the idea of what Burger Bar is like. You pick your meat, your bun, your toppings, and a side. I went with the Kobe beef, Swiss cheese, on a wheat bun with caramelized onions (lettuce and tomato come with it), and a succulent red wine reduction sauce on the side. Order you some sweet potato fries and you're set! Once you destroy the burger, get the Nutella shake for dessert! Magnific!

Not many people inside and yet the wait to get the food was long. Got the three beef sliders. Too dry and small piece of meat. Too much bread. You expect better burgers at a burger place. I rather go to In n Out. 

It actually doesn't make sense to get burgers in Vegas anymore as there are too many other good places to go to.",3,3,2

It was this past Friday night and I ordered mine like I order all my burgers medium with caramelized onions and mushrooms with a side of fries. The burger is definitely among the best I have ever had. The meat is juicy and tender! The price is decent after taking into account the elevated Vegas pricing at every restaurant.

Would I come here again? Definitely. Considering some of the other expensive choices you can make for dinner in Vegas, the food was great and I was definitely satisfied after eating it! A 4 star!",0,0,0

They have the variety of toppings and selection of beer to deserve their name.  Yet I don't think their food deserves their prices.

I had the Kobe Burger and topped it with japaleno bacon, carmelized onions, and got their black truffle sauce on the side.  With the price of my burger now above $20, I expected heaven on an onion bun.  When the food was brought out, my heart sank.  

One of my burger pet peeves is when the bun is bigger than the patty.  If I'm paying this much for a burger, it's disappointing when 25% of the burger was all bun and no meat.  Perhaps the cost and size is offset by the quality of the beef?  After all, the menu states, ""This American Kobe Beef from Snake River melts in your mouth, tender with an unmatched flavor, the most expensive beef in the world for the most discriminating palate.""  

Unfortunately I agree with only half of that.  It was a very tender burger; they're not too far off by saying it melts in your mouth.  But unmatched flavor?  When I was asked how the burger tasted, my only reply was, ""It's really tender.""  Sadly, the unmatched flavor was nowhere to be found.  I didn't use the truffle sauce at all for the first half; after that I was pouring that sauce all over in an effort to give the burger flavor.

In the end I'm suspecting that is was an off day, since many people have enjoyed the Kobe burger during their visits.  But based on this first experience, I can't see myself coming back anytime soon.",4,5,3

This was my 4th time there and it's still the best burger I have had anywhere.  Love the choices, and as a reviewer mentioned not sure I can taste the difference in meat choices.  It's probably because I customize with too many toppings.  Service is always good and the shakes are excellent (Tried the mint chocolate chip this time).  Usually get some sides of rings and sweet potato fries to share.  Beer choice is excellent, over 100 on tap? Tried a beer sampler as well this time...very filling.

Burger Bar wins the award for most expensive veggie burger. 

You buy a basic burger (meat and bread) and then they have a lot of fun burger add-ons. I got a veggie burger on an onion bun with bacon -- just kidding -- avocado, blue cheese and baby spinach. Also got a side of sweet potato fries and zucchini fries. Both were good, but the zucchini fries were just battered and fried zucchini sticks. I don't know what I was thinking. 

They also have a fat list of draught beers. 

My two friends and I each got a burger and we all shared a pitcher and our total before tip was about $75. 

The two times I've gone (primetime on the weekends) there was like a 20-minute wait. But you can take their number down, go window shopping at Urban Outfitters, and call the hostess to see if your digs are ready. 

Also, look at the menu outside as you wait, so you get your grub quicker. 

* 

On a separate visit, I ordered a $3.50 PB-chocolate shake. Kind of expensive, right? But they give you the leftovers that won't fit in the glass, old school style. 

Also tried the Buffalo shoestring fries. They were very good, by my standards. Tasted like they stole Jack-in-the-Boxes' fry seasoning recipe and applied it to a crunchy shoestring. Shoestring is the superior cut, but they were a little too crunchy. 

I found out that you can order all of the burger add-ons a la carte, with out having to buy a burger. So you can basically make a salad. This news is epic. Next time I'm gonna make a $40 Lobster tail-asparagus salad. 

I asked the waitress if ordering only a la carte items and no burger was common. She said a lot of vegetarians do that. Haha, pretentious ... I love it.",2,0,2

But after some friends told me about Burger Bar I expected more, a lot more.  The girl and I got a seat quickly but only because we sat at the counter.  No biggie.  The server\/barista came to us quickly.  I was a little miffed because he said the shakes were huge (depicting it with his hands) and would be enough for the girl and I.  Well when it came out it was not huge--it was barely enough for one person (depicting with my hands).  And at $7--spot-on for outrageous strip prices.      

Now to the food.  I ordered the Slider Trio because I wanted to try the 3 different ground meats:  buffalo, angus (i think), and all-natural.  The menu says they're cooked to medium--NO SUBSTITUTIONS!  It came with an order of skinny fries.  The gal had the angus burger and got a bunch of toppings.  

Well, my sliders came out and although they were really tiny, if the menu explicitly states medium, I would tend to expect medium.  The buffalo was medium but the other 2 were medium well.  All in all, the ""burgers"" were dry, practically tasteless, and pretty much tasted the same (though in terms of ground meat tasting different I didn't expect much).  

I tasted the girl's angus and you could definitely tell the difference in tastes from that and your run-of-the-mill ground beef.  But other than that it was unremarkable--dry (even though cooked to medium) and needed more seasoning.  

Eating on the strip I expect to be ripped off.  But I didn't expect to literally be ripped off.  Found out after I got back to the car that they had charged us for the more expensive burger!  

Sorry Hubert but although your $60 Kobe, Foie Gras and Black Truffle burger is impressive, the rest of your menu lacks culinary creativity and your basic burgers require something more that makes it better than your average diner burger.",1,0,1

This place is located in Mandalay Place which is the shopping walkway in  between Luxor and Mandalay Bay. The prices are definitely steep, you start at $8.95 for a regular burger but then your add ons like cheese, mushrooms, etc, cost that extra cash. Fries and sides are extra too, by the time you're done you paid a pretty penny for burgers and fries. I recommend the sweet potato fries.

Service did not check on us once after the food arrived, maybe he knew we were trying to be cheap cause we split a burger and he didn't bother??? HAH probably.

I've always wanted to go to one of Hubert Keller's restaurants (Fleur de Lys being at the top of that list). But since we were in Vegas, we decided to hit up Burger Bar. Okay, for the record, it took us for-ever to find it in the casino, our fault for not being able to navigate I suppose.

Food: Obviously known for their burgers, the range of flavors starts with a run-of-the-mill cheeseburger, to a fine dining Rossini Burger (Kobe burger, sauteed foie gras, shaved truffles, and a rich brown sauce). I settled somewhere in the middle with a Bacon, Cheddar Kobe burger. Very juicy, great bread (a choice of 4), and well-seasoned onion rings. Fries were also really good (offered thick or thin). But the coup de grace was their shake. A nutella shake. NUTELLA....SHAKE. It's freakin genius and I have no idea why it's not sold everywhere. It originally was suppose to have chocolate ice cream. When I asked the waitress which shake I should get, she suggested the Nutella shake, but with vanilla ice cream. Let me tell you....I will be forever grateful to that waitress. Possibly the best shake I've ever had. Rich, creamy, topped with a chocolate whipped cream and garnished with hazelnuts. Friends also had some alcoholic shakes, which were also really great. 

Service: Awesome service. Aside from the life-altering choice my waitress helped me with, the servers were good about keeping our glasses filled and coming around every once in a while to check on us. 

Overall: I wish there was one near San Diego, alas, to eat at a Burger Bar you must be in Vegas, St. Louis, or San Francisco. But a great restaurant, with awesome service. Oh, did I mention there was a tv in our booth? No? There was. It was awesome. Forewarning: They don't have restrooms in the restaurant and the trek to the bathroom is nice little stroll.

I ordered the Black Angus Beef burger medium rare. The meat was very bland, and it was lack of seasoning. Bryan had the American Kobe Beef burger medium rare. But, the kobe beef was like the black angus beef which was lack of flavors. The meat didn't melt in the mouth. Nothing stood out and nothing special! My husband and I definitely had better kobe beef burger before. That was very disappointing.

For the sides, we had the buttermilk onion rings and BUTTERMILK ZUCCHINI FRIES. The onion rings were just fine. The batter was flavorful, but the crust was too thick for the skinny onion rings. On the other hand,  the zucchini fries had the same crust, but the crust was good on the zucchini. The zucchinis were cut thick, so they can hold up the crust well. It was a good combination. I like them. 

My favorite is the NUTELLA MILKSHAKE! The shake was delicious! It was pack with hazelnut flavor, especially the nutella whipped cream. Every bite was nutella! Perfect for Nutella lover!

The good:
- This place can cook a RARE burger. Thank you!
- The buns are great.  Crusty and perfect for soaking up all those burger juices.
- Great variety of toppings.  There's definately something to be said for getting a burger with exactly what you want on it.
- Sweet potato fries were tasty.  Zuicchini fries were just ok, dipped them in ranch which reminded me of fried mushrooms and veggies at other run of the mill restos. (Side note: noticed in other reviews mention of runny ranch, this was not.)

The not so good:
- Fleur de Lys sauces weren't that great.  Tried 2 and both lacked the flavor to stand up to the rest of the burger.
- Music was loud.  I understand going for the ""bar"" feel, but honestly it was hard to hear our server (or anyone else further than 2 ft from you).

Other thoughts:
- If you're looking for a plain burger, this may not be your place.  There's really nothing wrong with their burgers, but the thing that makes this place great is the extrordinary toppings.
- If you've only had burgers at Chili's or Fudruckers type places, you may want to order your burger one doneness level up from your usual.  Those places notoriously overcook their burgers, so if you're used to their medium rare, it's really more like medium.",0,0,0

I came in here with zero expectations but left with the highest praise. As soon as I took my first bite I hailed it the best burger I've ever had. I'm not much of a gourmet burger kind of guy, but maybe thats because I've never had Burger Bar before.

I opted to get the angus beef burger cause that seemed like the most popular choice. I also added bacon to my burger because cmon...bacon... We just got into vegas that day and was already pretty tired from the drive so I was ready to eat and knock out. 

The burger itself was so juicy and so flavorful. The 2 main things I always look for in a meal is texture and flavor, and man did this burger deliver. Every bite seemed to taste better and better as I went on. The bacon that was in my burger was just the icing on the cake. It was cooked exactly the way I like it, which is right on the border of soft and crispy. This made the texture of each bite soft, juicy and chewy all at the same time while packing a punch of flavor.

I definitely would recommend this place to pretty much anybody. Even though each burger ended up being close to $20, I felt like I completely got my money's worth. Next time I go, I definitely want to try some of the more expensive options",0,1,0

Great selection of different burgers from the buffalo patty to the Kobe along with a large selection of toppings and offerings.  I've had the American Classic many times with cheese and bacon for a nice juicy burger.  The hangover burger is great with the coleslaw topping and it definitely helps after a night of drinking as its name suggests.  Full service bar to eat when dining room is full is a plus and the friendly staff make sure the order is right every time.  The onion rings are super crispy and cooked to perfection every time.  Sometimes I'll do the fat fries that complements the burger of choice well.  Great place to watch current sports events while dining on a delicious burger.

Buffalo is my new favorite burger. And the buffalo burger at Burger Bar is so good. They have a ton of toppings if that's your thing, but I just need cheese. Throw a pickle and some lettuce on there, mustard and steak sauce. I need one now!

Good onion rings, crispy fries and a great selection of beers here. Full bar too! Service is good, there is a small wait most of the time, but just do what I do and sit at the bar. TV's everywhere so you won't miss the game.

Some special notes about my new favorite meat...

Buffalo contributes about 69% more iron to your diet than beef; with higher levels of vitamins, minerals, and twice as much Beta-Carotene as grain-fed meats. It's also high in essential fatty acids and has an excellent ratio of Omega-3 to Omega-6 acids. All things considered, it's a perfect way to enjoy the full, rich flavor of beef without the guilt.",0,0,1

After our convention ended for the day, my boss and I wanted to get something to eat after all the activities. The location of the Burger Bar is between Luxor and Mandalay Bay at the Mandalay Place Mall. I wasn't sure what to expect, but sure was great my boss wanted to go here. I was supposed to go here last November, but my plans had switched because of the Pacquiao fight.

We were greeted by a beautiful lady and placed on the tables near the entrance because the booths were full. My boss wanted to see the Football game, but at the same time have a great meal with our work money. I opened up the menu and I see this expensive $60 burger. Foie Gras Burger...What?! Geez. I ordered the American Classic with skinny fries ($14). I am not sure what my boss ordered since it was a customized burger, but sure was delicious for both of us. I guess I am willing to pay $14 for a burger, but not a dime more.

The atmosphere was awesome and people were just having fun watching the game either with the MLB or NFL. The American Classic Burger is a MUST!!! One day...I will order the Foie Gras Burger...just need to win $60 bucks.....

Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!",1,1,1

But this place has become a staple in my family. When we think burgers, we think Burger Bar...so it's well worth the drive down the Strip to get there.

Depending on when you go dictates how long the wait is. We've waited anywhere from 10 minutes to over an hour. They won't seat you unless everyone in your party is present (which I can appreciate, having worked in the restaurant industry), so if you're waiting for people to arrive, I recommend at least getting your name on the list. That way, when everyone DOES arrive, you can just let the hostess know your party is ready and your wait time will be shortened.

It's usually pretty loud in there. If you're looking for a quiet meal, this definitely isn't the place to go. It's got a bit of a sports bar feel to it, with sports games playing on both the big screens and the small TV screens inside the booths. But everybody always seems to be having a good time, and I can still manage to have a conversation with my table without having to shout at anybody.

They have the Chef's burgers menu, and also have build-your-own options for burgers and milkshakes (both alcoholic and not). They have non-beef options, such as chicken, turkey, or salmon. They even have a veggie burger and a specialty vegan burger, along with various salad options for all the non-meat eaters out there. All of the Chef's burgers come with skinny fries, but you can change those out for any of their other side options. (I usually opt for sweet potato fries.) If you do a build-your-own, you can add on those side options for $3-6.

I personally am OBSESSED with the Hubert Keller burger. I mean, I dream about this burger. I wake up craving it. And then I bug everyone I know to give me an excuse to go get one. It's a buffalo burger topped with sauteed baby spinach, caramelized onions, and blue cheese. Each component on that burger compliments every other component. It comes with a Red Wine Shallot reduction on the side, and it just puts the burger over the top. It took a couple visits for me to get my dad to try it (he was scared of buffalo meat for some reason), but I practically shoved a bite down his throat and now he's hooked. Buffalo meat is amazing!

A close second (in my opinion) would have to be the Peppercorn burger. If you're a fan of pepper and mustard, THIS is the burger for you.

Then of course, there are the milkshakes. Holy crap! So yummy! I've had both the Nutella and the Salted Caramel milkshakes. Both are sooo delicious. When ordering shakes ""for here"" they are decorated beautifully. Very artistic. But you can also order them to-go, and they'll put it in a plastic cup with a nice wide straw so you can take it with you. 

I also recommend the Creamy Cheese Cake burger. This is a dessert alternative to the milkshake, filled with sweetened cream cheese and caramelized pineapple. The ""bun"" is made with fresh donuts! Mmm Mmm! They're a little small though, so...unless you just want a bite, I recommend skipping the ""Let's split a dessert"" part of the conversation and just keep it all to yourself.

We've never once had a bad experience here. Our servers have always been friendly, they are mindful of any modifications we make, and our burgers are always cooked to perfection. Service CAN be a little slow though. Depending on how busy they are, it may be hard to track down said server for drink refills or extra sauce. And once they take your order, you can expect to be sitting there twiddling your thumbs for 15-20 minutes with nothing on the table but beverages. (There is also a longer wait on the dessert burgers.) But! They DO cook everything to order, so it's completely understandable and well worth that wait.",1,1,1

We had the grandest of intentions of getting all dolled up and hitting the Strip for a Friday full of debauchery. What ended up happening was us, drinking vodka in their hotel room and stumbling for a late dinner at Burger Bar, where we proceeded to stuff our faces so full and then go immediately back to the hotel room to hit the hay. (When did I get so ooooooold?) 

Anyway, unlike my experience at Holsteins (which I do like better even though I give them both the same star rating)  I did have a boozy milkshake. It was not that impressive. Don't get me wrong, I love a milkshake and I still drank it all, but I wanted it to smack me in the mouth with alcohol, which it did not. Mint chocolate chip with chocolate whipped cream and an alleged mint liqueur for $10.75.

I ordered the Hubert Burger. I have a huge admiration for the chef (Public TV FTW) and also inventive recipes, especially those involving blue cheese. Buffalo meat (a hard find... coming from South Dakota where it's everywhere), spinach, caramelized onions, blue cheese and a wine reduction sauce on the side for $22. It was spectacular, though perhaps not the best choice combined with my previously vodka-soaked stomach and liver and the aforementioned boozy milkshake. 

We also ordered a sauce selection for the table. You're not coming to Burger Bar to save money or to eat healthy, so just do it. White barbecue, basil aioli, truffle mayo, homemade mustard, chipotle aioli were our choices. Loved them all but particularly the truffle mayo and homemade mustard. Mmmmm. 

The decor and bathrooms are where the stars really plummet for me. Bathrooms are forever away, passing by the back-of-house restaurant rooms on the way. The decor looked like it was schlepped together and doesn't match a $22 burger.

Currently, actively working my way through their Chef's Burgers portion of their menu -- I have had the Surf\/Turf (not my favourite), the namestake Hubert Keller Burger, and a third one that I am not sure of which one it was now -- only on one occasion was my burger not cooked to temperature (asked for 'medium rare'; was brought 'well done'). 

Back to the dessert burgers. Goddamn is that creamy cheese cake burger one good. 

The service has been hit or miss for us here. They can be busy -- and I can understand busy -- but there are other places that are busy but still take your order fairly quickly and more importantly bring you your desserts after ordering them in a timely manner. 

The weaknesses in this area force me hand in a four-star versus a five, although anyone can come here and easily have their five-star experience on a routine basis. Food is great; boy, those dessert burgers cannot be overstated though. - E

We went for lunch and ordered the Kobe beef burger (cooked medium), with the onion bun, brie, grilled onions, portobello mushrooms, lettuce, and tomatoes. We also added truffle mayo and chipotle aioli sauces on the side with fat fries. 

The patty was juicy and pink all the way through. It would have been perfect, HOWEVER, it was a little underseasoned. We had to constantly spread sauce to it. The fat fries were well cooked (crispy on the outside, soft on the inside). All the extras complimented the patty well. 

Since today is National Donut Day, we ordered the sweet Nutella donut burger, which is basically a Nutella patty enclosed in a Krispy Kreme glazed donut. It had strawberries for tomatoes, kiwis for pickles, and a passion fruit jelly slice for cheese. HOW CUTE, and delicious. It wasn't as rich as I thought it would be.

Burgers were great as were the sides and drinks. I ordered a custom made burger which does add up when you start piling on things like pineapple and different cheeses. Also added some foie gras to my burger which was delish.

The only gripe i have which i assume has nothing to do with the restaurant itself is that Yelp* has this as a $$ which i think it should be a $$$ considering there cheapest burger is in the $19 range.

I've only been here once, and it's been a year since I've last went there, but I do remember how much I enjoyed the Kobe Burger I had (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1LCXqYn).  Since it was my first ever taste of Kobe style beef, I ordered it plain and simple, just to be able taste the beef and figure out why the hell do people rave about it so much.  To be honest, I didn't notice a huge difference, but it was probably because I haven't had regular burger for weeks before that.  Needless to say, it was very good.  I was very curious about their Rossini Burger, but I couldn't come to myself to pony up $60 for a burger.  I've been hearing good things about it though, and also their Veggie Burger that I saw Hubert Keller make from scratch on his TV show.  

I don't know what to say about their Chocolate Burger (http:\/\/bit.ly\/20biv3F) as it really took me by surprise because they really did a good job making it look like a real burger.  I wasn't even sure how to go about eating it whether to knife n fork it, or eat it using my hands like a real burger.  I decided on the latter and that probably wasn't such a good idea as the strawberries and mint leaves kept falling out.  It was very good though and was a fitting way to finish your meal at a burger joint.

I saw that they had a Veggie Burger, so I was content with eating here. There was a 15 minute wait when we got there around 1900 on a Thursday evening, so we just waited outside. 15 minutes does pass by quickly while strolling around the strip mall, and soon enough, we were seated at a booth. Our waitress offered drinks, which I decided on a beer. 

One thing on the menu is how there are many options, ranging from all sorts of protein, ranging from beef, chicken, salmon, lamp, buffalo, or even Kobe Style, not to mention the house veggie style. There's even assorted bun types  (including gluten free) and a half page of toppings to consider. Talk about options, and letting my mind go nuts with all of the variables to consider.

I settled on getting the house veggie burger, with a potato bun, and sweet potato fries. Check out my pictures to see what it looks like. :-) The veggie burger was moist and tasty. The texture of the patty was offset by the texture of a perfectly toasted bun, with spicy ketchup and jalapeños.  A good amount of textural contrast, along with flavor contrast as well. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, and it was a nice way to end the evening.

However, one of my officemates decided to go all out and try the $60 Rossini Burger. Upon first bite of this burger, he was filled with glee and happiness. So much pleasure in enjoying a burger comprising of Kobe Style Wagyu beef from Australia, accompanied with foie gras, shaved truffles,  black perigord Truffle sauce. I mean - there was a lot of taste in that burger. The waitress herself said (and I agree with her) that, if you ever stop here, try this burger. It's all about the experience, not about the money. Just try it once, and then savor the experience forever. 

Next time I'm in Vegas, I will strongly consider eating this Rossini Burger, just for the experience. 

Service was top notch! Waters were kept filled, offered additional beers when it was warranted, overall, just checked-in on everyone while the entire restaurant was very busy.

Access to the bathroom is way in the far back of the restaurant; go past the second half of the bar. Pass a door, turn left, head down a hall way, and bathrooms on the right.

Fairly large place with two bar areas front and back, some booths along one wall and tables in the middle. Extensive menu featuring ""Build a burger"" options. They have some great milkshakes as well, both alcoholic and not. 

I ordered the Angus Prime burger, on a sesame seed bun, with prosciutto and cheddar cheese. The burger was decent sized, maybe 1\/3 lb. Flavor was just ok, didn't really seem like there was special seasonings or anything in the beef. I also got a Pink Monkey milkshake, which was strawberry banana flavored and that was pretty tasty. A side of sweet potato fries and it was plenty of food to fill my hungry belly.

Overall, the service was pretty good. Once seated it took about 5 minutes for a server to come over and take our drink order, even though it was busy. The burgers came out after about 20 minutes. You could definitely see the staff was hustling around.

How Burger Bar is ranked as high as it is is truly beyond me.  In fact, many Yelpers I respect and normally agree with love this place but man, I haven't felt this ripped off since I bought my HDDVD player. 

Maybe Im biased against these so-called ""gourmet burger"" spots.  I mean, what makes a hamburger great is that its approachable by everyone, regardless of economics.  Perhaps thats why it has come to be synonymous with America...that it crosses boundaries.   Not here however, these burgers are decidedly expensive and in reality no better than anything you'd find at your favorite local burger joint.  

Just because you use the word ""kobe"" or ""danish blue cheese"" doesn't mean you have the right to charge $20 bucks for a burger...but apparently here it does.  Another thing is one would think a gourmet burger place would have gourmet fries right?  Wrong...here the fries were so mediocre I was yearning for Chili's.......yep, thats right I said Chili's and now I must shower to wash the shame off my body.  

I had Hubert's favorite burger which was composed of Buffalo, Bleu Cheese and sherry shallot reduction sauce.  It tasted ok, but the price...oh that price!  Would you spend 15 bucks for a gourmet hot dog?  You would tell me to jump off a bridge!  My mom had the sliders and reported them as being ok as well, but nothing special.

Service was average but not very friendly.  I mean I would have a smile if I was getting a 10 dollar tip for bringing out two hamburgers and a couple soda pops but who am I to judge?

One positive thing to note was Burger Bar did have a nice beer selection with some unique options at decent prices.  Its nice to be free from the normal yoke of beer oppression perpetrated by the casinos.

I for one can pass on this place again but judging by the crowd there and the reviews on Yelp, most people disagree.....Twilight Zone I tells ya!!!!",4,3,1

I got the Hubert Keller burger with Kobe meat instead of buffalo due to the yelp reviews regarding the Kobe beef. It was good meat but the taste overall was kinda disappointing.

I got the sweet potato fries with my burger which was cooked well but under seasoned. 

Also fyi they charge a $2 split charge and portions were an okay size to share. :(

However ambiance was chill and service was good. Location was kinda odd, the place is located tucked away in Mandalay bays shopping area.

And when I'm told that anything is ""the best"", it almost always fails to live up to the expectation.  Burger Bar fell victim to the same curse.

A buddy and I were in town staying at the Luxor for a trade show that was at the Mandalay Bay, so aside from the recommendation from another friend, we had to walk past Burger Bar every day to get to the Mandalay convention hall.  We almost didn't make the stop, because like usual, Vegas had sucked the life out of me and made me feel sick to my stomach within the first 8 hours of our visit, and neither of us had much of an appetite as a result.  After passing by a handful of  times, though, we decided that our last meal (fitting title for a terrible trip) would be at Burger Bar.

We arrived around 6PM and the wait was 45 minutes.  Instead of being impatient, we saw this as a good sign of things to come and put our names down before heading to waste a few bills and brain cells on gambling and booze.  When we came back and got seated, we were both impressed with the layout of the place.  Booths have private TVs, and the adjacent tables have great views of flat screens that overlook the decent-size bar.  

The beer menu was extensive, and I learned that Burger Bar prides itself on its selection of ""rare beers.""  Although I opted to drink wine, I can confirm that the beer selection here is second-to-none.  They had something like a minimum of 4-5 beers from more countries than I could process in one look.  The only problem is that a person can only drink so much beer when they are eating large amounts of beef.  Not a bad problem to have, though.

Now to the food.  My buddy and I both ordered the Kobe Beef Burger, his medium rare, and mine medium well.  When they came, all looked delectable...until we took a bite.  Mine was barely medium rare, and my friend's almost kicked him in the mouth it was so rare.  I swear I heard the thing ""moo.""  So we got the attention of our nice waitress, informed her of the situation and asked for a re-order.  But instead of smiling and apologizing profusely, she tried to argue with us about what our respective burgers should look like based on how we ordered them.  Oh boy.  She finally sensed our quickly rising frustration, apologized and took the burgers back.

About 5 minutes later, we get our original order, but they were the EXACT SAME BURGERS, pieces missing from our last bites and all.  Now I'm not one to waste things, so this normally wouldn't be a big deal, but considering the waitress already arguing with us, and the fact that this place claims to be one of the best burger joints to be found, I would expect that they would cook us some new burgers.  I guess I'm expecting too much.

So my friend and I ate our decent, not great, but decent, burgers and moved on out as quickly as possible.  Needless to say, neither of us were thrilled with the food or the experience, and it would pretty much take a free meal to get me back there.  I'm not going to pay close to $20 for a burger and iffy service, when I can go to McDonalds and at least know what I'm going to get.  Bye-bye Burger Bar...",2,1,1

The Spicy Lamb Burger was very good. It had a nice kick without being spicy just for the sake of being spicy. Definitely not a burger that will ruin your taste buds and throw you into a flop sweat. The Hubert Keller burger (made with Buffalo meat), was awesome. Carmelized onions and blue cheese, tough to go wrong there. My favorite, though, was the Peppercorn Burger. It had peppercorns (obviously) along with Dijon mustard and a peppercorn sauce. I usually skip the sauces or get them on the side as I fear they will be either overpowering or make the sandwich too messy. However this sauce was outstanding. I'm not a fan of creamy sauces and although the menu states it is a ""peppercorn cream sauce,"" it was not at all what I expected. It was not a mayo-based sauce so not super thick. Tough to describe, but it was fabulous. Here's a great tip, get the zucchini fries rather than regular fries. They are awesome.

The wifey and I stumbled onto this place about two years ago, before everyone knew who Hubert Keller was, before Top Chef, before it turned into a herpes-ridden-french whore. And I'm not talking about the waitresses.

Time for a second visit... I say yes...

Walked into the Mandalay... If you've screwed a shark in the face, you've gone too far. 

Once we actually found the place again, we walked right in for a late 10pm Vegas dinner.

Drinks?  Tons of beer to tantalize, but I was already three Jameson's in, so let's stick to it.  So I ordered another one.  Waitress brings it and I thought it was Vodka.  This shit was so watered down it was a joke.  If I was just there for drinks I would of donkey-punched the shit out of the bar tender and wrote ""Suck it Vegas"" on his forehead.... 

But, I didn't.  I don't fuck with people who can fuck with my food.  And since we didn't order yet, I didn't want to get my burger finger fucked by a pissed-off bar tender.  Meaning, this restaurant isn't nice enough to send shit back.  Some places, you just have that gut-feeling that someone will Ryan Reynolds the shit out of your food. 

So, I sipped my water with a splash of Jameson, and got down to business.

The wifey ordered the American Classic.  It was good. Not mind-blowing, just good. The regular fries were tasty.  Especially dipped in mayo.  You know what they say, ""When in France.""

I got the Angus beef, fried egg, bacon, cheddar cheese.  My creation.  They should call it the Heart Attack Breakfast Burger. Yup.  It was fucking good.  Well worth the trip. Then again, if you put bacon and a fried egg on a donkey dick, I would eat that too.

The burger tasted like it was grilled\/smoky (it had the grill taste) but i did not like the caramelized onions. They were mushy and too sweet. Side note, they forgot my guac so it was separate in a container. Also, it comes with lettuce, pickle, red onion, & tomato on the side. I tried the cinnamon honey mustard and it was good.

Saturday evening, not feeling like going out into the hot desert air for food, we decided to stay at Mandalay Bay and look for some good, reasonably priced eats.  Yeah, I know, reasonably priced eats at Mandalay Bay, good luck, huh?  Well, we didn't find them.  We saw Burger Bar in the restaurant list in our room and decided to check it out.  Upon arriving, we looked at the menu outside the place and it was a little bit more than we wanted to spend on a late dinner.  We left and walked around the shopping area and by the restaurants inside the casino area and confirmed what we already knew, no cheap eats at Mandalay.  With no better ideas, we went back to Burger Bar.   It was pretty busy, and there was a wait for a table, so we decided to sit at the bar where there was no wait.  
 
Burger bar has a pretty wide variety of meats, cheeses, bread and toppings for you to build your own burger.  They have a veggie burger, turkey, lamb, Angus beef, Ridgefield Farm beef and Kobe beef.  Once you choose your meat and bread, you can add cheese and other toppings as you like (but of course, each topping costs extra).  They have the usual topping like bacon, mushrooms, onions, chili and peppers.  If you're feeling adventurous (and have some money to burn) you can get some of the more exotic toppings like shrimp ($6.00), lobster ($12.00), foie gras ($12.00) or black truffles (1\/3 oz for $30.00).  To go along with your burger, they have fat fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, zucchini fries or onion rings.  Finally, if you don't feel like a burger, they have a marinated chicken breast, a salmon steak or a few different salads.
 
After waivering between the Angus beef burger and the Kobe beef burger, I decided what the hell, I'm in Vegas, I'll go for the Kobe beef.  I decided on mozarella cheese, fried egg, mushrooms and jalapeno bacon for my toppings and a side of fat fries to go along with it.  Should have been a five star burger, but it wasn't.  I would have been way happier with a Fatburger for 1\/3 of the price.  I haven't had a lot of Kobe beef, and I had high expectations for it, but it seriously let me down.  It tasted like angus beef, nothing special.  I asked for it medium and it was overcooked too.  Kind of crunchy on the outside.  The toppings were good, but again, nothing better than what I could have gotten at Fatburger.  The fries were good, but that isn't tough to do fries right.  
 
Overall, a disappointing over-priced burger.  Four stars for the selection, but minus two for the taste and price.  The only reason I would come back here next time I'm at Mandalay Bay would be to get a milkshake to go.  Sitting at the bar, we were right in front of where the servers made the milkshakes.  Whole milk, real ice cream and Hershey's chocolate syrup, the perfect chocolate milkshake!!  They also have vanilla, peanut butter, strawberry, and banana.  Mmmm...chocolate banana peanut butter milkshake...drool.  I sorely regret not getting one.  It was, however, enjoyable to watch the cute waitress make them.

He felt like the meat itself was the best ever, and while I don't agree, I do think it was a fine quality burger. 
The problem with the burger bar is like most of America, self-loathing marketer: the choices.

I got a bunch of stuff on mine, but would suggest keeping it simple.

On thing that worked out brilliant was ordering a portobello on top. They are so tasty and meaty that I took that with some of the other ingredients (avo and bacon) and made a second burger out of it. Highly recommend it!

Good sweet potato fries.
Good beer selection.

Highly suggest the dessert burger!

Overall: Good place for a meal in Vegas that isn't too pricey and will satisfy most people....who doesn't like a burger?

Value: Alright...with beer it ended up being a pretty pricy meal for burger joint. classy or not.

- Get the dessert burger (donut\/cream cheese, raspberry sauce etc)
- Sweet Potato fries
- Don't order a bunch of ingredients unless you order the port shroom and then its like two burgers in one.",0,0,0

Hamburgers at this restaurant can easily get into the $20-$40 range without much effort.  The price of the burger depends on the type of meat you choose and the toppings you add.

So the host grabs the menus, walks us to a table, sets the menus down, and promptly walks away.  Doesn't say a single word to us during the entire interaction.  Not ""Your serve will be right with you"", not ""Right this way guys"" Nothing.  Just dead silence.  Awkward.

So our dude of a waiter comes up and takes our order, our food comes out, and the guy comes back to check on us once.  Everything came out perfectly we tell him.

So finally another server walks by, his name tag read Damien, and he glanced over saw our drinks were empty, and brought over a pitcher of water.  So another 10 -15 minutes goes by...still have never seen our unnamed server...our meals are well beyond finished, and Damien walks by again. 

""Has your server checked on you""

""No""

So he says he'll be right back, and comes back with our checks.  So we pay, and I don't think too much about it until as we are leaving, my sister and I look back and Damien is cleaning our table.  She walks over and politely asked him if he was getting our tip or the dude who took our order.  He informed her that when he went back to check on the server and find out why he hasn't been attending to his table that the guy had left for the night and hadn't reassigned our table to anyone.

So..thanks Damien for your server and F-U dude who deserted out table.",0,0,0

Since she was staying at Mandalay Bay, & we were both craving burgers, we decided to go to Burger Bar. Since my sister had eaten here before, & said it was good, I trusted her judgement. The wait was not long & 5 minutes under the 15 minute wait time given. The Hostesses were very nice & polite. I could care less for our waitress, as she was young and not too eager to help out with the menu selections. 

Our food however was delicious!! We both ordered custom beef burgers on a pretzel bun, cheddar cheese, bacon n onions with sweet potato fries. Juicy meat, cooked to order as a true medium, soft bun, fresh toppings and bacon was crisp along the the fries!! The sweet potato fries were a little too sweet for me, so next time, I will order the fat fries instead. 

We ordered shakes to go with our meals, they did not disappoint!! I had the adult Vanilla French Kiss shake made with coffee liquor, while my sis opted for the Salted Caramel shake. Both creamy, delicious & not too overly sweet!!

We were seated at a booth with our own personal TV which was great, since the Charger vs. Broncos football game was on!!

I would definitely come back to Burger Bar!!",1,1,2

It's tucked into the Mandalay Place shopping area of Mandalay Bay but you forget about that once you're inside.
The hostesses were friendly and cheerful, and it was only a 5 minute wait on a Saturday night, which wasn't bad at all! 

The booths are comfortable, which are fitted with a small television so you can watch whatever sports. It has a generic black button underneath which can be utilized to change the channels, but it was broken so we couldn't change the channel.

They have an AMAZING beer selection, and we opted for Magic Hat #9 which was shockingly on draft. Magic Hat is our favorite brew, aside from Dog Fish Head.

The husband ordered the Hubert Keller Burger which is buffalo, caramelized onions, baby spinach, blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. The hubby was a little thrown off by the ciabatta bun, but it complemented the ingredients perfectly and he had zero complaints. The fries are fresh and not too greasy and tasted unlike any fries we've ever tasted, which is a good thing!

I ordered the ""Perfect 10"" burger, which is BBQ Marinated Beef with smoked gouda, carmelized onions on a fresh pretzel bun, and it came with fries and a pickle slice. I love that they serve it with the onion on the side to give me the option of using it or not. To be honest, the burger didn't even need it. It was perfectly cooked to my requested medium-well temperature. The BBQ flavor was smokey with a dash of sweet and satisfied all of my taste buds! 

The burgers are way filling, so if you're not too hungry, they DO have a slider option that I had been considering prior to making my order. 

The server was sweet and friendly, giving us enough space to enjoy the meal but checking in at appropriate intervals without seeming like she was hovering. 

The total cost between our beers and burgers was $62 and change. It's a bit pricey for us to go all the time, but it makes for a GREAT date night and the quality of what you get is definitely worth the cost.",0,0,0

First, the good: There were a lot of options for our burgers, in terms of selection of ingredients, toppings, etc.  You can even build your own burger with just about as many things as you could want in or on it, truly making your own masterpiece of a burger.  There are a ton of side options, too, and you can even get a sampler of different types of fries, tater tots and even fried mac & cheese bites.

And the dulce de leche martini that I had was to die for.... It was the perfect blend of alcohol and sweetness to me!

Then there's the not so good: The place is ridiculously loud to where even with a 3\/4 enclosed booth with high walls separating us from patrons at the next table over, we still could barely hear anything through all the music and noise.  

I had the Hubert Keller burger, which as others have reviewed, is over $20.  Yes, I get that this is considered a somewhat ""high end"" gourmet restaurant, but for 20+ dollars, I expect that burger to sing in my mouth with flavor and texture, and what I got was a very generic burger that tasted overwhelmingly of the carmelized onions and slightly stale ciabatta bread.  

The other burgers that our friends had were good, but again, no one reported that it was anything spectacular that made it worth the premium we were paying for what was essentially burgers and fries.  

So in the end, it was a decent food experience, but unless our local friend insists on going, it probably won't be on our radar on our next trip to Vegas.",1,0,0

I saw the description: Buffalo, caramelized onions, baby spinach, blue cheese, I'm thinking - WINNER! Fell short!  The buffalo lacked the gamey flavor I like about the meat. It tasted like the Angus burger my boyfriend ordered, but with a higher price tag!

I must say the Buttermilk Zucchini Fries were pretty damn good! It almost tasted like a mozzarella stick because the zucchini has a melty, gooey consistency inside.  That was probably the highlight of our meal.

That being said, I didn't get one of the signature burgers, so maybe I just didn't order the right thing.

Ordered the Country National sustainable beef burger and topped it with avocado, grilled onions, and jalapenos.  While the meat was flavorful and cooked properly, the sesame seed bun was slightly hard on the outside and a little dry.  The jalapenos were the pickled, sliced varietal you're given to put on your nachos at movie theaters.

We also had a trio of sides - french fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings - none of which were any better than what you can get at your local neighborhood diner.

I got more and more excited as I did my research and found that this was often listed as a top burger place in Las Vegas. Hey, don't laugh at my naivete! You know it's all about Bachi anyway if you're a local.

I chose the Hubert Keller burger because I wanted to try buffalo meat and I was too lazy to try to custom-build one. Oh, and the whole having his name on it thing means it has to be good or else, right? Indeed, it was delicious. It came out medium-rare as I had requested, and the first thing I did was try to take a bite without adding the red wine and shallot reduction. Mistake number one! Gotta pour that sauce on there to get the maximum flavor out of this. Granted, the caramelized onions and blue cheese complemented each other well, but you need to use the sauce. Also, I liked the bite from the red onions that I threw on later and barely noticed the lettuce and tomato, which is fine by me because I just didn't want them to go to waste on the plate.

Did I not talk about the meat yet? Well, that's because I was saving it for its own paragraph. I loved it. It was similar to beef in a way, but it had a much cleaner flavor. It's somewhat hard to detect the unique flavor that sets it apart until you get a piece of mostly meat in your mouth, which I finally did at the end, and it's definitely not what I would call gamey or anything. It's just something different to appreciate because you don't eat it everyday (well, I guess you can, but I can't be bothered).

The only drawback to my meal was that the fries somehow just did not go with the burger, so it was like eating two separate dishes the entire time. I think I should've had sweet potato fries instead. When I tried a few of those from my friend, the sweetness called out to me as something that would have worked. So for those of you who might wanna try the Hubert Keller burger, I do suggest that you try to substitute in sweet potato fries for the normal thin fries (but it might cost more? dunno).

There is no doubt that this is a great place on the Strip to have a burger. If you're from out of town (and you're not one of those deprived people who have never tried In-N-Out), you won't go wrong making this your burger stop.",6,1,2

The Burgers are outstanding and the fact that you can pick from so many toppings, buns, cheeses makes this place just AWESOME. I only wish they had pretzel buns (as those are my fav).

My oreo crumble was just sprinkled on top of my chocolate whipped cream and not throughout the ice cream portion of the shake, and I barely tasted the Kahlua I added into the mix.  

Varied burger selection with a variety of burger meat options and toppings to add.  The menu also includes a selection of signature burgers.  The Hubert Keller burger was delicious with the complement of cheese and onions, and the au jus sauce made it absolutely perfect.  My bison burger was tender and flavorful with the onions and mushrooms, though I wish the meat itself was more flavorful (though stealing some of my husband's au jus made it perfect).  While parts of a given burger were good to excellent, the overall burger package was alright.  I expected more flavor and more unique topping combination for what I paid for.

You do have to give them props for the selection of burgers and shakes options, but the burger themselves are above average.  I actually preferred the burgers at BLT burger better.",4,2,4

I ordered the American Kobe Beef burger with sprouts, avocado, and beet root pickle. I wish I had known that the burger itself already comes with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle as I read the menu as all accompaniments must be ordered separately but I was very happy I got all the extras that I did. I would definitely recommend getting the beet root pickle. I loved it since I am both a fan of pickled things and beets. It really helped cut through the richness of the burger. I didn't notice a huge difference in my Kobe burger since as a whole it still tastes like a burger, albeit a darn good one. My table mates ordered the Buffalo burger (which was a bit more noticeable difference and very good) and the Hubert Keller burger (which again was yummy). I also vouch for the sweet potato fries as they are crispy, ketchup delivering perfection.

For dessert the table split the Chocolate burger which came out beautifully presented. The chocolate ""patty"" was chocolate hazlenut between two donuts with strawberries, kiwis, mint and a passion fruit ""cheese"". It was a great ending and very unique.

All in all, yes Burger Bar is expensive for a burger but I do believe that we paid for quality and craftsmanship and the portions were more than enough for everyone.",1,0,0

It can be crowded and hard to get in at times.   However, note that if you are looking for seats at the bar, the bar extends further back than the portion you can easily see from the entrance.

The Burger Bar has something for everybody.  They have a list of menu items they've put together as well as a create your own burger side.  Basically, you pick your bun, burger, cheese, vegetables, other toppings, and fries.  They have all kids of cheese, three or four types of bacon, many veggies, several types of onion, and even some uncommon items such as fois gras.  They have steak fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, seasoned fries, and zucchini fries.  You can pile it as high as you want.  The burgers are big and as delicious as you want to make them.  

They even have a few dessert burgers where a doughnut serves as the bun.  Originally, they only had one and it wasn't anything great to me.  Since then, they have added a few more options that I have yet to try.  Their milkshakes are delish as well.

I usually make my own burger, but last time I ordered the sliders and they were very good.  It was a perfect choice when you're not hungry enough for a big burger.  The sliders are three mini burgers that are each different.  I'll definitely order that again.

Time and time again, this is a great place and always has something for everyone, carnivores and herbivores alike.  I'm not sure about the vegan folks though...  They do get super busy and I would highly recommend making a reservation.  Roll up your sleeves, head to the Burger Bar and see who can build a better burger!",3,0,3

Angela suggested this place telling me she had heard it was one of the best burger places in Vegas. It's also got one of the most expensive burgers in the States. So we came meeting a friend of hers who also brought his own friend.

I got a bite of everything and actually I've uploaded a pic of my receipt. So you can see exactly what we ordered. I got the $60 burger and had them cut it into 4 pieces so we all had a bite. Angela got their spicy lamb burger, the other two ordered a peppercorn and salmon burger. I actually got a bite of all them. 

Lamb burger was overcooked. Almost well done, a medium at best. Was incredibly disappointing. Not good at all and I like lamb burgers. So don't order your lamb burger anything less then medium rare. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend any beef burger less than medium rare.

The salmon burger was overcooked. Wasn't too impressed with this also. I mean both this and the lamb were like 2 stars to me, would not ever order them again. The peppercorn on the other hand was outstanding. Really strong fresh peppercorn and it's super tasty. Really liked it a lot.

Ok, so the $60 burger. The beef was cooked perfectly. Just really, really excellent and tasty. The truffles, excellent. Burger also get serves with truffle oil on the side which you should absolutely pour on top and it so enhanced the flavor of everything. So what was its weakness? The foie gras. Not enough of it. Angela has never had foie gras and she told that she couldn't taste it. Not a good sign. I'm practically French and have eaten a ridiculous amount of different types of foie gras. Yeah, certain foie gras can have an incredibly powerful taste and overwhelm anything else if too much is used and eaten at once. This burger did not have this kind of foie gras. I could physically see the foie gras and even I could barely taste it. Seriously disappointing in this but other than this, a great burger. Worth $60. No, definitely not. Maybe a $30-40 burger. Maybe, though honestly I don't think I'd ever order this burger again. I'd encourage someone else to give it a try but I'd be good.

So what really was the gem of evening? You can not only customize your burger and make any 100s of different permutations of different types of burgers here, you can also customize your own shake! This includes beer floats! But what's the true sign of a real milkshake connoisseur? I'll show you how you make a shake. So I told our waitress that whomever makes the milkshake, to customize me one. I was going to leave it to their imagination and experience. I said I'd eat anything and wasn't allergic to anything. The only thing was that I didn't want anything boring but a shake of all shakes. So it turns out, there's a guy who's dedicated to just making the shakes! How awesome is that. When he came out with my shake it was beautiful. And this is the real reason why I posted up my receipt so you can see what he put in it. I boxed my shake with a black pen so take a look! This alone will make Burger Bar a special place for me.

So overall not a bad eating experience at all. I'd definitely come back anytime.",1,0,0

The burger was amazing. Cooked perfectly medium with a  pink center, and quite juicy. The burger and toppings were perfectly sized to each other and the bun, which is something you don't often see.

The concept is that you choose a base burger (3 kinds of beef, lamb, turkey, garden, etc), one of five buns, and then pile on your choice of about 40 toppings at extra cost, ranging from homemade beet pickles to a half lobster or a fried egg.  The $60 Rossini burger (with foie gras, sliced black truffles, and madeira sauce) is something to try at least once and the $16 regular Kobe burger is good too.  Knowledgeable and courteous waitstaff, great ingredients.  A real temple of burger-dom.  Only two reason for four stars instead of five are: 1) bar concept though ineeds work and better mixed drinks (but does have 24 beers on tap); and 2) prices a little high, and really, after all that it's still a hamburger.",2,2,1

The setting of the Burger Bar is simple and traditional, with the exception of small tv's on the wall of every booth. The tv's aren't of any particular interest, they had only two channel, sports and one that displayed some facts about the music currently playing.

Service was exceptional. Our server was very pleasant and attentive, even with the busy lunch crowd.

As for the food it was simple, but it was very good. They have a large variety of shakes, and the mmHg nutella shake was delicious.

I had the buffalo burger in the plain bun. The meat portion was generous and not really seasoned, which allowed for the buffalo meat's strong flavor to be the focal pount. My wife had the chicken sandwich and the chicken was tender and juicy.

The onion rings we were unimpressive, very traditional and bland. 

In addition to the onion rings , the only other complaint is the upcharge for additions like cheese and bacon, only because the burgers are so expensive to begin with. With an $18 price tag for a burger, having to pay extra for a slice of cheddar or a couple of slices of bacon seemed like a silly cash grab.",0,0,0

Still, given the opportunity a few days ago to stop in there for lunch I didn't hesitate. Besides, I didn't have any quality pictures to post until that point.  Because I've been here so many times I was almost nervous that I would give this restaurant preferential treatment, but since I've been taking a way more analytical approach to my burgers lately I found that Burger Bar wasn't quite the perfection I remembered it.  But it was still close.

Located in the elusive Mandalay Place shopping area connecting Mandalay Bay and the Luxor, Burger Bar is placed amongst overly expensive clothing stores, men's shaving boutiques and some other more touristy shops of late. The restaurant has been there for quite a few years now and is maybe looking slightly dated, but it's still a good atmosphere. It's very open pretty much anywhere you sit, even in the booths, so don't go there if you're looking for a decent amount of privacy. Also if you're going on the weekend, or even potentially during a weekday lunch, expect a wait or try the bar.

Other than a small selection of slightly overpriced burgers, the menu is pretty much do-it-yourself. You have your choice of meats; Angus, country natural, Kobe and buffalo, along with chicken, salmon turkey and veggie if you're into that sort of thing. While the Kobe is totally delicious, I find it to be a bit expensive and have been completely happy ordering the Angus. But more on that shortly. Once you've chosen your meats, you have a very long list of choices for veggies, cheeses, meats, sauces and plenty of other fancy things. I've had quite a few different burgers over the years, and all of the toppings have been great.

For this particular meal I went with the Angus, Swiss cheese, and mushrooms on a sesame bun. Fairly simple, but that's fine because the meat always stands out as a great flavor on its own. One of the biggest things I can say about this restaurant is that however you order your burger it will always come out that way. Consistency is key, and they never disappoint. I ordered medium-rare, and it's as pink as it could be. And like I said, the meat really has great flavor, so whether you have a ton of toppings or almost none, you're guaranteed a great burger. After eating a lot of others around town lately, I could say that this burger might be lacking a bit of seasoning now, almost as if the burger is outdated like the restaurant. Still it is fantastic and won't disappoint.

The various buns I have had are always good, no matter which one you get there seems to be a proper meat to bun ratio. The mushrooms were flavorful, and just the right amount. My cheese was melted as always, the lettuce and tomato on the plate were also very fresh. I haven't always been a fan of pickles in the past, but they're growing on me with all these burger meals so now it's a welcome sight on my plate.

The fries are the one slight weak spot in this meal; my skinny fries were just ok, a bit too generic for such a fancy menu. The sweet potato fries have been really good in the past, especially with some ranch, although it's been a while since I've had them. I'm not always a fan of fat fries, but they're a little better here so you might want to try them when visiting.

My burger, fries and drink came to almost $19; I would consider that a bit on the high side if it wasn't in a very touristy spot on the strip. I'm not always too happy about spending that much on a burger meal anywhere, but compared to Bradley Ogden or even BLT this is a huge value for the same price. This place is still one of my favorite choices in town based on the burger alone, so do yourself a favor and check it out.",3,0,0

FOOD
Because it's Hubert Keller, I was expecting an ""elevated"" burger, which seems to be a trend amongst respected chefs.  My burger fit the bill.  I took advantage of the ""create your own burger"" option on the menu.  You can choose from three different types of beef (angus, nature source, or Kobe), lamb, or buffalo.  Then choose from six types of buns.  Then choose from a seemingly endless menu of cheeses, sauces, and additional items.  My creation: the naturesource patty with smoked gouda, bacon, fried egg, peppercorn sauce on a pretzel bun.  I ordered it ""medium"" and was told that Burger Bar's medium is red inside, not just pink.  This was an accurate description -- and perfect!  My particular burger did not come with sides, but if you order from a chef's creations section, fries are included.

One friend in my party had chicken wings (delicious).  Another ordered the ""Hubert Keller"" burger which was made with buffalo and served with skinny fries.  She enjoyed it.  Another friend created a ""healthier"" and enjoyed it (though she said he liked Burgr by Gordon Ramsey better; I have not been there, so I have no comparison.)

We ordered steak fries and fried pickles for sides.  Both were great.

They also pride themselves on their shakes.  We did not try these or any type of dessert.

AMBIENCE
It's...fine -- nothing elaborate or terribly unique.  Burger Bar is in the middle of the Mandalay Place shops, and it feels like a mall restaurant.  It's comfortable enough, but don't expect award-winning design or a ""cool"" vibe.

LOCATION
At the Mandalay Place shops between Mandalay Bay and Luxor.  If you're staying at either of these hotels, it's great and an easy walk.  For those going by car, I suggest using valet.  Easy.

PRICES
Fair.  I think my burger was about $20 with all my extra add ons.  If you add sides, a salad, and a drink, you could easily be at about $30 per person.

NUTSHELL
It's a good burger.  I've been to Holstein's at the Cosmo up the strip, and it's comparable as far as quality and price (though Holstein's is more of an atmospheric destination.)  You'll enjoy Burger Bar...but expect to pay just a little extra than a typical restaurant burger.",0,0,0

For the picky (i mean discerning), you can also customized your own burger.  Starting with the patty options... 1) basic 2) niman or 3) the American Kobe beef.

Of course, you can also get sides of regular fries, steak fries, sweet potato fries (yum), onion rings, or anything else... just tell them to deep fry it.

I was pretty disappointed in the somewhat limp fries. They should come out more crisp. As a caloric  indulgence, I also got the Black & White milkshake. For $8, I really wish that there was more milk shake and less whipped cream! The glass is also very tall, skinny, and deceiving. You think you get a lot of milkshake, but you really don't.

The hostess said she'd already called our name and that she'd call it again later when a table opened up. 

Fair enough -- it was our fault for wandering off. She called another name ""party of [same amount of people we are],"" again, again; obviously this mystery party of 4 was not around. 

I said ""we could take the place of the  people you're calling, you know."" To her credit, she got it and seated us in one of the several empty booths (so, is anticipation part of the dining experience or is there some seating system whose logic eludes me to this day?).

This place leaves most gourmet burger places in the dust. With its various choices to build your own burger.. to the chef's signature burgers... it's not your typical burger place... definitely and certainly not.

Last year, I selected the Hubert Keller burger which was a buffalo burger with caramelized onions, baby spinach, and blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. It was delicious however there was one burger that stood out on the menu that I was hesitant to try at first. The $60 Rossini.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I decided to test out this burger to see what the whole hype was about... to see if a burger would be even worth that much to me. What crazy person would pay that much for a burger and why??

Well.. nonetheless I was curious and crazy enough to do it. I must say, though I can see how some people may not find the Rossini not not be worth the exuberant amount they ask for..... 

I found it to be utterly delightful!! From the juicy tender kobe beef patty, to the foie gras and black perigord truffles.. I was difficult for me to find myself eating a regular burger after having taken a bite out of this burger. The madeira sauce complimented the burger wonderfully and going halfway into the meal.. I just thought to myself.. I just ate $30 worth of food right there.. and as I contemplated if this whole meal was worth the money and hype.. I decided that the answer was a definitive and crazy, YES.

As I waited, I noticed that the restaurant looked like a comfy burger joint, with booths and tables. The booths each had a mini flat screen so you can watch while you eat. There are two bar areas, for those who do not want to wait for a table. Take a seat at the bar if you are hungry and want to be served immediately.

Personally, I prefer sushi over burger but this place was recommended by the Tap Out store down the shopping plaza off of Mandalay Bay. I had to try it out for myself. 

My friends and I went there on a Sunday night around 6:30pm right at Happy Hour time. The place was packed but we're able to sit ourselves at the bar. The bartenders were very nice even though we only wanted food. Fast services, friendly, and ultra good looking guys delivering your food are a plus!! 

The surrounding was like any burger and pub joint lotsa plasma and booth TVs playing the pre-season football.

On to the food: I had a Blackjack Burger cooked to medium. But came out medium rare, acceptable not too red. Quite tasty. Crispy fries just like McDonald long and skinny!! Delicious pickle to go with your burger. 

I really wanted to try the $5.75 Sweet Burger topped with Krispy Kreme dount, but my stomach had been filled with the ultra delicious under $15 burger. It's absolutely a steal for Vegas dining!!

Next time, I hope to try the ultimate $60 Rossini burger with Foie Gras and Black Truffles!! Sounds mouth watering...?? I bet it is...

Totally recommended!!",0,0,0

There's a set menu of burgers, but you can still customize your burger if you want. There is a varied selection of proteins for your burger, the sides are solid, the beer list is lengthy, and you can customize a shake or sundae for dessert. It's usually busy and on a wait, so service is usually relevant to the time you dine.

Our party of five came when they lifted the gate at 11 AM on Mother's Day. We had a reservation via Open Table, but didn't need it. The restaurant though was at capacity by the time we left. We sat in one of the booths which are each equipped with their own television. Service was sufficient as our server wasn't too busy. The kitchen was timely most likely for the same reason. Their efficiency also included the food runner, who was aware of seat numbers and brought the food to each of us describing the dish without having to inquire who ordered it.

I've had the Austarlian Wagyu burger on my last visit and it was delicious and quite memorable. This time, I ordered the Hubert Keller Burger ($24.85) which they were able to keep the lean buffalo meat juicy. The portion of blue cheese wasn't too large and overpowering and the red wine shallot reduction added to the depth of flavor with an acidic note. The skinny fries were hot with crispy exterior crunch. I did miss on the beer pairing as my Firestone Union Jack IPA was a little too high in the IBU units. That's my bad and I'll get it right next time. Also ordered was an angus burger, a turkey burger, the burger bar sliders, and a chicken caesar salad. I had a bite of my wife's angus burger and it was still juicy even though she ordered it well done (she should be punished accordingly for ordering her burger at that temp). Next time, I'll have to try the lamb.

Pricing is expected for a gourmet burger joint on the Strip with alcohol ordered. Before tip, our bill was $133. If the third visit is as good as my first two, then I'll have to put Burger Bar at the top of the list.",3,1,3

Personalen var trevlig och lokalen var fräsch, lite som en finare Friday's. Det går att beställa färdiga burgar-set eller komponera själv. Ölutbudet är mycket bra. 

Valde en classic. Den bestod av ett  sesam sprinkler bröd (tänk er de klassiska torra hamburgarbröden vi har fått växa upp med innan de började poppa till sig med Brioche o dylikt). Vid sidan om på tallriken var det sallad, tomatskiva och en skiva lök. Kött-pucken var en handgjord puck om ca 150g med bacon och ost på. Köttet var av Angus typ. Dessvärre var den väldigt milt kryddad och stekningen hade inte ger den någon Maillard effekt över huvudtaget, nästan  mera kokt. (för låg temperatur på stekbordet?) 

Mina kollegor som inte äter fläsk bad att få byta ut baconet mot extra skiva ost vilket gick bra. På notan visade det sig att det räknats som en extra order och ökat notan med ytterligare 1$ på deras respektive burgare. Detta var inget de informerat om när de beställde. Riktigt uselt!

Shared with a friend, and it was not only filling but DEEELICIOUS. It came with a dessert burger which I ordered the cheescake burger and that was also delicious.

The Rossini Burger was a lot smaller than I expected but it was soo good.  The way to order the burger is rare.  Hands down.  Its the only way to enjoy the true flavor of the meat.  The burger came with this delicious sauce and truffle salt and freshly ground pepper.   Heres what you do. Add the tomato and the bean sprouts to the burger, sprinkle some truffle salt (aka CRACK) on the meat, pour some of that sauce, and take a heavenly bite.  Totally worth the money.  However since I'm not rich, I probably wouldn't order it again.  It was a great once in a lifetime experience and everyone should have in Vegas!

Let's list the pros and the cons. List are a lot more fun.

PRO:
It's a cool concept, pick your protein. (Turkey, Beef, Salmon, Buffalo, etc.)
Lots of different toppings to choose from (from sprouts to lobster to truffles).
An extensive BEER and WINE list. They have beers from micro breweries around the country. 
Everything was fresh.

Cons:
The food was pretty bland. 
The service was sub-par. 
I was in a party of 6 and they included gratuity.
The places was LOUD.
The seating was cramped.
The hostesses were really rude.
Everything was overpriced (to be expected on the Strip).

Burger Bar is located in Mandalay Place. It is a trek to get to just eat. I was there on a busy Saturday night. We had to wait for everyone to get there before we were seated. The hostess was really rude about all of this too. 

We were seated in a booth that comfortably sat 6 people. Our waitress looked like she was juggling about  5 tables, one of which had about 20 people. She could really use a hand.

I ordered a veggie burger, which was quite bland and really need some spice and seasoning. I added grilled onions and guacamole and opted for a whole wheat bun. I ordered a side salad, which was $2.55 for some field greens and a balsamic vinaigrette. A bunch of my friends ordered the sweet potato fries, which are yummy, but they were't any better or any worse than I've had before. Again, nothing spectacular.

In all honesty, I would have been much happier with a Double-Double from IN-N-OUT.

I usually go for the buffalo, always medium rare and always right on target.  If a restaurant has buffalo on the menu, I'm going to order it.  it's the way beef SHOULD taste! it's worth the few extra shekels.

the skinny fries are great, as is the fried zucchini.  hey, it's a burger bar, order something fried!

their beer selection is awesome and they have a couple of really great stouts and ales tucked away in a special cooler.  ask your friendly neighborhood bartender for what's good.  I tracked one of these ales down in England and found a way to get it to me here in Cali.

If you are in vegas or staying at Luxor or Mandalay Bay, give it a shot for lunch.  btw...the seating at the bar is first come, first served, so if the wait for a table is too long, just hover around the bar and see who is finishing up.

Burgers come with the normal fixings of lettuce, tomatoe and onion, if you want to order any extras like bacon or cheese, there is a charge.  Burgers range anywhere between $10-60.  Damn, I can't imagine getting a burger for $60, but to each their own!  

I get my angus burger on ciabatta bread and order bacon to be added.

The location is conveniently inside Mandalay Bay. We were there around 11:30am and walked right in, but the night before there was about an hour wait for dinner time. We were seated at a booth table which feels very private because the booth walls go very high up. You also get your own TV at the table so you can enjoy the game.

With my Bloody Mary already in hand, I was in heaven reading over this menu. We decided to keep it semi light and split their wedge salad with the Hubert Keller Burger substituted with Zucchini Fries. It was all delivered hot and quickly. Great flavors, burger actually cooked to proper temperature and waitress put up with our random little requests throughout our meal.

Couldn't we hit them with some butter? 

When you come to a place like this & pay more for a strip location & a well known chef your expectations are high. Mine are because Keller is a master. I absolutely love his show on PBS & watch it every weekend! Not only does his food look amazing but he's such a fun & interesting person to watch. The French accent also works :)

So my burgers kind of sucked. My skinny fries were good. Luckily the ladies in my group seemed to enjoy their burgers & I should have just ordered a burger. But the sliders should be great and honestly they don't deserve 3 stars but I'm giving it because my prior experiences were good and I'm hopeful someone in the kitchen will taste them & improve on them. 

With that said, there's a reason why Keller is where he is and has so many great spots and I'm not taking anything away from him. Maybe I had an off night, not sure. The service was great. They were packed. Overall a fun time for everyone in the party except my sliders.",17,12,16

Whether you fancy an ultra-luxe $60 burger or if you prefer your burgers a little more spartan, Burger Bar can fulfill your needs. 

Give your burger the ultimate treatment and choose from a dizzying array of toppings, including pan-seared foie gra, black truffles, lobster, large shrimp, homemade chili, prosciutto, fried eggs, jalapeño bacon and more. 

After tossing a few options back and forth, I decided to go with the Hangover Burger --certified angus beef smothered in hangover sauce, chopped lettuce and served with fat fries. My friend ordered the same burger but the gluten-free version with sweet potato fries. We both relished every bite and lapping up all the hangover sauce with their tasty fries. 

The birthday girl choose the Hubert Keller Burger, which comes with buffalo, carmelized onions, baby spinach and blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. This namesake burger comes with a beautiful red wine shallot reduction sauce and many sides of hefty smiles. 

And don't forget about ordering one of their signature milkshakes or choose from a staggering 60 ingredients to custom build your own milkshake. I had the Cowboy Milkshake -- whiskey and chocolate ice cream topped with chocolate marshmallows. It's very rich, almost like a chocolate mousse, so prepare yourself for one decadent treat. 

Menu highlights include the American Kobe beef, buffalo, veggie, salmon, surf 'n turf burger with black angus and lobster tail. The Rossini Burger ($60) features wagyu beef foie gra and shaved truffles on an onion bun.

Whether true or not she had the kids in her back pocket.

My wife ordered the low carb burger both times.  Being a carb addict I didn't want to admit it, but it was better than my first attempt at build a burger.  The token salad on the side had amazing dressing, my guess is there are truffles.  The low carb facade was thrown out the door when she ordered the Twinkie shake.

I wasn't expecting anything gargantuan (I mean, they are sliders), but the sliced pickle was literally the same circumference as the pattie. Okay, I'll give you that not every slider can be the same size as one served on a Hawaiian roll, but the thing that bothered me most was that the bun was a bit hard (by design) and dry. Just about every quality slider I've ever come across has a soft bun. The others in our group seemed to have average things to say about the burgers. 

Heads up, the fried pickles are pickle spears, not slices. 

They have several cuts and varieties of fries. The skinny fries had good crispness but not a ton of flavor. The onion rings were spot on. Great crunch, batter to onion ratio, and used an actual onion.

- Macaroni & Cheese Croquets: Fried Macaroni & Cheese. Do you really need to ask why this is so amazing? 
- Zuchini Fries: Yum. I'm always looking for something different than the standard fries. These always hit the spot
- Fat AND Skinny Fries: I really like that they give you a choice, cause I feel like everyone has a preference!
- Buffalo Burger: Flarvorful, Juicy, something DIFFERENT than the standard Angus
- Lamb Burger: The spices they use really bring out the flavor of the lamb. It's the perfect amount of spicy. Again, something different that actually competes with the angus
- Angus: Great quality of meat!! Flavorful, juicy, and always cooked just the way you order it. I perfer mine Medium, with a little pink, and it's always perfect!

I also like that you can build your burger with whatever sounds good that day. I love blue cheese and bacon, with the aioli. The caramelized onions, or simply how it come. OH, and the ciabatta bun is what I always put it on. Chewy, soft, and toasted. Always compliments the burgers to perfection.

THE SALTED CARAMEL MILKSHAKE. Yes, save room, cause this is what I always want to come here for! OMG, split it with your table, or keep it to yourself, either way this is my favorite thing ever.

My friend ordered the veggie burger which was big, but delicious. I ordered the chicken sandwich with spinach and pineapple. Excellent, and had a cider and fries to go along. Definitely get a booth which has a personal tv for you sports fans or sit by the bar.

We walked around, gambled a little bit and came back in about 20 minutes, they called a few names but no one showed up so we were able to get a seat pretty quick.

I am a burger fan and Burger Bar really hits the spot when you are craving for one.  The menu offers some already constructed burgers, but the fun part is the ability to ""build your own burger.""  Whether it's fancy kobe beef burger with fois gras and truffles for about $60 or a black angus burger for $10, it is satisfying that the big burger you order will be cooked to perfection with the toppings you want.  I ordered a burger with jalapeno bacon, portabello mushrooms and pepper jack cheese on an onion bun, it was delicious.  

The burger doesn't come with fries so we ordered onion rings, fat fries, and shoestring buffalo fries for an addtional cost.  They were alright, I would prefer some seasoning on my fries and they were a little dry.  I've had better.

But overpaying for food of humble origins is just part of that Vegas thing for good or ill and I have long made peace with it. The place is accurate in it's name as a bar because the size of the place I feel plays a factor in the long lines. Vegas is about huge volumes of people and this place is smaller then allot of restaurants around the strip so planning accordingly goes a long way to starving less. Personally I say what breaks this place apart from great places I have had burgers is not so much that its miles better. But rather the options to assemble your perfect burger is staggering and the possible combinations equally so. Think of it as your one shot to make a burger in your image and then devour it like a hungry god and you get the idea of this place.

The bf and I made this our first stop when we got to Vegas. We (aka ""me"") also wanted to try one of their dessert burgers, so we decided to split a Kobe burger and then split the Cheesecake burger. 

We got the Kobe burger, cooked medium, without any toppings *partially because we wanted to see the no frills version, partially because we just couldn't pick what to put on it*, and with a side of zucchini fries. There is a charge for splitting the plate, but they warn you ahead of time and make sure all the dressings *lettuce, tomato, onion* are provided for both burger halves. 

I didn't realize no toppings literally meant nothing on the burger. It was a patty and a bun. Add the dressings to preference. No condiments on the burger already. After dressing my burger, I was ready to put some ketchup on my burger, but my bf reminded me that ""real"" burgers don't use ketchup. I took a bite, and was glad I didn't ruin it with ketchup. The meat was juicy enough that it didn't need ANYTHING. I probably would have eaten the patty by itself. I secretly regretted splitting the burger with the bf. I bet he did too. The zucchini fries were great too. Cut thinner than I usually see, and not soggy at all. Fried goodness. 

I didn't expect too much from the cheesecake burger. I knew it was just a gimmick, but that's okay. I wanted to try the cute little donut burger. It was surprisingly good! The cheesecake was more like a mousse, and the drizzled some raspberry syrup on it as well.

I started off with the Lindeman's Framboise, which I think is a beer, but it tastes like Izze and is alcoholic, so even better.  BF had some kind of IPA - big draft selection.  Drink selection a-ok.

Then came the burgers - a buffalo burger for me, and surf & turf for him.  Burgers were excellent, cooked to the right medium rareness.  Fries & onion rings were perfect too.  No oily fries or loose onions after a bite.  Only complaint is that presentation was nonexistent. (I don't like seeing white on my plate unless it's done artistically.)  I also stuffed myself with the Chocolate Burger for dessert.  With donut buns, chocolate ganache meat, jello cheese, strawberry tomatos and mint lettuce, it sounded heavenly.

In short, I don't recommend it.  Eating this became too much of a chore.  When you have to resort to pulling out a knife and fork to eat a burger, you're putting in more work than necessary.  It can all be blamed on a lack of a bun.  Using two portabello mushrooms to mimic a bun sounds good in theory, but is outright disastrous when executed.  Vegetarians at least have one other option, the Chef's Veggie Burger, which sounds more safe (i.e., less messy).

Because of their quality ingredients, classy styling, and multitude of options, Burger Bar is on a whole 'nother level, and can't be compared to typical burger joints.  Had it not been for their excellent sweet potato fries, the rating would've been a solid three.

Everything was pretty standard. My friend got the Hubert Keller burger, and honestly, for all of the bells and whistles it came with (carmelized onions, bleu cheese, red wine and shallot sauce), it was pretty bland. 

I built my own burger with an egg and pancetta, and while the pancetta was perfect, my burger again, left a lot to be desired. It was just a flavorless hunk of meat, and with the thickness of the patty, it's an awful lot of blandness to process. Eating these burgers felt more like work than an enjoyable dining experience.

We ordered the appetizer sampler with plenty of fried goodies and a five-sauce sampler, and while the sauces were great (we kept them to flavor our burgers a bit more later), the appetizers themselves tasted like they were thawed out staples that you could pick up at any grocery store. In fact, I'm pretty sure I've purchased the fried macaroni and cheese triangles that we were served at Target. 

We ordered alcoholic milkshakes as well, and again, were pretty disappointed by the flavor. Super thick, and while we both ordered different types (the french kiss and the chocolate cowboy), they both just tasted like chocolate.

Okay, so we found this place in a Japanese guide book and we were worried that it might not still be around... so we schlepped out there and arrived to find the place was hopping. We didn't have to wait too long to get a seat.

The menu at this place is amazing. Basically, you construct a burger with whatever toppings you want. And they have pretty much everything. It was everything I could do not to go hog wild and make the most expensive burger known to man, so I went with a spicy buffalo theme. I ordered the buffalo (delicious cow like animal) and got jalapenos and pepper jack, the fried zuccini, and a chocolate banana shake (not on the menu, but they made it anyway). The wife had salmon.

I was in burger heaven. I mean, it was really one of the best burgers I've ever had in my entire life. The wife wasn't enjoying her salmon and so she wasn't too pleased. She was happier when I gave her the rest of my shake though (cause it was soooo good).

Anyway, one little detail that I thought was awesome was that when my jalapenos came, there were picked ones and fresh ones. And they had ketchup, mustard, and A1 sauce at every table.

So, in the end, the waitress was kind of a bitch, but this random other dude kept helping us out, so we left her a little tiny tip and gave the random dude some gambling chips, and we were off.

Coming from Chicago which really has such excellent burgers, nothing overly mind blowing about the American Classic burger except the juiciness of the beef and that the overall burger kind of melts in your mouth. However , I was expecting a bigger cut of meat and perhaps a bit more flavor in the meat. It was a little bland and needed more pepper.  And the fries...ive definitely had better...ugh!

I also give 2 to 3 stars for beer selection on tap! At first i was like ""oh wow, they have a large selection of beers on tap."" I had the 6 beer sampler and only liked only 1!  (keep in mind i'm a picky beer drinker and i like microbrews and non domestics  such as Guinness.) This place seems to cater more to light beer lovers, as opposed to dark beer lovers.  

The amber beer  was the best of the 6 and we really liked! So tasty and  good for dark and light beer drinkers! On tap, the flavor is balanced and bursts in your mouth with complexity. 

The rest of the beers were very ordinary. The Oktoberfest was not what i was expecting- light and hoppy. The Kona Porter had the texture and smoothness of Guinness but no flavor really. The rest of the beers tasted like budweiser  or just too hoppy and light for my tastebuds.

There are two options when ordering your burger.  You can order pre-assembled burgers where the ingredients are chosen for you, but there are no substitutions if you go this route.  Or you can order the patty and toppings individually to create your own customized burger.  I chose to create my own burger.  I ordered the cheapest patty (relatively speaking) which cost $8.95.  My toppings included pepper jack cheese, avocado, and cinnamon bacon.  My husband ordered the Kobe burger which cost twice as much as my ""cheap"" patty.  The Kobe beef burger is NOT worth the extra cost.  Between the el cheapo patty and the Kobe, go with the el cheapo.

Fellow Yelper Mike L. mentioned he got a free dessert with the Kobe burger, however, we didn't get a dessert, nor were we offered or aware of one. 

The zucchini fries were excellent!  Crispy and hot!

My husband also order a Sierra Mist with a shot of peach syrup.  This drink was so sweet that one sip would rot your teeth.  After a sip of this sugary concoction, my Coke tasted like water.

Our waiter was a bit on the cranky side.  He was very robotic when it came to taking our orders and seemed agitated when we asked for ranch with our zucchini fries.  Perhaps he was a little disgruntled because he had to work on a Saturday night...

Grand total for burgers, fries, and drinks (sodas) for two at the Burger Bar came to $53.00 with tax and tip.  OUCH!

The Burger Bar is great for the upscale clientele who craves the ""poor man's palate"" of burgers and fries.  For burgers, I'll stick with Red Robin.",1,0,1

Everything on the menu is completely customizable - you pick your meat, type of bun, toppings and fries.  It ends up being about $12+ for your meal (depending on what you choose).

Instead of the regular fries, ordered the sweet potato fries.  My friend ordered the Kobe Burger and Onion Rings and an Alcoholic Mint Shake.  Overall, we felt that the meal was just so-so.  My burger was pretty much your typical burger with cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, etc. His burger was a little more tender than mine, but still nothing to rave about.  His shake was supposed to have alcohol in it, but who knows if there was any actually in there.  You cant really go wrong with a Fat Tire. 

When we went, it was about dinner time, so they were pretty crowded.  We were told there was about a 20 min wait, unless we wanted to sit at the bar.  We were starving so we elected to sit at the bar only to walk to the back to find that the only seats open were the last 2, one of which is IN the walkway for the servers to get to the kitchen.  We ended up sitting there, where we noticed that almost the whole back half of the restaurant was empty.  Apparently they werent seating in that area because they didnt have enough servers.  That sucks.

One good thing about this place was conveniently located in a mall, so you can walk off all the food you just ate, or browse the shops while you wait for your table.  This is your typical burger and beer place, and I probably wouldnt recommend the alcoholic shakes.  Id stick to the regular shakes for half the price.  Another good thing about this restaurant is that you can build your burger however you want it.

I got the buffalo burger and my husband got the nature source beef burger. The meat was good. We got it well done and the meat is still juice. My husband also got the pretzel bun and he liked it. I had the plain bun and it was good in a way that it is not the soggy kind. I asked for no pepper and no seasoning on my buffalo meat and they were able to accommodate that. I like my meat plain, that is just how I prefer. I usually feel that seasoned meat doesn't taste good as it masked the real meat taste.

The only thing we didn't like as much was the shake. We shared the salted caramel and it really tasted salty. I know we should have expected that it is salty but didn't anticipate that it would be salty enough to make me feel thirsty! It was like after eating msg! The shake does have a secret sauce called "" Fleur de sel"" in it and I don't know if that sauce contain any msg or fermented soy as my throat was terribly dehydrated and very thirsty after the shake. The toffee syrup in the shake for sure contributed to its saltiness too. After we went home, I had to eat an avocado and a plum which were high in potassium to counteract the trauma. I usually eat high potassium food as a remedy if I accidentally eat food with msg or high sodium. So if you can't handle sodium well, don't order the salted caramel shake, try another flavor instead.

The burgers were satisfactory but it is not a ""wow"" yet so we can only give 3 stars here. Especially when we know another burger place serving naturesource beef meat as well, and they can accommodate no seasoning and I think that this other place grills the meat better too. Burger Bar is very pricey too when considering the size of the meat they offer on the burger, so one time try at Burger Bar is enough for us. It is not the place for us to go back again if we have a crave for burger or shake in the future, there are better options in town.",0,0,0

We walked up at 8pm on a Tuesday and found that it was a 45 minute wait for a table. However their bar seating goes all the way to the back of the restaurant (pretty long) and we were able to find seats at the end of the bar. 

We ordered 

Fried pepper jack ""shots""\/ breaded cheese balls that are breaded and fried. They were crisp and the cheese inside was soft but not too oozy. The flavor was solid but towards the end of the dish it became apparent that it was just cheese. I love cheese so for me that was a plus, but be prepared for a lack of flavor development. 

""Naturesource"" (I think free range) Patty, onion bun, carmelized onions, foie gras\/ the foie gras add on was an extra $13, making this burger run around $26. I was splitting with my husband and they split the plates without us asking but then also charged us a $2 split plate fee. 

The foie gras was about a third of a full one, which for $13 isn't bad. I actually removed it from my burger so I could taste it on its own. The patty was too thick for the foie.. I would recommend adding the truffle sauce ($5) as this dish was a little on the dry side without. The onions were carmelized beautyfully, and the patty was perfectly cooked.

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE foie gras, I LOVE kobe beef, and I LOVE truffles....but quoting from a friend of mine, ""you can combine platinum, silver, and gold together and it'd probably end up looking like shit.""  That basically describes the $80 burger here.  Man and with that amount of money, I could've gotten myself probably 10 White Castle crave cases.  

I didn't get a chance to try any of the other burgers.  They do have a wide selection, and one of my friends ordered one of the cheaper burgers and he seemed perfectly fine with it.  So I suggest if you're going to go here, stick with a more traditional burger.

When the plates hit the table, the fries we piping hot (two hot to eat), but the burger was just lukewarm and relatively flavorless.  My suspicion is the cook let the burger sit waiting for the fries he waited too long to drop to finish cooking.  

When the waitress asked me how everything was, I told her ""It's alright.""  What a mistake that turned out to be.  I should have just smiled politely and said ""great.""  When she offered to get me another burger or whatever, I told her I didn't want to make a fuss or get something else.  She didn't listen.  Before I know it, the manager is standing over me explaining how they prepare the vaunted buffalo burger, how they sell about 800 regular hamburgers a day compared to only 20 buffalo burgers and take extra care preparing the buffalo burger, and how customer satisfaction is very important to him and to the server.

I know what you're thinking: ""No f-ing way.""  Well, that's fine.  I used to be like you: uneducated, unknowing.  Unenlightened.  And then I went, and my eyes were opened to the top of the burger world.

First, you gotta choose your meat: you can get Angus, Kobe, hell, even Buffalo and Vegetarian.  Then you choose your toppings, and this is where the fun starts.  You like lobster?  Bam!  Throw it on top of your Kobe burger.  You like shrimp?  Bam!  Throw it on top of your Buffalo burger.  You like lobster AND shrimp?  Bam!  You're crazy.  But you can throw both of them on top of your Angus.  They've got different kinds of bacon, different kinds of lettuce, cheese, mushrooms... hell, they even have shaved truffles, which launches your burger into the price stratosphere.  Somehow, everything is cooked so well that it all goes together, even if you've got a Vegetarian burger topped with eggs, asparagus, and applewood bacon.

Then you have sides.  They have a great selection of those, too.  Normal fries, sweet potato fries.... they're wonderfully crisp with just enough of the potato matter.  My personal favorite is the fried zucchini; way better than anything you'll get at a carnival or random schmuck burger joint.

The decor is pretty nice; it's sort of like a gentrified sports bar.... that occasionally serves $65 burgers with truffles.  But it's comfortable, warm and inviting, with tons of wood bars, tables, and booths.  I haven't really had a chance to try the beers, as I think I'm usually too busy stuffing my face.

They have pretty much anything you can think of for your burger. Start out with beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, or many other types of meat. Add whatever cheese and toppings. Then you get to pick your bun from many options (pretzel, wheat, potato, etc). Once you have your burger you have the option for many different types of sides (fries, sweet potato fries, fried zucchini, etc). There are so many options you could get something different every time you come here, even though it is pretty much just burgers. I think they do have a few salads if there are people in your group that would prefer something other than a burger.

My hands were practically shaking at the thought of yummy sweet potato fries *adores* 

What I Thought: So not pretentious! With a chef as famous as Hubert Keller, you'd think the place as a stench of snobbery to it, but it doesn't all. Very casual, elbows on the table can we get you meat and beer type joint. The servers were too slow for my taste and didn't check in on us but one time. it would've gotten 5 stars had it not been for that 

Who I Dragged Along: Ros and our Mommy (yea, i still say Mommy) 

Atmosphere: Clean, modern, dark wood, dimly lit with TVs at the booths with some sort of football game on. 

Price: Our bill including tip came out to be $55 or so 

What We Ate: My mommy is a semi-vegetarian and she said their veggie burger was seriously the best thing she ate during our Mother\/Daughter's weekend in Vegas. Unfortunately she refused to get onion rings since she's against all things fried. 

Me: turkey burger on sesame with sauteed portebello mushrooms, provolone cheese (for extra stringy cheesy goodness), bacon (pork fat ftw!!!), lettuce, tomatoes, onions with a side of sweet potato fries and chipotle aoili for dippin 

Mommy: Veggie burger on Wheat with lots of hot sauce, mustard, ketchup, lettuce, tomatoes and onions.. and ate of our plats of fries 

Ros: black angus burger with Cheddar, bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, onions with a side of skinny fries 

Shared: chocolate burger for dessert (yummmm, dark chocolate goodness) 


Parking: We walked over from MGM, but its Vegas, there's parking everywhere! 

Would I Come Back: Next time I'm in Vegas.. sho nuff! I hope Hubert opens one in the Bay, that would rock sooo hardcore 

Did i miss anything?: Hubert Keller is one of my ultimate Chef crushes, being a wannabe chef myself i adore his culinary point of view plus.. its damn friggin great burgers!",0,1,1

I can't believe someone didn't snatch it up sooner.  This is world renown chef Hubert Keller's baby.  He has some great restaurants in Las Vegas including Fleur de Lys.  First impression of the Burger Bar is that it's laid out pretty simply and looks like a place I would enjoy coming to.  The staff was friendly.  The burgers were surprisingly not that special.  I expected a much higher quality burger coming from Chef Keller.  They were good, but not great.  Many better burgers are out there in Las Vegas.  This is a good place to go if you're already there and are craving a burger, but I wouldn't make a trip just to eat the burgers here.

- American Kobe Beef Burger: 3\/5 (meat was better than other patties, but lacking in flavor): 3\/5

- Skinny Fries: 3\/5
- Buttermilk Onion Rings: 4\/5 (good but not enough)

The sweet potato fries were cut thin and long, but its got a good balance between the crunch on the outside, and softness on the inside.

The coleslaw was thinly shredded, standard stuff.

Kobe beef burger which was great, came out perfect for med rare. Not too bloody not too well done. I kept it simple with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and NO SAUCE! Onion rings which where amazing and the Number 9 beer went great with this meal.

The next time I got a USDA organic beef burger. Pretty standard, except I threw on some blue cheese, caramelized onions, lettuce, and no other sauces. A-MAZING!!

Well, I wish I had never had gone.***

They have a funny system where you basically pick your choice of meat, an array of toppings, various buns, etc. I decided I didn't have enough brain power to do all that so I ordered the sliders. Everything initially tasted good but as the food cooled and our appetites were satiated, everything started tasting a bit off. I ended up not eating the buns for the sliders and stopped eating the fries. Even the wonderfully fried onion rings were weird.

They did have some burgers that you didn't have to do a thing but order like the foie gras burger ($60) but after explaining to my group what foie gras was, they all decided it was disgusting so I didn't get to order it.

But still, nothing was horrible. It just didn't seem to be worth the price (except for maybe my $15 22 oz Doc's Draft Pear Cider). However, one in our party really didn't like her food so the manager ended up taking 10% off our entire bill. That was very kind of them.

Late night you see a lot of drunks walking to and fro. This seems more like a frat\/ sports bar anything with the crowd seemingly made up of 80% guys. I did witness a waitress help a girl in an extremely short skirt to the restroom. She later stumbled back to her table with her skirt hitched almost up to her crotch. Oh wow.

Interesting combination to put asparagus, lobster, and a [perfectly cooked but underseasoned] burger together on a nice soft bun but how you can charge $25 for a burger and not even include a condiment is beyond me.  You have bottles of ketchup, mustard, and A-1 in front of you - which one of these would go well with a surf & turf burger?  None.  This thing was dying for a nice aioli or something which would have made it less dry and a whole lot more tasty.  Alas, no luck - and from a French chef no less where you would expect aioli to be readily available for the fries and everything.

The restaurant is crazy busy but has 2 long bar seating areas as well as quite a few tables.

Then you choose the bun, then the toppings, and then you pay an additional fee for thin fries, fat fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, zucchini sticks.  I went veggie burger.  For toppings, I went with avocado, colby jack, grilled onions, and oyster mushrooms.  To make up for the fact that a veggie burger costs about $2.00, they had two thick patties stacked on there.  It was actually really good.  I was impressed.  I had onion rings on the side, which were good as well, although, I think they were frozen...no big deal, this isn't a gourmet meal.

First of all, it's a little bit of a walking distance from the Mandalay Bay parking lot, but no more than 10 minutes to get there. Upon entering, it's darkly lit and has a trendy feel to it. All of the booths have a tv screen and our particular booth in the back had a plug for you to charge your items (be careful...it was on the side of the wall, so I feared my long hair would get caught on it). Good addition, bad place to put it. However, The booths can be very roomy- we sat 6 of us! 

Overall reaction: service was good, but as soon as it got busy, it was harder for servers to make their way around the tables because of overcrowding. 
Burgers were okay (I had the sliders, and my brother had the hangover burger). Not bad, but not amazing in terms of taste. However, there are some burgers on the menu that have a much higher price range, and if I could afford it that night, I'm sure those burgers would've been amazing!

Once we got seated, we had to go over the menu for about 15 minutes before we could figure out what to order. I'd highly recommend checking out their menu BEFORE you're seated, you'll want to build your own burger and they have a TON of options - it's like the Cheesecake Factory menu in size but only contains burger options and condiments. They have a nice selection of drinks as well.

I had been here about a year ago and tried their veggie burger. It sounds amazing. The description sounds like it was made specifically for me. However, the execution of the burger falls seriously short. It's way way WAAAAY to mushy. Ew. Not at all how a burger should be. I didn't care for it so I didn't order it when I came yesterday.
Yesterday, I ordered the salmon burger and zucchini fries. That ""burger"" my friends, was delicious. The only ""complaint"" I have, is they should have put a condiment on it. Either mayo, or some cool dill dip kinda sauce, that would have sooooooooo made it better. We were given so ranch dressing (or that!) for the fries, so I did put some on it. The zucchini fries were OK. They had some weird after taste that I think was a dried spice in the batter. Whatever it was, I didn't care for it. If they took that out, this would be 4 stars, all day long!
Now that I think about it, they have all these cool condiments you can add to your burger and sauces you can order for your fries. I should have read them and maybe got one for my burger. Now that I know it doesnt come with anything, I'll order one next time.
Price for a salmon burger, in Mandalay Bay, REASONABLE! Only $10.25....NOT bad at all! I was shocked it was so ""cheap"". Nothing on the strip is cheap, unless you find happy hour specials. I was definitely impressed with the burger itself and the place.
Service was great. Waitress was always checking on us and refilling our waters.

The timing has never been right as we rarely visit the strip but a few nights ago after taking my little brother to scope out some UFC fighters after the event at Mandalay bay we thought what better timing, kill 2 birds with one stone if you know what I mean. 

Menu is simple burgers can come from a burger menu where toppings are already picked for you with a set price or build your own. I Chose the option choose my protein and build my own burger. They have angus beef, buffalo,Kobe beef, even salmon and chicken and other options if meat isn't your thing. 


Build your own burger option can be kind of pricey if you're not careful each topping is an additional price. It can also be a bit much if you're drunk and can't decide or if you're like me and are very indecisive. It's best if you know what you like. 


My custom burger - Angus beef patty medium on a potato roll with grilled pineapple, pepper jack cheese and jalapeño bacon. Chipotle aioli on the side. 

The fiancé chose a angus beef patty medium on a sesame roll with Swiss and an over easy egg. 

Sides - skinny fries and jalapeño onion petals. 

My burger was juicy and flavorful. Peoperjac didn't add much heat like I thought and the jalapeño bacon tasted like regular bacon. The sweetness from the pineapple went well with the chipotle mayo. Overall I was happy with my burger. The fiancé however had a huge mess as the burger fell apart and he was left with a piece of burger with a yolky mess as everything fell apart and he ended up finishing it with a fork. He's not one to send back his food, because he thinks they'll tamper with it, so he did not want to say anything and just bit his lip about it. 

Skinny fries were standard fries and the jalapeño petals weren't spicy like I had hoped no kick at all. 

Overall service was a ok and my burger was great but I don't think my guy would like to come back to this place. After all we try to avoid the strip unless we have to go there. 3 stars since my juicy burger was the perfect way to curve my midnight munchies.",1,2,1

Saying this is an alternative to Fleur is like saying that a Hyundai with ""Ferrari"" spray painted on the hood is an alternative to a fine Italian automobile.

I was fully prepared to love this place.  Had the $60 burger.  Was with a companion that ordered the second most expensive burger.  Had a couple sides\/appetizers.

Again, not worth it.  The $60 burger is very good, but it's worth more like $25 or $30.  Most everything else?  Typical diner fare.  When I'm at a place that serves a 60 dollar burger, and numerous 16-23 dollar burgers, I don't expect to get appetizers out of a food service of America bag, but that's exactly what I got.  Mozzarella sticks at BB should not be the same ones you get at Denny's for 5 dollars. Period.  Eff this place.

Our service was really poor. The restaurant was 85-95% full at the tables, but there were seats at the burger bar. The server was slow to get around to take our order and just didn't seem like she wanted to be there or help us.

The zucchini fries were just okay. People were really all about them in reviews, but the breading wasn't much more than basic bar provolone stick breading. A few times the zucchini inside just slipped out leaving a sheath of uninteresting breading. Not awesome. The sweet potato fries were very good and the mac n cheese bites were good, but I seriously think it was just Kraft mac n cheese that was fried. That's not a complaint because I have a nostalgic fondness for that, and I have to say at least it was full of mac n cheese. Some fried mac n cheese I've had (like at state fairs) is mostly just breading.

For my burger, I was very undecided. I went with the natural source beef with brie, the red wine reduction sauce, mushrooms, and carmelized onions. It was appetizing and filling, but the bottom of my bun deteriorated. I went with the plain bun; maybe others are more substantial. I ended up eating the last half of my burger with a fork. Medium is more like medium rare. This doesn't bother me, but FYI in case you expect your burgers to be more cooked through.  

The TV in our booth was not in our control, though the server did get the staff to change it. The TV was beat up with a good 20% section of poor\/damaged pixels.

Our milkshake was the best part.

I got blue cheese, button mushrooms and asparagus as toppings.  The asparagus was the PERFECT  burger topping.  The blue cheese was big chunks and the perfect amount.  I would skip the mushrooms next time.  Just nothing to write home about.

I want what the ""house specialty"" is, but wasn't impressed by their list of standbys. Also, by making all the toppings ala carte, you can really inflate your check. 

I ordered the organic beef burger, which after cooked to my preference of medium well it could have been from a Kroger beef log and I wouldn't have known. So, it wasn't amazing beef. After my losing streak downtown the night before, no Kobe for me! Like I mentioned, the highlight of the sandwich was the jalapeno bacon where they cure the bacon in pickled jalapeno juice according the the waitress. The fried egg was cooked over medium when it was stated over easy. Bummer. Ala carte Sweet potato fries can be passed on. When one of my table mates ordered cheese fries, they actually just melt 3 slices of cheese onto your fries and then charge you for each slice of cheese. Hilarious!!! Fat Tire on tap made the boys happy. Iced tea was fresh and refreshing!

Ok, so this is one of those places that have one expensive burger ($60 rossini burger). No, that's not the one I tried although I'm thinking next time I might, just to see what a $60 burger taste like.

Anyway, we walked in and they sat us down right away. This is a very casual place, nothing extremely fancy. It's an upscale bar, very cool, looks like a great place to grab a drink, grab a bite and hang out.

We decided to split the Hubert Keller burger (his favorite according to the menu). The burger meat is buffalo and it comes with caramelized onions, baby spinach, and blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. It was pure heaven! The meat is very tasty and the bread is delightful. This comes with a side of skinny fries which we swapped for sweet potato fries and they were fantastic. This plate of one burger and a side of fries comes at a whopping $19.25. But we split it between two people and it was enough to fill us up.

I forget how I heard about this place, but it's been bookmarked for a long time. Since I'm staying in Mandalay Bay on this trip, I finally stopped by. 

Service:
- the hostesses and the server were all pretty cool 
- food took a lot longer than it should have to come out

Food:
- American Kobe Burger - Not Good. on the menu, this sounds really good, and it better be if they're charging 17 goddamn dollars for it. Ordered ours medium with American cheese. The reason the food took so long to come out was because the kitchen was burning it to an effing crisp! It would have been overdone even if it was ordered ""well done"". They also charged $2 to cut it in 1\/2 and bring it out in two plates even though we didn't ask 'em to. The burger we had from room service the night before was a lot better. Pretty much any burger I've had in the last few years (including fast foods) s**ts on this burger.
- Fry Sampler (Fat Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, Onion Rings) -  Very Good. Only used ketchup and ranch to dip. Probably the best fat fries I've ever had. Onion Rings were really impressive too. Sweet Potato fries were good, but not my thing. 

Misc:
- Nice setup, the booths have their own tv in the wall
- Your burger doesn't include fries on the side, you have to order that separately
- I was planning on coming back for the Buffalo Burger (that costs more than the Kobe), but after they fumbled our burger tonight....I'm not wasting my time\/money here again.",0,0,0

We also tried the peanut butter burger ($3.95) at the end of our meal.  It's a donut with peanut butter mousse, jelly and kiwi, built to resemble a hamburger.  It was different and was worth a try.

After getting a recommendation for this place from my Boss, the Hubs and I decided to give it a whirl during our recent getaway to Vegas.  The place was packed and there was an hour and a half wait... that tells you all you need to know. Not only is the food great, but the service we received from the bartenders was amazing.

For appetizer we shared the pepper jack cheese shots, which were basically fried cheese balls.  As one would guess, they were fabulous.  The only thing that would have made them better was some kind of sauce, but they were gone so fast there wasn't any time to get some!  For our entree, we shared the buffalo burger with blue cheese.  FABULOUS!  Having never tried buffalo before, we decided to be adventurous and give it a go... so glad we did.  It was moist and flavorful and the au jus it was served with was the perfect touch.  The fries, which it came with were really good as well.  We were offered dessert, but passed, however my Husband made a comment about the beer floats (thought it was intriguing) and the bartender proceeded to give us a free small sample.  It was soooo... good... raspberry beer with vanilla ice cream - it rocks!

The Burger Bar is located right where the Mandalay Bay shops meet the Luxor. You get a lot of really unique choices of burgers but the real highlight of the Burger Bar is that you can completely customize your burger any way you like.

You can choose from different types of beef (including Angus, Kobe and my favorite Buffalo) as well as salmon and chicken and a huge variety of additional toppings. 
The standard burger includes a choice of beef Kobe and Buffalo being the most expensive and succulent) along with lettuce, tomato, onion and dill pickle and your choice of bun (more than 7 choices if memory serves me correctly).

While the huge variety of toppings is tempting, keep in mind that you actually need to eat the burger and an additional 6 toppings will make a beef skyscraper that will require knife and fork to dispatch (not that there's anything wrong with that).

The burger is always cooked to perfection, I have tried both medium rare (my favorite) and medium and every time they were juicy, succulent and flavorful.

Their onion rings deserve a special mention, they are crisp and fried to perfection and you can still taste the actual onion inside them.

The Burger Bar also offers some generous milkshakes. My personal favorite is the caramel latte which also comes with 2 Graham crackers. Believe me, I work hard so I eat a lot and it's often difficult to finish  big burger and the milkshake...

The staff is friendly and attentive. 

On the negative side, the booths are just a bit cramped and the music is too loud for my senile worldview. Also depending on day and time there might be up to 30 minutes of waiting but that is expected for a restaurant on the Strip during rush hour.

Overall, the Burger Bar is an excellent place on the Strip to eat a juicy satisfying burger, made to your exact specifications without putting a huge dent on your wallet.",3,0,1

Pink Monkey: ($8.75) Strawberry Ice Cream, fresh Banana & Strawberries topped w\/Whipped Cream and added Malibu Banana (+$5.50)
Crabbie Shake: ($11.50) Crabbies Ginger Beer served with a scoop of Lemon Sorbet and shaved Candied Ginger

On this particular occasion we were here for happy hour. Service was great from start to finish. Pleasant and extremely attentive by several different servers and bartenders. The drinks were good as well. Prices were right and I stuck with the strawberry mojito on special while my fella got a beer as well as a mai tai that he enjoyed for the most part. The happy hour food was les than stellar. The wings were probably the highlight, but they were a little dry and lacking in any real spice. The chicken tenders were sad and were similar to ones we could get at Denny's. The sliders were the least appetizing of everything we ordered. Lacking in flavor and after one bite I wasn't interested in eating any more.

I have had some good burgers here in the past but nothing particularly noteworthy. I do remember enjoying their sides quite a bit and after a relatively lackluster happy hour we ended our meal with the cheesecake burger that ended up salvaging our whole dining experience.

The place is super loud & music is blaring so don't plan on talking to your neighbors... or even yelling.  They won't hear you

There was an impressive list of beers & we chose chocolate stout & a Killians red.

Veggie burgers all around w\/ a variety of fixings, all on pretzel buns.  I am loving the fact places now offer pretzel buns b\/c they rock!  

The patties were homemade but cooked on the same grill as their meaty selections - I mean come on!  There are a plethora of burger places who have the routine down & keep things separated.  It shouldn't be impossible for you to do the same

They forgot my avocado; brought out wrong bun for the Mr; I had to ask for silverware & we were never checked on after the orders were placed.....we were flagging down anyone who would give us the time of day, to fix all our issues & errors

Tip for takeout, you can only order takeout when you're at the restaurant, not over the phone.  Yet the 20 minute wait for the food rather than the 60 minute wait for a table on a Sat night is perfect.  Plus there's a ton of shops in Mandalay Place so it helps the wait go a little faster.",0,0,0

I already had this place scoped out before our vacation to Vegas... I had actually thought it was inside Mandalay Bay...

I was looking forward to building a juicy burger and adding some toppings with a little extra heat and flavor in them and devouring it with some sweet potato fries.

We were seated... hostess was nice... I guess. The crowd was a little obnoxious and the waitresses seemed a little prude (in their short shorts, small tops, and platform boots).. and this was lunch time. We had about 4-5 minutes of looking over the menu when a gentl... guy came over (not sure if he was our waiter or busser.. he had a full lenth apron on). He didnt introduce himself as our waiter, didnt ask if we had been there before, didnt go over anything on the menu... just took our drink orders... Well, he did bring those back... and left again! This had been at least 10 minutes since we plopped our buns in the booth ( with a tv showing sports... news)
The dude made no mention still if he was our waiter or not, just dropped off the drinks and left. Still didnt ask us if we've had time to go over the menu, or if we had any questions. Meh, it was already past the point of no return... I could tell already what the service was going to be like. We had seen other tables being serviced, and plenty of other employees walking past us... we were close to the rear\/kitchen, probably noticing we hadnt really been helped, but kept on moving (like I said, I thought this place was a little.... ya know).

So 15 minutes, Im sure had past. My fiancee and I looked at each other, knew what one was thinking, got up, and left.

I swear I heard our dude holler across the restaurant, ""Hey guys come back"". Maybe that's what I wanted to hear so I could turn his way and....

Burger Bar is basically an upscale sports bar. Many of the booths have private TV's and tables have views of flat screens everywhere. The beer selection is glorious as they have large selections of Belgian and German beers. 

The menu is simple and to the point. You can either build your own burger or select some of the ones they recommend. We built two burgers: 

Burger 1: Country Natural Beef, Pepper Jack, Onion, Jalapeno Bacon, Fried Egg, Truffle Sauce on Onion Bun. 
Burger 2: Chicken Breast, Sprouts, Fried Egg, Tomato, Button Mushrooms, Cucumber on Ciabatta. 

Burger 1 was great. Highlights were the beef and Jalapeno bacon. I thought the onion bun was just okay.

I was here with a friend who tends to enjoy the finer things in life, so when he ordered the pricey Kobe Beef Burger, I did the same. After the first large bite into it, you should notice two key things. One: the flavor explosion of the high-quality beef bouncing around your mouth.. and Two: that captivating image of a perfect burger bite, where the juicy medium-rare meat begs you to take another bite, even while you're still chewing the first..

It's a lot bigger than it looks from the outside, as it snakes inside a long ways.  Waiters are friendly and bartenders very nice eye-candy.  The burger selection isn't endless, but the handful of choices you have all appear quality.  

Some burger choices are Kobe beef, lamb, veggie, followed by choices in bread, cheese, and a lot of other toppings.

I ordered a veggie burger with avocado and sprouts on whole wheat.  It comes as a double veggie patty, which I didn't realize.  It was good, but from the description, I expected a little more flavor (more spiciness, specifically).  In any case, I really like the value.  It's a pricey burger but not extravagantly so, and you're full at the end.  

They have about four or five styles of fries:  the sweet potato-style is a tasty, less salty-tasting, alternative.

I'd go back, as the other burgers ordered at the party looked really good.",0,0,0

When I came here for a late lunch and comparing other Yelp reviews, I have to say that to make one's visit more worth it here is to just try their Rossini burger, which costs a whopping $60. I am always looking for a better deal, so if you try their Build-Your-Burger and use the same ingredients, it actually costs about $6 more. Overall, the Rossini burger is your best option to try their foie gras, because it contains the best ingredients to make that burger POP and taste OH SO GOOD.

So what did I think of it?

We ordered two orders of the Rossini burger, which comes with Kobe style Wagyu beef with sauteed foie gras and shaved Black truffles and Black Perigold Truffle sauce on an onion bun. Frankly, I chose this burger only for the foie gras feature. Considering that duck liver is considered illegal in CA, I might as well make my trip to Vegas worth it and get it while it is still legal in Nevada!

Let me just say that it is absolutely delicious! The patty and truffle were solid and flavorful with the foie gras. The foie gras was SO GOOD! Absolutely creamy and what one expects foie gras would taste like! We substituted our skinny fries for fat fries and ordered the Truffle Mayo dip - definitely try it! It's so good and the server gave us free extra Truffle Mayo dip! GREAAAT PLUS!! **

As for desserts, we had the Pumpkin Spice milkshake to go. It tastes just like pumpkin pie. Yummy for those who are fans of pumpkin!

Looking back, I would say that $60 is probably a bit too much, but I think it was more worth for the experience and to try the foie gras. So if you haven't been here, try this place at least once! When one is in Vegas, might as well go BIG or go HOME!! =)",4,4,3

Only on the Strip in Vegas can you blow $25 on a burger and not really care. It's actually a good value, considering that's only 1 hand of black jack for most people. I guarantee you'll enjoy this burger way more than that one hand of black jack. 

The Burger bar is celebrity chef, Hubert Keller's creation. He has a few of his own burger combinations on the menu, or you can build your own from extensive options. I actually wish that Hubert Keller would have more of his own burgers on there. There are only like 6 listed on the menu. I like creating my own, but hey you are the famous chef, dazzle me. 

I've been there a couple of times, so I can report on a few different burgers. I highly recommend the Surf 'n Turf burger. I'm not sure it says on the menu, but I think all the burgers are 1\/2 lb. They are nice and thick. The Surf 'n Turf is Black Angus Beef, topped with a 1\/2 grilled lobster tail, and grilled asparagus on a plain bun. Because I believe all burgers should come with cheese, I had them add provolone to it. Now pay attention to this next part, because I believe I have improved on Hubert Keller's creation. Order some pesto and mayo on the side. Mix it together and use this as a sauce. Yum, you'll never have a burger like that anywhere else. 

You can choose different types of meat for your burger. After trying a Kobe burger on this last visit, from now on that's the only way I will go. It's about $7 more for a Kobe beef burger than the Black Angus, but it's so juicy that it melts in your mouth. The Kobe beef is actually American Kobe, so it's not crazy expensive like the real Japanese Kobe. American Kobe is a hybrid between Black Angus and Japanese Wagyu beef. It has the highest marbling of any beef in the United States, and is as fine as you can get without importing actual Japanese Wagyu beef. You also get to pick from 5 different buns and about 45 different toppings. Toppings are as plain as American cheese and are as fancy as pan-seared foie gras. 

Just so I could try 2 burgers on this last visit, I cut them in half and shared them with my brother. Burger number 1 was a do it yourself Kobe burger. We agreed on provolone cheese, caramelized onions, sauteed oyster mushrooms, on an onion roll. Had the burger medium rare. The result was such a juicy burger that you didn't need any mayo, ketchup, or any other sauce. Just the natural juices of the burger with the toppings was perfection. 

Burger number 2 was new on the menu since the last time I ate there. It's called the Hubert Keller Burger. The menu says it's his favorite. It's a buffalo burger with blue cheese, caramelized onions, sauteed baby spinach, aoli, on a ciabatta bun. I think the buffalo had the least amount of fat of all their burgers, as such I found it wasn't as juicy. I was expecting it to maybe have some different kind of flavor, but it didn't. It could have just been lean ground beef. It's also the same price as the Kobe, so unless you are trying to be healthy, go with the Kobe. The blue cheese was kind of medium, which wasn't a bad thing. A very strong blue would have over powered everything. Of the 3 I've had so far, it was my least favorite, but still good. 

The fries were ok, but the buttermilk zucchini fries, were excellent. Got those with a ranch dipping sauce. They have some dessert ""burgers"" on the menu that I must try sometime. They use a donut for a bun and have fillings like cheesecake and grilled pineapple for example. It's so hard to save room for them though, perhaps they deserve their own visit.",3,2,2

I love that the toppings went from mild to wild and cheap to expensive.  This is probably the only place where one could get a burger with both shaved truffle slices and velveeta.  I went with carmelized onions and gorgonzola - delicious!

As others have said, you must try the sweet potato fries.  They are well worth the extra expense and are scrumptious.

One last piece of advice - do the call-ahead seating.  The restaurant doesn't do reservations, but you can call ahead up to a half hour.  My buddy and I did this and were able to walk right in upon arrival.  The place was packed, and the relatively huge line that formed behind us didn't care for us all that much.  In the end, the price was more than reasonable, given how well-prepared and customizable the meal is.  There may be a better burger somewhere else, but I certainly have yet to find it.",0,0,0

Our waitress was so nice. I had a phone call that I had to take while our food was being prepared and while I was outside the restaurant, she actually came and let me know that the food was on the table. She also checked in with us every so often to make sure that everything was good.

I really like how you can basically build your own burger. 

I got the regular burger (medium) with American cheese, avocado, and bacon on a whole wheat bun. Bacon was crispy, but everyone seems to like it that way so I should've asked to have it a little bit on the softer side. Burger was cooked perfectly.

C got the buffalo burger (medium) with sprouts, cucumber, and bacon on an onion bun. Burger was cooked to order. The cucumber slices were HUGE.

We both got the sweet potato fries, which were good (as usual).

I could only eat half of my burger (I wasn't very hungry), so the waitress brought out a doggy bag to take with us. She delivered the doggy bag and the check quickly and we were in and out within an hour.

I will definitely go back if I have the chance. Just wish it was a little closer to the center of the strip!",1,0,0

When we got there me and my bf had already perused the menu all week deciding what we wanted to order so I was thrilled that the food lived up to my stupidly high expectations. 

I ordered the burger sliders as an attempt to test my taste buds to see if I could tell the difference between the different kinds of meat. Long story short...I couldnt. But it was still nice to get a variety of toppings on each one so that you dont get bored. The best thing though for me was stealing some of my bfs truffle mayo (which like all the condiments\/sauces comes on the side) and putting it on each of my sliders. It was sooooo goood. Now im a sucker for anything with truffle so thumbs up for that. One thing they should do is let you order some of their toppings even if you are not making your own burger. Next time I think id want to try the truffle sauce. 

Bfs burger was kobe with foie grais and some other stuff. He said he couldnt really taste the quality of the kobe either. The kicker was the foie grais which they give a generous amount of. Next time he said he would just order the angus meat as long as he had the foie grais.

Perhaps the most remarkable things on the menu, however, were the desserts; among numerous virgin and alcoholic milkshakes (the chocolate mint was tempting me like crazy), there were also two ""dessert burgers.""  Both served in a warm donut bun, one had candied passion fruit to imitate cheese, chocolate ganache to imitate the patty, a mint leaf to imitate lettuce, and strawberries to imitate the tomatoes.

It was my first time so had no idea the menu worked. None of us have ever been here so asked our waiter questions. He did awesome job of explaining everything too us. You can either build your own burger or go with ones that have on the menu. We optioned for the the ones that not build your own cause other ones it comes with fries. Maybe the build your own does but as far from my four PBR recollection or more  in could is negative. LOL!  I had the Peppercorn Burger. It was awesome. I know drinking but still the balance between the dijon mustard spread and the peppercorns (plus the peppercorn cream sauce serve on the side; put some of that cream-a-licous on top) slice tomato, lettuce, and onion. It was nice hearty burger at the perfect time in life. The burger meat was cooked perfect medium. The only thing that was disappointment was the fries was average at best. The burger which reality is the reason come here was Awesome. 

Service could not say what an amazing job our waiter did! Not only with the questions. Two of my friends had the craving for nice over easy egg on top of their Hangover burger. You can add too the burgers already on the menu item ones. One of my friends notice his egg was way over done. The waiter apologize went back fixed the problem and came back with perfectly cooked over easy egg. You know perfect second break that seal have the egg yolk spreading all over its the bomb. Just knowing that do over easy egg right way on any burger. Always reason for me too go back! 

Pricey. It Hubert Keller and on the strip so comes as no surprise. Too see $60 burger on menu blows my mind. Still most of the burgers average $15-20. I think your definitely getting quality burger. Fries could be better and meet the standards they set with the burgers. Just my take.",5,2,6

Can I just leave the review with that one word?  We visited Burger Bar because it was in the concourse that connected our hotel to the Luxor, so it was convenient.  A friend of mine also spoke very highly of their food, so off we went.

The menu is much like Kuma's, but the quality of the food is much lower.  Maybe I've been spoiled here in Chicago, but we have a LOT of good burgers and burger restaurants.  Especially ones that make 'signature' or 'specialty' burgers.  That said, nothing at Burger Bar was particularly interesting or novel to me.

The food was good, don't get me wrong.  It's not like everything tasted gross.  I just think that the reputation of this place is more a myth since this place is just a burger restaurant.  

The food is (duh) overpriced since this is inside a Vegas casino mall.  The drinks were decent and apparently the booze shakes were excellent.  Order one of those and tell me what you think.  

I'd rather enjoy the buffet at my hotel next time since it's cheaper and offers a larger selection of various foods.  Meh.",4,2,2

Sure, it's pretty generous sandwich because they really do load it up with veggies, so you'll get your fill on the vegetarian burger.  The fried zucchini was pretty standard, crispy and not soggy at all.

The Husband had the American Kobe Beef Burger ($16.50), straight up.  They ask if you want to add various fillings like cheese, mushrooms, etc.  But he stuck to just the beef so he could taste the meat itself.  It was decent, but nothing special or worth the price.  (I guess what makes this place special is all the toppings you can add - 8 different kinds of cheese, lobster or shrimp, foie gras, chili, black truffles, or three different sauces.  All of these definitely bring the price of your burger up though!)

When I head back there though, I think I'll have to try something with truffles (my fav.!)...",0,0,0

I am like Jules in Pulp Fiction in that I love the taste of a Juicy Burger. With this in mind I figured Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay would have been a stone cold lock. Hundreds of beers to choose from, a masculine yet inviting interior, a packed house and even great bartenders had me sprung from the onset. In fact, I was seriously digging Burger Bar up to the point the Burger arrived!

I decided to try the ""Perfect Ten"" Burger which really was more like a Perfect 5. Maybe Vegas grades on a curve? Basically they put down a (perfectly cooked) medium rare patty and top it with Gouda Cheese, carmelized Onions and serve it on a dry and stale Pretzel bun. With exception of the bun, the ingredients were fresh enough and the Burger was juicy and bold, it is just that there was no ""pop"" factor for me and at $16.00 it should have all kinds of wonderful in every bite.

 The place is pretty easy to find, being positioned in the mall between Mandalay Bay and Luxor.


 The service and food are very good and there is a great selection of burgers.


 The only reasons I would give for the Burger Bar not getting higher marks are that despite booking for 8pm, we were waiting another 20mins before we could be seated. I guess that is a good sign for the food, being such a popular place!


 Also, bear in mind that the burgers are not cheap - especially by US standards - they do have foie gras and kobe beef burgers on the menu, but as an afficionado, I would say that these ingredients don't always make the best burgers.

After hearing that Pete Rose was around the corner signing autographs at the sports place, we ventured upon Burger Bar and ordered something to go. Why to go? Why not stop here for a regular meal?

Well one reason is that we were in a rush.

Well then why stop here?

Because, my friends, they have something that is called the Nutella burger. The Nutella burger? What? I've never heard of that! The Nutella burger is on a glazed ""doughnut"" with a nutella mousse, strawberries, and a passion fruit gelatin. And nutella. Lots of nutella. The nutella was as thick as a regular patty. All that for $7. So here's what you'll think. I can get a burger for $7? Yes and no. First off, it's a dessert burger, so naturally it'll be small. Hahaha yeah it was small. I kinda guessed that since it was Vegas and I saw the prices of their other burgers. There's a Kobe burger for a price that I'm not going to repeat on here, but if anyone has ordered it, I wonder if that is good :P (you can check pics if you want :P )

The nutella burger was... interesting. Obviously it was a dessert burger and the donut thankfully, was glazed. The nutella overwhelmed the entire burger and you couldn't really make out the fresh fruit that was on the bottom of the burger. It had decent flavor, was surrounded by the Nutella (which obviously was the star).

First of all the atmosphere was nice and un-pretentious its not a very big establishment but both times I went right around rush hour it was busy but still room was found for me (both a table and the bar) the staff were friendly and I had great service

I built my own burger both times sticking with the more reasonable angus beef both times

The food was great the sides were nice and hot and good portions that never left me wanting more. The burgers obviously hand made were almost the perfect thickness big enough to make them nice and moist holding in the juices but thin enough to allow the sides room to act on their own

The beer and drink choices were great with many varieties of taps and a full bar

The two things that keep this from being a 5 star is some rather large variability on burger doneness  (one was perfect the other borderline underdone both ordered at the same medium) as well as being a bit pricy for what you get

It doesn't fall apart when you pick it up, and it's not soggy. The flavor of it is very nice and filling. The sweet potato fries are the best I have ever had- a lot of places do not know, or care, to make a great sweet potato fry. I got the Nutella milkshake and it was soooo good! Not only that but I have dreams of their burger desserts: the first one is a Nutella patty on a donut bun with passion fruit gelatin, kiwi and strawberries- the second is a donut bun with a cheesecake custard and pineapple slice (it tastes like an pineapple upside down cake). 
It can get VERY pricey if you don't watch what you are doing. You can build your own burger and shake if you want, but BEWARE- it will be more expensive to do so than if you go with their featured foods. 
Example: the Nutella milkshake was 7.00 (all milkshakes are, but for the Salted Caramel which is 8.75), if I wanted to make my own the ice cream to start with is listed as 7.00.

My burger was juicy, tender (not as fatty as I imagined) but had really great flavor. With a light spread of truffle mayo it was sooooo good. However, I preferred dipping my fries in the truffle mayo, the mayo had bits of black truffle in it that wasn't too overpowering.

We stayed at the Luxor 5 years ago & this is right at the Mandalay Place coming out of Luxor. We haven't stayed at Mandalay or Luxor since, but wherever we are staying, we make sure to stop by.

Let me give you a run-down of all the toppings I remember:
Bread- White, wheat
Meats - Kobe beef, angus beef, chicken breast, turkey, veggie burger
Cheese- Cheddar, provolone, american, jack, blue
Veggies- Asparagus, spinach, button mushrooms, portabello, 
Surf toppings- Lobster, shrimp
Misc.- Fried egg, truffles (expensive!)
Sauces- Fleur de Lys chef sauces

Sides- skinny fries, fat fries, fried zucchini, sweet potato fries, onion rings

I always had ciabatta rolls, which stayed intact but yet had an easy to chew consistency. I always had my burgers with smoked gouda or cheddar cheese. My sides were regular or sweet fries and spiced ketchup. Definitely get the spiced ketchup, which is so much better than the Heinz variety. As usual, I ordered wheat beer on tap for drinks.

The sweet potato fries were very delicious. They had a nice sweetness to them and did not require and seasoning nor condiments.

The burger bar has an impressive selection of draft beers with an optional beer flight of 6oz selections.

Once you do, walk through the casino hugging the right til you get to the shops (up the stairs).  Then walk most of the way through the shops towards the Luxor, and it'll be a small, unassuming restaurant front on your left.  

It's a chill atmosphere, with whatever music playing the staff feels like listening to (my night it was 90s satellite radio), and personal TVs in the booths.  Nothing pretentious whatsoever.

Grabbed a solo seat at the bar, and was promptly greeted and set up\/given water by multiple servers.  Patrick was super duper friendly and made my night very enjoyable.   He and another guy behind the bar seem to call everyone ""baby,"" which I found rather cute and enjoyable (although I'm taken), but I had the thought that a different woman dining solo as I was might have found it unnerving.  

Whatever, I had a great time chatting and hanging out with Patrick throughout the night, and he was an attentive and informative server.  He seemed to really enjoy his job and is great at it.  Service can often make or break a meal, and it definitely made mine.

I ordered the Hubert Keller burger, with a few changes.  I got the Kobe instead of the Buffalo, and an onion bun instead of the Ciabatta.  I also ordered the zucchini fries, with a couple sides of sauce (truffle aioli and pesto).

The burger was very good.  Piled high with the toppings, and the shallot and red wine sauce was sooooo goood.  My only complaint was that the bottom bun was soggy as soon as I got my plate.  Not cool.  All in all not the best burger I've ever had, but a great one and it hit the spot.  

The zucchini fries were AWESOME.  I've rarely had fried veggies that are juicy and taste fresh while maintaining a thick coat of batter.  Also, the serving portion is ample.  The sauces were great.

Sadly they don't make their own ice cream, which was more noticeable when I decided on a sundae instead of a milkshake.  I got coffee ice cream with nutella, caramel, and graham cracker (I was feeling a big pig-ish).  It came in a banana split style dish - very long and narrow - with two huge scoops of ice cream, shmears of nutella on either side and a couple of graham cracker pieces on either side as well.  The caramel was sadly missing, but it was brought over as soon as he realized.  It was difficult to eat - there was too much ice cream for the dish, the nutella wasn't incorporated and is hard to do so yourself when it gets cold, and the graham crackers were whole which meant I had to break them up myself and there was no space to put them really without them fall off the ice cream on to  the table.

So - bottom line - this place is good if you're in the mood for a very good burger, and some inventive fries\/sauce choices.  For dessert, maybe stick with the milkshakes over a sundae.",0,0,0

I personally like the place a lot especially since the restaurant is established by Hubert Keller. I have some major respect for Hubert Keller and he is my favorite chef. Anyway back to the review. 

First of all, I would like to explain how this place was a major up for me when we first came here because it was still open at like 12? My friends went to the Ice lounge so it was perfect to come here after the lounge. We were all hungry and this place was the only place in the mall that was still open and that was exactly why we went to this restaurant. So that was already a good start.

I really like the place a lot to be honest. There were so many different kind of burger to get. It was like Burger Heaven to me hahaha. You could either get a fixed selection of burger OR you can make your own burger with whatever topping you want in the inside. There were many pre-fixed burger that I want to get but dude...a burger with whatever you want is like a damn dream come true to me. :) SO OF COURSE I picked the ""Make your own burger."" ALTHOUGH i did wanted to try that one burger with lobster or the Hubert Keller burger but regardless I didnt regret it one bit.

SO there were 4 different kind of meat you can get with the ""make your own burger."" There is the regular, buffalo, kobe, and one other kind that i forgot. It was a week ago. ANYWAY i got the regular patty with bacon, avocado, spinach, portebello mushrooms, grill onions, and i think thats it...? I'm not sure hahaha i got too much toppings. ANYWAY the burget came and the burger was huge. It was like my dream come true burger :) It was so hard to bite through it bit by bit but it was so tasty bite after bite. OH MAN. I love the burger that i got. It was so delicious. 

I tried my friend's burger which was legit as well. HE got the kobe patty with bacon, avocado, FRIED EGG, grill onions and some other stuff. I took a bite of it and i was also in love with it. :) There so many different kind of toppings you can get that its just so awesomeeee! I think my rating went kinda down when i saw and taste my friend's sliders. It was so plain and doesnt look that appetizing. It was anything special just 3 sliders with 3 different kind of patty. I tried it and the taste was not special and it was not the right match as i would say. The fries was pretty good. 

I don't know but I wouldn't mind coming back here to make my dream burger again. hehehe :)",0,0,0

I must say this was the best lunch we had in Vegas and one of the best burgers ever. It is pricey but that is because these aren't the nasty McDonald style burgers. These are what I call gourmet burgers. 

What is so unique about this place is that you get to create your burger by picking the meat, the bun and a variety of toppings...not your basics like lettuce, tomato, pickle but toppings like portabella mushrooms, fried egg, guacamole, etc. 

We ordered the buffalo Burger on wheat with a fried egg and white american cheese and the grilled chicken on focaccia bread with guacamole, salsa and pepperjack cheese, both of us ordered the sweet potato fries. Every bite was wonderful. It is hard to find a place that serves sweet potatoe fries (which is a favorite of ours)! 

We also had drinks from the bar. I had washington apple martinis and my husband had long island iced teas...made perfectly. 

Service was ok...but then again it was VERY busy. We got lucky to find a seat at the bar otherwise we would have had to wait 40 mins for a table at 2pm. Very popular place so either make reservations or go at an very unusual dining time....

So average, you will wonder why the hype. Amongst the cheering and yelling of the Colts and Jets fans, we (the burger bureau) took a seat at the bar to indulge in the ""finest"" burger in town. 

The menu shows a lot of promise replete with choices of signature and build-your-own burgers. They suit all spenders ($14.00-$60.00 +). Plenty of liquids are also available to wash down your desired selections. 

I put in my order for the American Classic--sans cheese, picked up a side of Zucchini fries and elected for a mug root beer. 

The Burger Breakdown: The American Classic shared the white oval plate with the Zucchini fries, a pickle and the fixings on the side. The fixings: a slice of raw onion, green-leaf lettuce and a slice of tomato. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium--yet desiccated. This was the first time I have encountered this anomaly. I was disappointed with the lack of jus (fats and oil that were missing). I reached for the root beer after every bite. Yikes. The zucchini fries were well seasoned and made up for this average burger. The burger was fair sized but only fair-flavored.

The presentation was lack-luster and the meal could be described in one word: LACKING. In an otherwise unforgettable trip to Las Vegas, I cannot wait to let this burger slip from my mind.
While the selection was plentiful, the choices fell flat across this Burger Bar.",5,5,5

We went on a Saturday night around 11 and sat at the bar to avoid the wait (it was only 15 minutes but we were hungry).

I had a turkey burger which had a depth of flavor that is lacking in many restaurant turkey burgers. I added pepperjack cheese, avocado, and the usual lettuce, tomato, onion.  All great. Even better was the sweet potato fries!!! So many restaurants seem to have difficulty getting them to stay crispy but these were perfect and full of flavor.  My friend got a bacon, egg, and cheese burger and was in love as well.

I ended up making my own burger, which included a black Angus patty, a sesame seed bun with jalapeños, cheddar cheese, a fried egg and the BEST, I really mean the BEST PESTO SAUCE EVER!!! It came with a side of fries and I can tell you that I devoured that meal so fast because of how delicious it was!

The build-your-own with Atlantic salmon was the surprise winner. As an Alaskan I was skeptical but it was a big thick piece of fish that just happened to have been cut with a big round cookie cutter. Ordered medium, it was cooked nicely.  We added spinach, asparagus, and Gouda.  Couldn't taste the cheese but the veggies were great; the while thing was knife and fork food, not a sandwich.

The Vegas vegan was a little lame.  The pile of artfully arranged veggies was nice in theory but was lacking in the flavor department.

The jalapeño petals were our favorite of the several fries we tried.  Soft and tender with a nice kick.  Skinny fries were nothing special.  I burned my mouth in the zucchini fries more than once, even after waiting awhile for them to cool.

Relatives passed a lot of food on our direction.  We ate too many fried onions, but just couldn't stop.  Caesar salad wasn't worth more than a few bites.  

But the pumpkin pie milkshake that my other half's brother ordered...that was amazing. Dude knows how to pick the right indulgences.   Liquid, frozen pumpkin pie.  Mmm, Mmm, thickness.

You can order pre-assembled burgers or you can choose meat, topping, cheese, bun, basically everything that will go on your burger.  One of the guys did get the Kobe beef burger, which he was very pleased with.

Dessert (included when you get the Kobe burger) has an all sugar burger.  Buns are two donut halves, the lettuce is really mint, tomatoes would be strawberry ... you get the idea.

Went with a group of 10 around noon on Saturday.  Waited all of 5 minutes.  Seating was cozy with a table pushed up against a booth table.  Clean, polished wood, part sports bar, part diner atmosphere.  Had college football going on the tv in the booth and the waitress was cool enough to change it to a game one of the guys requested.

The menu was ka-razy.  You choose your patty and bun ($8-16), then pick from toppings separated into categories (from cheddar to guacamole to jalapeno bacon to shaved black truffles:  $1-30).  Then, you still have sides, dessert burgers, shakes, and an extensive beer menu to sift through.  I was overwhelmed.

I had to go with the package deal, the Rossini.  American kobe patty, onion bun, foie gras, shaved black truffles, madeira wine sauce, served with cracked black pepper, coarse sea salt, and a truffle oil sauce on the side.  The burger was like butter, juicy throughout without much spillage onto the plate.  The flavors in the burger were so rich, I had to really slow it down and thoughtfully taste.  Therefore, I was pretty much done two-thirds of the way through.  But that would've been $20 of burger left so I continued to chomp away.  

The fries that accompanied didn't suck, but they weren't memorable.  Tasted some zucchini fries, those were pretty good as well.  Might have gotten tired of them if I had to eat a whole serving.  Your choice of dessert burger came with the Rossini (something I swear I didn't see on the menu) so that was pretty cool.  I chose the chocolate burger--sliced donut, chocolate ganache patty, strawberry slices, passionfruit-pineapple gelatin, and mint ($3.95).  Looked like a cheeseburger, so cool!  Tasted pretty good but grew tired of the ganache.  I thought the cheesecake dessert burger was better, cheesecake was light and almost fluffy.  My chocolate loving homegirl would beg to differ though.

So all in all, I was satisfied with my $60 purchase.  Burger, fries, and dessert.  Another friend loaded up his burger with toppings and it ended up being about $30.  Plus, I figured I'd hit the slots later and recuperate some funds.  Whaddaya know, won $100 on one of those flaming 7s dollar slots.  Sweet...",1,1,1

This place has great food. You can choose from a variety of different and unique burgers, or you can build your own.

Although the Yelp app stats this restaurant takes reservations it in fact DOES NOT.

When we arrived we were told that there would be a 15 minute wait.  It was actually more like a 5 minute wait. Upon entering there was loud music playing overhead and TVs in the booths.  We ended up sitting at a table which was nice because it was more intimate.

We checked out the menu and decided to build our own burger.  The choices they have to build your own burger are limited but they did have selections that I liked. I ordered the angus beef with provolone, avocado and portobello mushrooms on a ciabatta bun with a raspberry ice tea. We also ordered the Fry Sampler with mozzarella cheese sticks, onion rings and skinny fries.  When I asked our waitress Daylene (which is a pretty name by the way) if they had honey mustard, she gave me a heads up saying some customers DID LIKE and some customers DID NOT LIKE the honey mustard sauce.  Our sampler came out pretty quickly and the honey mustard was good.

When our burgers arrived I realized they did not come with fries on the plate. That was okay because we still had the fries from the sampler.  I have to say, my burger was tasty. Better than a Slaters burger. I actually was only able to eat half of my burger.

They have a few specialty burgers, and offer made to order burgers where you can choose from a very large variety of toppings (they even had 2 different types of bacon) and a bunch of different types of meat (buffalo, beef, turkey, chicken, veggie, etc). I do wish they had more specialty choices because I can be really indecisive with the made to order build your own selections. Also the build your own burgers got very expensive very quickly. I liked that they offer sweet potato and regular fries, we tried both and they were equally great! The do also offer a moderate selection of beers on tap and a full bar.

Awesome food, great service, and generally a wonderful time was had by all.  We walked out with huge smiles on our faces and nicely filled tummies.

I ordered a burger that had ""pretty much the entire month's food ration of a small African country"" on it.  Black Angus, medium, blue cheese, jalapeno bacon, portabello mushrooms, and caramelized onions.  Sweet potato fries and a Deschutes IPA rounded out my meal.

The fries were crispy and delicious.  The patty itself was cooked perfectly and was juicy and awesome.  The toppings were completely proportioned just right -- not too much of one ingredient, not too little.  The bacon was so thick that perhaps it coulda been done a bit more crispy, but its amazing flavor more than made up for it.

The only slightly disappointing thing was the chocolate burger -- it looked INCREDIBLE, but the ganache serving as the 'patty' inside wasn't too flavorful.  Otherwise it would have been a perfect ending to our little outing!

The price was just right (at least it was just what we expected) and overall the servers made our experience just that much more awesome.

They have everything there from a $65 foie gras topped burger, to an $11 build your own burger right down to what kind of bun you want. And tons of different toppings. I built my burger with a pretzel bun, angus beef, smoked gouda, peppered bacon, grilled onions, and avocado. YUM! It was so big I had to smash it to fit into my mouth. It was so damn good!

One of the things that looked great on the TV show was the lamb burger, which has since been discontinued, so no luck there.  I wasn't up for the $65 Rossini burger, so I went with the build-your own, which was OK but nothing amazing.

The problem is that you can dig yourself into a hole with bad combinations, and there weren't that many suggestions made on the menu.  I gave it a couple of tries, and they were decent, but not great.

On its face, it seems pretty straightforward: decent bar, burger joint, TVs in the booths showing some sport or other. It goes deeper. Start with the beer list - great selection, large draft list and truly wonderful bottle list. I've had award winning Canadian beers here that I can't even get in Canada. If you've never had a Unibroue beer from Quebec, I recommend the Unibroue 17.

The menu, too, goes deeper. Not just burgers. Grain fed or naturally raised beef? Wagyu, maybe? You are spoiled for choice, but if that intimidates, they have several reasonable pre-defined burgers to choose from or riff on.

I'm the guy who brought Melissa Y. (below) here on her birthday, making lots of noise about the $60 burger. Kobe beef, foie gras, 1\/3oz of shaved black truffle on an onion roll. The Rossini, they call it. We each had one, and they were great. Better than great - putting black truffle on a burger is something I haven't done before or since (except on return trips here) and it is some inspired eats, my friend. You would not do badly to spend some blackjack winnings on that little masterpiece.

BUT. I'm going to tell you something important here, so listen good: you can do better. You can make a thing more pure and more perfect. You can reach the Platonic ideal of burger in this place, and reaching Platonic ideals isn't a thing we get to do very often in our lives. Are you ready? Then let's begin.

Ditch the foie - it adds richness where none is required, and the richness it adds is lost in the strong flavours. Ditch the kobe, too. Kobe is either getting you beautiful texture (not irrelevant in ground meat, but certainly *less* so than with steak cuts) or beautiful flavour, but the naturally raised beef has that in spades. Ditch the onion bun as well, if you want my opinion. I like onions plenty, but baked into a roll they lose some of their fire and even if the result is still tasty, you're missing the opportunity to go for their Ciabatta (great texture, nice yeasty flavour, works with the beer) or their Sesame (a classic, done well).

Okay, so now: Keep the black truffles (KEEP THE BLACK TRUFFLES), but maybe get your cheese on, and add some pepper bacon or a fried egg. Congratulations, champ, you've got yourself a burger that adds no pretense, that gilds no lilies, but which explodes with flavour you didn't think a burger could have. This is it, this is the burger you've been waiting for.

I'm proud of you, soldier.",4,2,2

Burger Bar is a great lunch or snack meal when you need that Beef Fix.  Hidden around the corner from the Mandalay Bay, this place is packed.  We waited about 20 minutes just to sit at the bar.  

Is it the perfect burger? No.  Not even close.  Does it taste like a premium gourmet burger?  Yes.  But the problem likes with the fixins.  Everything is an extra charge.  Bacon, avocado, cheese, onions, grilled onions, and of course the fries.  I think i had the NY beef or the sirloin.....the kobe seemed too outrageous at the time, but i think now, i should ponied up and just threw down $$$ for tasty american wagyu.

I dont recall sliders, but i think that wouldve been a better way to go.

Discovered they have picked green tomatoes as a side which were fantastic.  Got an order of the Burger Bar Ketchup which was fantastic as well.

Nutella shake was very rich and tasty, but I think I could make a decent reproduction at home and save myself $8 and change.  (I mostly tried it to see what it tasted like so I could recreate it at home)

The burgers. OH.MY.GOD.

Las Vegas is not only a desert environmentally, but in terms of quality, there is a sore lack of good beers, good wine, good whiskey, and good food at reasonable prices.  In terms if beer, it was quite difficult to find anything other than the usual swill.  In fact, this is the only place we managed to find a nice selection of beers - and they weren't $10 each either.

We were told at the entrance that we would need to wait 30-45 minutes, so we sat down at the bar and managed to find a few beers we hadn't tried before.  One was a Black IPA from Stone Brewing Co. and my wife had something else, I think it was European and smooth.  We talked about beer with the bartender and a fellow sitting by us and the bartender offered us what's called the Deschutes Black Butte XX, a variation on their Black Butte Porter, but much better.   We thought about the offer and decided we would wait until we got our burgers.  

In the meantime, we continued to talk about beer and convinced the fellow next to us to try his first IPA - Dogfish Head 90 minute (they were out of the 60 minute).   I'm not sure what he thought about it, but he certainly agreed it was strong and hoppy.

The wait didn't seem to long, and we eventually sat down at a table and started to wait for our burgers to arrive.  We ordered their buffalo burger and their American Classic (basically a bacon cheeseburger).  I asked if the waitress if they made their own meat, and indeed they did.

The burgers were among the best we have had.  Juicy, tasty, well cooked, no fillers, quality meat.  During our feast - these burgers were big - the Black Butte XX arrived which made our  meal even more delicious.    

If the burgers weren't enough, we decided to have dessert, well I decided, because my wife was quite full, but the dessert burgers looked good.  My wife's burger was marginal, but I had a delicious burger that was basically some fruit, whipped cream, and donuts for the buns.  

In any case, when I return next year, which will be for DEFCON, I will have top my visit off with a trip to Burger Bar.  You can go to some big expensive, overpriced restaurant with a chance that you'll actually get something of quality, and I'll go to Burger Bar.",1,0,1

The seating is pretty awesome with each booth with its own tv! I would definitely stay here for a bite and a drink if my teams were playing! The waitress and hostess were also very friendly and great service. 

We chose the Herbert Keller burger ($21.95) and the sliders ($13.75). Both came with skinny fries, which were surprisingly delicious! Somehow it tasted light for fries, crunchy, perfectly seasoned and a great portion as a side for the burger. The sliders were also surprisingly good. All three slider burgers were cooked perfectly, ate moist and well seasoned. One was ""nature source"" with American cheese, angus beef with bacon, and Buffalo with carmelized onions. For sliders that sound regular, all 3 were cooked perfectly and all toppings went well together. In my experience 2 or 1 of 3 sliders are the only ones that are tasty and the rest you eat only because you are hungry. I enjoyed every one of my sliders! My husband had the Hubert Keller burger, which Buffalo, carmelized onions, steamed spinach, blue cheese, red wine and shallots on a ciabatta bun. This one was big but too soggy. Perhaps this is because we were taking our time taking pics but the ciabatta bun was so soggy that made it hard to eat the burger. Despite that, great flavours. With the intense blue cheese, spinach and perfectly medium Buffalo burger, wow well balanced! Plus it came with a full pickle which always is a plus for my palate. 

All in all, a great burger place. I'd come back for the some or to try the Rossini ($60). Only 4 stars because of soggy bun and the price tag for the Hubert Keller burger. A fair price would be $18. Definitely recommend this one to others!",0,0,0

My friend got the chicken breast burger, and it was a pretty good burger but for 15 bucks, I was kind of expecting the chicken to be more juicy and tender.

As a premium burger, the Burger Bar offers complete customization, cooked to order with all premium ingredients.

Strawberry Banana Shake - pretty darn tasty, surprisingly light for a shake and not overly sweet
Cookie dough Shake - Not my favourite, had chunks of cookie dough with most of it blended in. Just like a light chocolate doughy shake

Lamb Burger - Well seasoned, a little gamey with a nice kick from the spices. Not bad but not my favourite.
Salmon Burger - Amazing. The salmon fillet came looking like a patty (round) which was a tad alarming BUT it was just cut that way.

Most of my Yelp buds gave Burger Bar good ratings, so I knew a meat feast was inevitable.   Shawn H. put out a UYE for Burger Bar and I took advantage of this opportunity. Keep in mind that Burger Bar is located inside Mandalay Bay.  Most restaurants tend to cost a little more in a casino on the strip.  But at Burger Bar, prices are fairly cheap considering its location.  Burger Bar has a huge selection and you can also create your own burger.  These are all great call outs for a burger joint. But first things first, I need to point out is that this visit was during Lent in which red meat is currently being sidelined. Second, I don't drink much.  So, my review might not be a fair one at the moment because I am not reviewing Burger Bar for what they are known for, which is a burger and a bar.  

This visit and rating is for their service and their Salmon Burger. The Salmon Burger is huge at a half pound and prepared medium well. Price is about $10 which is a good start. However, I felt that taste was lacking and the salmon patty was dry. I know salmon isn't flavorful in the first place, but I have had tasty salmon burgers at other restaurants (ie. Halphen Red in San Diego).  Since I was eating 8 oz of this stuff, I at least got about 40 grams of protein and Omega 3's.  In all, I was disappointed with my salmon burger. 

The service is pretty good considering that our party was fairly big.  Burger Bar is very accommodating and the staff is excellent.  You can say that the service almost cancelled out the poor taste of the salmon burger.  I have not given up on Burger Bar. I still have their real burgers to try and based on what other Yelpers have stated already, this is what they are known for.

Sorry, but if you're charging me $17 for a burger, it better blow my damn mind.",1,0,0

I ordered the Black Jack burger, which came with monterey jack and tapenade on a ciabatta bun. I absolutely loved the bun, but didn't care much for the tapenade. The fries it came with were so addicting. Try the white BBQ sauce, which is just BBQ sauce and mayo mixed together. 

I ordered the Chocolate Burger to take back to the hotel. Oh, man. One of the best decisions I made while in Vegas. Warm donut ""bun,"" Nutella mousse ""patty,"" passion fruit jelly ""cheese,"" kiwi ""pickles,"" and strawberry ""tomatoes."" It even came with a side of raspberry sauce, but I didn't bother using that... as you could expect, the ""burger"" was already sweet as is. But definitely order this if you love sweets! Very cute and very tasty.

I'll have to come back to Burger Bar on my next trip to Vegas and try a different burger, or make my own. The shakes also looked and sounded really great. Very affordable dinner for Vegas, especially for a restaurant owned by a celebrity chef!",1,0,0

nice place, very random songs playing, i mean one min you hear babyface and the next you are listening to shiela e... lol.. various beers on tap
i like the idea of building your own burgers, cuz i am picky and dont enjoy mustard or pickles on my burger. i decided to get the angus beef. i didnt throw in hella shit in it cuz i just wanted to taste it and i figured that i could always build more the following meal... BUT last min i couldnt help but throw in the portobella mushrooms. 

my bf is a vegetarian and got the veggie burger, basically 2 'bello mushrooms and hella grilled veggies in the middle. he got a few extra grilled veggies to throw in side. 

RE: the food
so our food arrives and first of all, the only thing in the bun is the burger itself. the 1 slice of tomato and the 1 slice of lettuce is off to the side with the pickle ooozing its juice all over my bun and sweet potato fries. i have to give them credit for the abundance of mushroom. my angus pattie is HELLA tiny compared to the bun. i'm not a fan of bread so the less i eat it the better. so we throw our burgers together and the angus was tasty but a bit on the dry side. i did enjoy my sweet potato fries. i enjoyed the cheesecake burger too. i'd go back for those 2 things alone and not spend $13 on a burger. i ate every gawd daym thing and wasnt stuffed... theres something wrong with that... cuz normally i always walk away like the state puff marshmallow man.... 

RE: the service
there was no mayo, the katsup and mustard were empty and i placed the katsup bottle upside down at the end of the table and 8 people walked by and didnt bother to refill it. the waiter forgot the extra shit my bf ordered and didnt really check up on us. the server was lucky i ended my meal on a good note with that daym cheesecake or else i would have stiffed him....",0,0,0

It's hard to find any other place that compares to Hubert Keller's burger joint.
Main reason is the vast customization of burgers and drinks. 
Deciding what type of bun, meat, condiment, sauce, and sides to get can get overwhelming, same scenario with the drinks.

Luckily, they have the Chef burgers, the one that I like is the Hubert Keller Burger. Consists of  Buffalo, caramelized onions, baby spinach and blue cheese on ciabatta bun served with red wine and shallots sauce. 
The flavors are balanced very well, and the buffalo tasted fantastic it did't taste gamy or have that earthy after taste.

Pros
- We sat at the bar, and thus did not experience service problems as some reviews have state, bartender was quick, friendly and on point
- Dirty Dog IPA was awesome - all of our beer from draft was perfect temps and poured correctly
- Fat fries, salad, all that was excellent

Cons
- Where this is located is a pain.  It's pretty much dead middle in the walk between Mandalay and Luxor - maybe not a con for others but wasn't convenient for us
- The burgers were undercooked - all 3 of us ordered medium and all 3 got blood on the plate and the bun.   Was way to hungry to send it back, unfortunately.
- The burgers were not well seasoned; if not for having pepperjack on it, it probably would have tasted like nothing at all.

I have been here twice, the first time was quite a good experience, wait staff was on their game and very attentive. I had the Angus on wheat with swiss, jalapeno bacon and a fried egg. Very good burger, although the patty did lack some seasoning but that may just be a personal gripe as I opt for seasoned meat over a plethora of toppings. Do watch out for the first bite when getting the fried egg, lets just say it was closer to sunny side up than over medium. 

My second time at the BB I was a bit displeased with the overall experience. The hostesses were rude and there were 3 of them standing doing nothing at a podium made for one person. The only thing worse than the attitude was the fact that the wait was about an hour but I can deal with the wait, its Vegas and there is always something to do while you are waiting. On to the food, I mistakenly ordered the slider sampler thinking that I could get a taste of the buffalo and kobe burgers without having to order the entire burger. What I got was 3 small tasteless burgers that were on the slightly overcooked side. Least I had some sweet potato fries to help calm the hunger pangs. 

All in all if you like options and you like creativity you need to check this place out but be prepared to shell out an extra few bucks if you want to go all out.

It was good, and tasted like they used quality ingredients.  However, it didn't mesh as well as I would have liked.

This is by far the best place to get a burger in Las Vegas.  It's not convenient to get to but its worth the effort (and the extra walking will maybe burn 50 calories!)

The best part of ordering a burger here are your options.  EVERYTHING is a la carte: the burger, the buns, condiments, extras, fries.  You choose your favorite toppings to go with your favorite meat (kobe, turkey, veggie, Angus) and bun (sesame, ciabatta, etc).  You can order truffles, bacon, foie gras, and many different types of cheese to go on top.

The fries are an extra cost but we each ordered different fries to try them all out.  

The tastes were very good on all facets of our meal.  My son had the choice of a burger (krabby patties) or grilled cheese; you'd think at a burger joint he would've ordered the burger but no.

The ambience here is great: servers are excellent, the lighting is cool without being too dark. The best part is the tv's at our booth which had the NFL game on from that night.

This, however, was not the record among me and my friends.  Two of my friends, went 4 times in 4 days - one had the chicken sandwich, turkey burger, angus burger and a dessert burger and another had a Kobe burger, two angus burgers and a dessert burger.  All bow down to Uvan and Steve!

Well, as far as my experience goes, I will have to say Burger Bar has really good quality burgers.  I had the Kobe burger, rare, no toppings on the plain bun and the angus burger, med. rare, no toppings on the plain bun.  Each time, the burger was cooked exactly as ordered (cool and red in the middle for rare, pink throughout for med. rare).  The bun was exceptional.  It was slightly crunchy but soft and was perfect to absorb the meat juices (which there were plenty).  The size of the patty was perfect as well - not too small, not too big, abouth an inch tall - I'd say it was around 7 oz.

Although I don't notice this at most places, I will say, each burger could have used more salt.  I don't think the meat is pre-salted before it's ground and very little appears to be put on before it's cooked.  But, just a sprinkle of salt really helped the flavor.  

Lots of people rave about the Kobe, but I wasn't too thrilled.  For one, the texture was too soft.  (I know, I got it rare, it's supposed to be soft.  Well, that's true.)  But the texture of the meat was soft.  Also, the angus beef had a much more ""beefy"" flavor than expected.  For the price, I'm getting the angus burger from now on.  

The sides?  Well, the zucchini fries are great.  Whether they're frozen or not, I don't care.  They are good.  The onion rings are thick with a heavy coating and good.  The fries are fine.  The beer list is very good with well over 20 selections.    TVs for each booth - reason to linger and drink.  Oh, and no corkage fee but terrible wine glasses.  Service is spotty, but really dependent on who's your waiter\/waitress.

Overall - one really great place to grab a great burger and some drinks.  

Wine I brought and had with the Kobe beef burger: 2003 Miura Garys' Vineyard.  Deep purple color, smooth rich texture, firm acidity, bright plum flavor with leather and earth.  Much more rustic than the Pisoni Vineyard bottling I've had from Miura.  Tasted better after 6 hours, likely because of bottle shock on the drive up.  Much more smooth, less leather and earth and more bright, sweeter plum and fruit notes.",1,0,1

A dinner at a high end fancy restaurant would have had slim chances since it would have been such last minute, plus I was getting the feeling the guys wanted a chill dinner. Trying to compromise, I hit the ""$"" and ""$$"" signs in my search.

One of the things that popped up was this place.  Personally for me, I absolutely love burgers, so I know I would have loved it.  And while it's no Fleur De Lys, I thought ""how can you go wrong with a restaurant by Hubert Keller?""

I skimmed a couple of reviews and made the suggestion to the guys.  They all seemed to like the idea. The listing said they take reservations, however I believe the listing is wrong on that because when I called, the hostess said they did not take reservations, but would happily put our name down when we were going to head in.  It was still a little early, so I called back about 30 minutes later to put my name in, however we took a little long getting over to Mandalay Bay from the Wynn, and they had apparently already called my name.

Not to worry, she bumped us back up, gave me a buzzer, and said it would still be about 20 minutes since we did have a party of 11.

We finally sat down and overall, the décor and ambience of this places feels like Daily Grill meets a sports bar.  The booths on the right were had dark wood high backs, yet while the dark wood bar still resembled something out of a Western movie saloon, they had several televisions all along the back wall.  It was fully stocked as well.  They took a page from Barney's Beanery and each booth had it's own television.  Down the middle were a series of tables and our table was set up near the back, closet to the kitchen.

Our server Renee, was really cool and cute too.  She looked a little bit like a cheerleader right out of high school, with her hair in pigtails and her bright yet borderline smile, she was actually really nice and took good care of us.  And no, I don't mean in ""that"" way.  Pervs....

The menu is simple: burgers and burgers.  On the left, they had some preset burgers, which I'm sure were meticulously decided upon by Chef Keller.  There was one burger called the ""Rossini Burger"" and it was a burger consisting of American Kobe beef, seared foie gras, and black truffles.  While it sounded AWESOME, I was not ready to fork up $60 for a burger.  I was almost going to suggest we get that as a table and split the cost.  But to no avail.

The other side of the menu consists of building your own burger.  The concept is not new with places like The Counter, 5 Guys Burgers and Fries, and a few other places, but Hubert Keller included the typical add ons such as avocado, caramelized onions, aioli, and various cheeses, but he brings in a variety of gourmet items such as foie gras ($12), black truffles ($30 for 1\/3 oz), Portobello mushrooms, and sauces such as a red wine and shallot reduction.

You start with your meat.  You have a choice of chuck, angus, American Kobe, buffalo and turkey.  The basic burger will run about $9-11 or $17 for the Kobe and is topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and a pickle wedge.  Then there are the add-ons.  Everything were of various prices, but quite reasonable and expected.  Cheeses were $.70, condiments ranged from $1 to $1.50, an avocado was about $2.50?  In all, you had a choice of I would say at least 2 dozen items.  Of course the gourmet items (as listed above) were more expensive.

I got the angus with both Monterey jack and provolone cheese, caramelized onions, aioli (should've gotten the chipotle aioli) and proscuitto.  You have a choice of plain, sesame, wheat, or ciabatta (I think there was one more?) as your bun.  I decided to just play it safe and go with a plain bun.

Most of the reviews I had read and raved about the sweet potato fries, and for $2.85, you can order an individual portion as your side.

Our food came out and the burger looked and smelled delicious.

I couldn't really tell between my 2 cheeses, but oh well.  The meat was well seasoned and while it wasn't a perfect combination of flavors, I really liked all of my toppings.  The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy but not overcooked, so I really liked that.

Overall, I think everybody liked it.  I've heard small things here and there that they didn't like, but I consider it a successful meal.  They apparently also have build your own milkshakes, but I think that would have absolutely sent me over the top.

* Bad Service
* Uncooked food

Not appealing. I went here 2 nights ago. I've heard nothing but great things about this place. We went on a Wednesday night, not 'peak' Vegas season or anything, it was busy, we waited over 40 minutes for food - and with my 3 year old, that does not work. When we got our food, it was not cooked. My husband asked for medium - I think they showed that patty the grill and that was it. I like medium well on a burger, it was barely medium. There was a long period of time where I didn't see ANY food coming out of the kitchen.

As for the taste. It was ok. I had an angus burger, on ciabatta with jalapeno bacon and guacamole. Not great. Sweet potato fries were great. My 3 year old had the chicken strips from the kids menu, those were pretty standard.

I would not come back. I can tolerate a lot of things, but not impossibly slow service and uncooked food. The waiter was nice enough, but to be honest, the PIZZA SLICE place around the corner seemed like THE place to be. Packed, loud and everyone looked happy.

Angus with monterey jack, portabello mushrooms, and pesto sauce.

But the pesto did taste awesome with the fries, so it wasn't a total loss. The burger was nice, but not as juicy as I was hoping (I guess angus is a leaner beef) and I thought the meat could use a little seasoning--found myself adding salt.

Other people in the party I was with had the black jack burger and the Hubert Keller burger which they seemed to enjoy quite a bit.

The fries were pretty tasty--we had the thick fries and the potato fries--and the zucchini fries were pretty awesome--perhaps the highlight of the meal.

They have a really nice selection of beers but also happened to run out of the one paticular beer I ordered, so I ended up getting a caramel latte milkshake, which I enjoyed most out off all the items I ordered.

In the end, the bill for four of us was about $130 including tax and tip...perhaps a little more than you'd anticipate from a burger joint, and quite a bit more than I would be willing to pay to go back...maybe I will have to try BLT Burger next time...

The Burger Bar was one of them and had an enticing concept - I could build my own burger. However, once I sat down, the menu itself with pre-determined types of burgers looked fantastic already. I could've built my own milkshake but their choices rocked already.

So what did I do? I opted for a brewski while my co-worker couldn't resist the Nutella milkshake (seriously, a NUTELLA MILKSHAKE!). I snagged a bottle of Deschutes Black Butte Porter for $5 which wasn't too shabby considering it was Vegas. Her milkshake was probably around $8 and oh so delicious. It was creamy and full of Nutella goodness without being overwhelming. There was nice thick consistency to the drink that a lot of milkshakes seem to miss when they are too thin or too thick. My porter was nice and smooth but didn't pair all too well with my burger. Regardless, I enjoyed it!

I opted to grab some buttermilk zucchini fries with my peppercorn burger (NatureSource beef with fresh and dried peppercorn, Dijon mustard, peppercorn cream, tomato, red onion, and lettuce) since I prefer them over regular fries. Aren't they healthier? Well anyhow, they were deep-fried to perfection and great with the ranch I asked the waitress for. The burger, now that was something. When you price a burger at $18, you get a lot of expectations from the client (well and again, it was Vegas). I think Burger Bar delivered. My peppercorn was just the right amount of peppery spice; I think the fresh peppercorn really gave a sweeter twist to the meal. The patty cooked medium rare really staved off my beefy desire as its natural juiciness made the meat so desirable. Paired with the creamy peppercorn sauce, it was fabulous burger. How did I deal with the guilt of such a huge burger? Whole wheat bun!",4,4,3

Perhaps it was Boulud, perhaps Keller.....at some point someone decided that a 99cent cheeseburger at McDonalds simply wasn't enough.  Foie Gras, Truffles, Shrimp, Lobster.....you name it, you got it.  While I do find it odd that I found myself being led into Burger Bar by my friend when I don't particularly like beef and don't eat burgers, I will admit to have had a few in the past and my all-time was the Thurman Burger in Columbus Ohio, a famous one in its own right.  In a day that included Tableau for breakfast and Alex for dinner I must say I didn't expect much from the Burger Bar....but I was pleasantly surprised.
 
While the Bar was located in a shopping mall at Mandalay Bay I didn't judge....most of Vegas feels like a mall anyhow and Per Se in NYC is located in a mall, as well.  Arriving around 2:30pm there was a line...a good sign I guess....our names were taken and 10 minutes later we found ourselves seated at a 4-top in the middle of the restaurant.  While the place was quite loud, conversation was quite easy and our menus were delivered quickly.  With 5-6 bread options, 5-6 meat options, 40-50 topping options, plus desserts it actually took longer to order than we had imagined.  Eventually I settled on the Turkey Burger on Ciabatta with grilled Shrimp, Pesto, and a side order of Sweet Potato fries while my buddy opted for the Kobe Beef Burger with Sharp Cheddar and Hickory Bacon on Whole Wheat with Spicy Skinny Fries and a sampler of beers.
 
As the place was busy we chatted for a bit and I decided to get up and explore.  Much to my surprise the kitchen was wide open for viewing and I wandered about to realize how fresh all the ingredients were, the bread being baked in visible ovens, and the meats stored in large lockers.  Everything appeared very hygienic and clean, very much unlike your average burger shack.  By the time I arrived back at the table my buddy was working on his beer and approximately two minutes later the food arrived.  While I spent a moment dressing my burger and eating my incredibly garlicky pickle spear, I heard my buddy partially-moan....clearly he was loving this burger.
 
Once my burger was adequately dressed and I had a large pile of ketchup for my fries it was time to dig in.  Crisp ciabatta with a fluffy interior first greeted my tongue followed by the wonderful basil blast of the pesto mingling with plump and tender shrimp and well cooked yet juicy turkey.  Great texture, quality ingredients, wonderful flavor, well cooked....what more can you ask for in a burger?  I next dug into the fries which were simply fantastic and #3 only to Michael Mina's Duck Fat Fries and Michael Symon's Lola Fries in terms of crispy outside and soft\/salty inside.  I do find it rather unfortunate that the restaurant did not order an organic\/original ketchup given the quality of the ingredients otherwise, but I guess a minimal amount of HFCS won't kill me.
 
Having finished off our burgers and laughing more at the PTI analysis of the USC\/Oregon State result my buddy and I opted for a dessert burger - the chocolate version featuring a split donut topped with a chocolate gnache puck, mango ""cheese"", and strawberries.  Humorous in presentation and tasty in flavor, this choice was excellent and split down the middle this ""burger"" was just enough after the huge burger\/fries.  The mango cheese was especially surprising in its fresh taste and jello-like texture while the chocolate puck was so rich I doubt I'd have finished one myself.  The donut was a tad dry, IMO, but didn't hurt the burger overall.
 
All told I liked the energy and the food at Burger Bar.  While certainly our most ""low class"" meal, I actually enjoyed the experience and the pricetag more than Sensi and Craftsteak and my buddy loved it which was excellent since he humored me in going to so many French restaurants on the weekend.  IMO, foie and truffles are best served by a chef like Stratta or Savoy and not on a piece of beef and buried under toppings...the concept of the Rossini Burger is ludicrous and anyone ordering it is showing off and missing out on the opportunity for more originality and customization at a lower price.  Regardless, to each his\/her own and I think the concept of designer burgers has a lot to offer...even if the underdressed and uncustomizable option at Father's Office is still the standard by which most burgers are judged.",4,0,2

They sound like typical bar food, but these were done right. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Not too greasy and not a hint of sogginess. 

I opted for the ""build your own burger"" option.  Chose the Angus Beef, sesame seed bun; topped with: smoked gouda, bacon, over easy egg, lettuce, tomato, onion, and of course TUFFLE MAYO. The truffle mayo was absolutely amazing and is a MUST when you check it out. It takes a special kind of mayo for me to dip my fries in there. I've never in my life dipped my fries in mayo... but I wiped that shit clean. 

My girl got the same except Ciabatta bread and caramelized onions. Instead of the mayo she got the Chipotle Aioli. Also very good.

I LOVE Father's office burger and now I love Hubert Keller's burger!  I really don't know why I like Buffalo burger so much, but I just find them so flavorful and juicy but with texture and not mushy like beef tends to be sometime when it is too juicy.

$22 IS a bit overpriced for a burger.  But attaching a name like Hubert Keller is like buying a $2,000 Prada bag if you love good food lol.

The restaurant is literally a Burger Bar.  It looks like a kick back sports bar that serves burgers.  There seems to be always a wait to get seated at this restaurant, but if you don't mind sitting at the bar, it's pretty easy to grab a seat since people who sit at the bar are always on the go.

Hubert Keller said on Top Chef masters that he serves $5,000 burgers and they people actually order them... I wonder what's in his $5,000 burger!

Next time I come here, I want to try building my own burger :) yummy!!!

I made a mistake, his $5000 burger is served at Fleur de Lys, his other restaurant at Mandalay Bay.

Anyhow, lucky for me, after arriving in Las Vegas at an hour too obscenely late for there surely to be anything open but a fly-by-night diner on the side of the highway, there stood Burger Bar...in a swanky hotel, without bean pole, Texas haired ladies in stilettos strutting outside its doors. (I would only later learn that fine eateries are ALWAYS open in Vegas.)

Starting with the trio of fries, I found myself dunking perfectly crisp, perfectly plump salty slices of sweet potato, regular potato and zucchini into an assortment of sauces. Not since my days as a humble saloon girl had so many luxuriously creamy flavors of dips been set in front of me. The miraculous thing about the creamy, slightly spicy chipotle aioli, the sweet and savory white BBQ sauce (a Ranch + Masterpiece concoction any Kansan would recognize) and the sticky, smooth yet viscous honey mustard is that none of them were cancer inducing. Take that Skools!

The Kobe beef burger cooked medium rare offered a nice crisp sear on the outside, and when cut into glistened with a reddish pink indigenous knowledge to any mid-rare expert chef. Not only was this burger as smooth as a swig of the finest vermouth, but when topped with caramelized onions, chopped jalapenos and spicy ketchup, offers your mouth a loving amalgamation of meaty, sweet, savory, crispy and smooth. Ordinary burgers be damned...I'll no longer settle for anything less than Kobe Beef (I'm now broke).

We tried the fries sampler with fat fries, skinny fries, and onion rings and all were cooked to perfection. I enjoyed every bite of them. Now....One of the BEST burgers I have ever had. Was the one they let me create through their nifty ""Create a burger"" section on their menu. You get to choose the type of meat, bun, toppings, cheese, anything you can think of to create your perfect burger. I got mine with a Wheat bun, Kobe Beef, Red wine sauce, pepper jack cheese, and jalapenos. The burger was soooo JUICY. Incredible. Delicious. Mouth watering! It is very hard to compare to any other burger I have had in recent memory. Although the Kobe beef makes it a little more pricey at $24 for the entire burger it was definitely worth the money.

My amazing girlfriend brought me here on our recent Vegas getaway. This is one of the best burgers I have ever had. Yes I just said that. One of the best burgers I have ever had and I have had a lot of them. I love cheeseburgers. I think I am ruined on burgers after this.
It is a nice place. One long bar with tables and some cool booths. I think it is great that they can text you now when your table is ready. No buzzer to carry around and if the wait is long you can wander farther away. It is a sign that this was the busiest place in this little area. There are a lot of other restaurants in this little area but this was the busiest. I now know why.
You can build your own burger and shake. Anything you want. Really anything. If you really go crazy you can get a $100 burger. You think that is crazy but I would say from the first bite you would say it was worth it. Mine came in about $20 and it was so good. From the first bite to the last. I didn't even get anything crazy. I just got an Angus patty, cooked medium, jalapeno bacon, Swiss cheese, a fried egg and their spicy ketchup. It is tempting to pile stuff on because you see so many toppings that you like but trust me 4 is enough. Too many and you have too many flavors going on and you overwhelm the burger. Mine was just about perfect. Cooked just right. It feel apart when you bit into it and melted in your mouth. The jalapeno bacon and the spicy ketchup had just the right amount of kick. Just what I was looking for.
For the shake I got chocolate ice cream with Oreos, hot fudge and mini marshmallows with whipped cream on top. The straw is huge. Almost hard to get your mouth around but big enough so nothing gets caught. It was so good too. Creamy and chocolaty. So good.
The service was great too. Water always full. They gave us time to pick out exactly what we wanted.
I really can't wait to go back. We almost went back a few times but wanted to try other places. Guaranteed when we come back to Vegas this will be one of our first stops. For sure.",7,3,5

Yes, there are more inventive burger joints that can probably serve you a Kobe bull ball burger with  llama milk cheese and exotic micro herbs grown in the Siberian tundra with a side of a previously thought to be extinct potato fries all for $10.99.

So why the Burger Bar?

- Hubert Keller.  His passion for cooking, standards of quality and utmost respect for ingredients shines in his humble burger joint.  

- Extremely high quality burger meats: Angus, Nature Source (USDA prime antibiotic and hormone free), Australian Wagyu, bison, free range turkey, and lamb.

- Always perfectly cooked to order (I have never had a single burger under\/over cooked).

- Incredible quality, perfectly cooked toppings that could be side dishes in any great steakhouse (from grilled asparagus to uber sweet deeply caramelized onions, a porky jalepeno bacon with a spicy finish, sautéed oyster mushrooms, pan seared foie, perfectly cooked sweet Maine lobster, to fresh cheeses, and black truffles).  

- Well seasoned, perfectly cooked sides.  Crispy fries, onion rings and outstanding zucchini fries made to order.  No soggy 20 minute old stuff here.

- Outstanding selection of seasonal and micro brews on tap backed by a huge selection of bottles.


Build your own or try a chef's invention.  The Rossini ($60) is to die for.  Topped with a slice of foie and shaved black truffles.  Orgasmic!  The Surf and Turf is not far behind.  A delicious combo of grilled asparagus and half a lobster top a thick, juicy burger.  OMG!

The price matches the quality with most creations with fries between $15-$25.

Service is extremely friendly and efficient (especially at the bar).

Very hard to beat.  Highly Recommended.",19,13,19

The environment here makes me think of a higher end biker bar. All the waitresses are wearing hip hugger jeans, tight black spaghetti straps with their midriffs showing, cleavage popping and their tramp stamps proud and loud. That said, the waitresses are all very sweet and accommodating. 

I ordered the Hubert Keller burger which is a buffalo on ciabatta bread with spinach, caramelized onions, blue cheese, and the usual condiments. I liked it a lot, and it was very juicy as well. I loved the sweet potato fries which the waitress allowed me to substitute at no additional cost.

 My other party member built their own burger: kobe beef with mushrooms, caramelized onions, avocado, and some other condiments that escape my memory. That was actually significantly better than the Hubert Keller burger I had, perhaps it was due to a preference in the meat selection. 

The sizes are filling and I was glad I didn't order a shake, even though I really wanted to. I wouldn't have been able to finish both my burger and a shake without rolling off the escalator in a food coma induced state.

We had came here kind of late in the evening as friend came into town around 0915PM. By the time we got down to Mandalay Bay, parked, and found the restaurant, it was closer to 1000PM. 

Oh side note, the restaurant is located between Mandalay Bay and Luxor, in the shoppes, more towards Luxor, so it may seem like a little walk before you see it. 

We were promptly seated within a few seconds of requesting for a table. The place was fairly empty. 1\/2 full or maybe less. Mainly with some larger groups. 

Typically we don't really go to burger places unless this friend is in town. He's a huge fan and lover of burgers so its almost became a tradition to go to a burger place or a pizza place. 

My party was a party of 4, 2 being larger guys, 1 tiny girl, and an average sized guy. We were sat at a booth. 2 larger guys can but definitely wont be comfortable sitting on the same side. These booths are more toward the smaller side, even for 4 people. 

Our waitress came shortly to take our drink orders. Then a few minutes later, our meal orders. 

Their burgers are more on the pricey side but as expected from a restaurant inside a casino, and from a more named chef. 

I had ordered the reuben. Our burger loving friend got the hangover burger. My tiny female friend (lol...) got the American classic with bacon on the side (shes not a fan of bacon, nor am I), and our other friend got a salmon burger

------------------

""The Reuben"" consists of a black angus beef patty topped with sauerkraut, corned beef, homemade mustard and swiss cheese on a whole grain bun served with a side of skinny fries priced at $19.80

""The Hangover"" consists of a black angus beef patty smothered in hangover sauce topped with chopped lettuce on a sesame bun served with FAT fries priced at $13.95

The ""American Classic"" consists of a black angus beef patty topped with American cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion on a sesame bun served with a side of skinny fries priced at $15.40

The ""Evolve Salmon"" consists of grilled salmon topped with roma tomatoes, baby spinach on a multi grain bun served with a side salad with lemon vinaigrette priced at $15.65

------------------

Food came out fairly quick. Most of us ordered medium for our patties with exception for the ""American Classic"" being medium rare. They were all cooked at about the same doneness of about a medium. A nice crust with a warm red center. Also, another ""consistent"" thing that we felt was in all our burgers was the patty was severely underseasoned. My friend opened up her burger and went ham on sprinkling salt on hers. I just sprinkled sparingly before every few bites. A little salt went a LONG way and it definitely helped. 

When my burger ""The Reuben"" first arrived, I was like WTCRAP I got 3 small slivers of corned beef? then my friend told me he sees it under the melted cheese. Lol almost flipped the table for paying such a higher premium for 3 slivers. With the added salt, the burger was fairly tasty. The bread used was nicely toasted, and had a good firmness to it without being hard. 

Skinny fries was about the same thickness as, per se, fries from McDonalds. Not bad. Comes with a nice pickle spear too. Dunoe why the ""Evolve Salmon"" came with 2 spears vs our 1. Om nom nom pickle. XD 

Friend had mentioned the ""hangover sauce"" is similar to thousand island dressing, maybe something like spread from In n out too. xD 

All in all. Decent place. Friend thoroughly enjoyed it. Ate his own and finished my friends 1\/3 left over. I've never been much of a burger lover so it was ok to me. Lol

Someone help me understand how there can be so many people - legendary Las Vegas-based Yelpers that I have much respect for - that live in a town that has BLT Burger, StripBurger, Bradley Ogden, Daniel Boulud, Stack... and yet still stamp the holy, golden '5-star' on Burger Bar.  When it comes to burgers, unless it's a $1000 burger served in some back alley by a gorilla, I personally don't really care about the price, venue, wait, or even the service.  If you're gonna give this joint 5-stars, I think you need to be prepared to tell me that this is gonna be the BEST...[grrr]... BURGER... [arrrrgh!]...EVVVVERRRR!! [HULKSMASH]!!!!!   (Oh, and compare it to a known quantity, please.)

1) THE TEST
I strolled into Burger Bar the other day (after waving to & observing the flirtatious ""Minus 5 girls"" for a minute - big ups to 'Leo C' for the mention in his review) & bought two burgers:   This ""Rossini Burger"" & this other Angus Beef Burger with grilled onions, avocado, and swiss.  That's right.  Eff it.  I'm on vacation, b-tches.

2) THE TASTE
I hunkered down and tried each of these things, disregarding size or accompaniments.
-- Rossini:  It was pretty GOOD... but it just wasn't OMGWTFGREAT. The beef was quite tasty and rich but the one thing I expected more of was the robust truffle flavor that I thought would be there and that didn't really come through... I question why they even add it.  And the Foie Gras thing was weird - I suppose I expected something a little more... ""fois gras-like"" and what I got... wasn't.  Did they make my burger, right?  I mean it still tasted good but the texture wasn't what I'd expected. 
-- Angus:  Again, not BAD... but just not that GOOD.  The beef wasn't nearly as juicy as the Rossini nor was it as flavorful which is to be expected I guess but to put this into perspective, I think a slightly better burger is purchasable through the Venetian's Room Service.  That's all I'll have to say about that.

3) THE COMPARATIVES
Think of this as, ""Two burgers go in; one burger comes out"".  I'm going to dump the Angus burger since I didn't think it was outstanding & nuanced enough to 'compete' and strictly compare the Rossini against some other burgers I've had from memory.  With the exception of Bradley Ogden, you may assume that I expressly order their best beef with avocado and some onions.

-- BRADLEY OGDEN beats Burger Bar
-- BLT BURGER beats Burger Bar (this was close)
-- BURGER BAR beats Stack (this was even closer)
-- BURGER BAR beats StripBurger

CONCLUSION
I don't think Burger Bar produces the finest burger in Las Vegas.  It's more like something somewhere in the middle... which of course is fine.  I boxed the Rossini Burger, because... well, I'm not gonna leave behind a frickin' $60+tax+tip burger on a plate for them to dump.  But it's sitting here in my hotel room after having made the taxi ride home and sadly I don't think I'm going to finish it.  Nor do I think I'll go back for another when Red Square's got such tasty casual tapas dishes on the other side of the hotel.  

3-stars.

It pains me to give Burger Bar four stars.  First of all, I'm not typically a burger type of gal, except when it comes to In n Out, but everything surpassed my expectations and was super tasty.  Unfortunately, my burger's lobster was overcooked and service slightly disappointed me.  :(  


BURGERS:
Hubert Keller burger - Buffalo, caramelized onions, baby spinach, blue cheese on a ciabatta bun.  The buffalo added the perfect amount of gaminess to give this burger a good earthy kick with the blue cheese to add a mildness to it.  Which was slightly odd since blue cheese has so much flavor and usually packs a bold punch.  Everything harmonized beautifully and I was happy to chomp away. 

Surf & Turf - Black Angus, grilled half lobster, grilled green asparagus on a plain bun.  Sadly, the lobster was overcooked and was chewy.  Other then that, the green asparagus complemented this burger perfectly.

American Classic - Black Angus beef, America cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion on a sesame bun.  A very good basic burger.  The juiciness of the beef makes this one exceptional.


SIDES:
Sweet potato fries - Hands down the sweet potato fries won the sides battle.  They were very typical very good sweet potato fries.  Good ratio of sweetness and saltiness, and nice and crispy

Onion rings - These babies reminded me of the onion rings you get at Carl's Jr. with the same texture and crispiness.  The biggest difference between the ones at Burger Bar is that the onions doesn't slide right out of the ring.  :) 

Aioli - Do yourself a favor and just get it.  It's so good.  I wanted to cover my hands with this sauce and lick it all day.  I know it sounds absolutely disgusting, but it was soooooo good!!

Zucchini fries, Skinny fries, Fat fries - They're all good, but not amazing.


From a service standpoint, I was a bit disappointed because we told the server that it was my friend's birthday.  Sadly, she didn't bring us a little burger dessert, but we were stuffed beyond all belief to even fathom having another bite.

Here's a little note.  Keep their number on hand.  Even though they don't take reservations, you can call them to ask them for a wait time and to put your party on the list.  It's almost like a fast pass for the Burger Bar.  :)",3,3,2

my onion rings were very crisp. Always a plus.

Keller does great with this one. My only complaint. My Rossini came with a dessert burger. It was basically a Krispy Kreme donut with ganace and passion fruit jello. I make a divine ganache and this was just too much. the slice of ganache was so think that it ruined it. too much chocolate and you got a headache.

This place rocks about 6 of their own signature burgers which I find to be kind of low for a Celebrity Chef. With a chef of this caliber I would have loved to have seen more options. I love the idea of having choices, but sometimes can use the guidance of a professional... especially a known professional.

You also have the option of completely designing your own burger from the buns, to the meats, to the cheeses, and to the toppings.

Your meats range anywhere from your everyday 80\/20 blend of ground beef all they way up to American Kobe which is a delicious blend of Black Angus Beef and Japanese Wagyu Beef. Since it's not actual Japanese Kobe Beef one can experience the next best thing next to the original for a fraction of the cost!

I'm not really a gamblin man so dropping $25 bucks on a great Cheeseburger is no big deal for me... and the experience last longer than how quickly I don't achieve 21!

I've been here a couple of times, but an example of one of the burgers I constructed was this: American Kobe Beef Patty, tender Grilled Onions, an Over Easy Egg, crispy delicious Bacon, American Cheese, and a perfectly balanced BBQ Sauce with Sweet Potato Fries. I found this combination most mouth watering and delicious that had my eyes rolling in the back of my head in pure culinary ecstasy. The burger was smooth and juicy and was complemented exquisitely by the other components of this burg!

I just couldn't bring myself to giving them a perfect score because some ""Amuse Douche"" server that was working on that visit just made my entire visit simply horrible. He was arrogant, argumentative, and his facial expressions were appalling. Someone definitely woke up on the wrong side of the bed that morning in turn leaving (pun intended) a bad taste in my mouth.

Decor inside is modern and warm.

I ordered mine medium well and they delivered. And since this is a Hubert Keller restaurant, if they cook it wrong, I don't think they'd mind if you sent it back.

I was amazed by the variety of toppings you could add to your burger ranging from dairy to culinary delicacies. I had the Kobe Beef burger with Cinnamon Bacon, and Swiss Cheese. It was delicous the Kobe Beef just melted in my mouth as I heard Kobe Beef is supposed to do. I also had a Black and White Milkshake which was fantastic, and they give you the rest of the can. Overall, a most go for any burger lover. The atmosphere was definetly not the fine dining I was expecting at Mandalay Bay, it was more like a wild west saloon.

Okay, the restaurant itself isn't really glamorous; it's a typical bar\/burger joint. At the time I dined here, the 2010 World Cup was going on, so the place was packed with testosterone-driven men of different nationalities, screaming and getting heated up. But the food is another story. That's right. I'm talking about the legendary: The Rossini. Rossini burger may overwhelm you at first. When I first saw the description, I thought to myself, ""Sure, I enjoy Kobe beef, foie gras, and black truffles, but all in one setting, in a form of burger?"" After minutes of serious hesitation, I decided to order it. If I don't enjoy the burger, oh well, at least I would have gained an invaluable experience.

Okay, the burger was good. But of course, it should be good; it has three of the most treasured ingredients in the culinary field after all. But after a couple of bites, I started to feel the heaviness of the burger and I was done before I could even finish half of the burger.

Burger Bar is located in Mandalay Place, the shopping area that's technically part of Mandalay Place, but the restaurant is actually closer to the Luxor.

If you're going just for your basic hamburger, it may be overpriced, but this place is all about customization and outlandishness in building YOUR perfect burger.

This is how I built mine:
- American kobe beef burger, medium rare
- Ciabatta bun
- Sauteed portobello mushrooms
- Seared foie gras
+ side of onion rings

Are you sitting down? My burger easily cost $35, and it was worth every penny. And I would gladly pay it again. Just know that it's very likely your burger won't be that expensive, and it will still be very good.

They didn't skimp on the foie gras, enough in fact for me to take a slice of it to enjoy separately.  The ciabatta was perfect for absorbing all the delicious juices and foie gras fat without disintegrating.  Man, I'm drooling just thinking about it again... if someone pointed a gun to my head and said, ""You must make love to a food item of your choice!"" this would be it. Rar!

Our food came out after 30 minutes and my burger was dry and not good at all. My friends burger was fine, she said it was alright but we both have had much better food elsewhere.  The prices are high as well for such crap meat. Go to stripburger instead.",0,0,0

The Burger Bar is LOCATED in the Mandalay Palace (Between The Mandalay Bay and Luxor walkway) is one of my favorite places to get a burger in LV. One, I love the 

QUALITY OF MEAT. They have great choices to choose from such as Angus, Lamb, Buffalo and my favorite Kobe. Not only is the meat good, they also have great buns. I think they work out a lot. PRICES here are very reasonable and in my opinion, excellent for the quality of food. If you a balla or if you just won a few bucks gambling then I would recommend you try the ROSSINI. It's a 60 dollar burger that is made with Wagyu Beef and foie gras.  I can tell you that it's worth it (If your a burger lover and like foie gras that is) Similar to other burger joints, the Burger Bar offers specialty burgers or you can customize your own. My recommendation would be to do both if your with someone else or if your really hungry. 

The ENVIRONMENT here looks like  your average bar and grill. Dim lighting and lots of TV's.  They even have TV's in every booth. This place has always been crowded and there was always a wait list whenever I ate here. I have said this in many of my other reviews but if you don't like to wait then go and eat early to beat the crowd. 

The SERVICE has been good on both visits. They took care of us well which was pretty impressive considering how busy they get.

Overall, I can always count on this place to satisfy my burger needs whenever I am in LV.  I give this place 5 stars because I believe that the quality of food for the PRICE to go along with their SERVICE is worth it.",10,5,8

OK, full disclosure: I'm a vegetarian rating a burger place. Most people will think I don't know what I'm talking about. Fine, whatever. Since I don't eat meat, I have become very picky about my veggie burgers. Most places that serve them give you a frozen patty that was made in a factory somewhere and the waitress has no idea what it is. Blah... Burger Bar is NOT like that. They may emphasize the meat, but it was one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. (Only one better is the black bean burger at Malibu Grill in Bloomington, Indiana).

My dining companions enjoyed their meaty burgers, and they said their sweet potato fries were very tasty. I was in the mood for more exotic fare, so I got the zucchini fries. WOW!!! Freaking awesome! Gimme more!

This is a great place for quality burgers. You can choose from one of the many different burgers on the menu or build your own. They have a ton of beers on tap,and a bunch of neat cocktails. I tried the Salted Caramel martini. Definitely very strong, but perhaps a little TOO salty for my taste. 

We tried a few burgers when we came in this weekend. 
I ordered a Grilled Chicken burger on an onion bun with a fried egg and truffle mayo.
The grilled chicken was really tender and moist. The onion bun was fresh and sooo soft. The fried egg was perfectly runny, and the mayo was so darn tasty! There were flecks of black truffle in the mayo, giving the mayo an awesome kick of truffle flavor. YUM!

The peppercorn burger was also a hit. The beef was cooked to a perfect medium with a hint of pink. They really piled on the peppercorns on the burger!  The sweet potato fries were fantastic as well. Probably some of the best ones I've had in a while.

Of course, we had to order the ROSSINI BURGER with Foie gras and black truffles.  Yes it is $60, but SO WORTH IT. The richness of the foie gras and the bold flavor of the truffles added so much flavor to the tender Wagyu beef. This has got to be the BEST burger I've ever had. The beef was so tender and the flavors were just heavenly. Since the burger is 60 bucks, they let you choose any side you want with the burger and you also get a free dessert! We tried the mac and cheese croquettes and the chocolate dessert burger.  The croquettes were good, but paled in comparison to the burger. 

The chocolate dessert burger was really good. Awesome dessert that works so well with the burger theme. The warm donut 'bun' was really good. It worked so well with the nutella mousse (the patty) and the passion fruit jelly (cheese). The richness and the tartness balanced each other out very nicely. It was a great way to end our meal!

Service was good. Our waiter was very nice, he was a little hard to track down, but  whatever, we were so focused on our food. I don't think we really cared. It's a little far from where I usually play on the strip, but it's a great place to get food on our way into or out of Vegas.",1,0,1

There are several reasons to visit Hubert Keller's Burger Bar.  It is from a celebrity chef (Hubert Keller), but it is a relatively inexpensive restaurant (at least compared to the many expensive celebrity chef backed fine dining restaurants on The Strip).  It also primarily features two items--burgers and milkshakes--that are very popular.  Finally, Hubert Keller was on Top Chef Masters and showcased this restaurant as well as his burger skills so many might be intrigued with this one if they saw that season of Top Chef Masters on the Food Network.

This Burger Bar (there is also one located in the Macy's in San Francisco) is housed in Mandalay Place--a mini-mall within Mandalay Bay that features a few retail and dining options.  It is a fairly small place and the menu showcases a build-your-own-burger concept where you pick your burger protein--several types of beef, lamb, buffalo, turkey, and veggie as well as chicken breast and salmon.  You then choose your desired bun as well as all kinds of toppings including raw vegetables, grilled vegetables, many types of cheese (standard stuff like American and cheddar but also brie and smoked Gouda), several sauces, additional proteins like bacon and prosciutto, and finally a few premium ingredients like seared foie gras and black truffle.  You can also order one of their signature chef's burger creations so you do not have to make any choices.

In addition to their burgers, Burger Bar also serves all kinds of fried food from French fries and onion rings to zucchini fries and mozzarella sticks.  Chicken wings and a few salads are available too.

I went the build-your-own-burger route and opted for their Prime ground beef and added bacon, smoked Gouda and spinach on a potato bun.  The burger was okay.  I thought the burger at the newer Gordon Ramsay BurGR was much better--the beef was much juicier there and it featured both a higher quality bun as well as higher quality toppings.  The burger at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar was okay, but only the really thick and meaty (crispy but also chewy) bacon stood out.  The bun felt very plain for a gourmet burger spot.

I also opted for one of their milkshakes.  They have all kinds of milkshakes from build-your-own-milkshakes with many toppings to signature creations.  I tried their caramel latte, which featured coffee ice cream, caramel syrup, graham crackers, and butterscotch morsels.  It was a great mix of caramel and coffee and the milkshake had a great thick and creamy consistency (very addictive and hard to put down).

Service was good--pleasant and quick.

Prices are reasonable for a notable Las Vegas restaurant.  Burger Bar's prices are higher than similar gourmet burger restaurants in other big cities like Los Angeles, but that is to be expected given that Burger Bar is on The Strip.  Burger Bar does offer a decent meal that comes at a much lower price than the many celebrity chef backed (and very pricey) fine dining restaurants on The Strip.

I remember liking Burger Bar more on my first trip.  It is not too surprising that the quality has dropped since then; the quality standards at many Vegas restaurants seem to slip if it has been around for a long time.  Hubert Keller's Burger Bar is still a decent spot, but Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood is a much better option for an gourmet burger on The Strip.

Maybe it's their policy to try to comp as little as possible, but the entire situation was handled extremely poorly. Both my friend and I are involved in the fine dining food and beverage industry in one way or another, we are well aware of how most good restaurants on the strip will bend over backwards to make customers happy. Instead of apologizing and\/or offering some kind of compensation for the dissatisfaction, the manager came out and proceeded to argue with us for a good 10 minutes about their general policy about unsatisfactory items, and as long as nothing was technically wrong with the product (i.e. spoiled or whatever) they wouldn't do anything else about the situation. And then he had the nerve to tell us about how he would only take it off the bill if we were going to leave ""extremely unhappy"", and that he was already losing money on the sale as it was. This, after a bottle of champagne was sitting out at room temp for over 20 minutes, becoming warm and flat. After a while we just got tired of all the arguing and told him to do what he had to do, paid the bill, and left.  

Needless to say he's lost at least 2 repeat customers, not to mention our significant others and countless number of friends who I'll make sure will never go here.",1,0,0

THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD!!! 
\/END REVIEW\/

Nothing more needs to be said.... well worth the money. Well worth the experience.

I had burger combo... which includes ""skinny"" fries. We also ordered the assorted dipping sauces for an additional $2 bucks (well worth it). I also had an additional side of onion rings.... amazing! 

They have a HUGE beer selection, including many on tap. That's in addition to all the custom milkshakes you can conjure up! 

Here is my overall take on this place.
- It's Vegas! Most good food (especially in a report hotel) costs a few bucks more. 
- It's a celebrity chef restaurant. Nuff Said.
- The prices are *not* stupid outrageous! I mean... have you ever eaten in a ""Five Guys"" restaurant?? You spend plenty for those burgers... and the Burger Bar is FAR superior for a few bucks more.
- The service was awesome.

I had a great lunch here, and am anxious to come back when I am back in town.",5,1,2

Waiters were very polite and attentive. 
The sweet potato fries and fat fries were delicious.

Cons: Waited 40 minutes on our food. I figured it was because I ordered a medium well spicy lamb burger. To my surprise, it was not my burger because what I received was an extremely rare burger with well done sticks poking out.  Like I said the waitress was on point and she was prompt in delivering a new burger.  The new one I received was cooked properly but unfortunately, my first bite left much to be desired. The taste of the meat was bland and there was no spicyness whatsoever. I was starving from the wait so I tried to stomach it but I couldn't even finish it.  

Save your money and either cook your own burger or stop by Bachi Burger. Not coming back here again.",0,0,0

We went on a Friday night, so  it was jam-packed. Upon checking in with the (very disinterested) hostess, we found out that the wait was going to be at least 30 minutes unless we found a seat at the bar. We scoped out the bar and finally found two handicapped accessible seats at the very back. Hey, I'd sit at the kids table if it meant that I'd get to eat sooner. Luckily, two people at the main bar left and husband was able to snag their seats. No kiddie table for us, yay!

Of course, sitting at the bar meant that the service was a little slow, but it wasn't horrible. The bartender was friendly, so that goes a long way.  The food definitely made up for it.  We got an appetizer of the jalepeno beer-battered fried pickles, which stayed piping hot all the way to the last bite. Husband got the surf and turf burger and fries ($24) while I made my own: American ""Kobe"", medium-well, oyster mushrooms, monterey-jack cheese, and bacon. Side of sweet-potato fries ($22). I don't know if it was a $22 burger- I could have done without the bacon, but it was fantastic. DH couldn't keep his hands off my sweet potato fries, either.

But then again anything worth having is worth waiting for.  This Hubert Keller establishment is less expensive than his other restaurants.  Since, I enjoyed his Fleur burger when I went to Fleur a few months ago, I had to get a similar burger at Burger Bar.

An old friend raves about the Nutella milkshake and he knows how much I love Nutella so eventhough I'm lactose intolerant, I had to get a Nutella milkshake.   It came before my meal came so I was basically having dessert before entree - and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  I was instantly addicted to it.  My friend had to pry it from my tiger claws.  It's a chocolate and Nutella milkshake with chocolate whipped cream topped with whole hazelnuts.  Definitely the best milkshake ever!!!

I got the Rossini burger (Kobe beef, foie gras and black truffles on onion bun) with Skinny Truffle fries.  It's $60 but you have to consider the fact that you're getting the best burger you could ever have plus, it includes fries and dessert!  Fleur charges the same price for  the same burger but your dessert won't be free!  So, for what you're getting, it's definitely worth the price.  The friend copied what I got except he had Fat Truffle fries.  The Skinny and the Fat fries were equally good.  

The free dessert that came with our Rossini burgers, we got a white burger and a chocolate burger.  The white burger has cheesecake with fruits on a Krispy Kreme doughnut.  The chocolate burger has a Nutella fudge ""patty"" with passion fruit gelee ""cheese"", kiwi and strawberries.  They were good but I'm biased towards anything with Nutella so the chocolate burger was a clear favorite.

The service was excellent as well.  Our server Gina checked on us from time to time.  She remembered having a Yelp event there a month ago.

To start we all shared the Jalapeño Onion Petals.  Very tasty! At first I couldn't taste any of the jalapeño kick but after a few bites it showed up.  It's served with BBQ sauce and ranch.  There was a large amount so it was easily split with three people.  

For my meal I chose the Burger Bar Sliders.   Three cute little burgers just calling my name.  They are topped with plain bacon, cheese and grilled onions.  I used some of the leftover sauce from our appetizer as well.  Really good! Of course I had to get the sweet potato fries on the side.  They give you plenty with your meal.  I almost didn't finish them... Almost.  I enjoyed every bite.  

I also had a taste of my husbands burger.  He built his own with angus, grilled onions, pepper jack cheese and jalapeño bacon.  They cooked this perfectly.  Plus the jalapeño bacon is fricken awesome! Definitely better than the plain bacon on the sliders.  

Service here could have been a bit better and more attentive.  Our drinks sat empty for a while until a different waitress came by.  But I did appreciate the others taking our finished plates promptly.

So why did this place fail to impress? I was honestly expecting to be blown to smithereens by everyone else' experience with BB, but it was just run of the mill for me.

I went there around 3pm and was mildly surprised it'd still take about 10 minutes before there'd be a table for us. While the place is not very big, the decor is pretty nice - in each booth at the Burger Bar there are individual TVs for you to keep an eye on the game (I was there on a college football saturday). 

I had the the $60 Rossini Burger (Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, and Truffles shavings). I knew I wanted it and was OK with paying the price. How was it?? It was delicious! The combination of the kobe beef, foie gras and truffles was incredible. Was it worth the $60?? Hmm... probably not. BUT, you can just get a regular Kobe Burger ($16) and add foie gras ($12) and\/or truffles (1\/3 oz. for $30). If you order the Rossini, however, you get fries and a ""dessert burger"" for the price of $60. Like I said, not a ""deal"" by any means, but if that's what you want, I would recommend anyone to try the Rossini once in their life. (BTW - I recommend the sweet potato fries over all other fries because we actually tried all of them)

The service was nice, the waitress kept my tea filled pretty much the entire time I was there. My only complaint is that I wish it wasn't at the extreme end of the strip.

I went with wheat and was highly satisfied with the bread to beef ratio which was more beef than bread and I didn't run out of bread during my last few bites as is usually the case elsewhere. 

When I was done with my burger my plate was dry which earns major points with me because I hate soggy burgers that I can't put down between bites because the plate is a soggy soupy liquidy mess. I also hate dry burgers but this magical burger was neither dry nor dripping! It was a first! 

We also ordered fries accompanied with a sauce sampler which allowed us to try 5 sauces of our choice. I enjoyed tasting all the different sauces and going back and forth between them all to decide which was my favorite. I ended up concluding that the white bbq sauce was the one I was most into. 

For now...this burger is the reigning champion of the best burger I've ever had....I may only want Kobe beef burgers from now on.",4,1,2

I ordered the American Kobe Beef. This is the most expensive burger I ever ordered ($16). I have to agree that melts in your mouth and is very tender.  I went crazy and customized it by adding bacon and pepperjack cheese... and boy that really did hit the spot.

I always enjoyed watching Hubert's cooking show where he would introduce an eclectic mix of ingredients to spice up the good old America stable of hamburgers. 

You can definitely taste the quality of the meat that is used to prepare the burgers. I had asked for a medium rare burger and it came out perfectly with warm pink center just enough to keep the meat flavorful and juicy. The Ciabatta bread certainly gives the burger a more elegant look from the old sesame buns and offers a much more full-bodied texture to the burger. My girlfriend had the Kobe beef burger and didn't enjoy it as much as she wanted to. I think it had to do with the fact that she asked for a medium well burger. 

The sweet potato fries were also a nice addition to our meal and added a hint of sweetness to every bite of my burger. 

Conclusion - Although the prices are a bit steep for a burger, I applaud Hubert for his colorful rendition of the classic American burger and will definitely visit again on my next trip to Vegas.",1,0,1

The bartender was so incredibly nice (and looked like a prettier version of Jennifer Lopez).  She served up our beverages and promptly took our orders.

I ordered the buffalo burger with grilled onions, portobello mushrooms, and pepper jack cheese.  My husband ordered the grilled chicken sandwich w\/ pepper jack and grilled onions.  We shared the sweet potato fries.  My buffalo burger was amazing.  I wanted to eat the whole thing but had to resist since I knew it was not in my best interest.  It was juicy and full of flavor.  I was surprised how generous they were with the portobellos, since it was only a dollar addition.  My husband raved about the chicken sandwich, too.  The sweet potato fries were killer.  They were the best sweet potato fries because they had the perfect consistency of crispiness and potato softness on the inside.

We ended up sharing a few things so we could try a number of dishes.  We shared a half Caesar Salad (the menu didn't offer half-portions, but our server let us know). It was pretty boring, but after a weekend of carbs and meat, we were pretty excited about a bit of lettuce. 

For the burger, we shared an Angus Burger ($9.50) on a Sesame Bun with Pepper Jack Cheese ($.95), Caramelized Onion ($.95), and Jalapeno Bacon ($1.55).  They had so many toppings it was very hard to decide (and easy to wind up with a $17 burger if you weren't careful!)  The bacon was awesome and we loved the onions. They had some chef special burgers that came with skinny fries, but ours was just the burger, so we added an order of Zucchini Fries.  

For dessert (and the bit that threw me from 3-stars to 4) was the Sweet Cheesecake Burger. It was a glazed donut sliced in half like a hamburger bun (so cute!) with a cheesecake 'burger' and toppings of strawberries and pineapple.

I also tried the sliders, which are tender little bites of hamburger heaven on a mini-bun.

For burgers, the surf and turf burger is a juicy burger with asparagus and large prawns on top. The hubby always gets the bison burger, with the works, and a ""black and white"" shake (read: large chunks of cookie dough that you have to suck through a supersized straw).

I just got a baguette burger. It was really really good. 
My paranoia when it comes to baguettes is that i'm going to get some stale loaf that cuts the roof of my mouth, or gives my teeth a workout. It was actually almost an amazing piece of bread. It if had been only a tiny bit softer, it would've been the best baguette burger of my life. Honestly, it was pretty close. 

The meat was cooked perfectly. There was enough fat in the ground beef for it to ooze flavor when I bit into it. The Gruyere was melted evenly and just had just the right amount of gooeyness. The arugula was fresh and the garlic aioli was flavorful but not overly so. The fries were also good, crispy and fresh. 

Here's the best part: every single time I've been here the service has been top notch. These ladies really know their stuff, and make me that much more likely to return in the future. Great job",18,12,14

Not the best burger I've had by a long shot.  Pricey, but not more than all the restaurants are in Vegas.  Went there late in the evening after the Jimmy Buffet concert....for some reason I was wanting a cheeseburger.  :-)

Had the Kobe burger with portobellos and blue cheese.  Tasty but didn't knock my socks off.  The sweet potato fries were okay, not the best I've tasted.  The fried zucchini was AWESOME though.  Just get them as your side instead of the sweet potato or regular fries...trust me.  Didn't have a shake or anything, but they did have a nice beer list and I enjoyed the Shiner Bock on tap.

The waitress wasn't very attentive. 

Overall I probably wouldn't go back because I could get just as good if not better somewhere else.

I was expecting more of a salmon patty. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned, I dove right in. I ordered it with garlic aioli, spinach, and avocados. The bread was the perfect thickness to contain the juiciness of the salmon. The fries were also amazing, fresh and lightly seasoned. Nothing like Holstein's potato twigs.

This is a fantastic burger spot, the only problem is the ridiculous wait you'll have to endure and the high prices for beer.  Seriously $22 for a pitcher?!?!

How do you know Burger Bar is legit? Here's how...
Me: Peppercorn burger
Waiter: How'd you like that cooked?
Me: Medium Rare
Waiter: It might still be bloody is that ok?
Me: OMG YES! (rolling eyes in anticipation of amazing nom nom nomness)

The peppercorn aspect of the peppercorn burger actually sucked.  Not enough peppercorn flavor at all, I was expecting an all enveloping thick & crunchy crust of peppercorns.  All I got was a light sprinkling. The peppercorn sauce on the side didn't help.  Don't get me wrong, still a fantastic overall burger but lacking the essential flavor I wanted.

The sliders are great great.  Meat is very flavorful and juicy but you might still be hungry afterward. 3 sliders doesn't necessarily fill up a growing boy.

As for the fries, sweat potato fries are good.  The regular fries on the other hand were great.  They look like Burger King's fries, but are fantastic, thin, crispy, crunchy all the way through (not greasy at all).  I am a fan!

PS. They have an extensive beer list.  Get lost in it, try something new, try something different.",2,2,2

Yet, Chef Keller made an amazing meal that looked good enough for me to fork out urber $$$$!

The menu at Burger Bar consisted of built your own burger, a few chef's burgers, sandwiches and salads and desserts.  After the constant pestering from the waitress, I finally decided to make my own burger.  There are no directions\/recommendations for the ingredients on the menu.  For example, it should say: ""pick your cheese, pick your sauce, pick your veggies, pick your toppings.""
 
I was overwhelmed with the list of ingredients, but chose: 

Black Angus Beef
Baby Spinach
Caramelized Onion
Peppered Jack
Portobello Mushrooms.
Ciabatta Bun 

My burger was aiight. The caramelized onion and Portobello mushrooms tasted yummy. The Angus beef was dry and needed more seasoning. I had to pour ketchup on the beef to add more flavor. The bun was whatever. Overall, I was just not impressed!

Chef Keller, I want to experience your flavor profile, not mine! Your awarding dishes look and sound amazing! I don't want to build my own burger! If I wanted to build my own burger, I could make it at home. I understand that you had Chef's Burgers like the American Classic, but, Ridgefield farm beef, American Cheese, Crisp bacon tomato did not excite me!

Unfortunately, I did not have as great of an experience. I ordered the American Classic, and also I still call for it to be medium rare, it was much dryer than before. I asked for grilled onions instead of raw onions, but they still gave me raw. I called sweet potato fries both times, but they were less crunchy the second time.

This should be my favorite place in Las Vegas: Artisan Burgers and amazing beer both local and foreign. Even the service was grand. What went horribly wrong? There are two factors that make this place a definitive nope: one is the price of everything is out of touch with reality. Sure this is in the Mandalay Bay on the strip, but it's actually in one of those weird connector mini-malls we have so many of. This is a very nice retail passageway, but it's not actually Mandalay Bay proper. Even if it were I am sure I could find a greater value in food virtually anywhere else in the Mandy.

The problem isn't just the prices, which are certainly atrocious, it's just that the burgers aren't good. I had the Hubert Keller signature burger. It wasn't great. The meat wasn't particularly flavorful,  the red wine and shallots sauce was vinegary and the side of the chipolte aioli was bland and seemed old. The Buffalo was dry the previous time I came here and I chalked it up to being the nature of the meat. It's not, I've had spectacular buffalo since and much better value.

The beer list is utter torture. It's glorious in it's depth and yet should anyone actually pay those prices they should immediately be carved into servings and fed to starving African Children. A handy strip mark-up is one thing, within reason. But charging eight times retail for a beer readily available at local gas stations almost almost makes me want to go all Reductio ad Hitlerum up in this review. I scoured the beer menu and could not find a purchase I was willing to make. I cannot remember the last time I went to a restaurant such as this and just had a soda. I actually did not purchase a beer.

Its fresh ground meat that has no soy additives, preservatives or filler.

I was recovering from an evening of WHOO HOO and needed some protein that wasn't covered in grease or had mystery ""cheese food"" on it.
Two people ordered the mini slider plates and said they were the best burgers they have ever had! I had the turkey burger with carmelized onions, cranberry sauce and blue cheese on an onion bun...and MAN, that was one hang-over cure!
Another friend who embraces the ""stinky cheese"", had the Hubert Keller Burger and his only complaint was there needed to be MORE of the blue cheese (but he's an over-the-top kind of guy anyway). 
The skinny fries and the sweet potatoe fries were just heavenly....I didn't order my own, but scrounged off other people b\/c I didn't think they would be as wonderful as they were....my loss...
We were all full, but the Chocolate Burger sounded all kinds of yummy, so we just ordered one to have a little taste...I wish I had ordered my own....I am dedicated to now try making my own at home for a special b.b.q. party this summer! It was to die for chocolate-y and the presentation delightful.
The bill for five people, with a couple of alcoholic drinks each, tax and tip was a respectable $120. Being as it was a late lunch, i didn't need dinner later so it really was a good deal.
Some reviewers have said that its very noisy, but we found it just pub-like: a constant, gentle murmur with sudden peaks of laughter and clinking, but not obtrusive or a detriment to conversation. But that could have been b\/c of the very cosy booth having such tall backs.
I would go there again in a flash.

I ordered the angus burger with pepper jack, jalapeno bacon, avocado on ciabatta and a side of truffle mayo.  I opted to skip the fries and get a chocolate peanut butter milk shake instead.  The shake was amazing.  One of the best shakes I've had.  When our food came my plate had fries and it looked like the wrong burger because I didn't see any avocado but I didn't want to touch it to check.  I told the waitress that I thought it was wrong and she said it was right.  She argued with me saying I didn't order avocado and then finally brought me some avocado on a plate for me to put on my burger.  I open up my burger to add the avocado and the cheese was all white with no peppers at all so I didn't think it was pepper jack, and the bacon was definitely pepper bacon and not jalapeno bacon.  I think she might have confused the pepper jack with pepper bacon? I'm not sure.  It was very loud in the restaurant so that could have been part of it also. I don't appreciate the waitress arguing with me though.  I know what I freaking ordered.  I'm a yelper.  I looked at the menu and knew what I was going to order before I got here.  So I ate the burger with the avocado she brought and just left the wrong cheese and bacon.  After the avocado fiasco I didn't want to deal with her anymore.  I didn't enjoy the burger at all.  Not sure if the right bacon and cheese would have changed that.  It just wasn't good.  I didn't even eat half the burger and I was starving when I got there.  She didn't charge me for the fries even though I said I would pay for them.  My total for the burger, shake and auto gratuity was $30.  Pretty pricey for a burger, especially one that wasn't very good.  A few others at our table didn't care for their meal either.  I'm wondering if I just got Burger Bar on a off day.

I ordered an Angus burger and added cheese and sweet potato fries.  My friend had a Kobe burger with spinach and feta with truffle fries.  

The food was good, not amazing, but decent.  At issue, when we got the bill, we had an entire other table's bill on ours.  I had to go find our server because she couldn't bother to return.  She was texting on her phone at the service area.  She barely apologized for the bill being double.

Unfortunately, it sounded too heavy before a night out on the town and drinking, so I opted out.

This is located in the strip mall at Mandalay Bay. I've walked by several times, but had never been in. While you're waiting, they have a free photobooth outside to take some photos. You can either social media tag them or e-mail to yourself. Cool little perk and makes the time go by faster before you're seated. I'm sure there are some great photos as the drunks come rolling through.

A full bar is available and they have a ton of beers to choose from and there are various televisions on different sporting events if you're into that sort of thing.

What I tried:
I created my own burger with the Australian Kobe beef with a ciabatta bun, spinach, swiss, fried egg, tomato, and chipotle aioli. This was served with skinny fries that were thin and crispy, just the way I like 'em. The burger itself wasn't everything that I had hoped for. As you know, I feel like I suck when it comes to building my own masterpieces, so I usually opt out. I should have stuck to my own habits and done so again.

I don't think that the spinach necessarily worked on the burger. It was sautéed but really watery making the rest of the burger super moist. I order the meat cooked medium and the combo of spinach and medium meat juices didn't really blend well. To be perfectly honest, I couldn't tell that the beef was that much better than the normal patties that my friends had in their sliders. Next time I will opt for the black angus beef and save myself $8. But at least I can say that I tried it.

I snuck some onion rings off of my friend's plate. They were pretty damn delicious. The onion was sweet inside and the outside was crispy and airy. They stayed crispy throughout the whole meal and I was tempted to order a second round. I was too stuffed, and that weird burger combo kinda gave me a stomach ache. Again, not their fault, I chose the flavors.

Service was good and everything came out fast. Our server was patient with some of my drunk table mates- I'm sure they get a lot of the crazy banter all the time.

I wish I would have tried one of their desserts. They have a good variety of shakes (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and something called a chocolate burger.

I would come back and try one of their other burgers and will sub for a side of onion rings. This place is more expensive than a typical restaurant, but it's expected since it's inside a hotel on the strip. Live a little.",15,12,13

Sneaking a peak at the other diners meals, the two of us decided to go with one big burger and one trio of sliders, rather than gorge ourselves on a couple behemoths.  I ordered their buffalo burger topped with caramalized onions and blue cheese while my friend got the slider plate that came with three mini burgers, each a different meat and combination of toppings.

The only strike against our heavenly meat experience was the deep fryer was on the fritz for the day, so no fries.  I went for the cole slaw option instead as an effort towards some guilt relief.

I've been dining here for years and while the menu has seen its share of changes (I nearly cried the day they removed the cinnamon bacon from the toppings menu), the food has remained high quality and consistent. 

Hubert Keller is one of my favorite celebrity chefs and I've seen him in the kitchen here at least a dozen times over the years. It's always a thrill when he walks through the dining room. Make sure you take a peek into the kitchen in case he's there the day you are in! Many local Vegas celebrities (Penn Jillette, Rick Moonen) also love this place, so keep your eyes peeled for a star encounter.

The wait time here is always long, so arrive at least half an hour before you want to dine. You can check in with the hostess desk and then shop around the mall until your table is ready. Be prepared for an even longer wait if you go at popular times or if you want to be seated in one of the very coveted booths (complete with their own mini television sets). 

The menu is simple and totally customizeable. You pick your meat, bread (they do low carb lettuce wraps too), cheese and then as many gourmet toppings as you want. The beef is super high quality and the toppings are delicious. I usually pile my burger high with grilled red peppers, carmelized onions, spicy bacon (extra crispy!), spinach, and grilled zucchini. The end result can get pricey (expect $20 per person, minimum), as you also have to add on a salad or fries or sauces. If you only try one sauce, make it the house made ketchup or the house made mustard. Both are incredibly delicious.

As sides, you can get a decent side salad, soft yet crispy sweet potato fries, regular french fries, or fried zucchini (which is fun to share as an appetizer). There's also a creative menu of milkshakes where you choose the ice cream and ingredients! 

The service has always been fantastic, a testament to the high quality standards for the wait staff here. It also appears that there's little turnover, as we've had the same waiters multiple times in half a dozen years. 

The worst part about this restaurant is that it is LOUD. Don't go here if you want to have an intimate conversation.

Back to the food. I had Kobe Beef burger before and this was not even close to it. Tasted more like regular plain beef. I should've just order the regular burger and save me some money.

I ended up ordering the baguette burger and added jalapeno bacon. It's served on what looks like a metal cafeteria lunch tray which I thought was cute and unique. My burger wasn't bad but it wasn't great. The jalapeno bacon was chewy and it didn't taste any different than regular bacon. The baguette was also a bit tough, making it hard to eat.

My boyfriend and I both got ours medium and both were cooked just right. I swear my boyfriend ate his in about 10 min because he didn't want to put it down!

This isn't the case at Burger Bar. For serving some of the most common food in our culture (ground beef), they really do it right. Sure, it's a little more than a fast food burger, but you'll leave more satisfied.

All the burgers are tender, juicy, perfectly cooked, and the service has been top notch every time I've been there. The little TVs at each table are a nice touch also, particularly when you're with a couple chatty friends who are busy ""catching up""; it gives you something to do while you savor your meat.

But after vomiting through an overpriced fiasco at Red Square, a 5am breakfast at Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Saloon so bad that no amount of scotch could mask it, cold fries from In 'n Out, and a soggy Reuben from Raffles Cafe in the Mandalay Bay I needed some real food.

On our last day everybody was a bit drained so I snuck away to the Spa at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay(highly recommended) but after a couple hours not even the hiss from the steam room could cover the rumbling from my stomach. I headed over to the Burger Bar as I'd heard tales of his Kobe\/ foie gras \/ truffle burger. I felt quite confident that my fellow San Franciscan Hubert Keller would do right by me.

I was expecting something befitting of the chef of Fleur de Lys. What I found was a sports bar that could have been anywhere in the US. I checked the menu to make sure I was in the right place and yup, there was Hubert's picture beaming out at me. So I took a seat at the bar and ordered myself the famed Rossini Burger and a glass of syrah.

So a little bit about the Rossini Burger: Tournedos Rossini is a classic French dish combining Filet Mignon, Foie Gras, and black truffles. For their Rossini Burger, Burger Bar takes a sizable Kobe patty, tops it with seared foie gras, and smothers it with black truffles.  It comes with a side of rich Madeira reduction sauce and your choice of fries (I foolishly opted for zucchini....should have gotten the sweet potato). At $60 a pop it's a doozy for both your wallet and your arteries.

 When it arrived I have to admit it did look pretty damn good....juices glistening down the side, truffles peaking out from under the bun....I was pretty psyched. And all in all it was pretty damn good. The meat seemed to be high quality, the foie (if a bit dried out) had that earthy sweet flavor, and the truffles had a surprising amount of oomph for it being out of season. The sauce was concentrated, rich and silky. So, what's not to like, right? But in all honesty, the whole was a bit less than sum of its parts. Perhaps it was too much of a good thing or perhaps my guilt detracted a bit from my overall enjoyment. It was all good but I can't say I'd order it again. The zucchini fries were standard but seemed out of place next to such dramatic opulence.

When I ordered, the Coyote-Ugly bartender told me that my Rossini came with dessert for which I could choose one of three ""dessert burgers"" which consisted of a split glazed donut filled with one of three options. On her suggestion I chose the cheesecake cream and broiled pineapple. And while all of those things are good, it was really exactly what it sounded like - far more fitting of Denny's than a Hubert Keller restaurant (albeit a burger joint). It just seemed a little gimmicky and over-the-top-Vegas-inspired-fat-American. Oh, and the donut was a bit stale.

Service was a bit questionable too. I was sitting at the bar so I had to contend with all the drunkards watching the Laker Utah game. With that in mind, the bartender was efficient enough. But when I asked her where the truffles had come from (I mean, I wasn't challenging her...I was honestly curious) she didn't say ""from Perigord"" or ""I'm not sure...let me go ask the chef"". All I got was an ""I have no idea"" before she sashayed away. And when she came by to see how I liked it she commented that the only time she's tried foie gras, she thought it was okay but had already had eight mojitos and probably wouldn't eat it sober. Now that's class.

So while the burger alone may have warranted four stars, the ambiance, service and stale donut reduce it to two. I might go back for a standard burger some other time as  the kitchen kicks out a mean one. Everybody should get to eat a $60 tortured animal-fungus extravaganza at least once. But, like so many things in Vegas, you just feel a little bit like a sucker. I'd feel silly about it but thanks to Carolyn at the Bellagio, I had some money to burn.

Cost to worth it rating: 3 (burgers start ~$10, specialty burgers are more)
Return worthiness: yes (I go at least once each Vegas trip)

Highlights:
- Peppercorn burger: yummy rich sauce from Fluer de Lys recipe served on the side so you can pour to your liking. I added blue cheese crumbles to take it over the top. As a pepper fiend, I actually could've used a bit more pepper on the actual burger. :-o
- Ranchers meat (or something like that): as the second level up, it's definitely worth the $1 upgrade. The hub got the standard and I could tell the difference in pure meat flavor as well and juiciness.
- Seasoned bacon: peppered and jalapeño are options 
- Jalapeño fried pickles: couldn't taste the spice so much but they were great and  like that they were spears
- Make your own: array of toppings including regular things like a selection of cheese to not so mainstream like fried egg and pickled beets  
- Open late: weekends til 2am
- Sweet potato fries: thin, crispy
- Veev acai spirit lemonade: not too sweet, interesting dynamic with antioxidants in an alcoholic beverage--wonder if they cancel each other out ;-)
- Personal tv in booths: great for sports days 
- Milkshakes: come all sundae style pretty with the hugest straws ever, also come in alcoholic versions which is great for sin city 

Lowlights:
- TV options: wish could switch channel and they had the direct ticket

I won't spend much time talking about the food because there are hella reviews about this place. My friend and I ordered the caesar salad, the Hubert Keller burger, The American Classic, and the Buttermilk Zucchini fries. The caesar salad was....well...a caesar salad. I'm a firm believer that a caesar salad can only get so good. The burgers were phenomenal. I made the mistake of eating my half of the Hubert Keller burger before the half of the American Classic. Although the latter was good, it still paled in comparison to the former. The zucchini fries were good. They had a little taste of jalapeno to them which was interesting. They are a bit too rich for my taste though so I would recommend getting a side to split with one or two friends.

The thing I want to talk about is their water glasses. I will admit. I am one of those jacka$$es who drinks alot of water. What can I say? A brother needs to get hydrated.

We came here on a Wednesday around noon before Thanksgiving. It wasn't too crowded so we got seated immediately. The waiter was really friendly and promptly took care of us. I got the chef's milkshake (called black & white I think). At first I thought $10.50 for a milkshake was super expensive, but when I got it I understood why - it was super big and had tons of stuff inside - chocolate, cookies (I think), chocolate whipped cream, and tons of both vanilla and chocolate ice cream made of real dairy. Maybe avoid if you're lactose intolerant and share with someone if possible. We almost got the fries sampler which was interesting but decided against it after the large milkshake came. I got the turkey burger with onion buns. Never had onion buns in my life but fell in love - it wasn't pungent and smelled and tasted amazing like cooked onions. The buns were fluffy as well. I felt the turkey patty was ""too high quality"" for me though - felt like I was eating angus beef. I prefer the frozen patties from Costco just because I don't really care for meat and I think those are more flavorful as they probably use more flavoring to mask the lower meat quality, but I'm ok with it!

But, that's the not the star of the show.  The star is the freaking amazing burger they serve here.  Now I've never gotten any patty besides the angus patty.  I figured it's ground up beef, no point in having a super awesome one.  Spend that money on the toppings!

I got the angus burger with portabello mushrooms, foie gras and some provolone cheese on ciabatta bread.  (Wait, maybe mozzarella because they didnt' have provolone.)  Anyway.  The angus burger was damn juicy and served at a perfect medium-rare.  The portabella mushrooms were AMAZING as well.  It was juicy and so perfectly grilled.  Man, my mouth is watering as I type this.

The real star of the show was the foie gras.  And yes, it deserves its own paragraph.  A huge chunk of perfectly seared liver.  When bitten into this thing explodes.  I'm serious.  It was like the big bang in your mouth.  You literally smile as you bite into it.  Your senses run wild.  You become reborn.  It is that damn good.  And for only $12 to add it to your burger, do it.  DO IT!

Guys.  Do yourself a favor.  Stop reading the reviews.  Just go.  If you're already there, reading Yelp reviews to figure out what to order.  Just remember.  FOIE GRAS!",1,0,0

Luckily we arrived at 4pm, just before the Saturday night dinner rush. We were seated quickly and had our drinks in hand within minutes. The ambiance was eclectic: there was a small television in our booth playing a sports channel, but I do not recall any audio. The lighting was dim, matching the dark mahogany wood seating. As expected, the crowd mostly consisted of visiting tourists. Attire is casual. 

I ordered a Hawaiian ""burger"", er chicken sandwich. Why didn't I order a BURGER? I am not sure. I suppose the pineapple just sounded so appealing to me. Even more ironic, my cousin ordered the Salmon. I know - who orders salmon at a Burger joint?! Apparently fresh fish , particularly salmon, is hard to come by where she lives. 

Anyway, my chicken sandwich arrived and to my chagrin, the chicken tasted very dry. The pineapple I was craving didn't really compliment the chicken as I had anticipated. I suppose I can't discount them too much since I didn't order a burger; but how hard is it to cook chicken? 

The salmon, however, was reportedly delicious - and I think that is what was important. My cousin was visiting, not me. 

Maybe next time I will actually order a burger. Hopefully it will be a little better prepared than my chicken - juicy and delicious- as one would expect it to be.",1,0,1

Loved taking my vegetarian girlfriend to a burger bar and ordering it rare. Mine was rare and very very delicious. I had it on Sunday on my way out of town so that means i had completely punished myself by the pool and in the lounges the days earlier. That burger said goodbye in a way i needed. It said ""there will be several accidents on the 15 south so this should hold you over for 5+ hours"" and it did. Loved it. I had the skinny fries and they didn't do a thing for me, however the onion rings were pretty damn good. Next time I will go for onion rings. 

Staff is really helpful and very attentive. We waited a little bit for the burgers but it was Sunday and Check out time. I'm not the only genius that decided to eat before leaving town so I get the wait.

There were a lot of really good waitress's and that was causing some serious issues with the girlfriend because i was actually looking around at what everyone was eating and my girl friend at first thought I was checkin out the servers.  Then when i explained that i was seeing what everyone else was eating she started laughing and said, of course you are...you yelp more than you look at porn on the internet.

I got the kobe beef burger with sweet potato fries and onion rings and eveyrthing was delicious. The kobe beef was very tender and cooked perfectly at medium rare.

I knew it would be late on a Friday for dinner, but there was no wait for a table for two. Destiny, deliciousness, and decadence awaiting us at Burger Bar.

This is a Hubert Keller place!!!! So great. I wish I could tell you who he is!. I bet he has an accent and grew up on the streets of Europe post WWII. That's where he learned the in and outs of food. I have a great imagination, don't I?

Anyway, the menu is STACKED with burger options: Angus beef, buffalo (which my brother ordered and said it was gamey), and USDA beef. They also had Kobe Beef! You know anytime a cow gets a massage and drinks beer to relax in Japan, you know it's gonna be excellent.

I was so hungry and overwhelmed by all the burger topping options. Luckily my brother got onions and since I ordered first and he wasn't ready, I was able to add them after the fact. I ordered the Kobe Beef Burger on whole wheat, with cucumbers, grilled onions, and portobello mushrooms. The meat\/bun ratio was GREAT!!!!! I had a choice of fries (sweet potato, skinny, fat, buttermilk zucchini), but I went with the onion rings and was not disappointed. I also got jalapenos (which ruined the burger so I ate one by one). I wasn't mad when my brother let me have some of his sweet potatoes. Well worth the 11 PM wait since my brother had gotten in an hour earlier!!!

We ended up ordering two of their reasonably sized ice cream sundaes. I thought it'd be bigger. I got strawberry he got vanilla and we added coconut (me) and he got a Twinkie, butterscotch, and coconut.

I would agree, this is probably among the best burger places in the city.....Yes, the prices are more than what you would pay at Apple-bee's and\/or In-n-Out.... but OBVIOUSLYYYY this is a much more quality burger and you do get what you pay for. 

For my experience: 
I sat at the bar. I didn't plan on it, but there was no wait.. and I was hungry! Overall I highly recommend sitting at the bar, there are plenty of bartenders, they are attentive and right there when you need them. If I were to be sitting in the restaurant, I would prefer to be in a booth because the tables seem like you would always feel in the way. 

For our eats we STARTED (which was a mistake) with the Nutella shake. I will dream about this delicious thing for the rest of my life. Something this tasty shouldn't be allowed to exist. If you love Nutella, you will fall in love with this incredibly easily. Its topped with fresh cocoa whipped cream, hazelnuts, and chocolate chips! I will drink this down before I die.

Burgers: I really wanted the buffalo burger(which they serve here) because I love buffalo and its better alternatives to beef. But, I stuck with turkey. Turkey burger with provolone and guacamole on a ciabatta bun. This baby was steamin when it came out. Fresh off the grill. I really appreciated the guacamole they had here, fresh and yummy, and its obviously not for dipping chips in, and they understand that. It is for spreading and the consistency of it was beautiful for spreading! All the burgers come with lettuce, tomato, and purple onion on the side... and a pickle spear:] 

My friend got a burger as well, and she also got the zucchini fries, PIPING HOT also. These were good, and a good change from fries. 

Sadly, I couldn't finish my burger because of the delicious Nutella shake. I will definitely be back here for my indulgence and gluttony, but next time I will fast and make sure Burger Bar is the only thing to be in my stomach that day.",2,1,1

I do not eat red meat or pork as I have mentioned before so I thrive on turkey burgers.  Finding a good turkey burger is a pretty hard thing to do, let me tell you. Most are frozen patty's that taste like cardboard.  Burger bar is situated inside of the amazing hotel\/casino Mandalay Bay and is a great spot to hang out with some friends and have a couple drinks with your meal.  It is a neat menu where you choose everything you want from your burger with the type of bun and what you want on top.  Like I said I always get the turkey burger and it is a very good size, and juicy not dry like many others.  The downfalls are that you have to pay for each individual topping and the sides that you want with it.  You have your choice of fat steak fries, skinny fries, zucchini fries (my favorite) and some others.  I have a hard time choosing between the three so every time I go I usually rotate them.  I have never had a bad experience with the food nor the service.  The atmosphere is great (first of all its Vegas!).

On my way back from my ski trip I had tried the restaurant the Burger Bar in Vegas. My brother and I have been wanting to try this place because the chef was featured on Top Chef Masters, which is really cool, so we decided to do a little research before we went there. We went on Yelp! to see if other people had thought his restaurant was good I believe the average rating was 4 1\/2 stars. The ratings made us more excited to go there. 
     We detoured our trip back for a bit and went to the Mandalay Bay seeking this place. After being pointed to different directions we were finally at the burger bar. It is a cool little burger joint that is darkly lit with little personal T.V.s at each booth and it also has a full time bar. Now that we were finally here we had to order. I was itching to get the Hawaiian burger well chicken burger because the description sounded good but being at a burger bar I should order the some red meat so I ordered the American, which is a classic burger. The burger came in all of it's juiciness. The patty was pretty thick so I put all so the condiments in the burger and I tried it but was sadly disappointed the burger lacked flavor in the meat. Keep in mind when a burger patty is thick I would expect some sort of seasoning but there was none. Since my brother and I had hyped up the burger bar so much we expected a mouthwatering burger but were sadly disappointed.

The burger itself was great at first.  I was so happy to see they got medium rare right.  However as you keep on eating the caramelized onion really dominates too much and the last few bites get bad.  They say chefs care most about the first and last bites so this burger fails.

We got zucchini fries which were, absolutely delicious. They weren't super thick, nor super thin. The breading was crunchy, and herby, with the soft (yet firm) veggie inside. 

As for the dessert burgers, eh, they were ok. Not needed, nothing to write home about. 

The price can be anywhere from $12-60 per burger. It all depends on what you put on it of course (for example, lobster and black truffles will be hella expensive. Where as asparagus and pesto will be much cheaper.)


Go here. Get the Kobe beef. Enjoy. And sob endlessly when you've finished it. :D",6,8,7

Burger Bar is located one level 2 in the Shoppes area of Mandalay Bay, not in the Fleur\/1oak nightclub area. Got there for an early dinner on a Saturday and there was no wait. We called to put our name down but they said it was first come, first serve. I guess they changed their policy based on previous Yelp reviews where people made reservations. 

We were seated at a booth which had a USB\/110 on the wall! Perfect if you have your cable on you and have been depleting your battery while wandering around Vegas all day! Being the purist that I am, I went for taste and ordered the Kobe burger for $18 and added foie gras $13 which I can't get in California. The burgers come with lettuce, tomato, red onion and a pickle. K got the regular Angus for $10 with various toppings. We also got skinny fries for $4 and mozzarella sticks $7(!). The foie gras was pretty good and a decent portion for $13. It wasn't the best I had but it doesn't matter as much when you're smashing it on a burger. I had to have a few initial stand-alone bites. My burger was so juicy and flavorful, I just constructed it with the lettuce and tomato and that pretty much made it. Figured if I was paying $18 for a burger then I wanted to taste the burger and not a bunch of condiments. It was super filling too. 

I had a few of the skinny fries which were just fries. K loved his mozzarella sticks but I don't think it's worth it for $7. 

We had great service although when we asked about different menu items, she answered ""awesome"" to it all. Which was true but just hard to gauge the level of awesomeness for each item.

However, you could get a similar tasting burger for $5 at Joe's Junior in the East Village at New York City. The Reuben on the other hand lacks any punch and the corned beef overtakes the burger in the dish.

i am a beer snob. i will be the first to admit it. so i was pretty damn excited to learn that what i have been told is the best beer bar in vegas was next to my hotel. the beer selection was solid. the prices were pretty on par with the average beer bar back home in chicago. i did notice few very very out of season seasonals which makes me wonder about their turnover on bottles and kegs. having pumpkin beer in stock in july is just strange.

 the bartenders we chatted up were super nice. i commented on one of the beers in particular and the bartender called over the beer buyer to tell him what i said. then came the part that irked me. the buyer asked me about chicago beer and the breweries here. i said a few sentences about 3 floyds in particular and mentioned something about having had some of their super limited dark lord a couple of days before. the buyer was very clearly not interested in hearing what i was saying even though he had asked the question. he basically smiled and nodded but did not listen at all. this too would be fine, rude but fine, had he not 15 minutes later while i was in the middle of eating come up behind me and asked me to tell him about 3 floyds and this dark lord beer he had heard about. frustrating situation. i don't really understand managing a beer bar and not wanting to talk about beer. 

in the end the price wasn't bad. the burger was pretty good. nothing amazing but pretty good. they had a ton of topping options and out of sight onion rings.

I like this place because it has a old school\/new school burger joint look to it. They have a huge beer list and my server allowed me to taste three different beers before choosing the one I wanted which was nice. I went the Rossini Burger which is the grand daddy of all the burgers they serve. It was named after a XIXth century Italian composer whose love for fine food was legendary. Its Kobe Beef, sauteed foie gras and shaved truffles all on a onion bun with a side of a rich brown madeira sauce. It comes with a choice of fries, I chose the sweet potato fries, and a choice of a desert burger, I chose the PB&J!  

The burger was absolutely amazing. I ordered medium and it came out perfect. It was very juicy and the flavors all pair well with each other. The truffles add a very nice earthy taste to it as the foie gras adds a nice richness to it. Surprisingly I was able to eat it with out it coming apart. The fries are were very good as well. I'm a huge sweet potato fan and like how they have different type fries to choose from. The PB&J desert burger is peanut butter mousse, raspberry jelly and sliced kiwi's all in the middle of a warm glazed donut. Its VERY rich but VERY good. The kiwi adds a nice refreshing taste to it which it needs with the richness of the peanut butter and the donut. 

The Burger Bar has a wide-range of choices and will satisfy your burger craving while in Las Vegas. I will be back to try some more of Hubert Keller's crazy burger creations.",0,0,0

Natural source beef, smoked Gouda cheese, pepper bacon, and truffle mayo.  Order that and thank me later.

Beyond the phenomenal food Burger Bar gets five stars for the following reasons.

1.Our waiter Sergio (I think) took great care of us.  Good recommendations and excellent timing.

2.  The prices are cheap by Vegas standards.  Burgers for two with a fry sampler and a few beers came in around ~50$.

3.  The hostess made a mistake and seated us in a section that was set to be occupied by a large group.  We were seated for maybe 5 minutes when the manager came over, apologized profusely and politely asked us to move a few booths down.  Our group was fine with his apology and had no problem with moving.  He insisted on knocking 20% off our bill which was an unneeded but nice gesture.  The manager also made sure to check on us and seemed genuinely concerned that we had a good time (which we did).

4.  They had an excellent beer selection.  Over the last few years I have been happy with good beers making their way to Vegas and Burger Bar has jumped on that bandwagon.  I had a few Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA and there were three or four more beers I would have gladly ordered.

The burgers faired pretty well as take out but there were a couple of hiccups.

Once back in our hotel room, we found that they only gave us 2 of the 3 burgers we ordered and 1 of the burgers had extra toppings, all the toppings of the burger that was missed.  Thankfully, the burgers were pretty big and we ordered 3 sides so there was enough to share.  We had the American Classic with a fried egg and a buffalo burger with caramelized onions, mushrooms and cheese\/bacon\/fried egg.  One of the two fried eggs popped on the way back to the hotel but it was still pretty good.  The buffalo burger was very juicy and perfectly medium rare, even though it was 25 minutes before it was eaten.

The sweet potato fries were ok as were the regular fries.  The mozzarella sticks were not great but that's because they were take out, if they were eaten right away at the restaurant, they may have been better.

The best part of this meal was that when we called the restaurant to let them know they left a burger off, the guy immediately accommodating and  said the meal would be comped for the mix up.  Pretty good customer service!  That's Vegas for ya!",0,0,0

On a weekday just minutes after opening for lunch, the place was already packed with people. I watched Giada on Food Network eat here a while ago, and ever since then I've had it at the back of my mind to check this place out. 

I ordered an Angus beef burger on ciabatta bread, with toppings of carmelized onion and peppered bacon. All the ingredients tasted fresh and blended well together. If I had to nit pick, the ciabatta bread was a bit on the dry side. It was begging to be oven warmed or briefly toasted on the grill. But I was so hungry, there was no way that burger was leaving my grasp. 

As for the sides, the crown jewel had to be the buttermilk dipped fried zucchini fries. Piping hot fresh zucchini interior, crispy not-too-heavy breading exterior, and nice seasoning. Dip it in some ranch sauce, and it was the perfect compliment to our burgers. We also had sweet potato fries, which was good as well, but didn't quite hold up a candle next to the zucchini fries. 

Prices are reasonable, and service was efficient and friendly. Next time, I'll have to spring for the Kobe beef burger, with pepper jack cheese and grilled mushrooms. Yes, I've given it some thought. So if you're ever in the mood for a good burger in a casual atmosphere in Vegas, you'll know where to go.",10,5,7

The concept of the build your burger and of course the Hubert endorsement is a reason that fills the seat, but my love for the Burger Bar unfortunately stops there.

I have gone on 3 separate occasions and the first 2 I have had issues with the burger and recently it was now my wife who had the ""Irish Luck"" with Lunch.

The first two times I had the build your burger and both times they had come out raw vs. the medium that was requested. I normally am not a complainer when I eat, but for something like that getting sick is not my forte.

Recently I went and this time it was my wife's burger that was red and dripping blood which was inexcusable. She ordered sliders and she even said it best ""how can you undercook a small patty""?

Beyond those experiences, I feel the overall flavor of the burger itself is just not there. I was looking for a little kick or at least something that doesn't leave me looking for a soda or a ""dolled up"" milk shake. I'm now on the hunt for a new burger establishment to satisfy my requests.",1,0,0

Decor, great, loved it. Comfy booths with individual tvs at your table. Awesome. Cute, friendly waitresses. Cool. I am sure she had nothing to do with the 50 minute wait to get my burger. Really. 
We were vanished so it didn't take long to decide. My other half went with the hangover burger. I went with the do-it-yourself style. I included cheddar, grilled peppers and onions, homemade mustard (YUM) and spicy ketchup. I could tell the quality of meat was there on the burgers. This was no frozen pre made burger. All the ingredients were fresh. But NOTHING stood out to make my burger $19.75. We also got a milkshake and some cheese shots. (deep fried pepperjack) Our tab came to over $60!! for burgers that were just OK that we waited almost an hour on.
No thanks, never again. Move along.

First of all let me say that I'm shocked by all of the great reviews. This place doesn't hold a candle to East Coast burger places like Z Burger and 5 guys. Want an overprice burger that doesn't have much to offer, come here. Want to say after your meal, jeez I wish I would have just went through the drive through at McDonalds, come here. I came here with a friend and we both ordered 2 dressed up burgers with a side of fries and a coke, the price was close to $60. The burgers were overcooked when we asked for medium. The fries tasted like they had come out of a bag in the frozen food section and then been deep fat fried when they were put on our plates there was an excess amount of oil. The only part of the meal they excelled in was the cokes, but how hard is it to put together a fountain soda these days.

The combination of spicy ketchup, perfect medium rare lamb, so thick my wife had trouble taking a bite, and the soft ciabatta bun (most places have ciabatta that's too crunchy for me), made for a wonderful lunch.

There is usually always a 15-20 minute wait during dinner time and if you are super hungry that can be annoying. For me, it has always been well worth the wait. Overall the staff is friendly enough, service is solid -- nothing exceptional but also nothing to complain about. The food, however, is what earns this place a five star rating. I have had several burgers off their menu and the Rossini, of course, tops them all -- but for more budget oriented people I'd recommend the Buffalo Burger or the Kobe beef burger.   I had the Buffalo burger with grilled onion and avocado along with zucchini fries on my most recent visit. It was good but i should have ordered it medium instead medium well.

Sorry Todd (the server), I know we were a big table (10), but that food took forever, one order was completely forgotten, and one burger was medium well instead of medium rare.  And while my wife got the $16 buffalo burger you raved about, I got the $9 Angus and mine was better.  The fatty cow is always tastier than the lean healthy buffalo in my experience, and at double the price for lean and healthy, I am not willing to give up flava.  Fooled me once and got me to buy your pricey burger while you had an automatic 18% tip for a big group, but it won't happen again, and hopefully all the Yelpers will be on to you now.

Oh yeah, Karen got the $12 foie gras option and it was nothing to write home about. Cool that it is on the menu, but I would like it to pay it's own way too.  While I don't mind spending $88 for burgers at lunch while in Vegas, it better be over the top spectacular at that price, and this simply wasn't.  

Other notes: The zucchini fries were pretty good, though a bit mushier than I would have preferred.  And this would be a 3 star place if we had just gone in, got the Angus burgers at $9+options, had our food prepared right, and got our food in less than 50 minutes, which is kind of ridiculous for a burger.  Oh yeah, also cool that this place has about 4 different fresh bun options, 3 different bacons, and about 20 or so other interesting sides.

I love the option of being able to choose whatever toppings strike your fancy, they even have pre prepared ""Chef's Burgers"" that take the indecision out of it. I chose the Pepper Jack cheese, Jalapeños, Jalapeño Bacon, and caramelized onions. It was very tasty, juicy and worth the wait.

Angus on Ciabatta, Foie Gras, Truffle Mayo, Black Perigord Truffle Sauce! My best combination and burger to date!!

I usually spend the money on Angus here, because even their most basic burger trumps the other guys in town.  I've had their Waygu here, but it is NOT necessary, and I'd rather spend that extra $7-8 towards the Foie Gras personally!

The Foie Gras melts in your mouth, and is like butter on top of your burger!  The truffle mayo is perfection on top of everything and blends perfection in each bite.  The Black Perigord Truffle Sauce was very subtle, but it adds to the moisture in the bread.  You could skip this last element if you need to, but make sure you have the other options!

And the ciabatta is the perfect bread to absorb those medium rare juices...staying firm and keeping your hands clean, even with all those juices hitting the plate.

It's a bit difficult to find, as we made many circles around the casino trying to figure out where to go. It's in kind of an odd location across from a shoe store in the shops at Mandalay Bay. It was worth the search.

I had the black angus beef cooked medium with caramelized onion, portobello mushrooms, prosciutto and monterey jack cheese on an onion bun. The meat was a bit too red for me, but it was still yummy. I didn't eat the whole thing (made for a great drunken snack later that night.)

I got the Rossini, which featured wagyu beef, seared fois gras, shaved truffles, all served with a black Perigord truffle sauce. I must say the beef was perfectly medium rare, as requested. The fois gras was a thick slab that was not nicely spread out over the burger. The sauce was tasty but was too salty. The bun was completely forgettable. Overall, NOT worth the $60 price tag. The flavors were rich but weren't well-balanced. A few more well-chosen ingredients to round out the burger would've made a huge difference. 

The beer float paddle was innovative and worth the one-time experiment. Only two of them worked very well, though, which included raspberry-flavored ciders -- maybe because my palate expected something sweet. The bitterness of a lager mixed with strawberries and whipped cream was undrinkable, despite how tasty the whipped cream was. And although Guiness and coffee ice cream go well in theory, I'd say empirically the two are each SO good on their own, it's a disservice to combine them. 

Ambiance is non-existent. At the comfy booths, there are TV screens about the size of a square foot flashing some sports highlights and a ton of ads throughout the entire evening. It is completely distracting, seeming to promote ADHD over any meaningful human interaction. What's worse, there is no way to turn the screens off.

We arrived around 6:00ish and had to wait about 25 minutes (party of 8 here), which wasn't too bad since we spent most of that time checking out the candies in Lick (a colorful candy store nearby).

The concept of building your own burger is fun, but can get pricey.  I got the naturesource patty on a sesame bun ($10.50) + pepper jack cheese ($0.95) + grilled onions ($0.95) + peppers ($0.95) + chipotle aioli ($0.45) = $13.80 (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and dill pickle already included).  Not too bad price wise, but that's for a burger only.  One of my kids (who eats like a horse) wanted a burger that included grilled shrimp ($6.00) + a side of mozzarella sticks ($5.95) that would've cost $25 to which I said HELLL NOOO (she only took out the shrimp so it still was about $20).

My burger was pretty good.  The patty was nicely pink (medium well) and juicy with a kick from the pepper jack cheese and chipotle aioli.  It was also pretty filling too, so I didn't need a side after all (because I stole some mozzarella sticks, skinny fries, fat fries, zucchini fries, and pepper jack cheese shots from others...needless to say, I couldn't finish my burger).

Let's start with the meat (or non-meat) selections: angus beef, another beef I don't recall, American Kobe beef, turkey, salmon, and veggie. From there, it's off to bread. They had everything from plain to whole wheat and ciabatta. The best part, however, is all of the other fixings! From cheese (blue, mozzarella, cheddar, swiss, etc.) to other burger oddities like foie gras, they've got you covered. My burger was a turkey on plain bread with mozzarella and peppered bacon.

Burger: angus beef, medium rare, caramelized onions, pepper jack cheese, jalepeno bacon, hangover sauce (in-house special sauce), avocado on a ciabatta bun. Eff yeah. Meat came out PERFECTLY medium rare. Can I just say how obsessed I immediately became over the jalapeno bacon?? Jesus is real. And I know this because of how amazing the jalapeno bacon was on that burger. Everything worked perfectly together and the combo with the Pilsner hit the spot. 

We were a party of 5, and the wait for a table would have been about 45 minutes (Sunday evening). There was plenty of room at the bar, however, so we made our way there and took advantage of the last few minutes of the Happy Hour menu. 

The fries and chicken strips from the Happy Hour menu came our within minutes. Your standard fries and chicken strips: tasty, not anything brilliant. 

The burgers took a little longer. Probably waited a solid 20 minutes, which felt like 45 because of how hungry we were, but for the perfection of my meal, I'll take it without complaint.

I had the Blackjack Burger on Ciabatta. It was somewhere in the $15 range. I know this is Vegas but I figure a $15 burger would be comparable to Red Robin. Maybe it was just the particular burger I ordered.

This burger was dry, the ciabatta roll was beyond dry. The burger disseminated itself, I had way too much roll and not enough meat. The meat (ordered medium well) looked suspiciously like my partners' medium rare. It was too pink for me. The meat itself wasn't seasoned (which is fine, I guess if you like that) and seasoning wasn't available outside of ketchup and mustard. 

The fat fries were good, but they probably came from a bag so I won't spend any time on that. The milkshake was great. But was it good enough that I would go there just for that? No. Would I try any of their other food again? No. Was I WOWED by customer service? No. 

When our check arrived, our waitress asked how the food was. We said bad. She didn't believe us(!!!) and then asked why we didn't say something sooner. Okay, it was our fault. It wasn't your problem to fix. It wasn't our assumption that the food you brought us was your best. What would you have done to fix it? So we payed full price for a meal we ate about half of.

Before even entering Mandalay Bay, I was telling myself to critically rate this restaurant for every minute detail. Working from a fast food burger joint (In-N-Out Burger), I've had my plentiful shares of burgers from all sorts of places and arriving at one of my favorite chef's resto, Hubert Keller, I was pleasantly impressed

Accompanied by the 2 most trustworthy women in my life, we busted a ""Lord of the Ring's"" journey to get here. From the Manadalay Bay entrance, the Burger Bar is far... Once arrived at this eatery, I noticed the settings is quite dim and social. There was a bar ofcourse but there were also booths and tables. Great take on a mix between a ""fine brewery"". The place ""looked"" packed and we had to wait for a good 15 min. for a booth but there were already a couple of empty booths so I didn't understand the point of waiting... Our server was nice at first but like a oddly new friend that you meet who suddenly opens up the next day, you see their real side and you don't like it. She was serving us like a quick Asian at an oriental restaurant. Didn't really care for hospitality, but got our orders right. She was also pregnant so maybe it was a mood swing that we ended up seeing?... I dunno. Anyways, onto what we ordered:

Marinated Chicken Breast Burger w\/ Swiss Cheese on a Whole Wheat Bun - Great chicken taste, nice and tender and the slice was not too big to overwhelm the swiss cheese or the bun. The cheese even had holes in it! The bun to compliment was great as well. Fluffy and a discerning wheat taste. These guys weren't playing around with the choices of ingredients.

Black Jack Burger on a Ciabatta - a thick beefy behemoth with thick italian square buns. It wasn't accompanied with any cheese (cuz my girl didn't ask for any) but the taste was still apparent. Medium well, moist ground up beef which was well seasoned and full of flavor. I really wished there was some sauce to accompany it but for a mere bread, meat, and veg combo, it still tasted out of the ordinary. 

Surf and Turf Burger on an Onion Bun - as a lover for steak and lobster, this burger was right up my alley. Think of a cheesecake with a graham cracker crust topped with thick full whip cream... but SAVORIZED! The asparagus was buttered with the texture of a moist graham cracker, my medium rare black angus didn't seem as big as the Black Jack Burger's but the texture was pure butta (that thing couldn't keep together on a fork). The lobster was perfectly cooked, tender for a lean meat, and complimented the steak and asparagus texturely, perfectly! I was kind of worried the server didn't ask me if I wanted cheese on it, but honestly you don't need any. Just another flavor to get in the way of the stars of the show. On the down side, from how moist everything was, it made the bottom bun really soggy. Nevertheless, the onion bun had an onion taste that you could not miss (which was great!) 

The lettuce, onions, and tomatoes on the side of these burgers were fresh and crisp. It could've been a side salad all together. Plus the pickle garnish had nice suttle taste, not overwhelming like your at home jar pickles, but almost like a cucumber palate cleanser.

Typing about side salads, I had one as one of my sides. It wasn't all that great, but with drenched olive oil for a dressing , it did have a good enough taste to finish. The other sides we had were fat fries and sweet potato fries. Fat fries were crispy and thick, which I thought tasted way better than the flimsy sweet potato fries. About sweet potato fries, they are popping up everywhere now, sadly these aren't the best I had.

Service was slow, food was tasty and fast, and the price was reasonable. Everything came up to be a good 60 bux plus tip, quality = price tonight. FYI: each booth had a mini TV on the side playing some type of sport. That's just overkill with the whole bar meets fine dining theme, but hey it sells!

Who else can manage to cook a 5 star meal in a dorm room using a hot plate and a shower stall? I also admire his diverse interests- not many chefs can boast about being a DJ in their spare time!

Anyways, I was excited to try out his Burger Bar restaurant when we were in Vegas. We got here around opening time, and there was already a line forming to try out the delicious burgers. Although we had a large party, we were seated promptly. 

We decided to order the chicken wing appetizer, and I had a nutella shake to start out with. The chicken wings were good, but quite small compared to other chicken wings you'll find at other places. The nutella shake was beautifully presented, with elegant swirls of chocolate syrup laced on the inside of the cup. The shake itself was smooth, rich, chocolate indulgence, topped with chocolate whipped cream and a sprinkling of whole hazelnuts.

Although I didn't order the beer float paddle sampler, a person in our party did, and it looked amazing! (See pictures for the evidence!)

Although the Rossini burger was indeed tempting, I decided to forgo the $60 price tag and order the signature Hubert Keller burger ($22). After all, why not order the owner's favorite burger? It was perfectly cooked to order (Medium rare), with tender, flavorful buffalo meat, spinach, blue cheese, caramelized onions, with a lovely red wine sauce on the side. I'm not normally a fan of blue cheese, but it meshed well with the other ingredients. The only slight negative was that the burger really needed the red wine sauce on the burger, otherwise it tasted like it lacked a little seasoning. The fries that automatically came with the burger were decent, with a nice crisp outer layer.

The draft selection is solid and is probably the best thing they have to offer. Be warned that pints are pricey, though.

Food is, to put it mildly, seriously overpriced. Burgers can easily run over $20.00 without much effort. If they were truly $20.00 burgers, this would be acceptable. But I feel these burgers and sides (brought in frozen or prepackaged, no less) are worth perhaps half to two thirds what is being charged. You are definitely paying for the scene.

Speaking of scene... it is crowded with youngish, good looking people. Saw lots of beer being consumed, but also saw a good amount of other beverages. I don't think the craft beer list is the main attraction for most of the diners.

Some places have deserved reps for great burgers (Father's Office and Lucky Devil's in L.A., for instance), but this place is getting by on its inexplicable ""hot"" status. Don't get me wrong, the food is good. But it's not buzz worthy.

I don't think I'll be going back here again unless it's to grab a pint on the way to eat somewhere else.",1,0,0

In all seriousness though, think about it.  When ""most"" people think buffet they think all you can eat (ayce) and average food quality, right? Right; However, the reason I think buffet's are ever so popular and important to the epicurean theology is not because of the quantity but rather another keystone of the American English vernacular... FREEDOM. 

Freedom is a very powerful ""gimmick"" restaurants employ [which we all fall victim too] to coerce patrons into thinking they are the captain, el presidente, la luchadora, and the head honcho of their own food eating destiny.  Breaking this nonscientific hypothesis down one begins to realize we have become a society filled of imaginative free thinking charlatan's [aka pansies] who scoff and laugh at menus containing such disclaimers as ""no substitutions!"" or ""additional fee's may apply"".  Many existentialists relate this chickenheartedness of linear movement to a consternation of structure and organization; similar to its analogous nature much like rusty shackles placed on man's progression towards lifes many possibilites. 

Now, while many readers are thinking wtmfs (what the motha f'n shits) does this rambling of philosophical food mumbo jumbo have to do with patties of meat???? Well, its sets the stage and illustrates the progression and direction of culinary ""fast"" food by placating to society's wants and needs.  Why do you think the Chipotles, Yogurt Lands, and the Burger Bars of the world are becoming so popular? It's the freedom of choice and limitless possibilities all stemming from the belly busting buffet. 

finally I digress.... 

Burger Bar is an A-OK place that provides almost limitless possibilities to feed your meat addiction. You pick the type of patty, Black Angus Beef, Kobe Beef, Colorado Lamb, turkey, and veggie. Then comes the different buns\/breads. Then comes the toppings which each have their own subcategory like the Garden, Grill, Ocean, Dairy, Farm, Pantry, and Earth. Lastly you choose the fried goodies. 

I can only speak based on my concoction. I got a lamb burger with spinach, cucumber, feta cheese, pesto sauce, and side of fried pickles. The burger was okay, outside the steep price tag, nothing was different than any of the other ""made to order"" burger joints. The fried pickles however were the best item. In honer of full disclosure however, if I didn't drop a couple of Benjamen's at the craps table while waiting to be seated the burger might have tasted a bit better. Just a smidgen though. 

I was lucky enough to get a taste of my friends [the famous michelle t.] angus beef, foie gras, truffle burger and it was as heavy as a thanksgiving dinner at the klump's house. For $30+ it tasted amazing but probably would have put me to sleep and then a stomach ache had I eaten any more. 

All in all, fun place, nice staff, good service, okay food, but a bit overpriced.",7,9,8

Granted, I have never actually met the French chef but I feel like after watching Top Chef Masters, I am convinced that he is a wonderful person who makes mouth-watering food. Fiance and I went here while watching my cousin's 16month old baby. It was a fantastic night. First, it was exactly what we were looking for - delicious food in a casual setting so that baby Cami could make all the noise he wanted and no one would mind. I had their sliders (three kinds - buffalo, kobe and classic mini-burgers) with sweet potato fries - yummm! Fiance built his own burger - kobe beef, grilled onions, cheddar cheese on focaccia with deep-fried zucchini spears. Delicious! Fiance has declared that it was the best burger he'd ever had. I must admit that I thought the zucchini spears were even better than my sweet potato fries. We ended it all with one of their decadent milkshakes - the caramel latte. oh man, it was a bit too sweet for me but fiance drank it down in seconds.

It's true, and if you've been here before, you should also know it's DELICIOUS.  

Located inside Mandalay Bay's ""Mandalay Place"" (their shopping center) - this burger joint is almost always crowded and buzzing with people.   We came here on a weekday around 3pm thinking that would be a good time to come and get a table right away.  We were wrong.  We still ended up waiting for almost 20 minutes to get a table but since we had been here before and knew what awaited us, we would've waited an hour.  

The last time we were here, we ordered the Rossini Burger ($60), which is Burger Bar's most famous and most talked about burger.  You get a 1\/3lb. of American Kobe beef (which is nothing compared to the original Japanese beef, but it's still pretty tasty) topped with sauteed foie gras (duck fat) and shaved black truffles on an onion bun.  OMFG!

They have four different kind of fries you can order.  Skinny, Fat, Sweet Potato or Zucchini.  We have tried all of them and our favorites are the sweet potato and the fat fries!

If you order the Rossini Burger, you get a ""sweet burger"" after your meal.  We ordered the Creamy Cheesecake Burger - the buns are actually a glazed donut that's been sliced in half, there's a patty made of cheesecake and then there's a caramelized pineapple slice on top of it.  It was freakin' amazing!  

Service was excellent and when we told the waitress we were splitting the Rossini between the two of us, she brought us two separate plates, each with a huge half of the Rossini burger, and each with their own order of sweet potato fries!  Very nice!  

Not all the burgers are this expensive, mind you.  You can still get a Kobe burger without the foie gras and truffles for about $20.  I've also tried their ""Surf and Turf Burger""($25), which has a 1\/3lb. of Black Angus beef topped with a grilled half lobster and grilled asparagus.  It doesn't come close to the Rossini burger in taste, but it's still a pretty delicious and decadent burger!  

This restaurant has become a regular destination for us whenever we're in Vegas.  My wife insists we HAVE to get a burger at Burger Bar.

My bookmark was for the Rossini burger, the most expensive item here, but I only realized that once I got home. If you're daring enough, give it a try. 

I see Burger Bar as a fancier version of The Counter. I try to eat as uniquely as possible, so being able to customize my own burger immediately grabbed my attention. You have a choice of 8 meats + 1 veggie, 6 buns, and 46 toppings. If this doesn't satisfy you, nothing will.

I ended up getting the following:

Lamb Burger ""Murquez Style"" + Sesame Bun + Cheddar Cheese + Grilled Shrimp + Pesto Sauce 

Where else can you get a combo like that? Upon first bite, the burger was nothing short of glorious. It's like the Vegas gods flew down from the top of the Mandalay Bay and presented me this burger on a golden platter. At that point of the night, I wasn't even drunk yet but my taste buds sent orgasmic chills throughout my whole body that had me ready to pass out from how delectable this burger was. The ground lamb is seasoned and cooked to perfection and presented to you in a pretty hefty patty. The shrimp are hefty and go together perfectly with the lamb, cheese and pesto. Whoever doesn't believe me needs to give it a try. The bun is perfectly toasted and has a slightly sweet but not distracting taste to it.

To top it off, I got the Chocolate Cowboy Milkshake, which consists of whiskey, chocolate ice cream, chocolate, and whipped cream. Simple, yet so delectable. It may be pricey but it comes in such a huge glass that you'll need to summon your friends to finish. This goes perfectly with any burger.

I rarely leave negative reviews, this is not a negative review, it's an attempt to tell management to wake up and start paying attention to the details. the owner ""or name"" attached to this place as a celebrity Chef means very little to me as the following points are well deserved comments.
1. Why do you serve a pickle spear on top of the lettuce tomato onion? Who wants to eat a pickle spear? This should be 3-4 dill pickle chips so that the sourness complements the burger in every other way.
2. Why is the lettuce soggy and setting on the side on a piece of paper tray cover?  Your line cooks miss this fine detail that lettuce is washed in cold water and slapped dry to stay crisp.
3. Good job on the thin sliced red onions, every one thick slices the onion and it ruins the burger.
4.  Your skinny fries suck.  If in-n-out can make fresh fries so can you.  Also I notice you use ""stealth"" or ""coated "" fries to make them stay crispy longer.  Whiskey Tango Foxtrot!  Your little square paper bags are nothing more than portion control tools.
5. Whats with the funky square metal tin trays? It looks cool and gastro-pubby but it's just another way some bean counter at corporate figured out that tin flat trays are cheaper than plates. And they don't break. Buy some plates.
6.  Your prices are beyond fair. $11-12 for a burger and fries well done. Nice location. Nice ambiance, I like the beer coolers with glass doors.  Your beer taps should be behind the counter on the wall.  Shorter runs, less waste, less foam, also you increase seating at the bar.
7.  This is good and bad.  Thank you for linen and nice silverware.  Next time can i have my silverware roll before I eat half my burger and have to ask the guy next to me for some paper cocktail napkins to wipe my face?

We made the mistake of dining at Holstein's, which I absolutely loved the first time we visited last year. 

What makes Burger Bar a 4 star dining experience for us is actually overlooked quite often by Yelpers like me. I have been to Burger Bar in Vegas 3 times, SF 5 times and both locations offer exactly the same quality, the same freshness, flavors are identical each and every time. Consistency is clearly the end result of hard work, dedication and a high level of execution. 

I decided to add some additional options to my burger this go around and I am glad I do. I typically order up the same things, but this time, I added grilled onions, which were cooked to perfection and tasted delicious atop my burger. 

I also ordered up a Virgin strawberry mojito and damn was it good!

The DBF is a big fan of the turkey burger, which has a terrific pure turkey flavor, like Thanksgiving.  The veggie burger is tasty and very different from all others that I have had; the interior is almost the texture of mashed potatoes, but the outside has a slightly crispy crust.  There are lots of interesting shakes on the menu too.  The restaurant is dark but has a fun and hip vibe, and there are TVs in every booth.  Service can be great, sit in Ashley's section if you can.  She is awesome:  fun, friendly, and really keeps on top of things.

Like any typical eatery on the Strip, they really stick it to you on drink prices.  Learn from my experience:  get the Burger Bar-tender to make your cocktail without so much ice.

Still, the Bloody Mary was delicious, served with a really crunchy full-size celery stalk.  Beer on tap was alright.  Strawberry Breeze, on the other hand, was weak and only so-so in flavour.  And further made worse, with a truly pathetic looking frost-bitten strawberry on the rim.

Trust me, this drink would *never* have passed muster, had the Executive Chef\/Owner even glanced at it before it left the bar for the customer.  Really left a bad impression-- just that one detail.

Burger Bar's servers were competent and cheery.  The hosts at front were less engaging, and very distracted.  If you want to have a meal at the bar, no problem no wait... just go straight in.  However, securing a table requires more patience than it should.

The booths were nice and comfortable.  Food-wise, it was... good.  But I can't say extremely satisfying.  Portions are not generous.  And way over-priced drinks leave a bad taste in one's mouth.

The lamb burger was thick, juicy, cooked exactly as ordered.  Tasty enough.  The condiment, though-- some kind of diced red pepper salsa mixture that came with-- was the real star of the dish.  That brought out the best in the lamb patty.

Burger Bar's Sliders were a trio of different beef varieties, done to medium just as requested.  Tasted fine, very good meat quality.  Buttermilk zucchini sticks and Skinny fries were crispy, light and nice too.

This is a costly burger joint.  I kind of want more value for above average food.

i had fried jalepeno pickles on the side. for some reason... i was thinking jalepeno poppers when i ordered them. since that's what i wanted i was disappointed when i took the first bite. but after i got over it and took them for what they were... i enjoyed them a bit more. they definitely had a little kick since the pickles were marinated in jalepeno juice. by the end of the meal i was all pickled out since i had 2 pickles and all the fried pickles.

As for drinks, 2 of us had the Summertime Splash which had gin in it and 1 of us had the Strawberry Mojito.  Both drinks were very yummy and I don't even like gin usually.  We could hardly taste the alcohol, so we asked the bartender if there was a lot of alcohol and he said yes.  He actually added an extra shot of alcohol in our drink after we said that, but honestly, I enjoyed the original much better.  Needless to say, the bartender and the other servers were all very friendly.

For the HH menu, there was a truffled grilled cheese sandwich, burger sliders, pulled pork sliders and buffalo wings.  Every item was good.  The meat in the sliders was moist and flavorful.  My favorite was the buffalo wings.  It was not the traditional saucy buffalo wing that you might picture.  They were prepared with a dry rub, but was not at all tough or dry.  It was the best buffalo wings I've ever had.

I definitely recommend this place and would love to go back the next time I'm in Vegas again.",2,0,1

I'm trying to ignore the fact that I pounded a few beers on an empty stomach before arriving here, but nevertheless...

I ordered the most ""famous"" patty on their menu (which comes in around at 11 bucks). After you pick your patty and your bun, you get to choose from a plethora of toppings... and by plethora, it's like an endless list of goodies (note, you get your standard fare of lettuce and tomato on here)

Portabella mushrooms, guacamole, 3-4 different types of bacon, like 8 varieties of cheese, grilled onions, some special sauces... I was just so overwhelmed and in a good way. They even had some truffle oil to be drizzled atop your burger and that comes in at a whopping 30 bucks. I opted for a burger on sesame bun with a fried egg and bacon. It felt like the BEST burger I have had in a long while. The egg oozed out some yolk and that just made for pure gluttony. I actually am getting heartburn writing about this...

Alongside your burger, you can pair it with some fries. I opted for the sweet potato fries and they were a welcomed treat. They didn't mess this one up.

We tried with the sesame and onion buns, both types of dipping sauces (one truffle based and the other red wine based), various cheeses, and finally garlic fries with Aioli dipping. We also tried their Nutella milkshakes. Overall, we were satisfied with the meal, but to be honest, Wagyu beef does not shine in burger form.

Day One:
Hubs - peppercorn burger and fat fries
Me - black angus burger with peanut butter and bacon, zucchini fries
Beers - Abita Amber, Dogfish Head Indian Brown, Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron

For me, the best things on the menu were not the burgers, although they were tasty.  The zucchini fries were delicious and amazing - hot with a crispy coating.  As Oklahomans, where decent beer cannot even enter the borders, we appreciated the extensive and tasty small brewery beer selection.

Day Two:

Hubs - same as Day One (not so adventuresome, or maybe he just really liked it), Black and White milkshake (vanilla ice cream, cookie dough, chocolate whipped cream)
Me - black angus with proscuitto and mozzarella cheese, zuc. fries, 
custom milkshake with vanilla ice cream, oreos, and caramel sauce. 

 I rarely, and by that I mean almost never, eat to the point of pain.  The milkshake was worth it.  In fact, I was tempted to keep eating it despite feeling like I just might throw up from fullness.

Kobe beef, lamb, fois gras, lobster, black truffles and avocado are just scratching the surface of the mismatched concoctions that come alive at the Burger Bar.  This isn't a buffet table loaded with burger toppings, but made to order concoctions of your own design (though they do have some pre-designed burgers to choose from).

The creative genius doesn't end with the burgers though.  A selection of Beer Floats are available as well.  That's right - Beer Float.  Ice cream and Beer.  We're no longer serving Mary Shelley's Frankenstien and now serving Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein.  And that's not all bad.

When my wife pointed out the Beer Floats, she laughed.  Unflinching, I immediately ordered the Beer Float sampler.  5 different micro-brew style beers, with 5 different flavors of ice cream.

I have to admit, most of them tasted better than I thought they would, and my wife who mocked me for ordering them was also slurping them down (I don't ever need 5 scoops of ice cream).

The burger was okay. I forget what we ordered, but we had four different kinds. All were probably just below the level of The Counter (pretty common in southern California), which isn't saying much. 

Service started off pretty good, and then suddenly turned ridiculously rude towards the end of our meal. I'm not quite sure what went wrong. We were all pretty friendly, and given that we were all slightly hungover, we weren't exactly loud or obnoxious. We didn't send our server running back for numerous things right after she came back, we didn't talk to her rudely, we didn't grab the wrong server and demand service, we ordered a good amount of beers and food for our group, we didn't order the cheapest thing on the menu and ask for waters all-around... in summary: we really didn't do anything that would piss off a server (and I've waited tables for years during college, so I know what those are)... 

Luckily, we were too hungry, hungover, and close to finishing our meal to give much of a shit. We got the bill, left a sizeable tip to let her know we weren't going to stoop to her level of rudeness, and walked out. Given better (or at least more consistent) service, I'd say 3.5 stars, but a 1.5-2 for managing to almost ruin a fairly-OK meal...",1,0,0

I don't mind paying more for a burger just because of a gimmick or because the place is in a nice hotel on the strip. However, I would like the food to be really good. It's barely average here. I did the create your own and it wasn't satisfying for the price. Maybe half the price. The fries taste like cardboard. Usually, I clean my fries up. I left half of them. 

Another person in my party got the sliders. They were pretty bland as well. The buffalo one was interesting. 

I feel like they have too many unique offerings and not enough made to order selections. Give the vegetarian, buffalo, Kobe beef, lobster, lamb, and other unique selections their own page or section. When you take all of those out, they really only have three made to order burgers. The classic, peppercorn and one other. 
 
The Create your own features too many options and could also get expensive. Also, you risk your customer not being satisfied by a bad combination of toppings. I would also recommend they come up with a signature sauce and push it. 

They need more, interesting made to order options. Or more interactive servers that guide you through the menu. Ours was nice but not helpful. 

We got a trio of ice cream\/mousse desserts that were not great either. A frozen strawberry shouldn't taste so much like a frozen strawberry.

The burgers here are topnotch and made with really good quality meat. You can have your burger cooked however you want it, and you have the options of making your own burger or choosing one of the house specialty burgers. I choose the Hubert Keller burger which is buffalo meat topped with blue cheese, baby spinach and caramelized onions, my friend had the Pepper jack burger which was Kobe beef topped with pepper jack cheese and tapenade. She had the zucchini fries as a side and I chose the sweet potato fries. 

The burgers were both tasty. The meat was juicy and flavorful. Every bite of my burger was pure deliciousness. My friends zucchini fries were superb, and my sweet potato fries were crispy and just perfect. It was my first time trying buffalo and it was really good and not gamey at all, and I think I actually prefer it to beef burgers. 

We also shared a milkshake which we customized. We chose chocolate ice cream, fresh banana, cookie dough and vanilla whipped cream. It was soo rich and good! 

To top it all off, the service was attentive, friendly and fast. Our waitress was super nice and we felt well taken care of.",3,2,2

With an amazing array of toppings to choose from, it's easy to get it wrong.  But after eating here on numerous occasions, I think I finally got it down pat.

I've been hooked on Burger Bar since day one.  I make it an effort to eat here at least once on all my Vegas trips (approximately 7 trips since).  The minute I touch McCarran Airport I make a beeline straight to Mandalay.

Is it that great?  Umm, yes and no.  It can be, you just gotta get the combos right.  Like I said before, it's very easy to go overboard on the toppings and just get it wrong.  

You have the choice of ordering their pre-made selections or create your own.  Picking a bun, meat and fixin's can be perplexing.  Like me, you easily get lured into exotic items such as black truffles, lobster and foie gras.  I made that mistake in the beginning and my burgers came out tasting like a garbage disposal.  So many things mashed together, it was a complete mess.  Not only that, it  was a costly Frankenstein experiment... ranging upwards of $65 a burger.  Yeah, it adds up quick.  

It wasn't until a couple of years ago that I stumbled upon a winning combination.  Plain bun, American Kobe (cooked medium rare), Lobster, American & Swiss cheese, Grilled Asparagus or sprouts, pickles and pesto.  Not too crazy, other than the lobster.  Eating that silky luxurious lobster tail is what drives me back.  It's that one ingredient that makes this burger gourmet!  It ain't cheap, but for $30 it gets my karma amped up to the highest notch.  All these nuances of flavor are working in every bite... sweet, savory, sour... mmm mmm mmm.  It's a feast on a bun!

Come early, there's going to be a wait.  If you get a chance, order the Butttermilk battered Zucchini fries and the Peanut Butter and Jelly Burger for dessert.  OMG... BANANAS!",2,3,2

I've been coming here 3 yrs or so now and feel obligated to post.  The food is always consistently good.  The waitresses seem sometimes like they have too many tables but are friendly.  I've never eaten at the bar here.

Price- When you're on the strip keep in mind that EVERYTHING is pricey!!!  If you don't like it head off the strip!!!  Actually, relative to other offerings on the strip and considering portion size, this place is actually a good deal (for the strip).  

I live in Vegas and took my Mom here a few days ago so i'll post from her perspective.  

Mum- Sliders - Raved about them rest of the day.

Brother - Angus Burger.  He loved it, said it was the best lunch he's had in a long time.

We shared the Nutella  shake and the sweet potato fries.  We all agreed the shake was the best we've ever had (i'm not a big sweet guy but this was the bomb).

I no longer eat red meat and had the Turkey burger which wasn't bad as well :)

In summary, don't avoid this place because people say it's over-priced.  It isn't for the strip, and I go out of my way as a local to eat here.  People I bring here think it's great and I have friends in town that have had their birthdays here.

The burger itself was smaller then I would have liked. The fries were seasoned and delicious. I had a martini that was shaken but when poured had some ice in the glass. No big deal I took it out.

The vegeburger is always an underestimated menu item, thrown in as an afterthought by most carniverous restaurants as a half-hearted olive branch so that the meat eaters can drag their vegehead friends with them, but usually they are very basic and do not offer choice options or ways to jazz them up like are typically offered for meat burgers-so any opportunity to play around with the vegeburger medium is a place I'm in the mood to try!

After ordering a vegeburger with portabello mushrooms and jack cheese, I gotta say that I am TOTALLY a fan of this place now!  Their patty was closer to a gardenburger than to a boca burger, which is how i prefer my nonmeat burgers to be.  The mushrooms were plentiful and the cheese was melted to perfection.  

As a fantastic side, the zucchini fries were amazing.  Fried to perfection with ranch to dip them in, these definately made my night.

Since I was staying at Mandalay Bay, they let me phone down my order and pick it up in about 10 minutes.  When I got there, I overheard the hostess telling a customer that the table wait was about 15-20 minutes for a table for two.  Not bad considering how long you have to wait for tables in other places in vegas, but I definately was pleased with my choice of to-go.

Unfortunately, this is the absolute worst burger I've ever had. I wanted to like this place since Hubert Keller designed the menu. We tried the $16 Kobe burger which should have been moist and delicious, but instead it was a over-cooked, scrawny little hockey puck on a so-so bun. The fries were just OK. I've had better...everywhere else.

Save the money and go to Keller's absolutely fabulous Fleur de Lys. Go to the Las Vegas location, not the flagship San Francisco one. I tried both and they don't even come close to each other...so wierd.",1,0,0

Also, the sweet potato fries were really good.
The hubs had the sliders and said they were very good. They had a ton of craft beers to choose from, and I thought the prices for reasonable for a place on the strip. The place was packed, so we sat at the bar when two seats opened up, after waiting about 25 minutes for a table.
I think I might have gotten food poisoning though, since I got violently ill after eating here. The hubs was fine. I can't remember, but I probably ordered my burger medium.

So burger bar is a not too trendy burger joint located in Mandalay Bay. They have build your own burger concepts but we decided to be safe and ordered the hang over and the lamb burger. I've had great lamb burgers in the past and this has got to be one of the most disappointing lamb burgers I've ever had for $20. As for the hang over, it's decent but it made me crave for in-n-out because it is the exact same burger except it is $13 versus $5. Everything was just underwhelming and lacking in bold rich flavors. At least the portion sizes were decent.

They do have a build your own milkshake, but since I'm lactose intolerant, I'll pass on liquid death. :(. There are so many other options which makes it hard for me to recommend the Burger Bar.

For God's sake, do not order the Kobe burger. This is one of my pet peeves about most of the restaurants on the strip. The beauty of Kobe (and really, Wagyu, which it can't even touch) is in the perfectly marbled texture of the meat, which is completely ruined by grinding it up into burger. It's a stupid gimmick that apparently works very well as these burgers are so prolific on menus here. It's hard to find a restaurant without them here, so I guess I'm in no position to protest them all. Whatever.

I like the idea that I can get something as ridiculous as truffles or foie gras on my burger, but I never would. Choice of three different types of bacon PLUS prosciutto is very nice, as well as three different types of fries (skinny, fat, and sweet potato) covers all the bases.

They were open late on a Friday night, when my boyfriend and I just arrived, so after a long 3 hour drive, we were starving, and craving something too good to be true.  We knew exactly what we wanted...a KOBE BEEF BURGER.

now this is the 2nd time we've been here, and neither experience has left us in dissapointment.  I've tried the angus beef, the turkey burger, and now the kobe beef, and no other burger i've had has been this meaty, juicy, and succulent.  Paired with the sweet potato fries, and it's one of the best meals i've had in my life.  The burgers are huge, and the servings of fries can feed 2, so if you wanna save your money for gambling or appetite for liquor, than share.  

we also had the dessert burger, which was okay. It's just cool to look at. The doughnut and chocolate ganache were my favorite parts, but the fruit combined with it was a little tart for my liking.

But this place definitely earns 5 starts for the food, ambiance, and service. AMAZING.

He couldn't have been farther from the truth. This place is nothing but a burger assembly line. The burger I had came to me with slightly burnt caramelized onions which threw off the entire taste of the burger I got. I flagged down the waitress and told her it was no good. Even another person at the table that got the caramelized onions thought the same thing. The waitress had me wait for the ""manager"" to come out and remedy the situation. His name was ""Scott"", and he had to be the most unprofessional manager I have ever experienced, he stated because I have taken two bites out of my burger that I am responsible for the bill, but he would gladly make another. After I told him I refused to pay for a burger that wasn't as advertised with burnt onions, he argued that this was policy. I told him, thats fine but if you want to charge me for some food that I refused to eat because it was amateur and sub par that he would have to call the authorities in order to get me to pay! The whole table that I was with was not only blown out of the water but was embarrassed, He offered to take only 1\/3 of the cost of the meal off the bill and offered me a choice of kolbe beef sliders. I finally agreed still blown away that he was fighting this so hard. He comes back to me and tells me that they are out of kolbe beef so they prepared regular burger sliders for me! It was at that time only about 9PM on a friday night. If this place has run out of Kolbe Beef on a Friday night, than it has no right calling itself the Burger Bar! My deduction, he didn't want to give me kolbe beef sliders! Either way, not a win for this place!

Lets summarize:
1. Bad food
2. Poor Service
3. Fight from the manager
4. Embarrassment from the manager
5. Lies from the manager
6. The most pathetic sliders I have ever seen

The sliders came back to us with no condiments just dry beef on 3 buns and nothing to write home about!

I was ""REQUIRED"" to pay for food I did NOT eat, I fought with the ""manager"", and I got a super sub par Slider as a sorry we suck gratitude! 
Overall this place and its manager are so full of shit that I will avoid this place at all costs, and recommend some of the more local places or even other chain places that will have better food, or management that can see that someone made a mistake, and make it right!

You cannot beat the burgers here. They are awesome. if you are going to get the Kobe Burger make sure you get it medium or less, if not you are just wasting your money.

We went here for happy hour on a weekday and it was as boisterous and loud as if it were a weekend. This place is pretty hopping and there were a crowd of people waiting to be seated.

Luckily, we only wanted to try the happy hour so we were able to walk through and find a small space at the end of the bar to settle ourselves in. Another gentleman told us - ""just grab a chair... that's what I did"". So we did precisely that. Unfortunately, the seat that I stole was inherently sticky from some unknown substance which kind of increased the ""ew"" factor. In addition to this, it took a long while to get menus or heck! even get anyone to acknowledge our presence.

We ordered their buffalo wings, chicken strips, plate of 3 sliders and their wedge salad.

Their buffalo wings had a nice texture however it was nothing special to me. The seasoning of the wings was a standard hot sauce just like what you can get anywhere else. The dressing it was served with lack any sort of distinctive flavor - if you can't tell if it's ranch or blue cheese that's pretty freaking bad. 

The chicken strips had a heavy slightly salty breading that tasted like what you'd get at any average cafeteria. Same goes for the fries.

The wedge salad was kind of disappointment because the tomatoes were on the mealy side. Yuck!

Finally their sliders. It was rather unfortunate that their meat is inadequately seasoned which ruined it all for me.

All in all, the food here is edible but hardly more than that. Given Hubert Keller's reputation, it should be way better than this. Factor in the cost...this place is a 2 star in my book.",6,3,3

Went to happy hour where you had to sit at the bar to get happy hour prices. Dining room doesn't count. OK, whatever. Wanted to sample several things so ordered some appetizers.

Here's the bottom line: The fat fries were OK but nothing special. Typical bar fare fries. I would expect fries in a place like this to be hot and crispy, not limp and mushy.

The Chicken Wings are the same chicken wings you get in almost any bar anywhere, covered in off-the-grocery-store-shelf Louisiana Hot Sauce. Nothing special at all. Very average.

Perhaps the most disappointing were the Sliders...

First, for $6.95, they only give you 2 instead of the standard 3. More importantly, if I go to a place promoting  itself as a superior, signature burger restaurant, I would expect the burgers to be extra-ordinary. 

Not only were they perfectly ordinary but they were the smallest sliders I think I've ever seen, about the diameter of a silver dollar. They were bland and dry, no flavor. I don't even think they were seasoned with salt and pepper. They came with cheese and a pickle slice.

Burger Bar is located between Mandalay Bay and Luxor in the shopping strip area by the swarovski store. 

We had a party of 4 and we were seated fairly quickly. Then again, it was also like 10 PM at night so it wasn't particularly busy anyways. The establishment itself was pretty big. It had a huge bar on top of that. 

I'm not exactly a burger lover so my opinion is pretty neutral. However, what I do believe is that when you're trying out a burger place, you should always go with a classic. With that, you are more able to taste their ingredients clearly. Extra ingredients won't be getting in your taste bud's way. 

I ended up with their ""American Classic"" --  black angus beef patty topped with American cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion on a sesame bun served with a side of skinny fries. I opted to put their crispy bacon on the side. I don't like bacon on my burger because it ruins the texture for me. 

While I'm sure that they use good quality ingredients, their seasoning department is quite lacking. Not only was my burger under seasoned, my fries were under salted. Perhaps some people like that? I'm not one of them though. I ended up putting salt on everything like my life depended on it. And before you think that the bacon would've made a difference -- I'm not the only one in my party that thought the patty was under seasoned. Speaking of that crispy bacon, it wasn't crispy at all. It was more soggy than anything. Limp even. 

The price was a little bit on the higher end of things, especially for a burger. My American Classic was almost $16. So with tax and tip, you'll probably looking at around $20. Though you do have to factor in that you're on the strip and it's advertised as a gourmet burger. The good part about it is that the burger they give you are decently sized. I got pretty full after eating half of my burger. I actually needed my friend to help me finish my burger :) Needless to say, he was stuffed to the bone afterwards. 

Overall, Burger Bar didn't quite capture my taste buds or my attention. It's decent and not a bad place to hang out with friends when you're in the area. AKA when your friends are in town. I personally wouldn't be back to this establishment as .. I think there are better burger places in town.",3,3,1

AMBIENCE - 3 stars (meh - boring\/any old bar and grill feel)
SERVICE - 3 stars (meh - passable\/not bad enough to complain)

This was our first time at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar.

We selected:

1) Chef's favorite burger with two changes: swapped out buffalo for Kobe beef; swap ciabatta for a soft whole wheat bun.  (Chef's favorite is buffalo with spinach, carmelized onions and blue cheese with a red wine and shallot reduction sauce on ciabatta) -  approx. $25

2) Build-Your-Own - Angus beef with green asparagus, oyster mushrooms, bacon and peppercorn cream sauce on a soft onion bun - approx. $17

3) Skinny (plain) fries - approx. $3

4) Glass of house merlot ($7) and glass of Red Diamond cabernet ($10)

Both burgers were amazing.  They nailed medium rare on both.  We split them in half and shared.  We savored every bite.  We couldn't really decide which we liked better.  The flavor on the Chef's Favorite might've won by a hair, but the texture on the Build-Your-Own was much nicer than the texture on the other (the crisp bacon, al dente asparagus and earthy, slightly chewy oyster mushrooms were all a nice contrast to the tender burger and soft bun; the Chef's favorite was pretty much all soft, melt-in-your-mouth-no-teeth-necessary kind of mouthfeel.)

Fries were good; not too greasy, not too salty.  We rarely ever finish an order of fries, but we ate all of these and dipped some in our burger sauces!

House merlot was fabulous minus (boring, a bit watery, not fruity like a Merlot should be.)  Red Diamond cab was much better.  It's a $10-11 solid table wine you can find at Sam's Club.  Would've liked to see a little bit bigger selection on the wine list (there were only about 4 reds by the glass and 6-7 total.)  But I guess they want you to drink beer (extensive beer list by country.)

Service was hit-and-miss with server forgetting about us twice for a long time.  Also, right after we sat down, she came by to take our order; we asked for a couple minutes, and when she returned she brought us a check.  She had already set it on the table and started to move on before she realized she had the wrong table.  That was a precursor on the service.  It wasn't horrible, it was just thoughtless.  Either she was distracted or tired or somewhat indifferent to her job (not sure which.)

Ambience was also a disappointment.  I would've expected something unique or inventive.  Nada.  Take away the menu and the food and I could've been in any average burger place anywhere.  No hint I was in a top-tier chef's restaurant at Mandalay Bay.  Kinda noisy; too many little kids and crying babies for my thinking (we had a 10:30 PM dinner.)

But for me, food is king, and the food was grand.  We were pleasantly surprised by the bill; under $65 before gratuity.  It was yummy enough that I actually thought, ""I could come back here again...tomorrow.",2,0,0

Maybe it is because they have a really good beer selection which includes this awesome IPA called Piraat, that I am on a quest to find now.

The burgers are decent, and the prices are fairly reasonable. 

FOOD
The burger choices on the menu appeal to a variety of tastes. There's also the option to create your own burger masterpiece with an array of condiments, buns, and patties if none of the menu choices don't appeal to your belly. 

On my last visit, I kept it simple and ordered the American Classic  (AC). The AC is a basic cheeseburger with onions, lettuce, tomatoes, a pickle, and bacon. It also comes with a good amount of crispy skinny fries. I ordered my burger to be cooked at medium-rare, but it was just too rare for my preference -- medium-well might be a better option. 

SERVICE
I've been here on a number of different occasions, and this place is always packed. When I arrived on a Saturday afternoon, before dinnertime, the restaurant was already filled with diners. You can choose to ride those hunger pangs and wait for a table, or grab an empty spot at the bar be served immediately. The bar service is fine, but I would've preferred sitting at a booth or table.

OTHER
The restrooms are located outside of the restaurant, and it's kind of a long trek just to get there no matter if you exit the restaurant from the front or back.

A decent dining choice located inside The Mandalay Bay, but I would check if it's possible to make a reservation in advance.",5,2,3

It came with a side of coarse sea salt and black peppercorns to sprinkle on your burger, along with a ""black perigord truffle sauce"" (which sounds cool but was nothing special). Even after adding all of the salt to my burger and using the sauce it came with, it still did nothing spectacular for my taste buds. Not to mention it took about 3 or 4 bites of just the plain bun and patty until I got to the actual foie gras and truffle part (which were both tiny pieces and low quality as I could barely taste them). The ""kobe style wagyu beef"" didn't taste any better than regular beef. The fries it came with were just mediocre fries.

So it is no secret that I love Hubert Keller.  I have the hugest crush on him with his French accent, charming smile, and gray ponytail.  And I don't typically crush on older men, that's a fact.  I also love how he's always adorably sweet and encouraging on the Top Chef shows.  And his PBS shows make it look easy to make souffle...yeah, right, but he makes it look easy.

So we went to Burger Bar after an unintended visit to the airport to retrieve my BF's lost ID.  Ugh.  This place looks like an updated more upscale diner with booths, tables, and bar seating.  Get your fave type of seating and get ready to stuff yourself!

Burgers are either ""build your own"" or Chef's burgers that are already designed with toppings, etc.  They even have veggie burgers and fish burgers so if you don't like beef you are still going to find something here.  I ordered the Hubert Keller burger that was buffalo meat with caramelized onions, baby spinach and bleu cheese on a ciabatta with red wine and shallots sauce.  If it is good enough for Hubert it is good enough for me.  The burger was perfectly medium rare and the entire thing was messy and dripping with savory juices from the sauce and the caramelized onions. It was delicious...and huge!  I didn't finish the entire thing but that may have been because I stuffed my face with fries.  The BF got the lamb burger.  This one is with secret spices, tomato, cilantro, and spicy burger bar ketchup.  It had a great spice taste, like Middle Eastern inspired flavor.  And the spicy ketchup - that is the stuff.  We ordered a separate order of that for our fries.  Not that the fries needed ketchup but damn that ketchup was good.

I cannot stress enough how good those fries were.  I am a huge fan of skinny fries, crunchier the better, and dear God they were amazing.  

If you don't want burgers, they do have salads and a chicken sandwich too.  They also have milkshakes, including BOOZY milkshakes.  If ONLY I had enough room for one of those too.  

Service was good, our waitress was attentive and didn't let us go thirsty.  She also answered that Chef Keller was not there that weekend and told me I could keep up with his whereabouts (i.e. stalk him more effectively) on facebook.  She confirmed that he is a sweet guy just like I already knew.  The prices are pretty standard Vegas if you ask me which means it isn't gonna be the cheapest burger...mine was $22 if that tells you.  And the ketchup extra was $1.  But hey, that's how it goes.

Nothing is as polarizing as the simple hamburger.

There's so many different arguments that can be made as to what makes the best burger. 

Simple and cheap at some stand that's been around since the turn of the century? Gourmet and requiring a credit application to order at a celebrity chef's latest brainchild? 
And every single combination and permutation in between. 

Hubert Keller is kind of accomplished in the same way one would say Matisse was a good painter, or Larry Bird was a good shot with a basketball. 

With that kind of resume, comes a certain amount of pressure to perform. 

And that's my fundamental issue with Burger Bar.

It's been around for a while now, and it's definitely on its way down.

I've been here more than a few times, and after the novelty of the Rossini burger wore off, including texting pictures of the receipt to prove my street cred, and the novelty of making a few custom burgers - ooh, i can choose from different grades of meat, that are all pretty good, and don't really make a substantial difference once ground up and seasoned, to 99.97% of eaters,  this place strikes me as a big buck version of Fuddruckers that happens to have a celebrity chef endorsement. 

Seriously. Think about it. 

They both offer hamburgers with different grades of beef. 
They both offer burgers with different types of meat.
They both offer customized toppings.
They both offer multiple types of fries.
They both have milkshakes and floats.
They both serve beer.
They both cost more than in & out. 

The last 2-3 times I went to Burger Bar, the service has been mediocre and delivered with absentee-level attention. 

The food has been inconsistent as well, and what kind of irked me the most recent time was that I created a spicy burger, and when I told the waitress that there weren't enough jalapeno's, she brought me a thimble sized cup with more sliced peppers, and I found an extra charge for them on my bill. 

Seriously? 

You're charging $14 bucks for a burger and you want to put another $0.85 cents on my tab because I mentioned that the burger didn't have enough jalapenos on it when it came out of the kitchen? 

Some nerve. 

There are so many other burger spots and so many other celebrity chefs in Vegas with burger spots that this place is completely irrelevant at this point.

When I like a place a lot I tend to ramble on and on and on and on about nothing.  I get all excited and talk about every little detail that I can remember in order to paint a picture of how fantastic of a place the place I like is.  This place is no different.  As you can see... I'm already rambling and I didn't even start talking about the place yet.  What does that mean?  That means I LOVE this place.  So in an effort to skip the rambling I will make a list of why I love Burger Bar...

1.) Hubert Keller- he is the chef behind this place.  He owns a fancy schmancy restaurant called Fleur de Lys that I have not had the pleasure of going to... I hear it's amazing.  He is amazing.  He is a wonderful man and a wonderful chef.  One of my faves in the world.

2.) Build-it-yourself- you get to pick what kind of meat goes on your burger (Kobe, black angus, country natural, etc), what type of bun, what toppings, etc.. The choices and possibilities are endless... they have so many choices it's ridiculous and all their ingredients are high quality making for a fantastic burger experience.

3.) Service- the staff is attentive and friendly and always ready to make great recommendations for your palate

4.) Milkshakes- two words: Nutella. Milkshake.

5.) Jalapeno bacon.  Boom.  Okay... so... this actually is a topping that is so good it deserves its own reason.  The jalapeno bacon is SO GOOD.  I'm really not sure how they were able to infuse the jalapeno flavor so well into the bacon... but it is so perfectly balanced with bacon and jalapeno flavor that you start to wonder if a pig and a jalapeno had a love child that resulted in this wonderful creation.  What?  Seriously... you do.  Okay, okay... maybe you just think they fed a pig jalapenos.  No but seriously... it has great flavor.

When I went to Vegas the trip was only about 4 days but we ate here twice.  The first time I went I ate my burger w\/ the jalapeno bacon and that flavor mixed with whatever else I put in was the best burger I've ever had in my life.  The second time I went I was without the jalapeno bacon and opted for the truffle sauce and some other stuff resulting in an okay burger.  Now I'm not saying that the jalapeno bacon is a make or break ingredient... I'm just saying that all the ingredients you put when you build your burger will make or break it... so choose wisely.. very very wisely.

Did I ramble?  Darn it I did.  Fail.  Fail for me... not the burger.  The burgers are excellent.  Just the burgers by themselves are excellent... without anything on them.  Seriously.  Okay wait I'm doing it again.  Rambling that is.  Darn.  I really do like this place.  Really.  Go try it.",2,2,0

So here is the good: we ordered one of their adult millkshakes (has alcohol) - the mint chocolate chip flavored one - which was AWESOME. Mint and chocolate and so drinkable with mounds of chocolate whipped cream and an oreo - what's not to like? It actually didn't taste like alcohol at all, which was good for me, but got us wondering what we were paying for.That came before all our food so I was kinda stuffed by the time I got my burger. My mom had the chicken burger on a wheat bun without additional toppings and my friend had the salmon burger with blue cheese on a sesame bun. Both said that their meats were cooked really well. 

I was way waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay less impressed. I had the veggie burger since I'm vegetarian, which had an awesome description but was pretty effing bland. It was made of mushrooms, brown and white rice, lentils, caramelized onions, peas, and potatoes. It tasted just faintly of lentils and the mushy texture added nothing to the experience. I had mine on ciabatta bread, which wasn't toasted enough to my liking so it was kinda too soft. We also ordered sweet potato fries which were good, but nothing special. Same with the zucchini fries, which actually seemed like every generic burger joint zucchini sticks which you can buy in a freezer section. I was SUPER excited about their deep-fried pickles, and sorely disappointed - they were pickle spears, not chips, and the beer batter was crispy but way too heavy. 

I don't get why people think this place is so good - must be all the toppings. But if you have to rely on toppings, anything will taste good for a price, won't it?

When the milkshake is the best part of my meal, suffice it to say that I won't be coming back. Too bad. When you go to a top chef restaurant, you expect top chef food.",1,0,0

You walk up to a selection of ingredients and fix yourself a personalized salad. Burger Bar takes that idea and steals it on behalf of carnivores everywhere (but primarily in Las Vegas!). There is no need for a sneeze guard at Burger Bar since all of the available ingredients, or burger toppings if you will, are listed on the menu. They do offer pre-designed burgers that range from reasonable to not-so-reasonable price-wise, but the fun as far as I am concerned is in building my own burger. 

For eaters more adventurous than I, which basically means everyone, Burger Bar is one of the few places in Las Vegas where I would suggest you go to frequently. With so many restaurants in Las Vegas it is hard to go someplace you have been before at the expense of trying somewhere new, but I try to apply that concept to dinner more than I do for lunch. Burger Bar, though a fantastic dinner spot, works well for lunch too. Each time you go, you can create a new burger blueprint like one you have never had before. There are enough options to keep you entertained visit after visit. And even though I basically get the same thing everytime, it hasn't gotten old yet. 

Angus Beef + Sesame seed roll + Bacon + Cheddar cheese + Fried egg = Bliss. Add their Brown gravy and you'll wonder why anyone puts ketchup on a burger (and it's GREAT on their skinny fries).

Yes, it's great that you can make all sorts of wacky burger combos, but stick to the classic here people. It will transport you to new levels of beefy bliss, like Bear weekend in Provincetown or the first cook-out of the summer.

i loved the skinny fries. they were so crispy and delicious. we ordered a side of truffle mayo to dip with it ($5) and it was REALLY yum. we also ordered pepper jack cheese shots, which are basically mozzarella sticks except with pepper jack and shaped into a ball rather than a stick. those came with some type of buttermilk ranch sauce and were okay, but again would have been better if it had come to us directly from the fryer.

For apps we ordered fried zucchini and fried pickles, as well as a sauce sampler. The fried pickles were spears and I'm used to the little chips. The zucchini, which I have never had, was actually pretty tasty! The pickle spears were ok, I don't like spears because I feel they don't get cooked enough, but they sufficed. The sauces we tried were chipotle aioli, tartar sauce, spicy ketchup, basil aioli, and I think the white bbq. The chipotle aioli is the clear winner! It was soooooo good! I dipped everything in that sauce, it made the pickles so much better! The basil aioli was also tasty.

For our burgers we both selected the Angus Beef and medium. I ordered mine on ciabatta, with jalapenos, avocado, Swiss, and jalapeno bacon. He went with a sesame bun, cheddar, Foie Gras, fried egg, and opted for the black perigord truffle sauce and the red wine and shallot reduction sauces.

My burger look most excellent, I love a burger on ciabatta because of the juices from the burger, it was so lovely and pretty! The taste was delicious; the beef was perfect with a pink center! You can tell the beef is fresh! The avocado was also fresh and green! The jalapeno bacon wasn't over powering nor was the actual jalapenos. Included were the pickled jalapenos and fresh. I also got the skinny fries which were a perfect addition! He said his burger was AMAZING. He literally finished it before I finished half of my half lol. He gave me a try of the Foie, and I was not a fan. He said it was perfect though, for $13 I would sure hope so! The egg was cooked perfectly as well, like a soft fried.

Our customer service here was impeccable, the server checked on us many times and offered her feedback on the food and asked how everything was! She made sure we always had our drinks refilled. It was nice!

We will def be back for more yummies!!

The Burger Bar offers a wide variety of burger choices, but the real fun is in the topping choices (ranging from the ordinary: tomatoes, pickles, onions...to the extreme: lobster, black truffles!!!).

Good drink choices (quite a few beers on tap) and wonderful homemade fountain sodas.  Excellent sweet potato french fries.  

My favorite there, however, must be the ""Chocolate Burger"" dessert.  It's a warm glazed donut sliced in half (to look like a hamburger roll), a round slab of chocolate grenache, fresh strawberries, fresh mint, mango gelatin and raspberry syrup.  Great stuff.

I have to say that it was a REALLY tasty burger.  The other ingredients (lettuce, red onion, and tomato) were unremarkable but let the meat stand out.  The Skinny fries were unremarkable but I did find myself nibbling at my brother's sweet potato fries which I actually liked better than the Skinny fries (and I don't normally prefer sweet potato fries).

We were seated immediately (didn't like our table and were shown to a booth without hesitation by the hostess) and our server appeared right away to take our drink orders (lots of beer to choose from).

I tried flipping through the channels and it became quickly apparent that they only feature sports networks\/shows. I'm not really a fan, but the TVs are a nice touch if you're into sports.

The menu has a selection of around a dozen specialty burgers, or you can pick your own toppings (and protein) to build your own burger. I opted for The Greek (lamb) burger. SOOOO ridiculously good. It had just the right amount of spice and the patty was cooked to perfection. The sandwich is served on a pita which makes sense but it does result in a slightly awkward meat-to-bread ratio.

I have had just about everything on the menu, so it is time to tell everyone what to do at this place.

Here's how it works: 

Pick your beef  (angus, wagyu, hereford etc).
Pick your bun. (ciabatta, wheat, onion)
Pick your cheese. (blue, provolone, cheddar, swiss, etc)
Pick your toppings. (fried egg, truffles, jalapeno bacon, lobster tail, lettuce, onions, oyster mushrooms, tomato, pickled beets)
Pick your sides. (fries, slaw etc)

Everything is a la carte.  

Sure, you can get the Hereford beef burger on a bun with cheddar cheese and pickles but if you want your mind COMPLETELY BLOWN order the Rossini.

I came here for lunch while craving a vegetarian burger. I know burger joints aren't known for vegetarian burgers, and frankly most places just throw some sort of dry black bean patty on the menu and call it a vegetarian option, but I find it refreshing when burger places have multiple vegetarian options for their patrons. That being said, the Burger Bar had a decent vegetarian patty on their menu. It was comprised of unique ingredients like peas and potatoes, it was soft and moist and although I felt like my patty needed some salt, it masked by the ingredients within my burger. 

My $9.95 vegetarian burger included a leaf of romaine lettuce, a slice of tomato and a slice of onion. Everything else is extra!! Cheese: 0.95, avocado: 1.75, aioli: 0.75. I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries for 3.65 and paid an extra 0.75 for aioli with my fries. I paid about $24 for a vegetarian burger and a side of fries with tax and tip.

The place is located in the small mall that connects Mandalay Bay and Luxor.  It has sort of a grill and bar feel to it.  Super casual.  

Their menu includes a build your own burger option, build your own milkshake and build your own sundae option.   Great it you are super picky, not good if you are indecisive!  I tried the top sirloin burger and added a few fixings.  I noticed that they had about everything you could think of to make your perfect standard to gourmet burger.  I was in the mood for a Hawaiian burger, but noticed they have everything BUT teriyaki sauce.   Bummer.  When I got my well done (by choice) burger, I noticed that the bun to meat ratio was a bit off.  ""Where's the beef?""  I would have preferred a flatter patty so that it covers the span of the bread.  My first bite included everything but meat.  Verdict.  It was good, but not entirely great.  I could have settled for an In-N-Out burger.  Ouch.

Service was excellent.  You gotta love Vegas for that reason.    There are TV's at each booth which is set to ESPN and a few huge TV's at the bar.

TIP #1: If you like mayo, ask for the chipotle aioli.  It's a hint of smoky, garlicky pepper aioli (mayo).  Surprisingly tasty.",1,0,0

They have a series of pretension-free specialty burgers and gourmet milkshakes. I've got to say that their Irish Coffee Milkshake is the best shake I've ever had. It was worth the trip to Vegas. It is made up of vanilla ice-cream, coffee beans, Irish Whiskey, whipped cream, and caramel. I want another one right now as I'm typing this review from my hotel room. I bet it was better than the one Uma Thurman and John Travolta had in ""Pulp Fiction"". This one cost more than 'five dollahs' though (it was $11.00).

The burger was everything it had to be but the fries were like the frozen kind that you can find in a grocery store.

I was with 3 other people, and one had the buffalo sliders. Not one had agreed that they absolutely loved the place. I chose the sesame seed bun for my bread and zuch fries.

Pretty much all breading, and no zucchini.

The wait time: 25 minutes. 

The gf really didnt want to wait, but lucky enough she decided to do so or I would have missed out on what could have been...a great experience. 

During the wait, I stayed thirsty and ordered a Deadlift IPA. Being a gym junkie, I got the badge on my IPhone to prove it, I went with the Deadlift IPA just because a deadlift was a exercise. lol. 

The 9 oz's of golden brown liquid was filled in a wine shaped glass. Why couldnt restaurants serve IPA's in a schooner. 33oz of great beer would eliminate the hassle of reordering. Id be down for that. Not your standard beer, on a empty stomach, you can get tipsy quickly. As I grabbed my beer, the bartender forgets to even ring me up as I stood there waiting for the bill. Our table was ready and I was not about to stand there waiting for a bill so I took it with me to the table. Already, this place was a ++++ for me. Did I just get this right? A free beer? Hell yea! 

We sat down and looked over the menu. Kobe burger was the only option for me but I was debating if foi gras for a extra $30 even worth it. The gf rejected the notion of me eating a $60 burger so I parted ways and decided to go with some toppings. 

Kobe burger........and then some.
-Avocados
-Coleslaw
- American cheese
- Bacon
- Grilled Onions

The total for my burger alone was $26. All that was missing was a fried egg, in which the restaurant wanted to serve scrambled due to the recent egg scares. I ended up passing on it, but I knew a fried egg would have made it even better. 

Oh and it doesnt end there. I got an order of sweet potato fries and a Caramel Latte Milkshake. 

If your going to do it, DO IT BIG! That is just what I did. 

The gf had a Angus burger w\/ aioli and skinny fries. 

As expected, when our burgers came out, Kobe beef is Kobe beef. I tried both the Angus and Kobe and was able to make a direct comparison. Hell, even in a blind taste test, I would be able to differentiate Kobe beef with Angus Beef. The very first bite of the Kobe burger and the juices gushes all over my hands. The texture was so soft and moist. Each bite took very little effort as the Kobe beef melted away in my mouth. 

The Caramel Latte Milkshake was made of coffee ice-cream, caramel syrup, graham crackers, and butterscotch morsels. My god, it made me wonder what the other milkshakes tasted like because this one was just indescribable in words. Any explanation would be unjustified. 

The Burger Bar got me. It got me good. Definitely a must try if you want a great burger.",10,11,10

Our first visit to Burger Bar was exactly one year ago to date - and it was probably one of our best Las Vegas STRIP experiences ever.  Before we knew about Aces and Ales - we always figured craft beer in Vegas was a bust.  As a last ditch attempt on our LV craft beer journey, I decided to do some research on yelp.  Did it exist?  Luckily fellow yelpers were able to direct me to Burger Bar. 

At first we weren't sure what to think - my first concern was that being a Hubert Keller restaurant, it would be extremely expensive (sure, his food is amazing and restaurants are to die for, but only on very special occasions!)  My second concern was it's location on the strip.  I wasn't quite sure what we'd be in for.

Luckily, my fiance, who refers to my trip preparation as ""research,"" trusts my recommendations, so we took a chance.  We were pleasantly surprised.  It's a really cute restaurant, with more of a pub vibe.  Although their logo is  a martini glass with ""Burger Bar"" on it, they have much more than cosmos and appletinis.  We were very happy to see Dogfish Head 90 Minute on tap (NOT 60, but 90) at a very reasonable price.  They also had a decent bottle selection, keeping in mind that we were in Vegas and weren't even expecting to see Sierra Nevada on tap.  They also had their local brew and a few others that were impressive.   Nothing rare, but still more than decent.  We had been back to Vegas since then, but had never made the effort to head towards that side of the strip.

Fast forward a year later.  Our 2nd Annual Labor Day trip, we decided to hit Burger Bar since we were already at Mandalay Bay for a concert at the House of Blues.  We first arrived at 8PM and it was packed. No seats at the bar (our preferred seating of choice - easier access to the bartenders :)  and there were a TON of people waiting for a table.  We decided to head to Mix for a beverage and stop by on our way back to see if anyone had left.  Sure enough - 9PM on a Sunday - we found two perfect spots at the bar!  Timing is everything.

Dogfish Head 90 Minute was again on tap - 9oz for $5 - pretty good for a 9% beer!  Then I saw Lagunitas Lucky 13 on tap - 9 oz for $4.50.  I really couldn't pass that up!

We ordered rounds of beer, and my fiance and I decided to split the Surf & Turf burger (a burger with lobster and asparagus- $24.00) - surprisingly - soo good, with fries and an order of their Jalapeno Fried Pickles.  The burger was awesome, the fries were crispy and flavorful, (not burnt) and the fried pickles were probably my favorite.  I know people who say anything deep fried is better, and I normally try to avoid that motto like the plague.  But I was glad I tried these. A hint of jalapeno in the light batter, and the clean, fresh flavor of the pickles took away that greasy aftertaste you normally get from fried food.  They did split up our order (they cut our burger up and separated the fries for us).  We noticed after that there is a $2.00 split fee, which didn't bother us - but worth mentioning in case you are thinking of sharing.

The crowd is extremely eclectic.  A variety of college kids, older couples, younger couples, families...and it was busy - even on a Sunday night (although it was Labor Day weekend so that's expected).  Almost a little too busy and loud for us.  Although casual, it's anything but a dive.

The service was super friendly and nice (which is one thing that had stuck out for us the first time around).  Higher end burger shops and gastro pubs seem to be the trend wherever we go nowadays - Burger Bar is definitely one of the better ones.  I only give it four stars because it's probably not somewhere we would frequent if we lived in LV.  It is a little pricey, and the ambience is a little noisy and cluttered. I will say that Burger Bar is consistent - even a year later we had the same great experience.  Nothing much had changed, but I guess if it ain't broke don't fix it.

I chose the barbecued marinated beef with bacon,  sautéed mushrooms and blue cheese.   The Burger was juicy and cooked to perfection at a medium grill.   I could tell the beef was high quality however I couldn't taste any type of bbq marinade.   The bun I chose was the pretzel bun which was just the right texture,  chewy and tasty. 

Sol chose a grass feed beef burger with bacon,  a fried egg and American cheese.  He had it put on a chibatta bun.  He had his burger well done which to me is too done but to each his own. 

We also split a sweet potato fry.  Sol also ordered a side salad which was very disappointing.   It was lettuce and vignette,  that's it.   No other toppings.   Weird. 

We drank water.   Alcohol drinks were on the menu for $12.50 each.   Milk shakes were $9 each.   They were good size but yikes!   Even the tea was $3.95, really?  For tea?   

Our bill was $50 for 2 hamburgers, 1 order of fries and 1 side salad.  Even though the food was good,  it wasn't anything I couldn't have made at home.

The wait was well worth it; you'll have to study the menu for a while to figure out what to order because not only is there a wide selection of burgers and drinks\/shakes to choose from, but there's a million different combos of burgers you can customize.  Luckily, they have a page of specialty burgers so that you don't have to make those tough decisions.

I stayed simple and picked the organic-y, grass-fed beef burger cooked medium-rare on wheat and added only swiss cheese, tomato, and sprouts (I wanted to be able to fit the burger in my mouth).  I probably shouldn't have ordered anything else because I couldn't finish it.  But what did we decide to do?  Since there were four of us, we each can order four different type of french fries and all try each others' fries!  Fat fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, and seasoned fries, I think.  A few more people at our table and we probably would have ordered the rest of the types of fries on the menu.  The fries were good entertainment (and too filling), but clearly the burgers are the superstar here!

Unless you have a huge appetite or order JUST a burger (hard to do given the wide menu selection), you'll probably need to take some to go.  Don't overlook the drink\/shakes section.  They serve alcoholic milkshakes here, like a ""French Kiss"" (Vanilla ice cream, Godiva liqueur, Kahlua, chocolate) or an ""Irish Coffee"" (Coffee ice cream, Kahlua, Jameson, Caramel, Chocolate syrup, Chocolate coffee beans).  And don't just drink a Guinness beer.  Have a Guinness BEER FLOAT (Guinness, Coffee ice cream).  If you're more of a Blue Moon beer person, they toss in Raspberry Sorbet into a glass of Blue Moon.  What a great way to kill two birds with one stone (having a drink and eating dessert).

The sweet potato fries are delicious. One of the people in our party ordered the kobe beef\/foie gras burger (aka Rossini), which was just ok.

Very flavorful.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich (yeah I know, I know, but I just couldn't stomach anymore beef) and it was surprisingly juicy and delicious!  You can select your own toppings (although you pay for everything besides lettuce, tomato, and onion) so I chose sauteed spinach and truffle mayonnaise.  Oh the mayo... I wanted to lick the cup it was so good.  Fat fries with spicy ketchup completed the meal.  For dessert we split a milkshake with peanut butter, chocolate, and Baileys... very rich and delicious.  All in all, we really enjoyed our meal and our server was great too.  We would definitely go back to Burger Bar!",0,0,0

We had a party of eight and they told us it was a forty minute wait. An hour fifteen minutes later we we're finally seated.
Sitting at our table we were given our menus but never introduced to our server. Twenty minutes passed as we were passed about eight times by various servers, but never acknowledged. 
Luckily, one person in our party called the hostess desk and told them we did not have a server. Within minutes, the manager came by apologizing and finally giving us a waitress. We were even offered a free round of drinks.
The dissatisfaction in my face and stomach was not repairable. 
Food was ordered and still wasn't happy. I blame the service solely on the manager. If the manager was on top of the staff this would never happen. The apology of miscommunication is inexcuseable.

To anyone who orders their burgers anything but mid rare-rare. What is wrong with you? That being said, our first experience was pretty awesome.

We didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes. We ordered the sliders to start and they were heavenly. Anything on brioche is sure to be fabulous.

I ordered a kobe burger medium rare with jalapenos, jalapeno bacon, guacamole and pepper jack cheese. It was heaven. The husband ordered a kobe as well, but I can't remember what was on his. The only issue I had with the service was that we had to ask for several things that should have come with the burgers. They forgot my bacon and my jalapenos and they forgot my husband's aioli. I had the sweet potato fries. They were delicious.

The second trip, I ordered the Guinnes float which was fantastic. I ordered a NatureSource burger mid rare, but it came out well done and I couldn't eat it. It was totally dry. The server never came back around after her first check in so when I finally had a chance to tell her that the burger was overcooked, Jared has finished all of his food. She offered me another burger but I said no thank you. I had to refuse two more times because she kept trying to give me another burger. I didn't want to sit and eat while my husband had already finished his meal AND we had reservations for a nice dinner in like 3 hours so we really had to go and get ready for that. They took it off the bill, so no harm I guess.

I figure that if the service wasn't so spotty, it would be a 5 star place. The burgers are fantastic when cooked right, and the prices are average for Vegas and well worth it for those delicious burgers.",1,0,0

Zucchini fries 
Pina colada (frozen drink virgin) 

$22 with tip. It's worth it and yeah buffets are cheaper. 

*TIP: You have to wait about 10 to 30 minutes depending on when you go. I went for lunch.

*TIP: Try their unique fries (zucchini or sweet potatoes instead of the usual)

*TIP: You can MAKE your own burger or add topping to burger combinations they already have. They have seafood burgers too.

*TIP: It's close to FAT TUESDAYS so you can get a drink from there and eat here if you want more varieties.

Their milkshakes are classic, high quality ice cream is used, not too sweet.  Very smooth, that you can drink from your straw, no lumps at all.

I don't see any of the older servers here and the customer service is just sooo...bad.  I am in the industry myself and some things you just can't do.

The reason we come here is for the good burgers and the good selection of beers, but you can not ask your server for a beer advise and be answered ""I'm sorry but I don't drink beer"" This is a beer joint you got to know your beers girl.

So we come in and the first thing is the hostess, we ask for our favorite server, the server who usually serves us, the hostess tells us that the only way we can be served by her is if we have a reservation or we need to wait over an hour. If we don't want to wait an hour we can be seated with Hillda or Hadia ... don't really remember the name in only 20 min. So we agree to wait 20 min and go with the other server.
OMG was this a mistake. We wish we waited an hour. 

Later we meet the girl who usually serves us and she tells us that actually she was not busy and she actually had had empty tables all along. 

So we not only got bad service, but we had to wait extra time for the bad service after we actually requested someone else to serve us. 

NOW THIS IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS! 

IF I would to do this in my restaurant ... I'd be fired on the spot.

You can't sit guest to your friend's tables, you can't tell me you can not recommend me a beer because you don't drink beer, when I ask for ranch I want it with my food, not after I'm done with it, and you need to check with me when the food arrives to make sure nothing is missing.

Add to this the spinach and bleu cheese that had melded together, and you have the recipe for bliss.

The salmon burger was also good, sizable and a healthy alternative to a regular beef burger. Unfortunately, the delicious fries and onion rings probably offset any health value to be found in this meal.

Still, this place impressed me, as burger places can often disappoint, and I'd probably give it five stars if it weren't for the high prices.

Honestly, the fries were better than the burger. I remember finishing the whole box of sweet potato fries. They weren't too oily and were crispy. The burger was such a shame. Patty was overcooked and it's ""Kobe"" Sure didn't taste like kobe beef though. It was so dry and lacked the fatty flavor that I normally get from Kobe burgers at most restaurants.

About five years ago we gave up going to the fast food joints, with the exception of an occasional IN n' OUT Burger, and it only has increased our appreciation of how good a hamburger could be.

The Burger Bar in Mandalay Place is a great place to truly enjoy a good burger. They have a wide variety of burgers to choose from. Not only in toppings, but also in meat choices (Angus, buffalo, etc.) as well as bun choices.

The last time I was there I had the Buffalo burger. It's a bit pricey, but certainly worth the treat. Throw in a side order of sweet potato fries, and I was a happy guy.

This place certainly isn't cheap. Two of us went for lunch, ordered a couple of burgers and soft drinks and the bill was close to $50.

Not sure how the meat options are. I'm rating this as if I were vegetarian.

They have a vegan option which is a giant stack of grilled vegetables between portobello mushrooms that comes with fries for $12. I was told it was good.

Hmm, what can I tell you that the twenty jillion previous dudes haven't? I'll make an attempt at some useful insight.

I order the angus burger medium and it's cooked melt in your mouth perfectly, with the proper thickness and pink throughout. You can get it with other crazy meats, but honestly it's not as good as the regular style with the angus beef. I just prefer to let the hamburger do what it do. The Kobe and costlier alternatives are nice if you want something different, but I highly recommend the OG variant.

The sweet potato and regular fries are simply real good, and not unnecessarily fancified. It's also an excellent place to drink delicious beer, as they have many micros like Dogfish Head 60 minute and 90 minute at a decent price.

We were in town for a week and I know the wait can get a bit crazy at Burger Bar. Normally, I have no problem waiting it out (the shopping close by is SO great), I mean, who would for quality food? But on this particular Tuesday, we had tickets to see a show at 7:00pm at Mandalay Bay and I wanted to score dinner here before the show.

I know they dont take reservations but figured I would call anyway and see if I could try to arrange something. The girl who answered the phone gave me the email address of the manager to see if she could accomodate.  The manager was so incredibly sweet and went above and beyond to make sure we had the best table with the best server and got in and out on time to see our show.  Needless to say, the service here is top notch, excellent.

Now on to the goods: the eats.  I had the Kobe Burger built my own way. The toppings you can choose from are SO original and they have a TON of choices. The meat was insanely tender and juicy, so lean, not an ounce of fat. I couldnt decide whether to pair it with the buttermilk fried zucchini sticks or buttermilk fried onion rings, so the waiter mixed and matched and brought me out a half order of both!!! And I'm so glad that he did... they were BOTH rediculous!! So, so delicious.

I'm guessing that even with all the different meat choices, the normal taster isn't going to be able to distinguish between the cheaper and medium priced beef. Throw in the fact that no one's going to be going to eat just a normal cheeseburger (who wants to when there are 7 types of cheese, tons of toppings, and even foie gras and truffles to be added), it's just not worth it to go for the more expensive meats.

Just think of Father's Office in Santa Monica: one burger, no substitutions, no additions and no one complains. Why? We know perfection when we taste it.

If you find yourself at the south end of the strip, do yourself a favor and visit Burger Bar for your burger fix.

Aside from the recommended options, Burger Bar offers guests the ability to customize their burger any way they see fit.  Bun choices, protein choices (even a salmon option), and toppings galore.  The fries and onion rings are pretty amazing as well.  I've been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed.  The prices are reasonable in normal places, and downright bargain-priced for the Strip.  I've dined here with a friend and we each got a burger, fries, and a beer for about $40 before tip.

This place often gets crowded, with wait times in the hour range.  If you want to be seated fast, sit at the bar.  The wait is usually zero and the bartenders are extremely friendly and helpful.",0,0,0

I had the peppercorn burger, medium temperature. When the burger came out, the meat was literally raw in the middle. I asked the waitress if they could just heat it up a touch, I like my burger pink, not raw. She said no problem and returned with a well done patty. *sigh*. there goes my $20 on a burger. 

The patty was overcooked, the peppercorn sauce was so mild that I couldn't taste it with my overcooked burger. All in all it was just such a disappointment.

Took us a while to actually find it but it's located in Mandalay place...take the escalator up, past RM Seafood & wander through the shopping area to find it.  

I have wanted to try Burger Bar for a long time now because I love Hubert Keller - I've eaten at Fleur de Lys so I also wanted to try this more ""casual"" eatery of his. It is quite different which probably is the most beneficial to my wallet.  

The bf ordered the sliders which had Angus beef, country natural beef & buffalo along with fries.  I customized my burger - kept it pretty simple this time around but when I come back, I'm gonna load more stuff on!  This time, I got country natural beef, cheddar, peppered bacon, aioli on a wheat bun with skinny fries.

Don't go too crazy with the toppings...just adding three items with the fries put me over $15 so even though it's tempting, you must restrain yourself.  =)  You can order a beer, cocktails, or get specialty milkshakes too.

After a brief stay at Daylight (the Mandalay Bay Beach Club), my group came here to grab some lunch. Burger Bar is located inside the Mandalay Bay Shoppes (it's sort of in the middle of things so be prepared for some walking).

Though without a reservation, we were quickly shown to a booth inside the restaurant upon arriving.

Service was superb. Our waitress was super attentive, fast, and kept our waters\/sodas refilled throughout our stay. 

I ordered a custom burger, choosing the Kobe beef option ($17.50 just for bun and meat - lettuce, tomato, pickle, and onion are served on the side), and grilled onion (which was about a $1.00 upcharge). I chose to get my burger cooked medium rare and that was that.

When the burger arrived, it did not disappoint! It was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had - simply tender, juicy, and wonderful with each bite to the last. There was no need to add cheese or anything fancy to this burger - just make it medium rare and have some onion and you are set.

Though definitely pricey, Burger Bar is an awesome eatery and I look forward to returning my next visit to Las Vegas.",0,0,1

At first, I thought it was just another burger joint as The Counter but Burger Bar is much better in every way. The service was great and the food was sooooo GOOD!

I ordered the Atlantic Salmon burger ($8.50) on a wheat bun and added on spinach and avocado. The burger already comes with red onions, lettuce, tomato, and a pickle as basics. The add-ons cost a little more but for all that, it came to be like 10 something. The salmon was cooked to moist, tender and juicy and everything complimented the flavors very well. Since I am not going back to Vegas anytime soon, I am definitely going to make this at home.

Of course, I can't have a burger without fries! We ordered a side of sweet potato fries and their buttermilk fried zucchinis. The sweet potato fries has the right crispiness without the grease. It could have used a little more seasoning but I was okay with it. On the other hand, the buttermilk zucchinis was seasoned to perfection with a slight crunch and the perfect crispness.

Soft and crunchy at the same time. All that washed down with a yummy Spaten Optimator beer...this whole meal made me one very happy girl.

Wait...that's not all. We ended the meal sharing a mint chocolate chip milkshake made with a mint liqueur. Amazeballs, I tell you.  We were so full we were convinced we'd only sip some and take no more. But it was so good, we forced our fat asses to keep going...and we regret not one sip of it.  

Sat at the bar, didn't have to wait for a table, and the bartender\/waitress was super awesome and nice.  So, my verdict? Burger Bar = happy lil me.",7,6,8

I'm giving burger bar a 2 because the burger was just flat out not worth it. $24 for a mediocre burger? No thanks.

A few of us started with the american ""kobe"" beef as our foundation. I added guacamole, provolone, and bacon and a side of chipotle mayo to mine. First of all, to charge that much for ""kobe"" beef would typically lead a person to believe that it just *might* be worth the extra change. It wasn't. The meat tasted incredibly LEAN and dry, in fact, and it kind of showed when my meat patty crumbled into multiple chunks. What the?? Sadly, the toppings couldn't save the burger from its miserable demise as I tried to pick up its pieces and enjoy what I could.

The boyfriend's kobe burger didn't crumble, but one of the other kobe burgers that were ordered also suffered the same ending mine had. A fluke? Did they run out of the good meat and think it would suffice to give us the norm? Meh.

Whatever the case, I've had burgers 10x as good for less than half the price so burger bar was a complete fail.

As far as beer was concerned... nothing was appealing. I peeped out the bottle list just for fun and was completely taken aback by a $20something bottle of sculpin... you must be delusional.",1,1,0

Ordered medium rare and it came out well cooked and tasted quite well 9\/10 (the bacon helped that). The skinny fries are good but i will suggest you to order the Zucchini fries with a side of ranch cause they are slammin.

The saving grace was the Black and White Milkshake which was to die for! The shake was thick enough to eat with a spoon and had large diameter straw to accommodate the big chunks of cookie dough in every sip and the chocolate whip cream on top was amazing!!!

The price range is hefty for a burger, but when you're in vegas--it doesn't hurt to splurge a little. My first choice was the Hubert Keller at the price of $25 & comes with a side of skinny fries. I've never had buffalo meat and cooked at medium--it was delicious. Never been a fan of blue cheese, so subbed that out for provolone. I am a true provolone cheese lover, but man oh man--it really overpowered the taste of the burger. As a matter of fact, it's sad to say that it was a bit too much cheese for me. Personal suggestion? Ask for light cheese with any burger. Oh yes, & the french fries? Nothing special about the fries. 

I can't say this was the best burger I've ever had aka still on the hunt for it. But it's never a bad idea to expand your broad of taste & check it off your list of places you've eaten at. Better to try than wonder ""what if"", am I right? 

Also, don't say I didn't warn you but prepare for a long wait for your food. It was at least a 20-30 minute wait for our food to finally come out. So just make sure you're not absolutely starving walking in here otherwise you might get pretty hangry.

In terms of atmosphere, Burger Bar is virtually indistinguishable from any other sports bar or mall restaurant. The schtick is the diner's ability to customize everything from meat to bun to toppings. I opted for the Kobe beef burger (which was $16), cooked rare and topped with swiss cheese, caramelized onions, and oyster mushrooms (these ranged from about sixty cents to two dollars). I also added a side of sweet potato fries (I believe they were just under $3). The burger was absolutely enormous, and it was more or less tartare-style with just a touch of char around the outside. The combination of toppings worked well together and added some dimension, but they didn't mask the flavor of the beef. The sweet potato fries were good and crunchy, but they weren't anything special and actually tasted like standard frozen ones. I also didn't eat much of the whole wheat bun I had chosen--next time, I'll just pass on the carbs.

By far the worst service I have ever had on the strip, bar none.

We waited 15 minuted for a table (not that big a deal) , however after we were seated it took 10 minutes for a waiter to wander over and take our order. We actually have to stop him from running off so we could order our sides.
In his haste to get away from doing pretty much anything, he managed to get a couple of orders worng, but our group of friends are pretty laid back about it and didn't bother to mention it. It literally took 35 minutes for our food to get the the table and by then it had apparently been sitting because the fries were cold and the burgers lukewarm.

The food itself was OK but forgettable with the exception of the Mint chocolate milkshake one of the group ordered, that was excellent.

None of us were ever offered refills on our drinks, not even the guy drinking water, of course the waiter woud have had to come to the table to do that. Once the food was delivered we only saw him again when he dropped off the bill.

Food: I mean, they're nothing really notable about it. You. Can make your own burger or you can choose the chef's special. Now, my take away from this was their extraordinary options for vegetarian\/healthy food. I guess that's a nice touch. 

I got the turkey burger while my girlfriend got the hangover burger. The turkey was clean but basic for the price. At $11.50, I'm expecting something that could bring a ""wow"" factor. So to be served burger with veges on the side feels a tad bit elementary. While the burger was pretty big, I didn't think it was seasoned well. You basically had to rely on ketchup to heighten the entree. That meal also didn't come with a side so it was a bit disappointing.

The hangover burger tasted pretty good but just like the turkey burger, there was nothing notable about it. They had a side of ""special sauce"" which couldn't live up to its name. This meal came with fries what looks so soggy, it made a bad representation of what fries are. It's embarrassing.

Cibatta bread, provolone, blue cheese and caramelized onions. It was a hearty dose of yum! Add some buttermilk zucchini fries and a beverage and I almost passed out at the bar counter I was so happy.

The wife, best friend, and I went here for lunch and we were pretty much satisfied. The wait was quite long but we were able to wrangle some seats at the bar and seeing as it was another hour wait for a table we just ordered our food there.

Getting a burger the way you wanted it was great. So many choices. The wife and best freind had the original burger while I had the peppercorn burger. First things first, the server actually asked us how we wanted the burger cooked. Not the usual let me burn the burger to a crisp and slap it in a bun and call it a burger. We got it medium because our server said they usually under cook the meat so our burger was pink all the way through and super juicy. The wife added a fried egg which was done right (a little runny yolk in the center, not like fatburger where it's over cooked). Made the burger more rich. The peppercorn burger came with a peppercorn sauce to pour on the burger which was delicious. Then each burger came with a side. (Had the sweet potato fries, fried zucchini, fried pickle, and onion rings.)  Each was good, though my favorite was the fried zucchini.

There aren't many people in there... Maybe 10. But the top 40 music is at a loud enough level that it feels like I am somewhere fairly awesome but low enough that I don't want to kill myself. The service is top notch. These guys are really on top of things. 

This is my first encounter with Hubert Keller (exec chef from Fleur). First impressions are important, and this food didn't let me down. The sliders were cooked to perfection. They were three very basic burgers. The focus was on the quality of the basic ingredients. Keller's staff was putting on a clinic for me of how to present a classic burger with no frills or fancy schmancy sauces and ingredients. I welcome truffles with open arms... In the right dish. You don't need to put them on my burger. I appreciated the sliders for their raw beauty and taste. Of course, if you want truffles, or triple cream Brie, knock yourself out... You can pile on gourmet ingredients all you like. 

I was going to get a shake, but at $9 opted to stick to my Diet Pepsi. I think that's where I had the biggest problem. This is definitely a quality burger place. Of the gourmet burger joints in town, this has my vote (for now). However, it is hard for a place like this to dethrone the simplicity and tastiness, and price tag of a good ole single w cheese at In N Out. I know they are not the same. But when I want a burger, INO is the benchmark of a burger. You can certainly get better, but at a $15-$30 premium? $9 for a shake? I'm not sure if that is money well spent. 

I'll be back. But not when I am just craving a burger. The next time I get a huge commission and I want to celebrate with my wife or a few of my buddies, the Burger Bar has my name all over it.",0,0,0

Burger Bar is located in Mandalay Place, which is the shopping area between Mandalay Bay and The Luxor.  There are lots of restaurants around this area and valet is a breeze at Mandalay Place.

Husband and I got right in and had a seat in the booth.  They have a HUGE beer selection (which had the husbands attention immediately!)  But we decided just to do burgers and fries.

I had a Kobe beef burger, on an onion bun, with a fried egg, mayo, lettuce, tomato and onion.  I had sweet potato fries with this.  I ordered the burger cooked medium and I'm glad I did!  If would have ordered it medium-rare, I think the burger would have come out moo-ing at me!!  (mind you- i'm all about medium-rare on a good steak!)

The husband had the American Classic with sweet potato fries.

We both agreed that we would have rather went to Red Robin or Stripburger over Burger Bar.  For one, you would think the Kobe beef would have great flavor.  Not even.  It was OK at best.  Husband said that he thought it was ""pretentious to charge that much for a burger that tasted like that.""

After both our burgers and fries (we had water to drink) and after tip, we walked out paying $45.00.

Definitely a cool place, and I'm glad I tried it, so I know that I don't ever have to go back.  Definitely disappointed!",1,0,0

These women definitely deserve a raise or a promotion or something because the service they provided at this burger joint was even better than the service i've gotten in much fancier much more expensive fine dining restaurants. if you're ever at Burger Bar look for either Erin or Ashley (or bothe of them) and i will guarantee that your dining experience will be as good as the transcendentally excellent burgers.,0,1,1

I really like the menu.  They have everything, for the vegetarian appetite, the vegan appetite and of course the carnivore appetite.  Tonight I got that grilled chicken Caesar salad for $8.50 + $3.50.  Super affordable for being on the strip!  I also got the Miller Lite pint for $5.75.  I thought the Miller Lite was a little stale but still did the trick.  My salad, though, was on point!  Romaine hearts, shaved Parmesan cheese, croutons and of course, tossed with Caesar dressing.  The dressing was lightly coated, not too powerful.  The Parmesan cheese was thinly shaved and packed a nice punch!  The croutons were in long strips of crusted toast, which you would crumble over the salad.  I thought the chicken was grilled perfectly!  It was seasoned well and they gave A LOT!

This time around I got the Kobe patty with American and Chedder cheese, plus bacon, grilled onions, and truffles all topped with an onion bun. For sides I got the sweet potato fries, also ate normal fries, but regardless they were nothing to rave about. As for the Kobe patty, well you can't really beat Kobe (WARNING: it is American Kobe not real Japanese Kobe) when it comes to beef do undoubtly it was good.

Did I mention the dessert that comes included with the fancy burger?  A sugar donut split in two like a bun with a patty made of dark chocolate and cheese of passion fruit gelatin with fresh fruit condiments. 

Only drawback was having to reject a Maudite because it tasted like the keg had been sitting way too long.  Waiter had no trouble getting me something I enjoyed a whole lot better.

Lunch for 3 please.  It was my first time there.  I was visiting out of town and two friends who live in Vegas brought me here.  They said we MUST try it.  GOOD CHOICE!

Their ""thing"" is that we must be intentional about ""building"" our sandwich.  Choose your: bun, the ""meat"", the cheese, the toppings, additions, sides, etc.  There is no ""pre grouped"" option, you build your meal from ground up.

I am 47 years old, and I have worked in hospitality for many years, and of course I have eaten in restaurants all of my life.  I have NEVER had a meal that was SO intentionally created and presented for me.  I could tell the placement of my two cheeses was precise, the placement of the burger on the bun was precise, the placing of the crown of the bun was precise... EVERYTHING was precise.  That made me appreciate it more.

The server was INCREDIBLE... never missed an opportunity to wow us with flair, friendliness, and refills.  Great job.

It will be a place I will re-visit when I am back in vegas... in a year or two... :)",0,0,0

Our wait was about an hour long, and the entire time we were saying ""this better be worth it."" Let me tell you, it definitely was. By the time we were there, we were starved. 

I ordered a Kobe beef burger, with grilled onions, mushrooms, and provolone cheese and the truffle oil sauce with onion rings, fat fries, and zucchini fries. OH MY GOSH! DIVINE! The fat fries and onion rings were nothing memorable, however the zucchini fries were soo delicious, I am craving it as I type this. I couldn't finish all of it (obviously), so we brought it home and unfortunately I didnt finish my burger as PH did not have a fridge. Sad times, sad sad times.",0,0,0

The waitress was extremely nice and kinda reminded me of Michael Jackson which made the experience even more enjoyable. But seriously this place is a must. I had the blackjack burger and mmmmm.

This place is located in the Shops at Mandalay Place, between Luxor and Mandalay Bay.  A totally unique burger menu where you can top your burger with pretty much anything under the sun.  If you are in the mood for a lobster tail or foie gras on your burger, they have it.  For the meat, you can choose from beef (they offer regular, Black Angus, and Kobe), lamb, turkey and veggie burger.  I actually prefer the turkey burger over the rest.  It comes out perfectly seasoned and so tender.  The beef and lamb are always great too.  After you pick your meat, you pick your bun type, your cheese type and then all the rest of your toppings.  My favorite concoction is a turkey burger served on an onion bun with American cheese, peppered bacon, and button mushrooms.  All the usual toppings such as lettuce, tomato, and onion come standard with all the burgers.  They make great fries here which come in both the skinny or thick varieties.  For something different, try their delicious zucchini fries.  They also have a big beer and drink selection here.  If you are lucky enough to sit at a booth, they are equipped with flat panel televisions.  The service has always been great here.  I have never been here when there was not a wait, but the wait is usually only 10 or 15 minutes and there are plenty of nearby shops to browse around while you wait.",1,0,0
