When you first walk up to the door you are able to see the fresh cuts of meats from the butcher shop on the first floor. There is also a bar on the first floor if you want to have some drinks while your waiting for your table.

The food was pretty good.

The Ribeye was good. It was not the best steak I have ever had, but it was cooked properly and tasted just fine.

The Steak Tartar was excellent.

The kale salad and the portabella fries were also very good.

The service was excellent. The busser and the waitress did very well. The valet attendant even brought my keys to the table for me because they were closing for the evening.

The tables out on the terrace have great views of the valley. I would definitely recommend dining here.

You also have to try the Sunday Brunch. The brunch menu is reasonably price and the food is outstanding. The Short Rib Hash is wonderful.",2,2,1

The Echo experience is one that is a must try. Tivoli has had its fair share of unique eateries that have all had some sort of cool new age fusion or a gimmick thats tried to separate itself from the rest and failed. Echo & Rig has also gone down this path but has succeeded.


The layout is a bar and butchery with a outside seating area downstairs. Upstairs has your dining area.

There are plenty of reviews of echo & rig so I won't spend all day writing a review telling you the ins and outs but you must know this.

1) It's a steakhouse with a butchery, this means the cuts of meat are pretty decent. 

2) The service is 9.5 out of 10

And 

3) Its kinda of an upscale kinda place, dress nicely. It isn't a flip flops and singlet kinda of place.

Ok yelp said it was a $$, but it's a nice steakhouse, I'd probably say it's a $$$
And not the $$ given.",5,2,3

Nice sour fresh lemonade. Spencer 8 oz. Center cut steak was tender med rare but a bit smoky for my taste. Broccolini side was good. Chips that came with steak were not bad. Enjoyed the arugula pear prosciutto salad was nice. Sea bass wasn't bad but not as light as I typically like. Very good Carmel turtle desert w salted caramel ice cream. The berry shortcake was very good also. Would come just to get dessert.

I also tried their Gin Gin Echo Mule Mule. Tasty cocktail that goes down way too easily. Their draft beer selection is decent. I followed up with a glass of Speakeasy Payback Porter.

Darren with two Rs and an E provided us with excellent service. We were outside on their patio and it ended up getting very cold. The manager was great in moving us to a warmer part of the patio. Their ceiling heaters are surprisingly effective.

Walking by the Ferraris and Porsches parked in the valet right outside, we entered around 5pm on a Saturday and were greeted by the hostesses.

We happily took the high-top right next to the window and I immediately ordered a Moscow Mule.

Even though we were seated in the bar area, service throughout was awesome. Our server went through her recommendations for appetizers and main courses. We had the portobello mushroom fries for our app which were...so incredible. Highly recommend.

For entrees, my wife had the Shrimp and Artichoke dish and I had the Spencer Steak. Both were delicious. Countless times throughout the meal, my wife and I looked at each other and wondered if this was one of the best meals we've ever had. Everything just tasted so good.

New review on the new\/revised menu items:
1) Alaskan Cod: fluffy, white fish cooked to perfection. It's served with a buttered crostini that crunch-ily melts in your mouth.
2) The Spencer Steak: This was on the menu before, I had just never tried it. This, I kid you not, was the best steak ribeye I've had to date. Perfectly charred, juicy, with a flawless pink center.
3) Hawaiian Ahi Poke: First time trying this menu item. I can be weird about my raw fish, but this. was. stellar. Not overly saucy and served with the perfect amount of seaweed and cucumber. Tasted like it had been marinating for days! I didn't lose any flavor as I bit into it.

As with any new restaurant, bugs to be worked out. The downstairs check-in\/bar wait area appears really disorganized, probably more so than it is. The huge entry seems to be a huge waste of space, especially when you see how cramped some of the areas upstairs are. The butcher area is cool, but I need to see if the selection and quality are up to the hype. 

My biggest issue was with the menu. It is poorly laid out at best. They claim to feature their small plates and ""butcher cuts"", yet they are some of the smaller sections on the menu, compared to salads? And lunches??
Also, the pitch the waiter gives about the specialty cuts being so unique-TrI tip, sirloin, flank steak???
Having said all that, the food was good, some of it very good. The sides were terrific (cauliflower, kale, bone marrow,asparagus, etc). The hangar steak is terrific. 
However, they also offer 3 cuts ""by the inch""-ny strip, ribeye, filet. The ""inch"" was more like a half and the meat was ok. Just ok. Tender but not that flavorful and disappointing. 
One great thing-bring your own wine-no corkage fee. 

As soon as this place decides what it really wants to be, it will improve dramatically. I'd love to think they'd move away from trying to be all things and really emphasize the small plates and specialty cuts. Vegas, and the neighborhood, needs what Echo and Rig could be.",4,0,0

When we arrived, I felt like the restaurant was HEAVILY occupied my males. Which I get, being a steak house. I guess. 

I thought the menu was a little odd in that the sides you order with your meat come out before the meat, as an appetizer. Maybe we were doing it wrong and nobody explained it differently to us.

Aside from not fully understanding that, the food was top notch. Seriously could not complain about any of the sides (we had the portobello fries, cauliflower, and sweet potato), and my filet, which I ordered well done, was cooked perfectly without them having to butterfly it.

Overall, I'd say this is a very masculine driver establishment. Great for a guys night, business meeting, or bachelor hang, but not so much a date night or place for the ladies. Atleast that was my experience.",2,2,0

We started off at the downstairs bar while waiting for our table.  I have to praise their liquor selection; they even had a couple bottles of Rip van Winkle bourbon, which I have been struggling to locate for a while now.  

When it was time, we were walked upstairs to the dining area.  Our server, Justin, was able to remember not only our names, but the names of my friend's two dogs as well.  This place does not have a corkage fee, so I would recommend bringing your own wine.  We didn't do that this time, but the wine list was also very moderately priced (I usually google an establishment's wine on my smartphone to see what the markup is).

My party of four ordered a few small plates to start: Octopus, pork belly and grits, watermelon salad, apple and fennel, and charcuterie.  All of these dishes were exceptional, but my favorite was the pork belly and grits.  The fatty part was crispy on the outside, and melted in your mouth.  The meat was as tender, and the grits were on par with what you'd get from an authentic Cajun restaurant in New Orleans.  

For our entree, Three of us split a 41 oz tomahawk ribeye steak, while the other member of our party got the black spaghetti.  I had a bite of the pasta, and it was nicely cooked, with a good chew.  It also came with a very generous assortment of seafood.  By the way, this dish was like 13 bucks -- what a steal.  The massive ribeye came out with a beautiful sear that made your mouth water.  A cross section of the steak revealed a perfect mid rare.  No unsightly grey band.

All in all, an excellent meal.  Excellent service, and much more affordable than a steakhouse on the strip.  5\/5.  Can't wait to go back!",2,0,1

That said, Ive been going to the butcher shop for about a year to get bone broth and am consistently frustrated by the service. If they weren't the only place I could get the stuff I would've stopped going a long time ago. Most of the guys are usually extremely nice (hence the 3 stars), which is wonderful, but they have no sense of urgency and are painfully slow in completing every task. Every time I go there I call ahead and ask them to set aside my items, so I should be able to run and run out. I'm not there for a leisurely brunch, it is a simple errand I generally run while out trying to get to other appointments or errands. However, I inevitably end up waiting for 10-20 minutes for them to even get to me, even though there are very few customers at the butcher shop and always at least 2 employees.

I went recently and the butcher was helping another customer. I watched while the butcher pulled some items out of the cooler at a glacial pace, carefully cut individual pieces of paper, lined the paper up on the counter, laid the meat neatly in the paper, wrapped the meat with the precision of an origami master, taped the package, tied it with a string, found a marker, and wrote on the package. Then he started on the second package, which involved some kind of bacon resembling meat and he has to brush individual piece which some tool, then trim each piece, before stacking it in a basket weave pattern in the butcher paper. If anyone has seen Love Actually I felt like I was watching the scene where Mr. Bean is gift wrapping the necklace - just get on with it already! Then the butcher asked the customer what else he needed and the customer named about 6 more things and I knew Id probably be able to sit down for meal before I could get my broth I called ahead for that was just sitting in a jar in the cooler. 

I was eventually able to catch the butcher's attention, told him what I needed, and asked him to just grab my broth when he went into the cooler for the next items. I showed him I had my money (exact change) ready, told him I didn't even need a bag or to be cashed out. He responded ""well I guess they (the other customers) probably won't mind"". Yeah, I'm sure they won't since it literally will not take one minute longer for you to just grab my stuff I called ahead for.

Don't get me wrong, I understand that if someone else is there first I have to wait. But you could at least move with a sense of urgency and act like you care that someone is waiting. Additionally, I do appreciate that they're offering something different than your grocery store butcher and I appreciate the care they put into what they do. However, if the service they provide is going to take 10+ minutes to help every customer, they should balance that with something else that would allow them to accommodate customers who can be helped in just a few minutes. The least they could do is have another employee (like the other kid behind the butcher counter) check in with me and see if he could help me. I know he may not be equipped to handle all orders, but he could've retrieved by jars of broth and cashed me out.",0,1,0

Upon arrival, the hostess was really friendly and accommodating. Immediately after being seated, we looked at the menu for about 5-10 minutes before anyone ever came over, weird but whatever. A manager (Kevin) came over to greet us and wish us a happy birthday, it was very nice but this is where the mess started. He ended up oddly asking what kind of water we wanted and started our appetizer order, which seemed weird because up until this point no one had come over and done the traditional ""Hi I'll be your serverthis evening what can I get you to drink... etc."". Whatever, thought he was being nice and getting us started. After he left the table we sat for probably another 15 min without anyone coming over to say they were our server, what drinks we wanted, if we wanted to order dinner, nothing. We genuinely thought we didn't have a server. Eventually a girl came over nonchalantly and started talking to us as if she had been our server all night, no ""Hello my name is ____ and I'll be taking care of you"". She just walked over and asked what we wanted for dinner.... we all felt super awkward and asked if we could order some sodas or wine or something since no one ever even took our drink order. After she walked away, another server came over and said he'd be taking over the table as our server.... okayyyy so who was the other girl? The whole night it felt like we had no designated server, it was hard to place any kind of order, and the entire dining experience felt like a disaster. I ordered the ribeye and I was not a fan. The outside was very charred and tasted burnt. The steak itself was extremely salty and was cooked more medium than medium rare. Our apps and sides (calamari, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, octopus, Brussels sprouts, and watermelon salad) were all mediocre at best. They brought out two ice cream Sundae's for dessert and they looked like a mess, it felt like we were 5 years old at  IHOP with these two ice cream sundaes.

We'd never been here so we took forever to figure out what to order, but everything we ordered was spot on!!! Family style is always my preferred way at a new restaurant so that we can try as many dishes as possible. 

Spinach salad was lightly fried and amazingly delicious!

Fried egg asparagus- because we need our green food! 

Lamb chop porterhouse- comes with two pieces nicely charred and not too chewy, how lamb could be

We ordered off the raw steak tray which is for cuts 25oz and up at $2.49 an ounce. The New York was the smallest on the tray and we went for it! If you're going to order from the tray tell the server that first so that time is allotted to cook. They served it pre sliced with house chips. Perfect for sharing.

We walked up to what looked like to be the butcher shop and put our name down and the gal said it was going to be an hour wait, makes sense considering it's a Saturday night. So we parked our behinds at the bar downstairs.

I ordered the hanger steak and the wife had the Spencer steak. Both were absolutely excellent. They were cooked and seasoned almost perfectly. The atmosphere is great, the staff is great, the bar downstairs has a great sangria. Overall, I think it's my new go-to steakhouse. The prices for the quality of food you're getting is just amazing.

Aside from our main dishes, we had the mashed potatoes and the asparagus with fried egg. Both were also amazingly delicious. One of the waiters came by and asked out of curiosity why I'd ordered the asparagus and I had to admit it was a legit question. Not usually two things that I ever would have thought to put together. My answer to him was, ""Well, I like eggs and I like asparagus, so I figured I couldn't lose.""  I was right. It's a combination I never would have thought of that goes together very well. The sauce on the plate is also delicious, and the flavors all just go together.

They brought out bread while we waited for our appetizers, which I usually don't eat. I made an exception this time and ended up eating all four pieces. It was very very good, and apparently very high quality because I didn't feel terrible after eating it. I have found that the higher the quality of ingredients in a few foods I avoid -- like bread, for example -- the less terrible I will feel. I still shouldn't have eaten it and felt the effects later, but I don't regret it. The bread was delicious and was high quality.

There are three things that I was not too happy with during the meal. One, I ordered the bone marrow appetizer and the waiter came back about 10 minutes later to tell me that they were all out of bone marrow. I wish he would have known that when I ordered it, and I wish they wouldn't have run out! Not a big deal, since this is what made me order the asparagus and egg which ended up being delicious also. Two, the hanger steak was cut incorrectly. A steak like this needs to be cut across the grain of the meat, otherwise the fibers in the pieces are very long and it makes the steak chewy. Thankfully, the steak was cut in such a way that as I made the pieces smaller I was able to cut them across the grain myself and the steak was definitely cooked just right so it was perfect when properly cut. Third, and this was the case for both my and my wife's steak, the char on the outside was a bit heavy on the ends. Two small bites of each steak on the ends was very charcoal-like, with that sandy texture and bitter taste. It doesn't extend too far into the meat so you're just losing the nice seared exterior of these two very small parts of the meat, and I ate them anyway. Just something that I'd like to see them be more watchful of.

This place is definitely a 5-star-worthy steak house, and if you're trying to eat Paleo you can  just chow down on grass-fed steak and a bunch of Paleo-friendly appetizers and have a great night out.

Pro tip: a Spencer steak is s boneless ribeye; also called a Delmonico steak in some places, but really it's just a ribeye. The Spencer steak here is ~$10 cheaper than the bone-in ribeye. You get the same great cut of meat and more for your money by weight, but you miss out a bit on the little something extra of flavor that the bone imparts.",1,0,0

We came in, excited, and ready to enjoy. We sat at the table closest to the bar. We ate and drank as any group in their early 30s would. Shared apps, steaks, cocktails. Nothing out of the ordinary. A young woman waited on us, who I will not name. As our time at E&R came to an end, we asked for the check. The bill was placed on the table and was left for us to figure out. We did, over $360 in cash, was put in a pile on the table. We continued to finish our drinks and our plates of food. Moments later, the female server came over and set down another check. One of the guests in our party explained that we paid it already, as she looked for the money. The server insisted we had not paid. The group immediately asked for management. After a brief description of the situation to management, the manager spoke with our server. He then came over to us moments later and brought 3 of us out on the patio, adjacent to the bar. He explained that the server accused one of the members in our party of stealing and he pointed out who the server felt committed this crime. I want to preface the rest of this story by saying, everyone in this party has been friends for more then 10years, minimum. We enjoy holidays together, know one another's family intimately, and have even been in weddings together. I trust everyone from that party implicitly. That being said, we finally called out the accused guest to the patio. We explained the situation and he immediately took off his shoes, coat, shirt, belt, pulled out his pocket. He was one article away from being naked. Imagine the horror? In front of strangers, guests, and friends, being accused of stealing and having to defend yourself in that manner. Everyone else in the party followed suit and we asked the manager to please check the cameras. He explained he could not, only ownership had access to the cameras. Really? What sort of policy is this? Obnoxious.
We politely obliged the managers request for a day to resolve the issue. He then asked us to pay the bill again. The audacity! We did, begrudgingly, as we knew the next day the group would be vindicated and the money returned. Wrong. 
      Over the next week and a half I called the restaurant almost daily. Everyday it was a different excuse as to why they haven't checked the cameras. Either ""The Owner's are working on it"" or ""They are close to a resolution"" or ""The manager you need isn't here"". This team of managers and owners passed the buck and I think it only peaks to their character as adults and people who run a business. Finally, after 15 days, I received an answer. The verdict? The camera was bad and they can't see the angle. It was tough to tell. I implored them to spare my feelings and please tell me if it was one of our diners who committed the crime, so that we could rectify it personally and I could apologize to Echo&Rig. The manager on the other end explained, ""It's not that...."" He would not elaborate. They basically said ""That's it"" No invite back in, no free dessert, no handshake, no sincere apology. They were just glad it was over. I will never set foot in that restaurant again and I suggest you do the same. We paid over $700 for one meal, do to the inept and dishonest nature of the staff, management, and ownership.
     To conclude my review, I will say that, I work in the Food and Beverage sector myself. I work for a renowned chef on the Las Vegas Strip. The rest of the party, also works for either the same chef or others of similar ilk on the strip. We told this story to every person we could in the last few weeks, in order to gauge if our behavior and actions were appropriate. We feel we handled it in the most proper manner. E&R did not. I realize that reviews like this can cost people their jobs, so I do not take a review like this lightly at all. I realize the brevity of a tool such as Yelp. If you are an honest, hardworking, decent person, I believe their are better places to spend your money, right here in our community of Summerlin.",10,0,0

The service is on point! The hostess passed along to the manager and our server that we were celebrating a special occasion. Our server brought over the steak tray for us to choose from. 
We were splitting the tomahawk and knew it was going to be about a 40 minute cook time. Our server advised us to order an appetizer. We had a huge steak on the way, so we went with the fried spinach salad. Sounds weird I know, but spinach will never be the same! It was amazing. The chili vinaigrette was delicious and really brought out the textures and flavors of the salad. I don't think I can have spinach any other way ever again. 
The food was fantastic. The service was amazing and their attention to detail was superb. I'd definitely recommend this place for a special occasion.",0,0,3

Anyway, we stopped by over the weekend and just made it in time for brunch! It'd had been a while since my last visit and I was surprised how fast I was seated since this place is usually very busy, it's a popular spot in Tivoli Village.  I ordered a cappuccino and ordered for my date and I since he was running a few minutes behind and said to get anything. There was a short rib hash with poached eggs that stood out. There was another steak skillet thing with filet mignon and egg in it I can't remember the name of right this second. I explained I wasn't sure which ones to get and ordering was left up to me, so they brought it out family style so we could share. Also got the portobello fries with the pesto aioli cause they are one of my favorite things from the last time. 

Echo and Rig's focus is on the food and presentation, there is a butcher downstairs, as well as a bar.  But what sets them apart is the level of personalized service.

My fiancé and I decided to celebrate our anniversary, and after the movies and some gambling we decided to try dinner at Echo and Rig. We did not have a reservation and walked in and put our name on the wait list. My first observation was they we were under dressed as we were at the movies earlier and didn't decide on our dinner plans yet , but was not made uncomfortable. We got seated and the General Manager Derek came over within a minute and greeted us, since it was our first time there and introduced himself and asked if he could get us any cocktails. My fiancé likes sweet cocktails and his choice nailed it as she loved the drink. Then Nicholas greeted us as he would be our server for the night. He was very knowledgable and professional, as was the whole entire staff. We decided on two 8oz filets and split a Ceasar salad. She also for asparagus with the filet. The Ceasar was excellent and the staff never let our water get less than half full, along with making sure if we would like another cocktail , as I had a couple , but she was one and done. After finishing the salad they come around and put a new fork and steak knife before the entrees came out. I am one of those people who likes a little bit of A-1 with every steak no matter how great the steak is , I know it ruins the steak, but just like the little tang. The steaks were unbelievable, we ordered them medium and they came out absolutely perfect. I started out by dipping it in a little bit of A-1, but after a couple bites I decided I didn't need it cause it was that awesome. The asparagus is pretty damn good do , comes with a sunny side up egg over it and adds a wonderful touch and flavor. Then, after we struggled to finish our entrees because we usually eat 6-7oz petite filets (there was no way we were gonna let any piece of steak goto waste) Nicholas suggested a Carmel dessert for our anniversary dessert and it was great as well , good flavor and I don't even like Carmel! Everything about this place is 5 stars from the hostess stand to the service every employee gives you including their General Manager Derek , as we were walking out he stopped us as said thank you for dining with us (He did this by calling me by my name , which was a nice little touch) and if you need anything here is my card and just give me a call the next time you come in, so I can set you up with a great table. I just thought from the start to finish this restaurant nailed it! There is a reason why this place has such great reviews and it's because it's service and quality of food is unmatched in Summerlin!

Conveniently located with valet service, this butcher shop\/restaurant was an instant hit when we walked in the door. An open concept with a trendy feel, the immediate impression from the receptionists were warm and welcoming!

We sat at the bar for pre dinner drinks and enjoyed a sampling of the homemade beef jerky! It was fantastic! 

We requested a balcony table because the inside seating was rather loud. We hoped to hear each other throughout the dining experience and it would be a challenge inside.

Because we asked for balcony, we had to wait a bit longer but we didn't care. The bar drinks, jerky and conversation were keeping a smile on all of our faces. Nevertheless, the manager approached us to apologize and presented us with complementary appetizers - tuna poke and watermelon & cucumber salad. Both were so light, fresh, and awesome! 

Now I was even more excited about dinner!

We sat down and our waiters were attentive, funny, and professional - we could tell things were only going to get better. 

Then, the waiter did it. He brought a wooden tray that held the massive cuts of beef available for purchase and boy, were they pretty!  The menu was loaded with so many tasty looking things we decided to make a buffer between the 4 of us. 

We ordered a 40oz steak which arrived on the bone and was cooked perfectly! Our table also held all of the following: bone marrow, risotto, grilled cheese, crab cake, Brussels sprouts, stuffed mushrooms, grilled corn, and bottles of wine. Everything was fantastic!

I would definitely return! What a fun dining experience with a great view and table setting. Awesome service from everyone we met as soon as we walked in the door.  Only downfall - noise level inside, but that won't keep me away if we are in the area again. That grilled cheese with braised short ribs is calling my name!!",1,0,0

Lost about 10 oz to the huge bone and another 4 oz to fat.  Considering this is a butcher shop\/restaurant, I didn't expect to find so much fat on the steaks, especially since they sliced the steak in the kitchen.  Ordered medium rare and steak came rare.  This is fine by me, but might be too bloody for others.  Minus 1-star for the fat and cooking temperature.  Portobello mushroom fries were good.  Next time, I want to try their thick cut bacon.  E&R gives out free sparkling or flat water to the customers.  Nice touch.

I'm glad I got to experience Sam Marvin's food before a huge hotel\/restaurant takes him away.  This place is not convenient unless you have a car.

We had the Smoked Salmon Benedict, Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes, the Waffle, and a side of the 1\/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious! The only complaint would be the Bloody Mary; it was a bit too bland for me. They could probably spruce it up by adding a square piece of bacon with the olive. They are a butcher shop, after all.

This place first and foremost is a butcher shop as were told by Dylan our server, and it is the only Echo and Rigg.  The atmosphere is hip and happening, and the place has a great outdoor patio area that would be great on a warm night or day.

We started off with portobello mushroom fries and I can see why it's a favourite for so many.  Juicy on the inside and a crispy batter on the outside, not like the tempura batter.  With the creamy dip it's perfect.

For dinner we both had the Spencer steak and side orders of the sweet potato and cauliflower.  All were delicious, I really like the spicy punch of the cauliflower when you bite into a piece of the chilli pepper.  Steaks seasoned perfectly.  However our steaks were not the temperature we asked for, both looked the same, between medium and medium rare, over cooked for my husband and undercooked for me.  For a steakhouse, you need to get the temperature right and because of this I would give it 4 stars as we really enjoyed the meal and drinks (mojitos) and service.  

Dylan brought out a birthday sundae, it had coffee ice cream and chocolate bits and  pieces of cake but the cake wasn't great.  It was dry and just not right.

Needless to say we couldn't finish our meal, especially the steaks so we asked for it to get packed up.  And this is where I'm going to give it 3 stars.  They brought out the bag, we took it back to the hotel and when my husband went to open it up, he realized they gave us someone else's steak left overs.

I came back to Echo & Rig to try their infamous Happy Hour.  Sounded too good to be true for a nice steak restaurant to have $2 steak & eggs, $2 shrimp cocktail, and $1 hot dogs.  Then they couple that with $3 draft beers.  This is one of the best deals in the city and it's located in high-class Tivoli Village at an outstanding steak restaurant.

The shrimp cocktail could have been a regular appetizer to order off the main menu.  The sauce was delicious and it came with about 20 mini shrimp.  The steak was cooked about medium and was a thin cut, but knowing that it come from the butcherhouse on sight, you know it's solid quality.

We've been coming to Echo and Rig for years for regular dinner nights and Sunday brunches and to celebrate special occasions.  I can't forget my dad's birthday 2 years ago when they let me bring in a cake and they surprised him.  This was also the first restaurant I took my boyfriend (as my choice) and it has become his favorite steak place in Vegas which is why we came for his birthday a few nights ago. 

First, I had a reservation at 645 but I had to change it because we were running late.   I know they were busy and the accommodated me so I was super excited and grateful.   

We got there and were seated outside which is fine but I'd rather like to be asked if outside is ok.   I've noticed that we've been seated outside a lot in the last few times we've come here and I'm not sure if it's just bad luck or if this is happening on purpose. 

Our service was not good at all.   Which surprised me because I almost never get bad service here.   The one time I have ever complained was at brunch when I got a hash that was burnt.  And this wasn't even about service!  One complaint in all the times we've been here?   Not bad at all. 

Our server was friendly and knowledgeable but he was also almost non existent.   We didn't get water refills (even by the server assistants)  and it took too long between checking on us.   I wanted the sparkling water and asked someone and they never came back so I asked the server but they were out so he offered club soda.  Very nice but it took 15 min to get.  Then my bf (the birthday boy!) ordered a diet coke (because his water glass smelled funny) and it came after the meal!   Unacceptable!

The managers usually come by each table to see how things are going and we saw that he did go to every table around us but did not come to ours.  Really?   This has never ever happened.  We definitely felt excluded and unimportant. 

The meal ended and we just wanted to leave but we were kind of forced to have the birthday dessert.  We didn't want it.   If it was that important to give us something then they could have taken off a side or something not make us order a dessert we don't want.  I did appreciate the fact that the club soda and diet were not on the bill because if they were I would have lost it.

It definitely has that vibe where you have to get dressed up in a sundress & get bottomless mimosas, which are only $16. You lose count of how many you drank because they refill your glass before it empties. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing, but I always have a good time.

I change up what I eat all the time, but have always loved what I've gotten. My favorite is the ""Grilled Cheese,"" which sounds basic, but it's so good!

The Mac and cheese was hands down the best I've ever had and I strongly recommend it. It's rich, creamy and full of flavor. I also had the rib eye which was cooked a perfect medium rare and was so tender I used a butter knife to cut it with. The wife had the bouvett cut and was pleased with hers as well. She also had the Le passion martini which she found to be very refreshing. Echo & Rig really lives up to the reviews in delivering excellent service, quality food, at an affordable price!

Echo & Rig is a butcher shop\/restaurant.  Just walking past the window into the butcher area made me salivate, craving a good steak.

We entered and were greeted by the butcher, the manager (maybe even an owner?) and several other employees.  The hostess was very friendly and one of the chefs brought us a prosciutto appetizer with a little pork belly slider while we waited. (this does not seem like a typical thing so don't expect it.)  There is a small bar that was crowded for a Thursday and a small appetizer bar that served the charcuterie plate, sausage plate and a few other items.

We were seated upstairs where our waiter Brian explained the menu to us.  The menu consists of small plates (appetizers or sides or combine a few to make a meal) and steaks.  Unlike the traditional steak restaurants that focus on NY and Ribeye and Filet, Echo has a wide selection of variety steaks like Spencer Steak (essentially a boneless Ribeye without the cap), Ribeye Cap, Hanger, Flatiron and more.  You can also get the traditional steaks.  I enjoy the pick your own sauce option and was extremely glad when the sauce came as a side so I could decide how much to put on.

I asked for the flatiron steak medium rare.  The service took a long time and in afterthought, I would have them bring the portobello fries (portobello mushroom, lightly breaded and fried with an amazing aioli.) as an appetizer so we didn't feel like the wait was long.  Brian was very attentive in an old school waiter type way, remembering my name, ushering me to the restroom when I had to go, and making sure our water was filled.

Sparkling and flat water are available gratis (FREE).

One of the best parts of this place is the price - portion ratio.  The Flat Iron Steak runs at $17.00 and is a 7 oz portion. (Note, they can make a Ribeye as large as 64 oz if you really must eat that much).  One of my biggest complaints about the traditional steakhouses is the steaks are usually 12-16 oz.  I almost never finish them and I cannot think of anything else that is so easily ruined by overnight refrigeration and reheating than a good medium rare steak.   Here, the 7 oz was just enough to fill my tummy and not make me feel overstuffed.

We also loved the Asparagus and fried egg appetizer and the Spencer Steak.

So why not 5 stars you ask?  1) Presentation was boring. Essentially steak on a plate surrounded by some potato chips. I don't need fancy but there was a pile of chips on the left side of my plate, the steak in the center and about 1\/3 the plate empty on the right. and 2) the service time was long as the place did not seem very crowded.

Some other interesting facts about Echo & Rig are 1) you can bring your own wine with NO CORKAGE FEE!!!! and 2) they make their own ribeye jerky.  Even their glass prices for wine are reasonable.

Enjoy!",11,4,6

I've never written a review but this was place was so amazing that I just had to! Everything from food to service was great. Here's how the whole experience went:
I called in to make a reservation for me and my girlfriend's 4th year anniversary. They asked me if there was a special occasion and I told them it was for our anniversary. When we walked in and told them my name, the hostess congratulated us on our anniversary. When we were seated, our waiter, Lucas (Luke on the receipt), also congratulated us. As we wondered what dishes were good since it was our first time there, he seemed completely honest with us. We ordered the filet mignon, butterfish, portobello mushroom fries, and Brussels sprouts. I usually don't eat Brussels sprouts but the waiter suggested it and I don't regret it at all! A few seconds after we finished the complimentary bread, we were given another without having to ask. Same goes for when we were about half way done with our water. The service is incredibly quick. The waiter also suggested to order the white lightning cocktail and it was also great! All of the food was amazing. The filet and butterfish were tender and juicy. Portobello mushroom fries were delicious and you can't really get it anywhere else! After we finished eating the main courses, we wanted dessert. The waiter then informed us that we are going to receive dessert on the house for our anniversary! Ice cream with assorted nuts. Tasty! Walking out, we were stopped by the restaurant manager, Xavier, and given his business card and told to contact him anytime whenever I plan to go back. Everything was great and I definitely plan to go back!

The restroom was also really cool. Sea salt scrub as soap. Paper towels were thick and soft. Most interesting restroom I've been to..",1,1,1

We planned our wedding reception for the restaurant, and everything ran like a well oiled machine. I wanted an off-strip restaurant that would be ""where the locals would go for a nice dinner,"" and I was NOT disappointed.  I could not have chosen a better location for our reception. 

The staff were friendly, gracious, and ever-accommodating, making menu recommendations, and working tirelessly to ensure that all 10 of us were satisfied (even the toddlers!) throughout the meal. I have to give a special shout out to our server, Brian. He was friendly, knowledgeable, and did a fantastic job with everything. 

In terms of the review of the food, we started with the small plates - the knockout items were the portobello fries, the ricotta and figs, and cauliflower. Other really good ones were the squash and the macaroni and cheese. 

For the mains, the Texas Brisket was one the best that I've ever had. I also loved that Brian took the time to explain to us the origin on the Spencer steak. Several people in our party ordered it, and it was fantastic. Just the right size, and cooked to perfection for everyone at the table (no small feat!). Even the vegetarians in our midst were satisfied; with all the small plate offerings that were vegetarian, in addition to the salads (the Over the Rainbow was great!), everyone was happy. The Salad was so big, that it was shared! As the person who paid for it, I also have to say, the pricing is extremely reasonable, with options at a variety of price ranges for everyone. 

I'm sad to say that with our wedding cake, we did not get to indulge in the E&R specialty ice cream sundaes, but I'm hoping that next time (there WILL be a next time) we will be able to make sure that happens. We can't wait to recommend this spot to everyone, and come back again!

We've found the best meals are off the beaten path. I happened to find Echo & Rig on Yelp. There was only one downside to the experience.

We loved the food. The atmosphere was nice. We were able to use Open Table. Everthing was a winner except for Sam, our waiter. For whatever reason Sam thought little of us. Any question I asked was met with a condescending answer. I don't understand the mentality. Sam is a waiter. While I don't think I'm any better than Sam I also don't think Sam is any better than me. Clearly he did think so. I asked about a side and was informed snidely that marjoram is a spice. I didn't ask about marjoram. I asked how the corn was served (on the cob or removed). My lamb chops came with violet mustard. I tasted it and found it to be delicious so I asked how it was prepared. All he would say is it's VIOLET mustard - three times he said it. I told him I tasted wine and was curious (we like to replicate things at home). He left and came back a little later, telling me dismissively that it was a red wine and mustard reduction. Was that so hard?

On the other hand his assistant, Julian, was a breath of fresh air. He was young and seemed happy if we were happy. I was so impressed with his attention to detail and his genuine courtesy that I stopped the manager and told her I thought he did a wonderful job.

So I guess I recommend the place with the caveat that you should avoid Sam.",4,2,4

I was particularly impressed by their commitment to sourcing food locally, and the selection and  quality of the meat offered was outstanding.  The service was impeccable.  Our server, Brian, was friendly and impressively knowledgeable about every item on the menu which he took the time to explain to my dining partner and I.  The ambience was sleek and modern, but relaxed and not the least bit pretentious.  Shortly after we were seated we were offered the choice of flat or sparkling water free of charge and a tray of focaccia bread with butter was brought to our table.  My dining partner and I ordered the kennebec salt and pepper fries as an appetizer, and  the Jumping Beef and the Bavette as our entrees.  All steak entrees are served with a stuffed mushroom, homemade chips and a selection of as many sauces as you'd like.  The accompaniments with the steak selections is certainly a rare find as most upscale steakhouses offer sides ala carte. We  finished off our meal with a decadent caramel and sea salt ice cream sundae that was more than big enough to share. Every dish was delicious, perfectly cooked and artfully presented.  We had all of that food along with three beers and coffee for  $85.00.  There is no way a meal like that for two people would have cost so little on the strip.

First incident was a dinner with my parents a few months ago. I chose not to do a review and maybe try to see if this was a exceptionally bad moment for them and that they can resurrect it. I probably shouldn't have as I completely forgot that the reason why dinner with friends was exceptional and we had some comped items was because they messed something up on the groups check the week prior they dined without me.

Anyways back to dinner with my parents The wait was 90 minutes, but then the food service was so slow and full of mistakes we were stuck there another 2 hours. I will spare the details but basically it was long wait to order something...appetizers came eventually...i was told that they didn't have what I ordered so I changed my entree....waiting...waiting...waiting....then we had to send back food multiple times. I am one of those people who don't send back small errors... We dine out a lot and asked for a refire twice this entire year, one of them being this. All of my vegetables were raw, my fish not cooked right. My fiance's steak was sent back THREE times because medium rare wasn't a possibility. A ribeye shouldn't be half a inch thin to where they can't get a steak to anything but well done. I have not been to a place where the staff knew how bad it was and comped the entire meal and gave me a card and asked to let them know when I will be back for dinner so they can ensure it went well. Unfortunately, it was the 1 day my parents were in town and did not bode well for me as a host. I'm now stuck to chain restaurants because I am not trusted to take them to small businesses now. They rather go to PF Changs.

I havent dined for dinner since and tried instead to do cocktails and snacks to ease into this place again. 

I went with drinks with friends and it was just OK in terms of food and drink. We sat in the tiny tables downstairs against the snack station which wasn't comfy and feels more suited to being used as seating for those waiting to dine in, than any sort of service. Service wasn't attentive. 

Went with friends most recently and I was just done with the long waits for a place to sit and not being able to handle the crunch with a backed up kitchen again. Good thing I overheard people complaining and some frustrated looking tables so that I got a headsup. I didn't want to sit for hours so I decided to opt out of getting food at all. Got a drink and left. 

This place will keep being busy because of location alone. There's few places worth the wait and this is not it.",10,6,5

I failed to review them after my first visit somehow and after going again this week and now realizing I didn't review it before, I felt it necessary to make up for it. Echo & Rig has won over many fellow Yelpers and locals alike and you can count me on this list. At first, I was skeptical about the location as every time I go to Tivoli Village I feel like I'm being punked and there are really hundreds of people there who are going to jump out and do a flash dance.... sadly, it's just empty streets. Yet Echo & Rig was packed the first time and had a nice crowd the second time I went.
I won't bore you with stories of delicious steaks, fantastic sides and tasty pasta dishes. .. instead I'll focus on the service which has been excellent both times. Coincidentally, we sat in the table right next to the one we were at the first time which put us right near the kitchen. I love being next to the kitchen where I can enjoy first hand watching the artists at their craft. But back to the service... very attentive, helpful with menu choices and not overbearing. They've cracked jokes, shaken hands and provided my friends and I with one very memorable prank on a table of friends dining nearby.
We had a hiccup with the bread on our first visit but it turned into a funny memory more than anything for the simple fact that we asked about 3 or 4 different people for bread and each told us it would be right out as they had fresh stuff coming up. And each time someone else seemed to grab the bread before our guy was able to. He absolutely made up for it though and I'm happy to report that on our next visit the bread came out right away.
If you have not made it to Tivoli Village yet or have and were also afraid you were being punked... make it a point to go back and enjoy a meal at Echo & Rig. You can thank me later.

Thus concludes my story... thank you... goodnight.",2,2,1

I got the Short Rib Hash made with diced Yukon gold potatoes, paprika hollandaise, bell peppers & two poached eggs. The diced potatoes had a nice texture, but the short rib was a little too dry for our liking.

I ordered a medium rare filet and what I received was rare, no medium anywhere to be seen but rare. I had to send it back to be cooked a bit more which for a steakhouse they should know rare from medium rare. Medium rare steaks should be cooked to where 50% of it is a red center, the steak they served me was almost blue rare and very difficult to chew. So with the fact that you can't hold a conversation with the person sitting next to you without yelling and they can't cook a steak, I wouldn't be back again. 

The other sides that we ordered were just ok, nothing that I haven't had better anywhere else. I expected a fabulous dinner and experience but I couldn't wait to leave. The avocado toast with shishito peppers was probably the best thing that we had there.

Michel? I'm sorry, I don't remember!) was the best!  He was an expert and answered every question well. He was very knowledgable on all dishes and had the best recommendations!  We never had to ask for a refill, they offer both flat and sparkling water. Another waitress offered my daughter crayons and paper to keep her busy. The experience was absolutely perfect.

Note #1:  there is no corkage fee.  That's right - if you have a bottle of something special sitting around that is begging for the right meal, bring it with you.  Echo & Rig will crack the bottle for you and give you glasses.  Also, you do not get treated like crap for bringing your own bottle.

My wife and I arrived for our anniversary dinner at 7 pm on a Saturday night.  We were seated quickly and were greeted immediately by Derek, the general manager.  He introduced himself, let us know who our waiter would be, and took our drink orders.

Note #2:  Do not let Note #1 get in the way of availing yourself of their cocktail list.  My wife's gimlet and my ""lemonade"" were tasty ways to work off the heat of the day.

Sipping our drinks, we then got down to the business of looking at our menu.  You notice right away that the prices are reasonable for the plates that are offered.  Internally, I breathed a sigh of relief, happy that I wasn't going to pay $60 for a mediocre rib eye.  Our waiter, Jason, came over and introduced the menu.  And then showed us the off-menu steaks.  Yeah, this is where they make their money, and it's well earned.

We selected a 34 oz (2 lb) bone-in Tomahawk steak.  This monster was pricey, but was plenty big enough for the wife and I to split, and then some.  It was our anniversary, and I'm about to re-attempt swearing off red meat (I will fail, but try to keep it to once per month).  More on the greatest threat to vegetarianism ever known (next to bacon) later.

We started off splitting a spinach salad, which was great.  The spinach is flash fried and the salad includes broccoli, cauliflower, onion and a citrus vinaigrette.  It's not the same old spinach salad with bacon bits you are used to.  The accompanying vegetables in the salad are finely chopped\/sliced, and what you end up with is an easy-to-eat salad that is very flavorful.  

For our tapas\/accompaniments, we selected the cauliflower, thick-cut bacon and lamb cigars.  The cauliflower was either deep fried or broiled with mild chilies, shallots and onions.  Very tasty.  The thick-cut bacon was very tasty, so tasty I did not use the BBQ sauce that came with it.  The lamb cigars are like miniature egg rolls, they were good but didn't excite me the way everything else had so far.  We didn't bother with asparagus, potatoes, etc. because of the large chunk of cow that was coming.

The Tomahawk chop was epic.  It apparently is grass-fed Wagyu beef, hand-massaged and blessed by beef monks until it gets led to the slaughter, or something like that.  It had enough of a layer of fat that it got a nice, crispy outside, and deep-pink inside.  It was very flavorful.  You can get a variety of sauces with it.  My favorite was the red wine demi-glaze, which didn't overpower the flavor of the beef itself.  My wife really liked the Bearnaise sauce, which I think is sinful to put on a quality piece of beef, but our marriage continues to survive this and other disagreements.  The texture of the beef was excellent, firm but not chewy.  Steak also came with stuffed mushrooms (the stuffing would make a fine topping for the steaks) and some garlic potato chips (tasty, but I rather would have had another mushroom).  *If* you are going to pay $75+ for a steak, the Tomahawk at Echo & Rig is an excellent choice.  I'd put it up against anything I've had from Morton's, Maestro's or any of the strip steak places.

Note #3:  I think it would take a WWE wrestler to get through one of these chops entirely.  Splitting one of these is a great strategy for a couple. They slice it and make it easy to share.

After we finished all but a few bites of the Tomahawk (it was a struggle, that I must sadly concede to have succumbed to) we were provided a caramel sundae.  It looked really good, but it had peanuts in it so it was a no-go for me.

Note #4:  If you are there for a birthday, anniversary, etc. where you might expect a goodie, you will likely get one.  Be sure to tell the server if you have any allergies (because I didn't do so, I'm not going to penalize the server on being cool and providing us something extra, and I'm sure if I would have mentioned my nut allergy it would have been handled)

To finish off, a couple of cappuccinos.  Well prepared, very nice.

Now, about the service.  Some of the reviews on Yelp complained about the service.  The only thing I can figure is they got sucked into a parallel dimension where Spock has a beard and Kirk is stark raving mad.  Derek, Xavier (restaurant manager) and our server were constantly keeping an eye on us.  And it is readily apparent we do not posses stupid amounts of money.  Nonetheless, they treated us like ballers.  All staff, whether they were directly involved with our table or not, would refill our waters, restock bread, take away used plates, etc. as they passed our table.  The place was packed, and I can understand why.  Great meal.",0,0,1

I love that she takes the time to do this, not only for our event\/party but to all tables as well. Even when I was here before with a smaller group, she came by and I really appreciate that extra step. 

For brunch, we were given four entree options. Since I'm allergic to raw eggs (and potentially Hollandaise sauce) I chose the Steakhouse Scramble. It was just as awesome as the last time I had it. To compliment our main dishes we were served Kennebec, Roasted Breakfast Potatoes and Bacon, family style.

The steak was excellent and the price was very reasonable. I'm used to paying about 40% more for that quality cut. I ordered 2 sides not realizing that each side feeds 2. The only thing I didn't care for were the fresh garlic chips which I found too salty.
The service was excellent. It was nice to sit outside and enjoy the open air instead of being in a dark room. I think this is the first time I've been in a high end steakhouse and actually been able to see that my steak was cooked to my liking.

The personnel at Echo & Rig are all superb.    They immediately check to see if you're a repeat customer, and host you as such.    Their waiters go above and beyond in terms of service and manner.   

The wait staff knows the menu and I've found they do well in suggesting plates to try.  So if you want them to just order for you, this is a place you can trust them to do that.

The bar, hostess stand, retail shop, and butcher shop is downstairs and they restaurant is upstairs. Down stairs they have the bar where you can get really decently priced cocktails starting at about $8 which is great since most bars have speciality drinks starting at $12 and up. They do offer happy hour but there are only three food items on the menu so we never tried it. They have a retail store where you can buy products they use in the restaurant, and a butcher shop to buy fresh meats. There's also only one bathroom in the place and it upstairs in the dining area. There is also outdoor patio seating that looks our into the fountain of tivoli village. They also seem to have a juice bar where you can order fresh pressed juices. 

Side plates are on the smaller side so don't expect to get full off of those. Which is good because it saves your appetite for the main course. 

Items ordered:

Appetizers:
Portobello Fries: The best portobello fries that I have ever had! The waiter swears by them. The breading they use is not bread crumbs like we expected. Instead it was a smooth outer shell with a nice crunch to it. The mushroom was cooked perfectly on the inside and not mushy, underdone or burned. The aioli that comes with it for dipping is just the perfect mixture to compliment this fry. 


asparagus and a fried egg: came with I believe about 4-5 pieces of  asparagus with an over easy egg on top of it. 

Maryland lump crab cake: about 3-4 pieces on this plate. Pretty good

Entrees:
Bavette: good piece of meat not to fatty. 

black spaghetti pasta: delicious! The broth\/sauce was so good that I had to slurp it with every bite! A good serving portion and didn't taste overly fishy. I was a little skeptical ordering this because of the squid ink but it was delicious.",1,0,0

I visited Echo and Rig with my family to celebrate a birthday, after a friend recommended we try it.  I went it with high expectations as the other reviews I read were good and this friend suggested that they had great food. Well the food was great however it is the service and overall experience that left myself and everyone in my party disappointed. Upon calling to make a reservation and entering the restaurant you are treated like you are a regular and the staff interactions are positive. I was assured by the manager on the phone prior to dining that my dairy allergy would not be a problem and they would easily be able to accommodate it. 

The service simply went downhill from there. I will keep it short as no one wants to read a review full of complaints but I want to share my experience so others are aware. We were rushed, not checked on regularly by our server, the staff were constantly whispering in the corner and pointing at tables, and above all the staff is not educated about and does not handle food allergies appropriately.

A few examples about the service:
- Our waiter seemed annoyed with the ordering process and instead of helping us - a larger party who had not dined there previously he rushed us into ordering. He spoke so quickly that no one could understand or hear what he was saying. In addition when the person paying the bill tried to order another side for the table he stopped her and said ""I think we are good on sides"". If she wants to order the whole menu that should not be a problem for you the server who will benefit from a higher bill in the end. If you think it is too much food then there is a way to say it to the party but at the same time if someone wants one of everything that should be up to them. 

- The manager who was very nice when we walked in did not stop at our table once throughout the time we were there. He walked around the restaurant looking at tables and refilling waters but failed to ask our table how everything was or if there is anything we needed. In addition he stood constantly in plain view of all tables talking with staff and pointing and glaring at certain tables. This felt awkward and rude. In my opinion all of this is restaurant management 101. 

A note for anyone dining at this restaurant with a FOOD ALLERGY. Be careful and explicit when you order because it seems the waitstaff are not knowledgable or worried about allergies. Any time I have dined at a steakhouse I have had no problem with staff accommodating my dairy allergy. Whether it is by sharing items with me that are not made with dairy, talking to the chef or manager about what could be made to accommodate me or as I have had at many establishments the manager or chef come speak with me directly to come up with a fabulous meal that I could enjoy. None of that happened here. I had to have a plain steak and a salad while everyone at the table enjoyed the food (that looked and smelled wonderful). And the kicker was that when I physically went to find and check with our server about my order to double check that my food would not contain dairy (because I felt like he rushed me at the table) he said to ""just don't eat the mushroom that would be placed on my plate as it will contain dairy"". Furious at this point I explained to him that my plate should not have ANYTHING dairy on it!!! The cherry on top was at the end of the meal he had the balls to make a comment which I interpreted as passive aggressive that we should be sure to come back to visit again and make sure to see him so he can accommodate my allergy. 

Overall the food was good but the service left much to be desired. In the future I will likely choose to visit one of the many of the other fine dining establishments in the area.",2,1,1

This place is carnivore heaven. With an in-house butcher shop supplying the restaurant, you can get pretty much any cut of meat you want.

I appreciate that Echo & Rig proudly displays what farm their meat comes from. This is huge, I wish all restaurants had this level of transparency.

Echo seems to source meat from smaller organic or all natural farms, something I am very happy to see and happy to pay a premium for.

On my first visit here I opted to share a massive 48oz porterhouse with my friend. When it came out pre-sliced I was worried, but all was good when I took a bite. It was properly rested before cutting, and so much easier to eat that way. I'm now a fan of this style.

The steak was perfectly cooked, well seasoned, and good enough that it has brought me back to Echo & Rig many times.

This is now the place I crave after too many visits to Veggie House or when I need a little more (ok, a lot more) protein in my diet. 

All the main dishes I have tried here have been excellent, I have not been disappointed with a single one. Notable highlights include the Lamb Porterhouse Chops, Summertime Steak Salad, Horseradish Crusted Butterfish, and of course all the steaks. You can't go wrong with any piece of meat here, but the Spencer Steak takes the crown - it's lean but very tender and always cooks to an even, perfect medium rare.

One minor complaint, the potato chips and stuffed mushroom that come with the steaks seem more like lunch items. These sides are not fit for dinner steaks and certainly don't add anything to the amazing steaks they are served with. I would prefer a choice of vegetable, roast or mashed potatoes, or even fries instead of the dry underwhelming chips.

Some of my favorite sides are the Portobello Fries & Herb Aioli, Grilled Octopus, Charcuterie Platter, Fried Spinach Salad (perfect to share, ask for it to be split in half), and roast potatoes.

The no corkage policy is awesome, I hope it is here to stay.",5,0,1

You know the space is more than a little awkward (looks like it should be a furniture store of clothing boutique).  But it's good, actually really good.  Service?  Good.  Food?  Good.  Management?  Treated us like kings even though we showed up with no rez in our walking clothes and a stroller with baby in it.  Servers were incredibly patient as my wife tortured herself with the overwhelming number of small plate options.  And the ones she chose were pretty good.  And the steak (the Spencer Steak) was excellent.  Best $25 steak I can remember.  

This is what we hoped Ogden's would be.  A place worth visiting within walking distance of our house.  I think I'd like this place even if it wasn't within strolling distance, but maybe an extra star for that.  But it's not like it's an easy walk, so don't discount my review.  We gotta head up Oakey and then once we get to Cimaron we can cut through the 'hood.  When we get to Durango it's a bit of risky, more like 'mad', dash across Durango.  Once you've safely navigated (jay walked) to the other side of 6 lanes of stupid, probably drunken, traffic (think frogger with a stroller), you can cut behind the Guitar Center to avoid the inevitability of being flattened by some Kohl's shopping ingrate.  Assuming you make it through that long, dark alley you can take a right to approach Sahara and cross at what should be a protected cross-walk to the Boca Park shopping center, only this is Vegas so you can press the button for the signal (which by design is a really fancy one that in addition to a walk sign and in case you're blind should at some point announce ""WALK SIGN TO CROSS SAHARA""), which in the last year has never given us a walk sign no matter how many cycles you wait through, but it doesn't really matter anyway because this is Vegas and signs don't matter because it's a 24-hour town and at any time of the day you've got people getting off their shifts and hitting happy hour and driving home drunk and on ambien or loratab, so with your head on a swivel, charge into traffic and cross when you see the left turn arrow and as you get to the other side you will notice a melting pot fondue restaurant, so if you're light on ambien, loratabs or blow you could probably score there as long as the employees haven't gotten too twisted - not on fondue - on that given evening and used up their whole supply.  So now you're basically in the back of Boca Park.  That should be a relief and, if you hit the melting pot fondue restaurant, maybe you're a little ""emboldened"" at this stage of the walk.  It's probably good to be emboldened because now you've got another half-mile, unlighted stretch behind the office max and down a construction road with no sidewalk.  Keep your head on a swivel because occasionally someone leaving cheesecake factory restaurant will come roaring up behind you and because there is no sidewalk you may have to employ some evasive maneuvers to make it to alta where you can ride the sidewalk and enjoy a protected cross-walk into Tivoli Village.  My family enjoys this walk frequently.",0,0,0

The butcher (Aaron) was EXTREMELY helpful.  He suggested a nice mix of charcuterie based on our adventurousness as well as provided some great tips on how to cook the steak.  With our skirt steak, he suggested that the best way to get an even temperature is to flip the steak every minute (vs flipping it once).  

He also suggested wines and cheeses that would go well with the charcuterie.  Even wrote it all down on butcher paper for us! He really knows his stuff!

I came to Vegas for a mini vacation to hangout with some close friends & family, not really for the nightlife but more for hanging out and good company, so that being said they took me to this fancy restaurant. I've been to 5 star restaurants before with $50 plate menus, so not foreign to the type of environment. Right away we saw several snobbish people, usually ""old money"" material, heads turn as we walked. Just a few groups of snobs, not the whole restaurant, don't get me wrong. Fine establishment but we could sense the eyes glaring into the back of our heads with each step we took. It was ok for me though, always use to classism. We laughed about it. Same story different neighborhood.

Ambiance: A little noisy but not bad at all. Very nice and fancy. They had the see through glass where you could see what the butchers were upto. The balcony over looked the mall and vallet service. Nice touch.

Service. ***BEWARE***Sneaky. Well just our waiter, JASON, and his choice of vocab for the night ""SEXY."" He kept persuading us to buy the more expensive steak cuts, which were ""SEXY"" and more off of the menu the whole night. Just like a kiosk salesman who oversells a product. Our table found it very annoying. We asked the price per pound for the suggested meat and we asked for the lesser of the two. On the bill he gave us the more expensive cut, and we ordered two of those! It being $210 on the bill, basically half the bill. Wtf. It was good but he changed our order up, ordering the biggest of the two tomahawks. 

Before the steaks came out, he was like ""I got you guys my favorite salad as you wait,"" we thought, oh what a good guy until we saw that he added it on the bill as well! We didn't order that sh*t! We didn't even know what it was to even order it! Ha.

The service was split between a team. Jason and about 3 other people. The 3 others we saw the most and did all the work. When it came to paying our check we saw Jason again and he started to compliment one of our friends, shaking his hand, telling him ""I see you a lot here and I got you guys next time...blah...blah...blah"". This was actually our friends 2nd time here. So we paid the check, he thought we were gonna pay him a fat tip for the $350+ menu we racked up due to his ""SEXY"" waiter skills, NOPE! 

Out of all the places I've been to this was the most unprofessional I've seen due to him alone. He stood there hovering over us to see what we would tip him and then after signing and tipping he took our bills with the quickness. I remembered I was in mid sentence and then *SNATCH* the bill was in his hands. He crumbled the originals for the customers to keep then rudely said ""I'm missing one."" We told him we split it 3 ways and he left angry. Like he really deserved a fat tip. As we walked by him he didn't say good bye or anything but had the nerve to talk sh*t behind our backs to his coworker. Very ""SEXY"" of him. So one of my friends said, make sure he's on your YELP review. Got em!

Food: Ok now let me talk about the food. Haha. Very delicious. Very fancy\/gourmet. Presentation was excellent. We ordered Calamari, Crabcakes (which Jason hinted to us the whole time), Portabella French fries w\/ aioli sauce, and bone marrow. Everything came out delicious. 

Our tomahawk steaks came out plate sized humongous. Ordered it in medium, it came sliced and detached from bone, which we devoured the meat on their too. We got 5 different dipping sauces which were unique and enjoyable. The meat was juicy and very pleasing. After a few bites we found it overwhelming and ended up taking the rest home. 

I'm Definitely coming back here every year, maybe check up on my favorite waiter. Ha. Service is one of the MOST biggest factors when it comes to trying out new places. It's all about the experience you share with good company. 

You only get one chance to make a good first impression! #SEXY

But, considering it's only 5 minutes from my house it really should be in the rotation more often.  Anyway, went here recently to meet a friend for Friday afternoon drunch (drinks and lunch, so much better than calling it brunch), sat on the balcony patio enjoying the soft fall air and a view of downtown Vegas in the background, and it all came back to me.  The little skip of my heart when I take that first bite of the fried spinach salad, with it's lime vinaigrette dressing and crunchy veggies.  The perfection of the Portabello fries, how they aren't greasy or soggy, not even a bit, matched with the freshness and zip of the goddess dressing they're served with.  And then there's the butcher's sausage dish.  Smokey and seasoned to perfection, with a mushroom ragu that tasted like it was made to order and not sitting in a pot all day waiting to be served.

Unfortunately the service beyond getting sat was the main issue throughout the meal.  The server would leave the table for extended periods of time and we had to flag him down  for beverage orders.  Were told they ran out of Bread... so no bread service.  Clearing for each course took a long time.  

The entree arrived and they forgot our cheddar mashed potatoes!  Then told by the waiter it was the food runners fault for not communicating to us they were out of that as well..?

Up a lot of stairs to the dining room. I personally hate restaurants with two floors because the last thing I want to do when I am fat, full and happy after eating is go down a bunch of stairs. I go to the gym for cardio not to restaurants. Design flaw! 
Our server was Nan who was fine. It's early for me, I am grumpy, I am mad at the stairs. I am sure it's part of her job to ask if we have been there before but does everyone who says no get a history lesson on the chef\/owner\/locations? It was a dissertation and guess what? I don't really care, if I am interested in the background I'll ask, don't have the server waste my time and theirs with a story just short of...he started off as a young boy...  Then we get to the menu...about six brunch entrees were described to us. Why give me a menu if it's going to be navigated for me? I seriously have never been to any restaurant where there server had to recite as much as Nan did before my order was even taken. 

My drink was terrible. I tried to like it.  I got the black and blue mojito.  I described it as blackberry minty toothpaste with alcohol.  Nan took it off the bill. My water was kept full.  The service was good.  The food was good. My companions were happy with their entrees and I got the blueberry buttermilk pancakes with a side order of potato pancakes. The blueberry pancakes have lemon zest in them and as was described by Nan and the menu it came with blueberry syrup for added sweetness. The pancakes were delicious. However, as luck would have it...THE CHEF HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR!!  I nearly died laughing at the syrup.  Let it be known I come from NY where we have real maple syrup so I can smell Aunt Jemima\/Mrs. Butterworth a mile away. Seriously. The second the ""blueberry syrup"" was in front of me I knew what it was. HEY, CHEF YOU CANNOT PUT BLUEBERRIES IN AUNT JEMIMA SYRUP AND CALL IT BLUEBERRY SYRUP! It doesn't work like that!!  Otherwise the food was a few notches above satisfactory.  It was reasonably priced. 

The downfall of this place is in the details. Paper table coverings (I get it butcher paper...steakhouse but it just doesn't exude the classy atmosphere this place is trying to project.) The cardboard check presenters with paper clips just seems trashy not hipster, cool, modern elegant vibe attempting to be put forth.  The long winded lectures we have to listen to. It's all unnecessary as well as the stairs.  A better location would be more enticing for me to want to visit again. 


Dear Jenny G. This is just a review of a restaurant, I had no idea I would  personally hurt someone's feelings (yours) so badly by posting an honest and somewhat humorous review that you'd need to leave me a ""compliment"". Do you work there? Who are you?? P.S. Sorry not sorry, now stop harassing me and go do something more useful with your time.

****The owner called me directly to discuss my experience.  I am impressed that an owner would take the time to listen to a more in depth description of my experience.  Unfortunately, he felt I didn't enjoy the food from his message to me. I want to make clear the food was very good! There is lack of description on the menu itself, if not some details misleading (For example the syrup). FYI I do have a culinary arts degree for anyone who was wondering. We were happy with our food.  Some aspects of the service needed to be tweaked a little, those were my issues.****",0,0,1

    They don't take reservations unless you're a very large group, yet we didn't have to wait either time although the restaurant was crowded. We sat on the patio both times and caught the sunset the second time. Beautiful view. 
  They make excellent cocktails and also have reasonably priced bottled wine. I've also heard they do not charge a corking fee if you'd like to bring in your own bottle.
    The Tapas\/Appetizers I've tried were all quite special. I suggest: The Cauliflower, Chili de Arbol, Crispy Shallots & Onions, The Brussels Sprouts, Pistachio & Fresh Lemon, The Pork Belly, White Grits, Bitter Greens & Apple Cider Sauce, The Garlic Shrimp and The Bone Marrow Carne Asada so far...
    Don't get too full because you've still got a main course to order. I love how the staff brings out the different cuts from the butcher shop in addition to the menu for you to choose from. The manager even gave us his card to call and ""reserve"" our cut for next time. We've done a Porterhouse, Ribeye, and Strip family style to try everything. All of the steaks were fantastic and I love how they slice them for you. The Ribeye so far is my favorite, it was really something special!

Neat butcher shop on the bottom floor (wished I lived closer to pick up meat from them on a regular basis) & restaurant on the 2nd floor. The atmosphere is upscale but casual and friendly. We sat on the patio & immediately was welcomed to the restaurant by one of the managers (I assume since he was dressed to the nines in a pressed suit), Kevin, who was cheeky, friendly and had made his presence known that if we needed anything, we can request him. He also wished my husband a happy birthday as I made a notation on the reservation about the birthday. Then our server, Celine came promptly, welcomed us, explained the menu and then said she would bring by the meat tray (for the bigger cuts that could be shared) to show us. She was personable and friendly. Throughout the night, service was above par. Our drinks (soda, iced tea, water) were immediately replaced\/refilled even though our glass were only half filled. Bread service came quickly & seconds were brought immediately.

FOOD
- We ordered the fried calamari to start. It was, by far, one of the best fried calamaris we have ever had! The calamari was so tender (not rubbery) and the breading was lightly fried and not oily. We knew that we were in for some excellent food!
- Husband ordered the Spencer steak (which is less fatty than the Rib Eye Cap), medium and it was cooked to perfection (outside charred and the meat was melt-in-your-mouth perfect); bernaise sauce was the perfect compliment. The Mushroom Rockefellar (that came as a side on all steak plates) was my husband's favorite (I'm not a mushroom fan so I didn't see what the big deal was). He didn't really care for the garlic chips (he's not a big fan of chips) but they were crispy and not oily.
- We ordered a side of the cauliflower and this was the BEST side dish I have ever tasted! The cauliflower was crunchy on the outside, slightly sweet with bits of crispy shallots\/onions and sliced chile de arbol, which added a little spicy kick at the tail end. 
- My daughter ordered the grilled cheese (with short ribs) and mac n' cheese. Grilled cheese was meh (nothing to write home about- I've had better) but the Mac n' Cheese was, again, one the best I have ever tasted! So creamy and no stringy cheese in the mix. I could've had that alone with the cauliflower and I would've been a happy camper!

Since it was my husband's birthday, Kevin offered us dessert on the house. He even sang happy birthday to my hubby, which made the hubby blush! LOL! We were so stuffed but requested sorbet & mixed berries to clean our palettes and end on a lighter note.

I have been here three times and I haven't had one bad experience. I work at a hotel near by and this is definitely my favorite place to recommend when guests ask for a dinner recommendations. I've had not one bad review of the restaurant.

The food is consistently delicious every time I have gone here. So just as a little about Echo & Rig, they actually butcher their own meats. They have special cuts for sale in their little shop on the first floor. They also have a bar on the first floor where you can also order from the full menu. Upstairs, they have indoor and patio seating. It's nicer outside during the summer nights. 

Every cut of steak is delicious and well prepared, it is really up to your preference which cut you like. Some cuts are more thick, some thinner, some more fatty, some more lean, its up to you what you like. I prefer mines cooked medium rare, and they cook it just right, every time! I can't help but get the charred onion sauce for my steak. It's just so good! My favorite sides include the portabella fries, bacon, and the carne asada bone marrow.

We had a fantastic meal and I would definitely go again (for the veggies out there, the hubs and I ordered the asparagus, the goat cheese sammy - it was massive, and the mac n cheese - it was ALL incredible!).

My favorites were the calamari and the fried cauliflower. Omg I never thought I would die over cauliflower but it is just so addicting. It has a great crunch with a nice little kick to it. So freaking good. The Calamari was cooked very well and not at all chewy and it had a great spice to it. 

The MAC and cheese was also delicious. It wasn't too cheesy and they used the perfect macaroni size.  

We also got the grass fed filet mignon. I loved how they explain how their meats are grass fed, no preservatives, no steroids, all natural meats! It was cooked to absolute perfection and was cut for us when it came out. It came out with a awesome sauce.

Don't be shy trying any of the tapas, the flavors are endless. For sure try the cauliflower and carrots. You'll want seconds. .maybe thirds.  The avocado toast is great and comes with sheshito peppers...awesome combo.  Lamb cigars are also good.
Been here multiple times, on different days.  Sundays is pretty happening. Lots more people and a little more noise, but don't let that deter you.  
They won't be understaffed, and you'll get taken care of.  
For a large menu,  the dessert options are pretty minimal.  If you're not into ice cream or sherbet, skip it and go somewhere else. I love ice cream, and anytime i can get espresso ice cream,  that's a win.  
Their cappuccino sundae is great! So is the cherry sundae.

From the scheduling of the reservation to the greeting of the hostess at the front and the service from the wait staff, I have never experienced a better night out. We have eaten at a stapling amount of steakhouses in California and Echo & Rig by far surpasses not only the quality of the meats, but the customer service as well. 

Our server, Lauran, was very informative and kind. The food runner and wait staff were also super friendly and personable. We were sad to hear it was her last day. 

The atmosphere is amazing and dressy casual attire appropriate. While it isn't on the strip, it is more then worth the journey. 

My husband had a Filet Mignon and I ordered the Spencer steak (both medium rare) and we shared Roasted Broccolini and delicious Mac N Cheese. We were able to try the avocado toast and it was to yummy! There's a kick to the flavor that keeps you coming back for more and the peppers they serve with the toast compliment it very well. Our steaks were cooked perfectly and they literally melted in our mouths.

Small Plates - although Echo & Rig is quite obviously a steakhouse, the menu has an eclectic, yet put-together feel. Steak, salads, pasta dishes, did I say STEAK?, and small plates are found here. Small plates have three price ranges. One could come here and simply eat off the small plates menu, or use the small plates menu to come along as sides with a steak. The variety is good, but not overwhelming. You can tell these items have been selected with the utmost care.

Butcher's Choice Sausage - this sausage changes daily as noted by our incredibly helpful server, Edward. When my friend and I dined it was a chicken sausage, within a pork casing, with a sweet tomato sauce, onions, and jalapenos. This sausage was quite possibly the best sausage I have ever eaten. Cooked perfectly, with a snap to the outside, and a deep flavor without the ""taste"" of your normal run-of-the-mill grocery sausage (that taste is not good). 

Carne Asada Bone Marrow - The sausage blew this small plate away. However, it was still good, presented beautifully, and a decent-sized portion (my friend and I shared). Comes with onions.

Moving on to main courses..

As impressed as I was by the brilliant selection of steaks AND the lesson the server gave us about each of the cuts I wanted to order more small plates, however, I was so mesmerized by the cuts of meat available I decided to have the Hangar Steak Sandwich. This comes with roasted Anaheim chiles, spinach, and preserved lemon chimichurri. I certainly picked a good dish as the steak was cooked to a velvety medium, the bread slightly toasted, and all the flavors melding together, plus a serving of crunchy potato chips.

Lastly, dessert. My friend and I chose a chocolate ice cream bowl that came with candied pecan cookies, cherry gelee, and big, ripe, bourbon-soaked cherries, topped with what I know was a freshly whipped-up whip cream. This little dessert was the perfect end to a perfect meal.

Other features... a decent wine listing with wines that will and won't break your pocket book. Service that was immaculate, friendly, yet not too hoity-toity. Our table was also visited by the manager of the night who was a very nice gentleman.

Overall I will absolutely return to Echo & Rig.",0,1,0

The small plates are great if you want to share or have as a side to your main...you could even dine on them alone - there are many options, and they all sounded wonderful.

I think they give the best value for what you pay for in terms of steaks and meat. And I think all around, everything has been really fantastic including the food, service, and ambiance.

I've been here for dinner and I've loved everything that I've ordered here. I recently came by to check out their brunch, and from what I can tell, they got their brunch game on point.

The first thing I noticed on the menu was the bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary's. Nothing goes better with brunch then a good Bloody Mary. I really like the one that Echo & Rig makes. It's not too spicy, and has a really nice kick to it. I also ordered their short rib hash. The short rib was very tender and flavorful, and the potatoes were perfectly cooked. The hollandaise sauce was magical, and the poached egg on top really sealed the deal for me. Our server was a rockstar, and did a wonderful job.

Came back after hearing everyone talk about their $1.99 ""Happy Hour"".   We were unsuccessful not once, but twice, and the first time they had an excuse about some private function blah blah blah, yet when we called ahead of time there was no mention of this.  Second time we could not call ahead due to a recording being the only answer so decided to show up anyway. 

It was exactly 10 pm and asked the host about the ""Happy Hour"" and she said ""yes of course you may sit anywhere in the bar area"". So we proceeded and then waited 11 minutes for a menu and then when it finally arrived we looked it over only to find no mention of this ""Happy Hour"". 

We asked the waiter for that menu and said ""Oh, let me check because I don't think we are serving that menu tonight"" What??  Yes, please check. 

A second waiter came to ask for our drink order and again I asked and this time I was told ""Oh, we are not serving that menu tonight"".  When I mentioned that this was the second time we were being denied this menu he said he would go check to see what he could do....18 minutes later the first waiter came back to try to take our order again, really?? Again I repeated myself about waiting for an answer and could tell he never asked anyone about it. 

So third time's the charm, and asked the hostess about the menu and said ""Maam we are not serving that menu but you can order anything off the regular full menu""  She sensed my disappointment and before I could say another word I heard once again ""Let me check with our manager"" Oh geez at this point I wanted to walk out but instead decided to be humored yet again with their lack of urgency on a response.   And she did not disappoint.   She quickly said the manager is tied up on a phone call but said that the cook who manages the happy hour menu had an emergency (that no one knew about up to this point) and left early, but said we could have a hot dog...really??? As consolation??? No thank you.  You can offer me the whole menu and you are not short staffed there but can't manage the ""Happy Hour"" menu??? You must think it's my first time out!!!

The mushrooms were savory, but not overpowering, dipped in herb aioli sauce. Even the herb aioli sauce created a myriad of sweet and any that truly brought out the essence of the portobellos. 
We also opted to try the calamari. Deliciously tender, and in no way chewy or tough. Served with red marinara sauce, as well as the herb aioli sauce. Unbelievable!!! I haven't had calamari so tender in years, BRAVO!
Fantastic Steak. We had the Spencer, AMAZING. I had the red wine demi sauce medium rare, while my boyfriend had his medium with the brandied  mushroom sauce. The red wine demi had a light but rich flavor, that played well with the rare portions of my steak. The texture is creamy without being too rich, and it simply melts in your mouth. 
My daughter had the asparagus with a fried egg... sooooo not just asparagus and a fried egg. The asparagus had a lightly smoked flavor topped with the perfect slices of aged cheese. She also ordered penne bolognese. Honestly, this was the closest sauce I have ever had at a restaurant, that tastes as close as my Italian grandmother's sauce (AKA gravy).
Saving room for ice cream was tough, but we did it! Worth every bite the cappuccino and caramel turtle sweet, but not so rich that the ice cream weighs you down.
Our waiter was Jordan and we were instantly impressed with this young man's knowledge and descriptive purpose for each dish. Not once did we have to ask for our drinks to be refilled. Thank you Jordan for treating us with great service and consideration.
Although, my boyfriend and I are well off financially we did not walk in dressed well at all. Echo & Rig is definitely about the food and not the prestige of who walks in their door. They are fair and consistent with how they treat their customers. We came in looking as casual as you can be, which subjectively for us, is

After a minute, we have been guided to 2nd floor where restaurant is located. Our server was Hugo. He was well groomed, and seemed like he knows his own stuff. He was really attentive and amazing. The best part of this place is complimentary corkage fee. Their manager greeted us and insisted whether or not he can open the bottle for us, which was great. We ordered few things.

Steak Tartare - 5 \/ 5. Meat was fresh, it harmonized with lemon scent with toasted baguette.
Fried Calamari - 5 \/ 5. TBH nothing special, but as long as we enjoyed it, I would give 5
Fillet Mignon - 5 \/ 5. Ordered medium rare with blue cheese sauce, it was cooked perfectly, tender. 
Rib eye Cap - 3 \/ 5 Ordered medium rare with mushroom sauce, sauce was amazing, but steak by itself, it was too salty. I asked our server to see if this is supposed to be a bit salty, and been informed that it is supposed to be but maybe cook has put a bit more salt for seasoning than it is supposed to be. 
Comp. Sundae - 5 \/ 5 comp is always great no matter what. Right? lol

Overall, great place, staffs there, they seemed to be happy also. It was great experience, and I will definitely come back. But I will make sure that I won't order Rib eye Cap though.  Ask for the server Hugo, he is just awesome.",0,0,0

There is something I have found at so many restaurants - for all the cooks that know how to prepare steak or chicken well, many don't know how to bring out the best in vegetables.  So, I was very happy to find the best dishes I sampled here were from their small plates selection - cauliflower browned with chili and crispy shallots and the portobello fries.  Both were fantastic.  
The wine list gets a gold star for some very reasonable prices both for bottles and by the glass.
Our server was painfully new and slightly awkward, but his heart was in the right place, so any missteps were forgiven. A missed order was quickly corrected and comped, though I thought that was unnecessary, they were obviously aiming for good customer service, which is more than I have experienced at some of the other restaurants in that immediate area (that includes you Honey&Salt, ahem).
For my main course, I had the rib eye cap at a truly reasonable $22.50.  It was served with garlic chips and a stuffed mushroom.  My steak was good and cooked exactly right.  It came with one complimentary sauce - I chose chimichurri.  I had mixed feelings about part of this: I tried both the chimichurri and the horseradish sauce and they were equally bland.  I also didn't really enjoy the chips or mushroom much, but considering that most steak places no longer give you anything with  your steak - any sides are usually $7 or more, I thought it was nice to have something with it.
I finished off with a turtle sundae and left happy.  All that food for $50 per person (before tip) = happy diner.",0,0,0

I had the pleasure of being treated this past Sunday to brunch from my best friends to celebrate my birthday. After doing a bit of research on this place prior to arriving I decided to book a reservation. This is a MUST especially on the weekend and even more so on a Sunday. The popularity on the Sunday brunch is crazy busy. They connect with opentable so if you prefer to reserve on there you can and or through the restaurant website\/call in directly.

Upon arriving my party was greeted immediately by the two lovely hostess who stand up front. They confirmed our reservation and even wished me a Happy Birthday! So thoughtful. From there we were escorted up the stairs to nirvana. No I'm kidding but it sure felt like it. You can't help but notice this most beautiful chandelier as you are making your way up. Impressed already from the décor and ambiance of the whole place I was sold and haven't even sat down to eat. Usually places like this are super elegant but the service and food doesn't match. Usually is an operative word in this case because the exact opposite was provided. Not only was the food great but the service was impeccable! One of the manager's Beth came over not even after 5 minutes into us being seated to personally come over and introduce herself and again wish me a happy birthday! So thoughtful I was blown away. Our waiter was awesome to he made some excellent suggestions for starters and walked us through how the bottomless mimosas worked here. And hey... if you are like me and can't say no to a great mimosa do yourself a favor and indulge into this $16 never ending champagne and orange juice river! 

Starters: Avocado Toast & Maryland Blue Crab Cake

Food: Two orders of Short Rib Beef Hash & Eggs Benedict

Everything tasted great! We all were so quiet because that could only mean one thing? Yeah we lobed our food lol. The Short Rib hash was prepared so good and I literally finished my whole bowl. I always have leftovers and today my stomach said NOPE be a pig so I did :-) There wasn't one dish that was placed on the table that wasn't good! I ended my brunch with the birthday ice cream that they provided and again just delicious!!!

Cool looking place with bar, lounge and butcher area downstairs, decent sized restaurant upstairs.

Forgot to bring a bottle of wine to take advantage of the ""no corkage"" policy - no biggie since only three of us drink and I personally was in a beer mood ( later in the meal, when the manager came by to ask if we enjoyed our meal, I couldn't resist, I asked if there's a no corkage policy, why not extend it to beer - as in, can I bring in the ""brown bag.""  Sadly, manager said ""no"" and her eyes said, "" HELL NO""

The food ?  overall, a hit.  Ordered:

starters\/sides - 

$5.10 each : Mashed potatoes w\/ white cheddar; cauliflower with crispy onions; 

$7.40 each:  Meatballs; Mac and cheese; portobello fries; asparagus and fried egg

$9.20 each: grilled octopus and gigante beans; fried calamari

The starter\/side hits ?  the cauliflower, meatballs and Portobello fries.  

The misses ? mac n cheese ( very rich sauce but lacked cheesiness and served cold )  and the grilled octopus ( beans , though tasty, overwhelmed the octopus )

Mains-

24 ounce Rib eye, medium ($58).  Very good flavor, properly seasoned about 1""-1 1\/4"" thick, but I feel the steak was closer to medium rare\/rare than medium.  Not an issue for us.

Grilled cheese $11.90) - short rib with white cheddar and gruyere - perfect !

Tagliatelle Bolognese ( $12.80) - al dente, delicious sauce but a little light on meat.

black spaghetti ($12.80) - includes shrimp and scallops with a little bit of calamari - great flavor, a little salty but I like it that way.

desserts ($6):

Caramel turtle - I was a little disappointed - guess i'm an old school guy because I was hoping for a prominent caramel sauce - there was a sauce but seemed like an afterthought to the brittle

berry shortcake - loved the berries and syrup ;  the biscuit a little too hard - does it freeze up a little due to the ice cream ??

service was excellent - the food definitely comes out timely\/fast.

We like the concept especially the variety in the menu.

But I will get into the food in a moment. The thing that made tonight so special was the service. Upon beong seated we were greeted by the manager who knew the name of our party right off the bat. He was very gracious came back to check up on us, but in that magical ratio where it isn't so much as to be annoying but just enough to know that these people truly care about you and your experience. 

The waiter was amazing. We described a wine and he knew it immediately by name! We were never in want for anything throughout the entire meal. In fact I feel wonderfully spoiled. The restaurant was full. Yet there was plenty of room for everyone, it was quiet enough for table conversation and the waiter was amazingly attentive. I had to scan the restaurant a couple times to verify that yes, every table was occupied. 
 
And now to the food. In a word: oubf#$\/v£*^#fdf!!! But as I'm sure that doesn't make sense, please allow me to expound upon this. As mentioned above, the Spencer was amazing. 

The best steak I've had in Vegas, not just in organic grass-fed goodness but also in knock-your-socks-off flavor. I split this with my friend Big John and we also had the tuscan kale, the bone marrow carne asada, and the specialty sausage made by the in-house butcher. Plus three glasses of wine and a magical cocktail called the Dionysis (ketel 1, elderflower liquer, pomegranate seeds, unicorn tears, the hopes and dreans of small children).

My beau made dinner reservations to dine here for 2014 New Year's Eve. The entire reservation process was effortless. However, their phone line can get busy and you may reach an answering machine - if this happens, I would suggest trying again a little bit later. The restaurant\/ butcher shop is Chef owned and proudly advertises farm to table style dining. Not to mention, it's the same owner of the wildly popular Bottega Louie in Los Angeles. Talk about a tasty resume.

When we arrived, even with reservations, we encountered a minor wait. They have a cold oyster bar right in the front area and they treated us to a taste of the freshest and sweetest oysters with mignonette and also offered us some champagne - a supremely classy touch, especially on a night like NYE. They were extremely gracious and offered us many apologies for our wait.

We were then escorted upstairs into the main dining room - it was a packed house! The crowd was a good looking bunch. The dining area had an elegant atmosphere with clean, minimal decor. The less art on the walls makes for more more art on our plates. Smart.

We were offered flat or sparking water and also some bread and butter. The bread was room temperature and didn't have any special touch. I wasn't too upset since I wanted to save room for a great big meal ahead.

Let's get to the good stuff: the food! 
Pork belly and white grits $9.80 - I hope you're taking notes on this one. Whatever you do, add this to your list of items to try! The pork belly was cooked with insane expertise, super buttery, and the grits were ultra sultry. My date took one bite and said ""now this is what grits is supposed to taste like."" I nodded fervently in agreement. The creaminess and flavor of the dish was phenomenal. I'm rating this as one of the best dishes I've tasted in 2014! That's an accomplishment. Flavor rating: 5\/5

Fried Spinach Salad with red onion, cauliflower broccoli & chili-lime vinaigrette $9.30 - Super delicious! I loved the charred flavor and crispy fried texture of the spinach. The dressing was sweet and slightly tangy and it really enhanced the flavor of the earthy spinach. Flavor rating: 5\/5

Roasted garlic mash $5.90 - This dish didn't do it for us.  I mean as simple of a dish as mashed potatoes, how do you mess it up? It was super dense and dry, not to mention... where's the roasted garlic? It was super faint and I didn't taste it. Flavor rating: 2\/5

Cauliflower, chili de arbol, crispy caramelized and sweet shallots & onions $5.90 - YES! Yes! yes! so much yes!!! Luckily I left dry-town since this dish took my tastebuds on a magical ride into flavor city! The roasted cauliflower was cooked well plus I was not expecting so many pops of delicious flavor from the caramelized shallots, every bite was screaming with excitement, especially when you get a little bite of the chile de arbol. Wow! Those little guys pack some explosive heat and amazing flavor. I was shocked by the heat level on those pretty little chilies. I enjoyed the overall thought of this dish. Who would have thought cauliflower was that exciting? Kept me wanting more. Flavor rating 5\/5

Wild mushroom soup with a touch of cream $5.90 - I wasn't a fan and it's unfortunate since I am a wild mushroom soup lover. It was boring and watery. A thicker consistency and an extra boost in flavor would have been nice. Flavor rating 2\/5

Ribeye cap $29.10 - Served with a mushroom Rockefeller (greasy, but not bad) and house potato chips (greasy and boring) You also have a selection of sauces you can chose to pair with your steak - we couldn't decide between bleu cheese or bearnaise sauce, so our generous server brought us both! We appreciated that gesture. The steak was cooked medium rare as we requested, but somehow we were both not blown away by the seasoning and flavor of the steak. It's sad for me to have to say this, but I've had better steak. I really wanted to love the concept of them being a butcher shop restaurant, yet I just was not a fan of my steak; It was lacking juiciness and flavor. Even the sauces were tried were rather weak. We both preferred the beanaise over the blue cheese but it's not something I would ever order again. Flavor rating: 3\/5

I'm not going to lie - I thought it was troubling that we weren't blown away by the steak, but it wasn't terrible. To me, it was average; to someone else, they may be really blown away. I mean, c'mon, my taste buds have a mind of their own sometimes. 

Overall, the pro's outweighed the con's during our dining experience. I feel that the disappointments with our dishes boil down to our own personal preferences. We enjoyed our server and the maître'd was also a charming young fellow that really took his time to mix it up literally and figuratively at our table! I just feel so bad that they had to work New Year's Eve all throughout the countdown as well.

My respect goes to them for their hard work and great service! Happy New Year!",8,5,4

---  Tri-tip Steak.  The star of the evening (wish I had ordered it).  Perfectly cooked with just the right sear on the outside.  The accompanying peppercorn sauce was just fabulous.
---  Flat Iron Steak:  This was also quite good, although not nearly as tasty as the tri-tip.  Be careful ordering anything less than medium if you don't like a bloody steak.  This was undercooked compared to a normal medium-rare, but I didn't mind.
---  Trenne pasta:  We had no idea what ""trenne"" was, so we Googled it.  It's kind of like penne, but it's crunchy.  Weird.  Came with pieces of steak and kale, it was very good.  Be on the lookout for trenne!

The pricing here is very reasonable given the location and atmosphere.

The service was impeccable.

One nit to pick:  what's with the guys standing with their arms crossed, looking at the customers?  Are they bouncers or what?  Some muscle-bound fellow in an extremely ill-fitting suit was standing in the corner, glowering in our general direction.

I headed to the restroom and sure enough, another primate in a bad suit was standing in the corner.  NOTE:  I was wearing jeans, just sayin'

My coworker and I both frequent Las Vegas a lot and my boyfriend actually works as a chef on the strip. He's quite particular when we go out to eat so I was very careful to do my research. Echo & Rig had great reviews so I decided to give it a try. 

When I called to make the reservation, the person who answered the phone was very pleasant and took note that we were coming for a special occasion.

Me being the girl that I am realized we would be a little late for our reservation, so I called to move it back a half hour. Again, another pleasant person answered the phone and made the change, no problem.

As everyone else stated, it was located in a very nice shopping center about 15 minutes from downtown LV.

Our waiter, Nicholas, was finishing up with another guest so the manager, Xavier, came to take our drinks. Nicholas did come, apologized for the wait and took our order, explaining some of the items on the menu. 

Everything we ordered was really good. He had a 12oz rib eye, and I ordered the Jumping Beef, filet mignon tips in an amazing sauce with roasted tomatoes,  onions. Anytime he is trying to figure out how they prepared a dish, they have done a great job. 

We also ordered the mashed potatoes which, I believe, had 3 cheeses, the mac and cheese and the mussels, which Nicholas recommended we have for an appetizer. The boyfriend LOVES mussels and liked the sauce these were prepared in. The crispy shoe strings fries on top were a nice addition.

Service was great. I remember I dropped a knife and an attendant appeared out of no where with a new knife.

They brought out a wonderful dessert with ice cream, berries and a pound cake for his birthday. The ice cream was very good. 

He wanted to give his compliments to the chef, but we were told he was already gone for the evening, but we did speak to Xavier again and let him know we would definitely be back.",2,0,3

First, I must say, I only gave this 5 stars because that's the most you can give. If I was able to give 10 stars out of 5, I would.

I found this restaurant from other reviews on Yelp. My friends and I were looking for a good steakhouse without spending an arm and a leg. They were hesitant at first due to the location (it's a good 20 min off the strip; $50 cab ride). I convinced them you could go to any steakhouse on the strip and of course it's going to be great, why not try somewhere different. 

When you arrive you pull up to the most expensive cars you'll ever see in your life in person. The plaza this restaurant in is gorgeous. When you walk in you're greatest and welcomed by the hostess, who checked to see if our table was ready. To the right is the Butcher shop, which was closing. We then made our way upstairs to our table. 

The restaurant was mostly empty; only two other tables had people. Our waitress, Ally I think, was AMAZING! Super attentive and quickly broke down the way they do things there. They recommend you go ""family style"" and order everything you'd like separately. They brought out a platter of steaks. There was a 64oz Tomahawk, then it progressed smaller. They recommend you order one and split it amongst your table. My friend and I ordered the 32oz off the platter and split it. 

The food was beyond words. Everything was amazing, and the price was surprisingly not as bad as you'd expect for a place like this. If you're looking for a phenomenal steakhouse and awesome experience, GO HERE!!!",2,1,1

You'd pay about the same at an Outback or Longhorn, but the quality of food is markedly better. Interestingly, a platter is presented before ordering showing different cuts and sizes of meat. One different thing I've never really seen at a steakhouse before, they encourage everyone to order something different, then place it all in the middle of the table for folks to sample, but fear not, you can still order things 'a la carte', where you do have your own personal appetizer & main meal as per usual.

The actual restaurant has a very interesting setup; a full bar on the 1st floor, and more traditional white tablecloth dining on the 2nd floor, with an option for outside tables if you like. It was a nice, mixed atmosphere, very relaxed and inviting.

Our waiter was very attentive, and very friendly. It was apparent that he enjoyed his job! This is something I love to see, because it shows they care about customers than they do about the bottom line.

THEN we met our waiter, who was extremely knowledgeable and had a lot of good recommendations for us. He was very attentive. 

A few outstanding points...

The quality of food for the price is outstanding. My boyfriend and I have dined at some very expensive places in California and on the Strip, and Echo & Rig's quality rivals them for a third of the price. I got the filet, my boyfriend got the tri tip, and both were exceptional. We started with the brie, which is essentially brie in a bread bowl - I am more of a fan of the traditional baked brie (a la Mon Ami Gabi) but it was still delicious and the fruit paired with it was very tasty. We ordered roasted carrots as our side - again, delicious.

We ordered Arnold Palmers to drink and the assistant server (not the main server, I'm sad I missed both of their names) made sure to keep them full. One time the main server brought me a lemonade instead of an Arnold Palmer - I didn't really care so I didn't say anything, but not only did the assistant NOTICE that I had the wrong drink, he brought me the correct one and cleared the lemonade. This was after the room started to fill up as people came in for dinner. VERY impressive!

We ultimately decided on the 43oz Tomahawk steak because I had read reviews about how it was a must-try. To go with that, we ordered small dishes only: Butternut Squash, Pepitas, Strachatella & Honey ($6.40), Lamb Cigars & Tzatziki Sauce ($8.60), Pork Belly & Spicy Slaw ($9.80), Portobello Fries & Herb Aioli ($9.80), Grilled Thick-Cut Bacon & Barbecue Sauce ($8.60), and Mac & Cheese ($8.60).

Our server recommended we get the Tomahawk steak medium even though we as a family usually eat our steak medium rare. We trusted him on that one and we're glad we did! That was one of the best steaks I've had in my life. The outside was crispy and the inside was juicy and it had the perfect doneness for our taste. I even picked up the bone and started eating around it, it was that good. The small dishes were all good as well. Our favorite was definitely the Portobello Fries, followed by the Butter Squash and Mac & Cheese. The Lamb Cigars, Pork Belly Slaw, and Thick-Cut Bacon we probably could've skipped.

Service was excellent. Like I said, our server recommended that we get the medium even though we told him we usually like medium rare, but he was right on the money. They cleaned our table and set it up between the small plates and the steak. They also brought us all seven steak sauces so we didn't have to choose! I loved that. And they also came by to refill our drinks frequently and to check and see how we were doing. Between bites of food, I think we might have uttered out a ""great, thank you.""

Super pleasant experience from even a month in advance to getting the check. I would love to bring my family back here next time we're all together.",4,0,1

They have a butcher shop in house, in which you may purchase cuts of meat to take home as well. 

There isn't a single item on their menu that doesn't sound amazeballs.  But I must say I really enjoyed their portobello fries with the best aioli dipping sauce, which was so good that I couldn't resist swabbing the dish with my finger.

Nicholas was full of wonderful personality and immediately turned around our initial negative experience. He works seamlessly with the rest of his team members and introduced us to Derek The manager. I ordered a whiskey sour and my wife had some type of champagne. We started off with the bone marrow, beef tartare, watermelon salad and those three dishes were top notch. My wife and I commented that the bone marrow dish specifically was probably a top three dish of our entire life. We go out to eat frequently and have no problem dropping a few hundred dollars on a good dinner. For our entrées my wife had the ribeye and And I had the lamb chops. We shared a cauliflower side dish as well. Our biggest surprise came when the bill came. Out the door including taxes and tip was under $130. We were so impressed with the service, the friendly attitudes, and the excellent food that we recommended the restaurant to a group of friends who were staying on the strip and they took advantage of the recommendation and the six of them went to the restaurant tonight.

One of my favorite places in Vegas period. Classy without being pretentious, beautiful without being intimidating, gourmet without being overpriced.

Restaurant is located in Tivoli Village, which has nice shops and is great for walking around.

Food: It is quality you can taste. The sides we had were the mashed potatoes and pork belly. I could have just eaten that pork belly all night long! Then came our steaks. I have not had a more tender well cooked piece of meat since Alberta Beef.  You could tell the butcher knew what he was doing, and the chef did as well.

The service was by far the best service we've had at any restaurant. Period. The wait staff was always there, whether to refill the water, or take plates away or simply to ask how everything was going. We were very impressed with everyone knowing our names and welcoming us to the restaurant. It was definitely a nice touch. The restaurant itself is beautiful - the ambiance is perfect for a nice night out. 

Ok, so now on to the bad. First, and foremost, the beef is NOT PRIME grade. That's extremely disappointing, especially when you consider the fact that the cuts are sold at prime market prices. Our steaks (bone in ribeye) had a tremendous amount of fat on them and quite frankly, the steaks were completely raw in some areas. I also didn't like how they cut the steak for us before bringing it to the table.  I question whether they allowed the steak to rest for several minutes before serving, because the meat was very hot when it arrived. Steak like this needs to rest before it's cut, otherwise it takes away from the flavor because the juices are not given enough time to return to the meat. They also left huge chunks of fat on the plate. Not sure what that was about. The dessert was also very lack luster. I had the apple pie sundae and the apples were completely raw, there was no sauce and the cookies were hard.  Not impressed.",1,0,0

Tip: make reservations, always. 

My beef--we came here Saturday night for a lovely dinner with friends.
It was SO HOT. Seriously. I'm always cold. I'm running a heater on my legs as we speak, and the temp in my building at work is set at 74 degrees. It's cold to me. And it's 104 outside. That's how ridiculous I am.
But when we came here Saturday, I think their air broke or something. It was nicer on the patio with their misters. 
We asked the waiter about it a few times, and he just kept telling us it was because they wouldn't shut the door. Honestly, we were here so long that I went to the bathroom 3 times and each time, a breeze would come in from the outside patio. It had to be over 80 degrees in there. Maybe even over 85. Even our wine was really warm. It made it not so pleasant to drink. 

Our waiter was good. He was really slow to come around and take our orders. But once we placed the order, he was very attentive. We got there at 7:30 and we didn't leave until after 10pm. There was only 4 of us. I think he was very overwhellemed at first, and they seemed short staffed. He did bring us some icecream because he knew we were really hot, and fanning ourselves most of the night. It was nice of him...and because I'm sure he didn't want us to complain any further. ;)

The food was amazing, as always though. I had the Bavette cut, which was insaney better than I was expecting. Crazy tender and so flavorful. I LOVE a really well prepared and cooked steak. 

I really do love this place, and I highly recommend when it's not crazy hot in there. But it was pretty shitty that we spent a good amount of money on being miserably hot, and drinking hot wine with our dinner.",23,19,12

Three of the four dishes we had were great - the baked brie in sourdough, the lamb cigars, and the $1.99 steak and egg. The $1.99 hot dog was okay, nothing special. Why the two-star review then? The service.

I arrived first and sat in the bar area, knowing that happy hour started at 3pm. My friend came not long afterward, and the bartender gave us menus and glasses of water and introduced himself. We caught up for a few minutes and perused the menu. Around 2:45, my friend called out ""Hey!"" to get the bartender's attention because he was down at the other end and hadn't come back over to check on us. We asked about the happy hour menu, and he explained to us that there wasn't really a menu, only three $1.99 items. At this point one of the butchers with a long beard (is that even hygienic?) had walked up to the bar. After the bartender walked away, he made eye contact with the butcher, who proceeded to roll his eyes. EXCUSE US. What did we do to offend your genteel manner? I thought the point of happy hour was to generate foot traffic and money during a time of day when people aren't sitting down for a meal.

The bartender, who will remain nameless, came back afterward to tell us that his ""name is K*****, not 'hey you.'"" First of all, my friend didn't say, ""Hey, you."" Second of all, how often do you remember your server's name without having him remind you at least once? Thirdly, I would have let go of this reprimand if it wasn't already obvious from the butcher's actions that they were not pleased to have two women in the bar at HAPPY HOUR asking about HAPPY HOUR specials. We both felt like this bartender resented serving us, but we decided to stay anyway since we've been there for lunch, brunch, and happy hour before and liked the food. This wait staff experience, though, was a disappointment and quite matter of factly, bullshit.",0,0,0

I had a craving for steak, but didn't want to shell out $100 at one of the super fancy steakhouses. Something about Echo and Rig rang all the bells for my desires. 

I rolled into the restaurant, which has a bar and a butcher shop downstairs. There is a main dining area upstairs, but I settled into the only seat open at the bar, between a visiting guy from Texas and a retired Navy lady living locally. They both were very friendly, which makes eating alone a little easier. I ordered up a Stoli cranberry which was made with white cranberry juice providing a little sweeter taste and a nice change from the routine red one. A brief look at the menu brought me to the Spencer steak, which my new friend from Texas was enjoying. He has a cattle farm and raved about the steaks here, so I simply followed his recommendation. Good choice as the steak was prepared perfectly medium rare, served with my choice of sauce (bernaise), a stuffed mushroom, and some potato chips (this I would have preferred the choice of a baked potato). Plenty of flavor in the steak, a little salty but then I""m one of those who never salts any food. A delicious meal it was for a nice price of $26.

It was advertised as butcher shop where you can pick your meat and they will cook it for you.  All the meats are grass fed and come from California.  Upon walking in, you see the butchers in action slicing meats, making sausages, and grinding beef for meatballs and hamburgers.

They don't take reservations, so expect to wait a little bit before getting a table.  The good thing is that they have a bar with 3-4 bartenders slinging up craft cocktails and making a great impression.  The bartender even gave us some complimentary shots of jalapeno infused tequila which seemed to improve our moods.  The drinks were $8, which is reasonable compared to $15-$18 drinks on the strip, so that worked well for us.  

After a 15 minute wait, we got a table and a great personable server.  They presented us with the selections of meats on a platter, which were supposedly steaks for 2 people.  I could have easily eaten their NY Strip which was 24 ounces and sold by the ounce ($2.29\/ounce).  So yea, it would have been a $50+ steak. 

We opted for for the hangar steak with chimichurri ($22.5) and the Ribeye ($34.50) along with a couple of appetizers of Portobello Fries and a Charcuterie platter with assorted meats.  The portobello fries were delicious and the charcuterie platter was a very good.  Then the main course came.

My Ribeye was about 10 ounces for $34 and was MAYBE 3\/4 inch thick.  It was well cooked, but one of the worst ribeyes that I have eaten in a long time.  I get better meat at Sam's club.  The Hangar steak was charred on the outside and chewy as all hell. The portion size of the Hangar steak was probably about 5-6 ounces and even though it is probably the correct amount of food per dietary guidelines as a serving, it was small and we did not leave feeling full, but left with a bill of over $150.

I would try it again, but I wouldn't go back for dinner.  Maybe their sandwiches and lunch selections will be a bit better.",3,0,0

I'm not one to want free stuff, but you would think if 3 steaks were sent back then brought back out with cold sides that at least a drink would have been comped. This place has been a favorite of ours... I'm not sure if this was a bad night but I don't think I will be back for a while. The whole place seemed unorganized, bad service on a Wednesday night is not a good sign! We were in celebrating a Birthday as well, so it was a definite let down for the whole party. The floor managers that are usually ALWAYS super attentive and friendly never took the time for our table either. I thought they would have stepped in when 3 of our steaks were returned. We spent $450 for this horrible service. Such a let down

Love this place!!! Its our new go to spot when we want a good quality steak. Customer service is top notch!!!

On our second visit, our server claimed that he waited on our table the first time we visited (he didn't). So ymmv when it comes to the service, it might feel a little disingenuous.

The lunch\/dinner menu here is well-rounded and offers a good variety of flavor, especially with reference to their selection of small plates.

To the meal, there were 7 of us and only 6 dinners arrived at the table after an hour of waiting.  When my steak finally arrived 15 minutes after the initial services it was undercooked, fatty and generally about as good as a steak you can order for breakfast at Denny's.  No apologies or anything,

For the price there are many other comparable chophouses in town to ever consider Echo & Rig again.

The moment you walk in the door you are greeted with sincerity and interest as to who you are and where your from. Once your seated one of the managers introduces himself and inquires as to what part of the US or in our case what part of Arizona and California we were from. This info was obviously passed on from the hostess but what a great touch. Our waiter named Dillion came over with a sweet introduction along with a brief education and highlight filled description of the restaurant. Drink orders were taken based on recommendations from our waiter along with appetizers. No rush dining made this experience that much better and the education we received regarding the levels of beef and what to expect what first class. The entire meal  was incredible and the entire staff made you feel like you were the most important people in the entire place. We topped the evening off with coffee and dessert which were again excellent. No surprise that this restaurant was voted BESToff the strip RESTAURANT for 2017.

Coming from fine dining, my expectations are pretty high. Time after time throughout service I was amazed. 

As we walked through the entrance and up the stairs (being seated at the exact time of our reso) the hostess inquired about our intentions. Whether or not we were celebrating. I informed her that I was gaining a brother in law. She took the information she gained and shared it with the staff. This is not something commonly done throughout restaurants but she took the extra step to make note.

Our server was phenomenal. It was like dining in the Wynn. He timed out our food perfectly, coursing it out and keeping us informed at all times as to what his intentions were. Dining here was an experience in itself, it's as if the entire staff works as a team. As every glass was emptied there was a different staff member removing it from the table just seconds later. When each of us stepped away from the table we came back to a folded linen. When the glass was low it was immediately filled from our bottle. Absolutely impeccable service. 

We felt like family. Thank you so much! I will forever recommend Echo & Rig to family and friends!

All of their steaks are from grass fed USDA cattle and are fresh cut daily in the butcher shop downstairs. The menu offers a wide variety of cuts as well as daily specials that are off the menu.  I highly recommend the filet, hanger, of the spencer steak.  The appetizers have never disappointed either.  My favorite from the appetizer menu had to be the lump crab cake, it is a single crab cake, but the flavor was amazing!  The filet chop salad was a must as well, it comes packed with steak and other cold cuts, and a bunch of different veggies for only around $10.  For a steak house of this quality, they prices are very fair. Anywhere else in town I easily pay 2-3x the price for similar quality.  The staff is extremely friendly and on point. We were kindly greeted by the manager when we say down, who knew we were returning guests.

We sat down and the waiter offered us drinks and a menu.  One of my friends who's been here often said don't even look at the menu. He'd order the appetizers but we'd pick our meat from what they bring to show us.   The waiter then brought out a tray just loaded with tomahawk steaks and ribeye.  We ordered one of each. My friend also ordered some French fried portobello mushrooms and some garlic mashed potatoes.  

When the tomahawks and ribeye came out they were just a delight to look at in the plate.  Cooked perfectly and sliced gorgeously displaying the perfect  cooked outside and red to pink middle.

A dinner here will run you about 50pp with drinks and a few appetizers. 

On multiple visits I have been served food that had been sitting out. I am not one to send something back but had to on my last visit because I could not stand paying good money for what I was being served. The server happily took it back and apologized after he touched the plate and realized that I was right. 

Regardless....
The layout of the restaurant is stunning. When you enter the restaurant you are checked in downstairs where you will find their butcher shop, then walked up the stairs by a hostess where you will find an open kitchen and dining area with a gorgeous patio overlooking the tivoli fountains (Not much of a view, but they definitely worked with what they had).

Echo and Rig is a great spot to have a casual lunch with a friend, date night with that special someone, or celebrate a special occasion.

The busser filled our glasses with water. My husband took a drink and said his glass smelled foul. I immediately picked up my glass and figured out that's where the smell was coming from. The glasses where DIRTY. I looked at my glass a little closer and there was food particles floating in there!!!!!! OMG!! My kids glasses were dirty too. 

I told our waiter and he replaced them with clean ones (so we thought). The new glasses were hot. He took them out of the dishwasher. He walked away and a few minutes later came the busser and filled with water. I touched the glass and it was rough and you could scratch off the particles of food on it. As the water sat in the glass it loosen up the food from the inside of my glass and again more ""floaties"" I think their dishwasher is broken or someone in the back is not doing their job right.

My visit was for brunch again and this experience was MUCH better. I didn't have a reservation this time, but the hostess was very enthusiastic about seating us and gave us a 15-minute wait (we received a table within this time frame, however, we were not given an option to sit outside). 

Smoked Salmon Benedict ($17): Smoked wild salmon, poached eggs, crème fraîche, red onion, sautéed spinach, and hollandaise sauce on potato pancakes. The elements of this dish were good, but there were issues. The spinach was a tad salty and the flavor managed to overpower the salmon. The menu says 'sautéed greens,' so they may serve something besides spinach that might complement the salmon more? We really didn't like the spinach with the smoked salmon. So, I just ate them separately. The hollandaise was fantastic. The potato pancakes were all right. It seemed like they were just piles of hash brown. Also, I'm not sure what happened, but I didn't see any crème fraîche or red onion..?

Short Rib Hash ($15): Prime short rib, Yukon gold potatoes, bell peppers, shallots, herbs, two poached eggs, and smoked paprika hollandaise sauce. Great hash! What made it was the delicious hollandaise with the smoked paprika - it added nice flavor. The diced potatoes were perfect and the short rib was very tender.

We had some Small Plates as well and they were really wonderful. I highly recommend ordering them and I'd love to try the others during another visit.

Portobello Fries ($9) with a herb aïoli. If you fell in love with these fries at Bottega Louie in L.A., you'll be thrilled that we have them in Vegas now! I love the large cuts of portobello, the light and flavorful batter, and the great aïoli that ties it all together. YUM!

Maryland Crab Cake ($9) served with red pepper coulis and lime wedge. This is one of the best crab cakes I've had and I loved the coulis with it. The cake has a light cornmeal exterior and large chucks of crab meat. Great flavors. You'll wish there was more than one cake per order!

The 1\/2-Inch Thick Grilled Bacon ($8) is AMAZING. It comes with a housemade BBQ sauce and trust me, you don't need it! The bacon has the best of both worlds - smoking and grilling. The two flavors mend together to make a really tasty piece of meat.

Service was great, as it was last time. Waters refilled frequently and many check-ups from our server. We had a great time. Also, the food was delicious and satisfying. I certainly enjoy this spot for brunch for its atmosphere and fun sharing dishes. I'd love to dine on the outdoor patio. Perhaps I'll even brave another steak and\/or dinner in the future.

Side note: The 'Steak Frites' is now served with New York Strip rather than Ribeye (online menu does not reflect this change yet). I'm not a fan of NY Strip, however, it may be a better fit for this particular dish seeing that I did not enjoy the Ribeye I was served during my previous visit.",9,2,4

I came here with a 8 adults and 4 kids for my wife's birthday dinner on a very busy Saturday night.  Even though they normally don't take reservations, the manager I spoke with on the phone the day before (Cheryl) was very helpful as I had my eye on the big long striped wooden table that was pictured on their site and they saved it for us.  We arrived a few minutes before and were treated to passed hors d'oeuvres of their homemade salami and smoked chicken.  Yum freakin yum.

With so many small plates offered, Echo & Rig is meant for groups so everything can be shared.  We split 3 salads and they all threw curveballs to the palate.  The kale salad with yellow beets, toasted hazelnuts and goat cheese was really nice.  Their ""over the rainbow salad"" was an explosion of flavor featuring farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & Champagne vinaigrette.  That's a vegetarian's dream right there.  And the fried spinach salad with red onion, cauliflower, broccoli was fantastic with the chile-lime vinaigrette was probably my favorite of them all.  The crispness of the spinach combined with the heat from the dressing was quite a combination.  

We ordered a bunch of small plates and the standouts for me were the cauliflower with chili de Arbol, crispy shallots and onions and the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with sharp white cheddar but the description didn't do that justice.  It was almost like a super hash brown with a really nice dijon sauce.  I was also able to sample the burnt peas, pumpkin squash, grilled thick cut bacon with bbq sauce (no sauce needed), butcher's sausage and mac and cheese.  All of them were solid options and everything was devoured by the group.  

I got the ""Spencer Steak"" which was one of the 3 ribeye cuts offered.  Each steak comes with a complimentary sauce and I went with charred onion but sauce just isn't necessary when the meat is awesome.  My medium rare cut was closer to rare but it was probably better that way.  It was everything you wanted in a steak...tender, juicy and flavorful.  My wife's rare filet mignon was cooked perfectly and just got better bite after bite.

Then there's the freakin value of it all!!  The priciest entree is only $35!  NO corkage fee (we brought 3 bottles), NO cake fee (got a cake from Patisserie Manon) and they lit the candles and brought it out.  The total bill for 8 adults and 4 kids came out to what 2 people would spend at Carnevino.  Total Wine and More is just across the way in Boca Park so pick something up there.  

I cannot wait to come back since there are so many other dishes I must try like bone marrow carne asada and Hawaiian cowboy.  I also can't wait for them to bust out their brunch and late night menus.  They also have tables set up on a balcony overlooking the Tivoli Village fountain which would make for a terrific date night.   

The staff was top notch from beginning to end and the experience here wouldn't have been as wonderful as it was without their great work.  They earned their tips and then some! I'm ready to go back for lunch.

We got our starter within 10 minutes but after 45 minutes and watching other, newer bar mates receive their food we asked about ours.The bartender said ""do you want me to check on it?""... That should have been the first warning. He came back and waited  on other guests and we finally got his attention to ask if he found out about our food and he said yes, 10 more minutes, when we said it it had a long time so he said the kitchen was backed up ( there were 2 others at the bar and 2 other 2 tops in site). We then waited more than 10 with no word or apology so we asked for the check (twice). We couldn't pay until the bartender got his manager and he came over saying our food was coming but we were literally trying to leave at this point. I am most sad that I wanted so badly to eat here, the food looked great and other than the horrible lighting in an otherwise nice atmosphere the restaurant was just a compete miss, we won't be back and really hope they can get it together so others can enjoy a potentially great restaurant.

We started with the Maryland Crab Cake which I normally love but this one however tasted very fishy....I am guessing they use the entire crab not just the crab leg.  It is definitely fresh as we found pieces of shell in the cake.  So overall it's not the best we've had and if you are not an avid seafood person you may not like this one.

Next we had the chopped vegetable salad which is raw salad and was actually very good.  So many items along with the dressing made this a fantastic dish.  The only item among all the vegetables that neither of us found was the avocado which it says on the menu is supposed to be in the salad which our waiter confirmed.  He did check with the kitchen and they said it was in there but I have a picture and taste buds on two people who can say it's not.  Nicholas did offer to bring us some slices which was awesome on his part but at that point almost being done with the salad and ready to move on to the next course we told him not to worry about it.

We also had the THICK cut smoked bacon with bbq sauce...yum

Next we had the ribeye along with asparagus covered with a fried egg which I really enjoyed.

Finished with the Salted Caramel Sunday that I watched and did not indulge as I was stuffed and very satisfied.

They don't take reservations, but it gave me time to go check out the specialty cocktail menu. For $8, these drinks are a preview of how reasonable the rest of the menu is. I tried the bourbon peach tree cocktail and it was heavy on the alcohol. Besides the bourbon, all you can taste is the mint. It was not well balanced, but for someone who likes their brown liquors, this is great. I still liked it. The Hot & Bothered was my favorite though. The mixture of spicy and sweet was phenomenal. The mango syrup was not too overbearing and the spice lingered on your lips. 

I sat in the lounge for 20 minutes before someone came to get my guest and I. We were taken upstairs to our table. Within minutes our server came by to introduce herself and I tried to get a few recommendations. With such a spectrum of items being suggested, it did not make it any easier. 

What we ended up deciding on was astounding. For starters, we got the ""over the rainbow"" salad and the bone marrow carne asada. Holy cow are they amazing. The best contrast of something healthy with a heart stopping appetizer. The mixture of grains with corn and veggies had me shoveling it down. The fatty goodness of the bone marrow had me wanting more. A squeeze of orange cuts the fat. As our protein, we went with the Spencer steak. $25 for a ten ounce steak with housemade chips and a mushroom rockefeller. What a deal! When we got it, it was cooked to a perfect medium rare. With that, you get a choice of sauce. Initially, we ordered the green peppercorn thinking it would pack some bold heat. It is more creamy and possessed little flavor. Afterwards, we asked for the chimichurri and that was much better. The capers in it had me scooping it up. Adding the crispy cauliflower tossed with chili de arbol and portabello fries was more than enough for two. If I had to choose between the two again, I'd go with the former. The sweet and spice of the florets had me wanting to plan another visit. The meatiness of the fries were good, but the aioli was what made them. We were dipping anything we could get our hands on in it. I was ready to tap out, but Sarah Marie wanted to see the dessert menu. They don't have one, but our server broke down all of their desserts for us. They only have sundaes. I was a littl surprised by that, but I am a huge ice cream fan. We ended up with the salted turtle sundae. The roasted peanuts, toffee pieces, salted caramel, chocolate sauce, and salted caramel ice cream was to die for. We were filled to the brim, but that sundae did not go to waste. 

All in all, it was the best dining experience I could have asked for. We ended up hanging out there for quite some time. Their timing was perfect. I didn't even realize that we had a three hour dining experience because they always had something in front of us and the pace was so controlled.",24,11,17

On my initial visit, I reveled in an excellent small appetizer plate of Meatballs with mixed flavors and straight ahead red Tomato Sauce and fresh grated Parmesan Cheese brought on request.  French Onion Gratin Soup with caramelized Onion, Roasted Pumpkin Squash, Sage, and domestic Swiss Cheese was great and somewhat unique served in a Staub metal pot.  A side of Butternut Squash & Brown Sugar was also excellent.   Sweet Fire Cauliflower was rather spicy but sweet at the same time.  Mushroom Rockefeller was interesting and tasty.  Garlic Shrimp featured 5 jumbo shrimps.  And, Garlic Chips were light on garlic and very good.   On the first occasion, these were offered to us to savor as snacks while we waited to be seated despite arriving on schedule.  But, on the second, during a delay that lasted about 15 minutes to be seated after the time of our reservation, we were offered nothing.    

There was a long wait between consumption of starters and delivery of our entrees during the first dinner service.  When entrees did finally arrive, I enjoyed a medium rare Filet Mignon that was in fact almost rare, with a good Red Wine Demi Glace and excellent Bearnaise Sauce.  This meal ended on a very upbeat note with great moist Strawberry Shortcake and assorted berries along with a Turtle Espresso Sundae provided gratis by the manager to make up for our delayed entrees.  A yummy finish! 

Both times after our arrival, the period of waiting to be seated was a little unusual, as my party of four had to stand on our feet and awkwardly mill about with other strangers in the sleek tiled atrium until we were called.  The only diversions were observing butchers at work or looking at cuts of beef, chicken, lamb, and pork, and various sausages in the on site butcher shop that displayed staggering prices for each offered item.

On the second occasion just over three weeks after the first, Wild Mushroom Soup with a touch of cream was even better than the French Onion Gratin Soup experienced earlier.  Complimentary bread was very tasty.  Garlic Shrimp were juicy, tasty, and extra fine.  A Steak Salad with large Cannelini Beans, medium rare hunks of tender beef, pepperoni, White Onions, Red Bell Pepper, pepperoncini, and zucchini was a very good chopped salad, but almost a meal in itself.  And, another 8 oz. medium rare Filet was very tender and buttery (again almost rare), enhanced by a good Green Peppercorn Sauce and again an excellent Bearnaise Sauce.  Moist Skin-on Redskin Mashed Potatoes were very good, just as again were homemade Garlic Chips (if you like potato chips with your steak, which I don't).  The only food item I didn't find appealing on this occasion was a side of too hard, falling apart Brussels Sprouts.  And, a fellow diner announced that she did not like her Shaking Beef entree.

While the food served here both times was generally praiseworthy, the second dinner was marred by a cluster of service errors: one bowl of Wild Mushroom Soup (mine) was missed, and then the server forgot to bring it to the table again; no steak knife was provided until requested; refilling water glasses was very intermittent; Bearnaise Sauce was initially forgotten; and Grilled Seabass was proferred with skin on after the server declared that it would only arrive at the table with skin off, and being told ""Good!"" by the diner who ordered this dish.  My steak was also cold by the time I finished this delayed entree, after dispatching the salad and belated soup courses.  The decor here is modern but rather austere, and feels somewhat cold.  The capacious upstairs dining room can also become very loud when it fills up, as it did both times I was here.

But to me, food is paramount.  Although this restaurant still has a few kinks to work out, it offers much promise.  Based on my two experiences to date, I rate it 4-1\/2 stars overall.",6,2,4

Here there were several fish and other seafood choices. I had the butterfish which was incredible, so I am psyched to return and try some other seafood dishes. 

We also had some cauliflower and brussel sprouts on the side, and they were almost as tasty as the mains. 

The only part that saddened me was dessert. Nothing was wrong with it, but the selection was a bit thin. They had a variety of different ice cream sundaes, but no cake, pie, tarts, etc. Just a dish of ice cream, no matter how good the toppings, is not as good as a brownie or pastry.",0,0,0

I had a piece of skirt steak I believe it was just alright I wasn't crazy about it and side of asparagus.

The setting, the food, and the atmosphere really made this an enjoyable dinner while visiting in town for the week. 

Our table ordered everything from the Steak Tartare, to the Portobello Fries, to the  thick bacon with bbq sauce which the bacon was made in house ( it was the BEST bacon I've ever had). my boyfriend loves the Oysters too, and the men had the Butterfish and were raving about it.",0,0,0

And despite my love affair with all things steak, I've only eaten steak at a restaurant once before Echo & Rig (and it was just a so-so steakhouse in Santa Barbara that I couldn't tell you the name of or anything about the meal beyond the steak was tasty.

Anyway! While visiting a friend in Vegas who takes me to all of his favorite food spots while I'm there, he suggested Echo & Rig for dinner on my last night in town. He'd never eaten there before, but passing by while walking in Tivoli Square, he, a fellow crazed steak fan, knew that he needed to eat at this classed up butcher shop.

We waited for just a few minutes for a table, but I didn't mind taking that time ogling the meats and sausages in the butcher case. Sadly, there was no one working the raw oyster bar on the first floor near the bar.

The restaurant seating is upstairs and I really loved that our server asked if we preferred the elevator or stairs. She sat us right near a big (closed) glass door and I loved having the light and view without the heat and wind of being actually outside.

Throughout the meal, the waitstaff regularly referred to my friend as Mr. Levin, which was a touch neither of us had ever experienced at dinner. Our server checked in with us many times for water and cocktails before we ordered. The best moment was when she brought out a board with some of the meat cuts on it. 20-some to 40-some ounce slabs of raw, marbled as all get-out red meat just waiting to be seared and devoured.

My friend and I had to joke about the meats being ""to share"" since both of us would be more than happy to take down one of those each. It was especially helpful that she explained where the different cuts come from and which ones are better ordered medium than medium rare to allow for more of the marbling to melt into the meat.

Neither my dining companion nor I are big on drinking, and wine is repulsive to me, so the vast assortment of wines here did nothing for us. The small cocktail menu on the table though caught my eye, and we ordered two drinks that actually sounded really delightful: Le Passion and a Duck, Duck Goose (how could you not?).

I can usually taste the alcohol in anything. but these drinks were phenomenal. I could taste tequila in the LR, but it was such a bright, citrusy, well-balanced drink that I liked it. I tasted pretty much no alcohol in the DDG and actually drank the whole thing.

Alongside the flat or sparkling water provided and the cocktails (only $10 each btw), I got a lemonade that was bright and tart, not too sweet at all.

We got the lamb cigars for an appetizer and they were exquisite. Not salty, the flavor was rich and complimented beautifully by the tzatziki sauce (which I tend to dislike) since it often tastes so cucumber-y, but this was a very light flavor that cooled down the spice and temperature of the lamb. The pickled red onions were fruity and sweet, not at all what I was expecting as someone who hates briny pickle flavor - they were like bread & butter style pickled onions.

My friend ordered a rib eye medium, and I a New York rare.The rare made it tougher to cut as less fat had melted into the meat, but it was still perfect to me. It was juicy and flavorful and I just savored every bite. My friend loved his rib eye and even said it was so good (along with the rest of the meal) that not being able to order 16oz. rather than 12 was totally okay.

The chips with the steak were great! They were slightly salted and peppered. Of the sauces we asked for, the brandied mushroom was my favorite; it was sweet and tangy and I want to put it on everything. I had to be careful not to drench the steak in it and just use it as a compliment. I felt the same about the charred onion, with its sweetness that could almost overpower the steak but stopped just short. My friend is a huge fan of horseradish cream and said this one had little kick, but was smooth and flavorful.

I fully expected to just ignore the mushroom Rockefeller since I really don't care for mushrooms, but it was delicious!A cooked mushroom top, topped with a crunchy breadcrumby topping. Usually the texture of a mushroom makes me gag but this was cooked to tender perfection.

We also ordered the asparagus and fried egg as a side as per our server's recommendation. Cooked until tender and no longer stringy or chewy, the asparagus sat atop a creamy green sauce and had on top of it a fried egg and shaved parmesan cheese. I would have liked a more runny yolk.

This is definitely a great place for a date or a celebratory gathering. All of the staff is so attentive, kind, and genuine. The food is out of this world.  We felt taken care of and appreciated. If anything, they didn't want us to leave without ordering dessert! For how special everything about the experience was, the price was so reasonable!",1,1,2

When it comes to a holistic dining experience Echo & Rig executed perfectly on all aspects of what ""I"" (just my humble opinion; others are entitled to their own...) deem as important when eating out.

This place is a restaurant\/bar\/butcher shop. As you walk in you can see them butchering meat behind the counter to the right, to the left is a bar with some small tables and upstairs is the dining area. This place sources really high end meat from Snake River Farms and Compart Duroc (pork)!! The customer services was top notch, our waiter was super attentive and we were greeted and checked upon by management before, during and after our meal. The food was excellent; since this was a butcher shop we chose to order some non-traditional cuts such as the ring of rib eye and the bevette (hope I didn't butcher the name; pun intended...). Steaks, small plates, salad and drinks were beyond excellent. The waiter recommended the portobello fries and they were delicious. We also ordered the grilled octopus, kennebec salt & pepper fries (same potatoes In & Out uses), broccolini and shared a Caesar salad. Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection and tasted great. I'd say this is the best dinning experience that I had in the last year (we eat out often). 

This place is unique because it is very evident they are extremely focused on working with most fresh and ""best"" ingredients, their customer service second to none, the environment is lively, elegant and welcoming, and the prices are reasonable (compared to ""Vegas Strip"" prices).

I am thoroughly impressed. The butcher that was working at the counter was very very helpful. I had a few questions, and he was more than happy to help. He had no problem separating the chickens I purchased and even threw in the bones. (Chicken bone broth!)

I have already eaten some of the chicken, along with a bit of the bacon. It tasted fresh and tender. Obviously the cooking method plays a role, but the quality of the meat was amazing. The bacon was flavorful and delicious. A great addition to my brussel sprouts.

This is one of those restaurants that is just ok. An average restaurant. The food is not bad, but not too memorable either. I've been here a couple times before for brunch. The reason I go for brunch here is not because of the food, but because they have bottomless mimosas (for $16. Bottomless bloody mary for $22) and they're not stingy with the champagne :) Also, the place is nice and easily accessible, so it makes a good place to meet up with friends. I tried their short rib hash and steakhouse scramble for brunch. Both were ok. Not special enough for me to want to order again. I do really like their portobello fries! 

For my friend's birthday dinner, I shared a 48 Oz. tomahawk steak with 3 other people. I think the steak was cooked a bit too charred on the outside, but the inside was a nice medium. However, the steak was bland and not tender. It was so bland that I had to eat it with a sauce. I recommend the brandied mushroom and the red wine demi (they offer 7 different sauces). The fact that I had to eat the steak with a sauce is quite sad. To me, a sign of a good steak is when you can eat it by itself and you can savor that juicy meaty taste alone, not covered by some sauces. For sides, I tried the cauliflower (this is good), brussels sprouts (just ok), and mashes potatoes (again, just ok). I also tried the steak tartare for appetizer. Nothing wrong with it, but I've had better. Service was kind of on the slow side that night. 

Side notes: you can bring your own bottles of wine and they don't charge a corkage fee. If you have a big party, they automatically add a 20% tip. 

Overall, this is a nice place away from the strip to have some drinks and appetizers (portobello fries!). If you're looking for a good steak though, there are other local places that offer better tasting steaks.",2,1,1

I was so excited to celebrate not just a new year, but the first new year as husband and wife. When we walked in the restaurant, I was a little confused. To the right was a butcher shop, to the left a bar, and a host stand with four hosts. We told them we had reservations and one led us upstairs to be seated and gave us menus.

I think I've been watching too many Bar Rescues lately because I just started observing and timing the service. No one greets us for at least five minutes, then some employee came by to light candles on our table refusing to make any eye contact so I assumed he wasn't our waiter. Then another five minutes, a manager stops by and welcomes us, tells us about the concept and hopes we enjoy our dinner. He says he will get us water (yes, that would be great). Then another five minutes and we get water (from some other employee that doesn't make eye contact either or interacts with us). Okay....

Another couple minutes pass by and we finally were greeted by the waiter and I order the Date 17 cocktail and hubs orders the Black N Blu Mojito. It probably takes another 5-10 minutes to get our cocktails and we place our order. Now, I will give them the benefit of the doubt since it was New Years Day! My cocktail was superb! I highly recommend it! I don't think I've ever had such a great drink that had dates!

The hubs and I order the Portabello fries with garlic aioli, House Blend butcher burger and the grilled cheese with short ribs! The portabello fries will not let you down - you need to try it!! Actually, everything was delectable and I was impressed.

When we get our bill, it was less than $60, which I was pretty happy about because the last few restaurants I've been to were more than $60 for two people and the food quality are probably the same. 

Thanks for celebrating the New Year with us, Echo & Rig - it was delicious and fun and for that, I will give you five stars!",12,7,9

We waited only 15 minutes even though we had a large party and it was busy. The space is beautiful - modern, clean lines and sharp-looking staff. I appreciated that they were offering samples of the charcuterie in the bar area while we waited. 

Service was quick, pleasant, informative, and accommodating. We got to see the special cuts of the day, which was a lot of fun. One recommendation I have to improve the experience a bit more would be to have visuals of the regular cuts as well - we had some steak novices at the table who would have benefitted, and it would enhance the experience.

Food was excellent. My steak was cooked perfectly, and we got a mix of sauces so I got to try 4 of them. My favorite was the wine sauce, which was not much on it's own, but once on the steak it really popped. The wine selection also highlighted the food. I had a Spanish Tempranillo that was lightly sweet, fully of cherry and some vanilla. My friend went with a California Merlot that was dark, bold, and spicy. Flavors of honey and an acid balance that worked well with the richness of the beef. I did not have the mushroom rockafeller because it had bread crumbs (I am allergic to wheat), but reports were they were also tasty. 

We sampled small plates as well. The bacon was smoky and thickly-cut. It was balanced well with the tangy spice of the BBQ sauce. Cauliflower was well-spiced, and still managed to not overpower the nutty flavors. The salt and pepper fries were crisp on the outside without being over done, and the dipping sauce was light and flavorful. I also liked that the fries were not greasy at all. 

Dessert was a major treat. I had the turtle sunday, and it was both a flavor and texture dream. I appreciated the smoky, salty, and nutty crunch that highlighted the sweetness of the caramel. Presentation on desserts was excellent.

I have wanted to try this place since a pal of mine, Jason, starting working here as a Chef. I have heard\/read mixed reviews. The most recent article I read was in the Desert Companion magazine. After eating here, I find the magazine's review offensive.
The nice young lady at the front told us it would be 30-40 minute wait. We made our way to the bar where Scotty was waiting to take care of us. He was OUTSTANDING! Knowledgeable, friendly, and entertaining. I can't even tell you how long we waited bc we didn't mind, We enjoyed our time at the bar. Sangria made w\/Sav blanc so it wasn't too sweet. Kentucky peachtree was a little herbal for my husband, who is a straight whiskey kind of guy. Admittedly we were a little sad when our table was ready, Scotty said next time we could eat at the bar with him. Prices at the bar weren't bad, 1can beer, one glass sangria, one shot whiskey, one Kentucky Peachtree and a glass of wine, $37.
So glad we went to the table. Our service was on point. Ramón brought out a plate with raw cuts of meat to explain the menu and help us with our selections. We ordered nearly one of everything. He asked how we would like the meal timed. We chose to go with ""whenever its ready, bring it out."" As we received our dishes we slowly realized we may have over done it.
Anyway! What we ordered.... just my husband and I....  and our rating(1-10), don't judge, we like to try everything!

Asparagus & fried egg-11 the asparagus had slight grilled char that was perfect  with the creamy egg,

The waiter explained the menu, offered his recommendations and we were off to a normal Las Vegas steakhouse experience.... Until the service sputtered and crashed. Interestingly our section started clearing out after we ordered so I can't say it got busier for them. The first issue was the bread we were told about never came. Fine. We had the amazing portobello fries to munch on anyways. Getting water glasses refilled was a constant struggle throughout the visit. Next, out steaks arrive, without steak knives. I asked for one but my friend didn't think to, assuming they'd bring for both of us. Out comes one steak knife, just one. We ask for another. It comes. She had to remind the server to bring her wine. Oddly, he never asked if she'd care for another glass...? Look, the food is delicious, the concept is wonderful but the staff needs more training.

The food is about a 3 and the service was a 5 so the average out to a 4 star rating. I dunno maybe a bad day? I think I will definitely give this place another shot. 

We had a lot of dishes here I love that we ate our meal family style versus individually I recommend anyone to do that. Here's what we had 

Octopus salad-liked the dressing but the combination wasn't great don't recommend 

Bone marrow carne asada-this was ok I'm used to this having a sweet contrast to the dish but this was sour but the carne asada was good!

Lamb cigars- least favorite just an egg roll nothing special at all 

Parmesan risotto- good flavor just texture was bad

Duck dish- could do without the wild rice side and seem like that duck could've been executed a little better was tough

Lamb chops-was really good so soft and buttery and not gamy at all. 

Broccolini-not a broccoli guy so just whatever. Lol

Mushroom soup- not bad just super simple

Best thing on the menu was an off menu item. Tomahawk rib eye!! We chose the 36oz cut I was blown away from the display they had with the exact cut you pick is the one you eat! Awesome selling point that we enjoyed! But the steak was very fatty but cooked ok.

You have to wait in this awkwardly laid out area with not enough seats for the hostesses to run up and down the stairs to the main seating area of the restaurant, one party at a time. My visit was on a quiet Saturday afternoon, yet we still managed to wait a solid 10 minutes to be seated with only two parties ahead of us. When we got upstairs I was pretty confused by how long we had to wait based on how empty the dining room was, hopefully they figured out a better system during busy hours! Then our waiter took the orders for the 10 person table near us and disappeared for a good 5 minutes before finally coming back to take our drink and food orders at the same time. Plus we pointed out that both of our water glasses were dirty so he swapped them with two from the table next to us, which got immediately placed back into that table setting. Yum! The dining room is a bit strange, very minimally decorated and doesn't seem too thought out. Their brunch menu is fairly decent, with a handful of salads, sandwiches, breakfasts, small plates and sides. There is a different dinner menu that is slightly different. I would also note that their burger is listed under the SANDWICHES section, for those that don't think a burger is a sandwich...

Their burger, in this case the Butcher Blend Burger, comes with USDA prime beef, bibb lettuce, Brandywine tomato and red onion. The bun was a little dry, but the meat was cooked to medium rare as ordered so it wasn't much of an issue. If this was a well done burger it would have been a vacuum of moisture. The meat had excellent flavor; it was very juicy, peppery and delicious. You could definitely tell this wasn't cooked with a frozen, pre-made patty. The sharp cheddar I added was flavorful and melted well, the tomato was colorful but didn't have a strong presence with the meat and oniony mystery base under the patty. I'm not quite sure what it was as that wasn't a listed item on the menu, but it was quite tasty.

Sadly the burger comes with chips, fries would have been extra. The chips were good; crunchy and of your kettle variety but not the fries I want with a good burger. Overall this was a pretty great deal for $12, but could have been way better with fries instead of chips. What makes this not such a great meal was the experience at the beginning and our service overall. I hate to say it but our waiter sucked, he was non-existent for much of our meal, never took away our table setup plates so our two-person table was a little crowded, and we sat for a full 10 minutes after our meals were done before he returned. We spotted him rolling silverware in the kitchen area while we sat around, and all the managers were having a little powwow to the side. The food seemed pretty good, but service like this is unacceptable even during quiet hours. I would probably have given my burger a better score based on the quality, but we walked out with such a bad feeling after this that I have to go by my overall experience. If you're in this area and want a great burger, stick with Honey Salt.",1,0,2

Its also a great place in that it's a steakhouse but it also has other items, great for couples where one enjoys a good steak and the other is less of a carnivore!

The service was great and the hostess immediately asked if it was our first time or if we were celebrating something special. Yes to the first, no to the second. But that information was clearly passed on, as our waited and a manager-type both acknowledged that we had not been in before and took the time to explain the menu\/food\/ect. So there is a long line of communication going on between employees and that's a good thing. 

Now to the food: 

Short-rib grilled cheese - Order it! Just do it. It comes with thick bread, egg battered and then grilled with tender, savory short-rib meat, gruyere cheese and white cheddar. It's savory, flavorful and filling. 

Ribeye - I'm not much of a steak eater, but I enjoyed the seasoning and flavors of this steak and the way it was cooked. 

Garlic Chips - come with each entree and are the classic home-made style of kettle cooked potato chips. They are salty and garlicky and good. 

Mac and cheese - pretty standard. Creamy with breadcrumbs on the top. Not the best mac and cheese you've ever had, but still good. 

Brocillini - pretty basic, but good. 

Lamb cigars - almost like an eggroll, but with lamb filling. Unique but worth trying. I could have done with out the wrapping and just had the strips of meat, but the eggroll aspect did give it a unique flavor and style that I haven't had before. 

Baked brie - I'd probably skip next time. I love cheeses but this brie did not have much flavor and the bread was over cooked. Just wasn't my favorite. 

Each of those items plus a bottle of wine and the bill was about $150 which is a nice price when you compare it to what you would pay at a steakhouse on the Strip. The menu is large enough that you could go back several times and never order the same thing. The service was great, food was high quality and well prepared and the atmosphere was nice.",0,0,0

First off, love the decor and layout! Bar area (open seating) downstairs + main dining area upstairs. It's clean and everything is spaced right (tables aren't too close, nor too far). So snaps for lovely interior design! 

Now the important stuff: the food. 

I got the sea bass -- soft and moist, with a beautifully crunchy exterior. This was served with a side of olive oil for dipping; oh and of course a lemon slice to squeeze over the fish! Seriously, so flippin' delish. 

Husband got their most popular steak (forgive me, I can't quite remember the name, but it's basically smack dab in the middle of the menu, so your eyes focus on it almost immediately anyway! -- great placement guys!). He made sounds I've never heard him make at a restaurant before. Yea. Ah. May. Zing. It came with a little stuffed mushroom, some housemade potato chips, and a mushroom gravy sauce (you can def taste the butter in it, yum!). 

So let me tell you, this was so good that when our waitress took his plate (took it too soon on accident cause we were all talking and not paying attention), he shouted after her, ""no! Come back! I have one more bite!"" And she didn't hear him, so he ran after her and got his plate back -- then proceeded to make the last bite into two bites (ain't he adorable?). Now that's how you can tell it's a good steak. 

Oh, and for you beer enthusiasts, if you can get their whiskey cask beer (not always on tap), it's a must! 

Will definitely be returning :)",3,2,1

Pork belly slaw- wow, great acid, perfectly fall apart.

Portobello fries- I was against the thought of these, but Ari brought some out for us to try because we had to and they were, surprisingly, delicious. I could dip everything in that basil aioli. 
Rib eye-cooked a little more rare than medium rare but really flavorful. 
Mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and asparagus- good sides, but I was so full at this point
Chocolate cherry sundae-they only do sundaes here and this one did not disappoint. Not a dessert person but the dehydrated candied walnuts were amazing. I'm going to try to duplicate these at home!

Echo & Rig is a butcher shop, deli, and restaurant rolled into one. The main dining room is upstairs and the best evening seating is on the patio. The lights are enchanting and the views set a really romantic tone. My friend and I decided to order a few of their small plates as a full on meal wasn't something we were looking for at 9 PM. 

We ordered a few of the small plates and the two that stuck out the most to me werethe thick cut bacon which was decadent, juicy, and tender and was paired with a nicely balanced BBQ sauce that was tangy, sweet, and had just the right amount of smoke flavor (and trust me, I hate that smokey flavor). The most knock me on my knees and had me beggin' for more was the Portabella mushroom fries with a basil, garlic aoli, Oh, sweet baby Jesus! We need to pause for a moment of silence... This was off the charts amazing. Order this or else.

I cannot wait to head back and experience the meat here.  I guarantee it will be off the charts and butter knife tender.

COCKTAILS:
""HOT MESS"" - absolutely terrific. Nice spice and not too sweet. 

APPETIZERS:
Crab cake - one crab cake; excellent flavor, could have been served slightly warmer. 
Bacon - what they are known for and fantastic!!! Served with house-made bbq sauce but not needed; bacon is delicious, almost better, alone.
Cauliflower - I hate all veggies but I could eat this. Nice sweet and spicy notes :)

ENTREES:
Horseradish butterfish- best meal of the evening!  Cooked perfectly and delicious flavor. 
New York strip - excellent marbling and cooked to a perfect medium rare (closer to rare) 
Horseradish cream sauce- had to ask for seconds; could have drank it!  Extra good with the homemade potato chips. 

SIDE NOTE: NO CORKAGE FEE!!!!!!

If one thing's for sure about Vegas, there will NEVER be a shortage of places to explore different cuisines, excellent to otherwise.  Echo and Rig was one I'd heard about before, and I saw it when we went to Tivoli Village to another eatery, Cantina Laredo, which was also excellent.  So once I saw it on Open Table as I flipped though, selecting it was a no-brainer.

Now, we like to pride ourselves on a knack for one-upping the quality level of our experiences, each time we go out to a new place to eat. Anyone who does knows that there's about a 50\/50 chance you'll have a great time, or not-so-great.  I am over-the-moon to report that E&R was nothing but spectacular. 

Let's start with walking in. More of a butcher shop that just happens to have a full bar downstairs, and a restaurant upstairs, the meat cases are the very first thing to capture your attention as you enter. And you realize immediately, seeing the impressive various cuts of steak and pork and who-knows-what-else on display, that no, Dorothy, we're not in Kansas anymore.  We ain't at the local Safeway Meat Department, either.

We were warmly greeted and invited to have a drink from the bar and a seat in the lobby, while we waited for them to get our table set. I don't think the chairs had a chance for our butts to warm them up, when the receptionist came and took us up to the dining room.

Once she seated us, again it was only a brief moment before our server, Sam, (fancy that - easy name to remember, too!) appeared to see to us.  When the wait staff in Vegas establishments is good, they are VERY good, and Sam is top-notch. Knowledgeable, witty, accessible and quick with great suggestions, he made sure that as the 'birthday boy', I was well taken care of, but he DEFINITELY made sure that we both got exceptional service, as did all the staff who delivered our several different courses. 

Now, experienced 'foodies' know that because you spend a boatload of cash on a steak dinner, it doesn't necessarily equate to a GREAT meal. Echo And Rig makes any concerns you may have about that aspect disappear as quickly as the moisture from the misters out on the patio did, by laying down some of the best damn food I think we've had in the almost five-year span we've been designated 'local Las Vegans.'

The bread-and-butter starter as you peruse the menu is a 'green flag' for what's to come.  The bread is right-from-the-kitchen fresh (even if it isn't warm), with creamy, whipped, unsalted butter to go with, and they will keep bringing as much as you like.  But you'd best control yourself with that...you WANT to have room for all the other offerings, because they are worth it.

I have NEVER experienced anything like the Portobello Fries with Avocado Aioli before, and a few more go-rounds with them may convince me to '86' potato fries for GOOD. Golden brown with crispy, crunchy breading, they are as tender, juicy and meaty on the inside as you would expect portobellos to be, and the aioli complements them with a mild creaminess and flavor that never becomes too overpowering.  We kept forging ahead with the thick-cut bacon with barbecue sauce, (pig candy addicts everywhere, BEWARE - this will NOT help you kick your habit!), plus a bowl of what may be the greatest Onion Soup known to man.  I could have EASILY done three bowls of that with bread and a salad, and simply called it a day. (Glad I opted NOT to do that.)

When Sam explained how they handled the meat dishes, he treated us to the spectacle of a display tray of brontasaurus-sized slabs of beef. He told us the actual cuts were for family-style service and that we could opt for the saner cuts from the menu - which we did.  Bear's eyebrows arched in recognition of the Tri-Tip with the Santa Maria rub, (he hails from SLO), so there was no question what he was having.  After Sam answered my questions about the Spencer Steak, I went for that.  With our entrees, at Sam's enthusiastic urging, we had the cauliflower with Chile de Arbol, crispy shallots and the Kennebec Salt-and-Pepper fries.  Yeah, I know - I said the Portobello Fries were my new 'bae', but these reminded me of what it is about fries I dig in the first place...the crispy tenderness dunked into ketchup with a forkful of steak? ORGASMATRONIC.

Portions here aren't MAN VS. FOOD-sized, nor did they need to be.  With a great wine, we were pretty much stuffed to the gills by the time we got halfway through.  (Oh, yes...there WILL be doggie bags.) The beef was everything as advertised, and MORE. I may have even learned how to like medium-well steak now, (I usually won't eat steak unless Drogon has breathed on it. For a VERY long time.)

At the conclusion, Sam surprised me with a complimentary birthday dessert of two different sherbets, and that clinched the deal.  Amazing. Will we be back? Does Trump Tweet?",2,0,0

Bottomless Mimosas are great.   The issues fall on the preparation\/flavors, and mediocre service at the bar.   ""roasted potatoes"" were clearly deep fried for faster delivery...along with the peppers and onions.   Deep fried.    Tell us they are fried potatoes, and all is well, but these were listed as roasted.  

Potato pancakes were perfect.     Poached eggs with asparagus, potatoes, goat cheese, beets, carrots dish - very bland.   That's fine, but the bartenders never asked how everything was, so we had to find salt\/pepper\/hot sauce at the end of the bar.   Totally helped the flavor; just a service issue there.  

Not steak eaters, so cannot provide feedback there.   Love Tivoli Village, love the place, just not up to our expectations.    If the service would have been even close to over the top, we would give 4 or 4.5 stars. Bartender never asked how the food was; never checked on us; without conversation kept our mimosas full - just going through the motions.  We are locals that love to sit at the bar and enjoy the atmosphere.   Just not at Echo and RIg.   Above mediocre flavors become great with amazing service.",0,0,0

Parking is free and plentiful in any of the underground garages. Alternatively, there is valet at the door. I admit I found the first floor layout a bit odd - the hostess area to the left of the door, an oyster bar at the bottom of the stairs, a butchery to the right and a few scattered tables in the center. The hostesses were very pleasant, asking questions and jotting down notes as you walked up the staircase. This note was then passed on to your server as a conversation starter, which was a nice touch.

We opted to sit outside and the ambiance was perfect. The furniture was comfortable, the lighting and balcony overlooking the street made for a romantic evening. Our server, Ramon, was truly a professional and offered suggestions from cocktails to small plates to entrees. We opted to start with the Portabello Fries which were flavorful and nothing like we've ever had. Get it! We both opted for the Spencer Steak (him with the chimichurri and I with the bearnaise) and the Cauliflower and Pork Belly small plates. Unlike some places where your steak arrives alone, E&R's comes with garlic chips and a mushroom Rockefeller. Our small plates\/sides were a good portion for parties of 3 or 4, especially since the steaks don't come naked. I found the steak cut a bit chewy side.

We ended the night with bursting bellies and declined dessert but the server brought over the caramel turtle sundae anyways and WE COULD NOT PUT THE SPOONS DOWN. It was so good!

There are reasonably priced bottles of wine and they even sell some by the 1\/2 glass. I split the New York steak with a colleague and we probably got about 5 oz each which was plenty for me. We got the cauliflower, broccolini, and fries. The cauliflower was delicious but a little too sweet for me. The fries were fresh but also plain. The broccolini for me was perfect! Next time I just want a side of it for myself! The greens of the broccoli perfectly absorbed the seasoning from when it was roasted. This is a new team favorite for us!

It's in an upscale outdoor mall, that is beautiful and a perfect place for a stroll to walk off some of dinner. When we walked in, it didn't seem very impressive because it is somewhat sterile in the downstairs lobby. The dining room is upstairs and the lower level is a butcher shop, which is basically how this restaurant exists. 

The cuts are all so amazing. I ate way too much because it just felt like a waste to leave a bite on my plate

At our table, we had the rib eye (not the cap--that's mostly the fat), the brisket and the Spencer steak. Each of us loved our choices. We got the portabella mushroom fries (amazing, you should try them), ahi poke, cucumber watermelon and tomatoe salad, Mac n cheese and the Brussels sprouts. The only one that was just ok was the sprouts. The others were outstanding. 

Ally was our server and she did an awesome job of making us feel special and attended to. This is a hidden gem. Prices are very reasonable for what you get. Plan to spend about $60 per parson (or more if you drink a lot and add on dessert).

Please note that our food and waiter were both great during the last two experiences.  Our issue is with the having a reservation or not having a reservation.  Recently about month ago we decided to try the brunch menu on a Sunday.  When we arrived we were told that they were full and we should of made a reservation.  We were disappointed but thought oh well next time we know better.  We did end up eating down in the bar area instead (not quite the experience as up stairs) and settled for that instead.  Few minutes later another group sat next to us and they did not have a reservations as well and but decided to make the best of the bar area too.  As we all received our drinks and looking over the menus the hostess came over to the other group and offered them a table upstairs.  NOT COOL!   My daughter and I decided that this may have just been an oversight and a restaurant of this scale would not do that under normal circumstances.  Ok we forgave you that one time!  Now on to our experience on May 21st.  So we made sure we made reservations early so we would get seated in the area we wanted to be which was the patio.  So as you have read in the my daughters review: They made us wait downstairs for 45 minutes and then took us upstairs never telling us that they were planning on seating us inside.  The hostess looked puzzled and called the manager over.  He then explained that he was only doing it temporally until the table was available.  He didn't want us waiting downstairs any longer. He took me over to where he wanted to seat us and told me as soon as they were open he would seat us.  What good is a reservation if you are not seated at the time of the reservation!!   Finally another 15 minutes goes by and they finally come to seat us outside, its not the table he showed me and is at the opposite end of the patio with NO view of the city lights.  I did not notice anyone with prom attire and when we walked by the table he showed me earlier there was a new set of guest seated there. By now we are all starving!  Derek, the manager, said he would make it up to us.  We received 3 salads comped - whoopee - I think he could of done much better than that.  : (     
I think we got the message from Echo & Rig. Its too bad, the food and waitstaff are great. 

ps.  the men and women bathrooms were filthy - my husband told them about the men's room and they never took care of it.  We were there for over 3 1\/2 hours and notice the women's restrooms need attention as well with paper towels on the floor, etc. For this upscale of a restaurant they should know better.",0,0,0

Everything was family style.
- skirt steak which came with chips and a stuffed mushroom - nice flavor. It was ok. 
- shrimp with artichokes - the sauce was good but the shrimp were dipped in a weird batter and fried. It did not taste good at all. 
- bavette - AMAZING. It had a wonderful, subtle seasoning that I can't place but was delicious. We shared this dish with the table but I'm getting this just for myself next time!
- fried spinach salad - refreshing, yummy Asian-y dressing
- Mac and cheese - hubby liked it
- Portobello fries with aioli - YUM! really tasty. Especially liked the aioli which made the dish 
- Pork belly - pass. nothing special 
- Avocado toast - So so. Not as good as other places
- Berry sundae - shortbread was dry but ice cream was creamy and berries were good. They really need to get a pastry chef. 

Ambiance: small, intimate restaurant upstairs above the butcher shop. Way too LOUD. Really hard to hold a conversation with the table and be able to hear. May try to sit outside next time. 

Service: absolutely top notch. Ari was our server and he was the epitome of impeccable professionalism. I have not experienced this kind of service in years. He was able to anticipate my needs before I could even open my mouth to ask. He was relaxed, easy going and knowledgeable and funny. It was like dining with an old friend. That's experience!

New York egg sandwich -two eggs on an English muffin with a slice of bacon and a small green salad. Liked, would order again. Also had potato pancakes -- delicious. 

Goat cheese quiche: Very ""goaty"" and sharp. Okay, but would not order again.

Fried chicken salad: A big bowl of lettuce with sliced fried chicken on top. A few tiny veggies, but mostly lettuce. Disappointing.

Over the Rainbow Salad: The winner of the day. Loved it, would definitely order again (one other diner had been to E&R before and had that and also loved it.) 

The eggs benedict with salmon. It looked delicious but was rated ""okay,"" would not order again.

Grilled cheese sandwich with short rib meat. Grilled to perfection, but skimpy. Two pieces of cheese with bits of meat. Came with yummy potato crisps, but a small salad would have been more welcome. Would not order again.

The prices were not outrageous for a nice restaurant -- about $12 for salads and sandwiches.The service was fine -- nothing to rave about.

This is just about HH and we were pretty surprised at the low quality of anything being served from this place. I've had it bookmarked for a very long time and I said to my man, let's try the HH menu before we make dinner reservations. HH should inspire you to come back for the value but also back for the real thing. That definitely didn't happen here.

The space itself is really nice and overlooks Tivoli village which is inspired by Italy. Unfortunately it was filthy and none of the tables were cleared in the bar area for happy hour. We waited and one was cleared for us and then sat next to the other tables that were never cleared off. Our server was pleasant, nothing negative on that front. 

We decided to order the three items they offered on HH to try them all. Shrimp cocktail, steak & eggs and a hot dog. Prices are super cheap from 99 cents to $1.99. The shrimp cocktail was inedible, extremely fishy in taste and smell. The steak was like beef jerky and I couldn't even cut into it. It was also a tiny cut but that's expected with these prices. The egg was great, no complaints there. The best offering was the hot dog that came with deli mustard & sauerkraut. The only thing that we finished. The cocktails are all reasonable with other HH menus at beers starting from $3 and house wines from $5 as well as a few other specials. 

I would suggest raising the very low rates and serving up some decent HH plates. There's no need to offer such low prices and serve up this kind of food. The restaurant is also very pretty and should be kept up with. It wasn't busy on a Saturday around 4pm and the place was pretty dirty.",35,22,27

When I called to make a reservation, they asked if it was a special occasion ...i told them it was my birthday.  When we showed up for our reservation we ended up having to wait for almost 20 minutes for our table.  When we were seated we sat for a good while until we were approached. In fact the general manager had come over to see how we were doing because a server had not approached our table.  I ordered bacon and eggs and a bagel.  My sister ordered the same and my friend ordered the steak and egg bowl.  We all ordered the bottomless mimosas and my sister and i ordered coffee.  To get someone to refill our coffee and mimosas was like pulling teeth.  The eggs are ""any style"" yet they don't do basted eggs...so  really no they aren't any style.  I was really blown away by the bacon.  We had looked at all the meat in the fridge before we came up and I was excited to taste the glorious looking bacon.  When I got my plate I had a twisted up mess of 4 pieces of overly burnt bacon.  There was absolutely no moisture in this bacon... none. dead... so confusing how this is a butcher shop yet the cooks can't cook their meat.  The server had forgot my potatoes but finally after I mentioned it... he brought them out.  I wasn't too fond of them either... although they did have a mixture of peppers and onions... the potatoes clearly tasted like they had been deep fried.. just not the way breakfast or ""brunch"" potatoes should be cooked...definitely not in a place like that... the server brought out the dessert menu and I mentioned that when I called for my reservation they told me since it was my birthday to ""prepare"" for a sundae! yay! so a gentleman walked over... dressed in a suit so I assume he was a different manager... he told me he would take care of it and brought me out an amazing sundae off their dessert menu... that was one of the only high points of this restaurant.

The difference between this time and the first was that my brother was with us which meant I had a partner in crime to attack one of the bone-in steaks, which we did relentlessly. The fantastic steak, along with stellar service made for quite a memorable meal.

Seated immediately in a round at the top of the stairs for our 8 o'clock reservation, the manager greeted us and we ordered drinks. The Duck, Duck, Goose from their award winning bar was a fruity drink with some punch to kick off the meal. The menu was about the same from our last visit two years ago and no specials were being offered by the chef that night which are options that might need to be considered by the restaurant for those who want something different every visit. For me, just give me quality Double R Ranch\/Snake River Farms beef every time.

Our server Luke was an exceptional guide throughout the meal, friendly (especially to my daughter and able to make her laugh) and knowledgeable about all food and drink. He actually helped us tilt the bone-in tray toward one tomahawk as we were teetering between two by pointing out how the marbling was more pronounced in one of the cuts compared to the other. His recommendation to have the thick cut cooked medium to assure a medium rare center and to have all the fat rendered through the steak, guaranteed that we tasted every bit of the sublime flavor. After requesting a recommendation of a cab to pair with my steak, two taste samples were brought out so I could decide.

We were also informed that a shipment of Mer Bleue oysters had arrived earlier that morning and there were only 20 were left, so a dozen were ordered immediately. The Canadian oyster definitely had the salty East Coast start, but a surprisingly sweet West Coast finish. The small plates are a definite strong point of the restaurant and we had a total of five to sample from throughout the meal. All food was brought out in a timely manner and all seven of their sauces were brought out with the steak. I didn't delve into the sauces too much, but my brother did and he said the mushroom sauce was the best. We finished off the meal with two caramel turtle sundaes.

Service has never been an issue with us, but I could see how it might present a problem at times because the servers don't work in teams of two and if one server gets caught up at one table, other tables might suffer because of a lack of availability. Price for the meal was $350 before tip which was reasonable with the numerous small plates and drinks ordered, but a price point much less than if we were on the Strip. If you're into meat like me, you'd make a wrong assumption that restaurant with a butcher downstairs wouldn't serve you quality product. Your server will be a valuable resource to guide you if you let him or her know your preferences. I will use that resource the next time I'm back, and I won't wait this long again.",4,1,4

We knew that they took no reservations, but coming in at 6pm on a Saturday night (which we thought was early), we didn't expect to have to wait over one and a half hours for our table.  It was chaos up front.  And the hostess was polite, but lacking a sincere warmth.  Good thing we loaded up with wine and tapas next door.  If you detest waiting, come at an odd hour.  If you don't, then be patient to get a table, and even more patient for the food to arrive.  
The restaurant is beautiful... tall ceilings, beautiful meat greeting your appetites at the door, and a masculine but comfy bar to wait, load up and people watch. 
When your table is finally ready, you get whisked upstairs to a gorgeous space that wraps around a whimsical chandelier.  It's one of those great hangouts for a hot date or the whole family because any baby cries would be drowned out by the noise of the crowd.  There is also a well-heated dining balcony area for fans of the outdoors or cigarettes.  
Get to the food woman!  Ok ok, were they worth all the wait?  It was quite divided at our table.  Were the cocktails fabulous?  Yes.  The food was good, but I'm not sure I'd like to wait that long for steak I can get elsewhere without a wait.  Eeep, but that's the truth.  
We did enjoy the food.  We had the portabella mushroom fries with herb aioli (definitely a must-try), the Bibb salad with radicchio blue cheese and balsamic dressing (a great pair up with the meat), the Sea Bass a la Plancha which comes with an olive-oil sauce (nothing else), the lamb chops with a wee bit potatoes and apricots, and finally the rib-eye steak which come with 1 quite bland stuffed mushroom and pretty good potato chips.  
I love how they organized the menu - steaks, salad, small plates divided into price categories.  All of which I am pretty sure will please any palette and wallet.  But my biggest beef with the main entrees is (and I am a petite woman who enjoys sushi) the main meals itself are a little lacking... either in weight or side dish pairings.  Make my meat cuts larger, or give me more substantial sides with my main entrée, and I will be one happy camper... who will still order your small plates.  I promise.  
That night the servers told us they had introduced 20 new items to the menu which were causing delays in the kitchen.  This restaurant is still working out its kinks, but overall, we had a good dining experience.  Definitely try it out and gauge for yourself if it deserves a repeat.",1,1,1

Pick your choice of temperature for the meat and add some sides. It is literally that simple.  This is an easy meal to come and splurge on.  The restaurant is located upstairs while below is the butcher shop.  Everything is elegantly appointed. The restaurant ambiance is almost a feeling of pure elegance along with a family style dinner.

For brunch I usually go for the smoked salmon benedict (and I'm not really a smoked salmon fan but this is amazing)! The short rib hash also never fails to amaze. You can also go with the healthy breakfast option - I think it involves some sort of egg whites and veggies (obviously I haven't ordered this again, not bc it wasn't good but bc I don't want to be healthy at brunch). They also have bottomless mimosas, so how can you go wrong?? 

For dinner, I've had:

Portobello fries (delish)
Tuna poke (good but I wouldn't get it again)
Asparagus with egg (I love both separately so together it was amazing)
Chili cauliflower thing (good if you like cauliflower) 
Salmon (decent - hard to go wrong with salmon)
Some other white fish (good but a bit dry)
Steak (this is supposed to be the star of the show, but if you want steak just go to a steakhouse - I mean its still good and decently priced but if you're there for a legit steak you might be a little disappointed)

Come here for the slabs of meat you can buy, stay for the delicious dishes they serve.  Echo and Rig will have your taste palates running wild like Hulkamania and your stomach bursting like the chestburster from Alien.  

A few of us went on a Friday afternoon.  Our friend's wife's cousin was the Executive Chef at the place.  He wanted to stop by and say hi.  We all followed and thought it would be best we stuff our faces at this place.  

From the outside, you can see the various meats hanging and placed around the freezer room.  It was a sight to see.  When we went inside, the butcher welcomed us with open arms.  Not only was he super friendly, but he was super handsome (just like me).  He kind of looked like James Purefoy (from the t.v. series Rome), but with more facial hair.  Man, I'm probably way off with the look.  Maybe he sort of had a Brad Pitt-esque facial structure.  Wait...why am I talking about him?  Let's talk about meat...no....not his meat, I'm talking about the restaurant meat!

So, James Purefoy (we'll just name the butcher that) led us into the freezer room and schooled us on the different types of meat on each animal, how you can combine each part to make something delicious, and told us some other fun facts.  Did you know Vikings used every single part of the animal?  Thanks for the info, James!

As we left the freezer room, he began to give us a little history lesson about Echo and Rig.  While he dropped some history on us he gave us some samples of headcheese and liver.  It was my first time having these delectable delights.  Actually, I can't say they were delectable before trying them.  The thought of headcheese and liver made me dry heave.  However, I summoned enough courage to try them out and it wasn't bad at all.  The liver tasted a little salty, but I was able to down it no problem.  The headcheese tasted just like ox tail.

After Mr. Purefoy entertained us, we were escorted to the upstairs patio area for lunch.  We were served by the most pleasant waitress I've ever come across.  Kind, gentle, sweet-- just like me on a first date.  

My friend's cousin gave us appetizers on the house.  They were portobello fries and fried cauliflowers.  Man, hmm...hmm!  The sauces that accompanied these fine appetizers were also great.  I've had portobello fries before, but this takes the cake and smashes it in everyone else's face.

For lunch, I got the grilled cheese.  The grilled cheese had short rib, white cheddar and parmesan in it.  My first bite was ecstasy-- the gooey cheese was pure bliss and the short rib was nothing short of fantastic.  If I had 20 hands I'd give this sandwich 20 thumbs up.  And don't get me started on the chips that came with the sandwich.  The freakin' chips, man.  I need to wipe the tears from my face because I'm reminiscing about the good times I had with those chips.  I'll be sure to pour some liquor on the street because I do miss those chips. 

Echo and Rig is the spot for great food and a euphoric atmosphere.  Check the place out because you won't be disappointed.  And I should point this out, just because Mr. Purefoy would want us to:  support your local butcher!!!!",0,1,0

They don't take reservation so be prepared for a little wait. After reviewing the menu, I was glad it was simple and did not offer too many items. You get to choose side dishes, salads, pasta and steak. For the visit, we ordered a kale salad, roasted  pumpkin squash and carrots, a chopped steak salad and the butcher's sausage. 

The pumpkin squash and carrots were amazing. Max said the steak salad was good and the sausage was the best sausage he has ever had in his life so if sausages are your thing then this item is a must try! 

I didn't like the kale salad. There was too much cheese and dressing which made the greens all soggy.

I tell you how, with a comment a good friend said as she was looking at all the meat cuts, WOW,  what a great alternative to WF's!  I can come here order my meat and have a martini while I wait until they cut it up fresh!  That is how I am starting my review of Echo & Rig.  And the patience and care the 23 year old butcher, yup that is not a typo, that took care of her, while in slicing her meat was ...frankly in today's world amazing - that is what I call customer service.

That service does not end there, it only begins there.  Jason and Courtnee  are polite without being pushy, knowing the menu items and making the correct recommendations; friendly but professional, comparable to the 5 star restaurants I have eaten at in Las Vegas - that is the service we received at Echo & Rig, not once, but two nights in a row.  Not to mention Michael , who is just so excited to have the restaurant open - well Michael you are not the only one, we of Vegas and especially Summerlin, cannot be happier, to have a premier, delicious, vivacious, restaurant with great energy opened in our backyard.  Welcome to the neighborhood!

And now for the food -  OMG, delicious.  Fried spinach salad, kale with baby yellow beets, gratin caramelized onion soup with pumpkin squash (I would come back just for that), Portobello fries, Brussels sprouts with pistachio and fresh lemon, black spaghetti with seafood and roasted peppers, Butter fish, Sea Bass, skirt steak, prime rib, caramel salted ice cream and short cake and berries with ice cream.... Yup that and more, not one bad item, not one complaint from me or in two days from the 6 people I ate with.  The people around us ate different items and could not stop complementing them, such as the bone marrow and carne asada.  If you are a meat eating you will love this place, if you are conscious of farm to table eating, you will love this place, if you are a vegetarian, there are plenty of choices.  So let me recap: great atmosphere, great food, amazing service and prices, beyond reasonable.  Least I forget to mention the cocktails; they do know how to make a drink. So what does this mean, you need to go and try Echo & Rig at Tivoli Village, make your reservations , book your parties, bring your friends, stop by for a drink, you are not going to regret it!

I had not been in for dinner before and he did a great job at explaining the different cuts of beef that were offered.  Portobello fries, are a definite must.  They are light and flavorful.  I ordered a seafood dish and was pleasantly surprised by the portion as well as the quality and flavor of my meal.  I had a sea bass with and olive oil dipping sauce.

Our server, the manager, and other staff members were laser-focused on their roles from seating us through thanking us at the end of the evening.  We specifically selected this restaurant because of the no-corkage fee.  
Our waitress was the best of the best I've experienced.  Having been a waiter myself, those extra touches of refilling water glasses without being asked, discrete plate removal, pouring of wine, as well as really knowing the menu all made for an excellent experience.  I would rank the service higher than the best restaurants I've dined at in New York, Chicago, Paris, or London.  
The downside - the ribeye cap was tough.  The tendon structure of the meat made it tough to cut and it was cooked at a true medium rare rather than the medium I ordered.  The flavor was superb as well as each ""little plate"" of side dishes.  
In summary, a 7 on service and a 3.5 on the ribeye.  
This should demonstrate just how important training and execution of service is to any restaurant, whether an IHOP or Michelin-rated establishment.  Service trumps Selection and can balance a dining experience that may be less than perfect.",0,0,0

Refreshing, strong in a good way and it complimented the Octopus I ordered with steak tartar. Get the portobello fries, it's a must. We ordered and split the 12oz bone in rib eye which was amazing with 3 sides of sauces. My favorite was either the onion or bernaise. Hopefully I spelled that right. The valet was weak...

BEGIN RANT

I really hate downgrading my review. Pisses me off!
I still love the food, I still love the drinks. But let me tell you what I dont love.
Calling the manager the day after a meal and explaining that I dont like being made to feel cheap. Stop pushing so much damn food on me. I've been here before, I know your menu, I've TOLD you that. Stop telling me to order 2-3 of everything. I am NOT cheap, and these waiters\/waitresses make you feel like that. 
I got SO turned off the last time I came, I called and complained, was told I'd get a call back, didn't, and said I'm not returning.
Well, my friend had a birthday and I was invited and thought, hey, it's been a while, things have changed....right? WRONG. Same pushy ass service. Like this night when I had to send my steak back. Put me on blast all you want for wanting my steak well done. Whatever. That's how I eat it. So when I say over and over, freakin well done, and you bring me some pink ass steak, I AM PISSED.
I think it's going to be a long while before I return. As much as I love the food, AND I DO, the service is just so offputting, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.

The food is great, the ambiance is beautiful, prime location and excellent customer service. All the staff (for the most part) is attentive, friendly and professional- but Augustine, the busser, really stood out. He went above and beyond and it motivated me to write this review. Out of all of my visits, I remember Lauren and Oscar also- they are amazing servers. I highly recommend their brunch: Short Rib Hash, Breakfast Sandwich, bottomless mimosas (and you get to pour the amount of champagne vs orange juice which I loooove!)

For dinner, the lasagna is really good, Portobello Mushroom fries are a must, all the steaks are incredible and you can grab your own cuts of meat to cook at home  at the butcher shop on the 1st floor. I also enjoy the corn and Mac & cheese for sides. 

All of the cocktails are yummy but I'm personally a fan of their Bourbon Cassowary cocktail- it's very booze forward. Whether it's brunch or dinner, you will definitely be impressed!",2,0,0

Such an awesome place with a light and airy flare. I love natural light that floods into a space. It brightens my whole day! My best friend and went to Tivoli Village in search of quick drinks and light appetizers: HAPPY HOUR! Since we were on a time crunch we decided to to take advantage of happy hour at as many places as we can. Luckily this place started their happy hour at 3! 

We sat at the couches, with fluffy pillows, right by the bar. They offered draft beers for $3, wells for $4, and wines for $5. Unfortunately they only had three items to choose for appetizers: steak and eggs, shrimp cocktail, and a hot dog (pics included). 
 
As a vegetarian, the only item I can order was the shrimp cocktail (see pictures). My friend is a foodie, so she ordered all three.  The shrimp cocktail was original and nothing out of the ordinary. It was served on a plate of lettuce. I only wished it was different type of green, such as spinach or kale. The lettuce made the dish too simple and uninspiring. My friend said the steak and eggs were good, but since she is a RAW eater, she was disappointed that the steak only comes medium rare. The hot dog was... Well, just a hot dog. 

For drinks I had the white wine from Argentina, which I loved. My friend had the red, but I apologize for not remembering the type. Both were great for the price though!

Overall the experience was fantastic. The staff was more than accommodating and I will return, but only for the drinks. Stop by if you are in the area and just want a  drink for happy hour without food (its much more peaceful so you can have conversations with friends\/colleagues without the restaurant noise). Although they offered the full menu with happy hour, I didn't order full meals, so I cannot review the restaurant as a whole.",1,2,1

Unfortunately I can only give a limited review after only one visit.  There are a large variety of starter dishes served like tapas ranging from $5 to $10.  I ordered the bacon, pork belly and octopus.  All good but the pork belly over grits was amazing.  The menu lists a variety of non traditioinal steak house cuts such as tri-tip, hanger, flat iron, skirt, etc all at very affordable prices $20-$30.  I was excited to try one of these thinking how wonderful it would be to find a cheaper cut that is well prepared.  Then they tricked me by bringing by a tray of special cuts.  The tomahawk chop was a giant 45 ounce rib-eye with perfect marbling.  I caved and ordered this to share.  This steak was almost 3 inches thick after grilling which is a challenge to cook if you want anything rarer than med-rare.  It was done perfectly and seasoned very lightly.  Meat taste and quality was very good. I appricate the light seasoning as the quality of meat should stand on it's own...add your favorite sauces after the fact.
My only slight complaint is that the chips and stuff mushroom side that comes with every steak was rather unimpressive next to the rest of the food.

So in the end, food was great and I'm not done sampling from their awesome menu. I spent way more than I could have but I was able to make steak and eggs the next 2 days and my dog was happy there was a bone left over as well.

When I walked up to echo and rigs window the first thing I noticed where the pigs hanging from hooks and then there was rack of lamb and strings of sausages. I knew I had to walk in to check it out. Inside, it's a two story restaurant. Rustic looking but really cool none the less. I went to the butcher counter after looking at all the beautiful meats. I asked if they could shave sirloin for cheese steaks. They said absolutely and brought me out two choice cuts of steak to choose from.  I made my selection and it was shaved so beautifully thin.

Started out with the Mache Salad. o-m-g. it was sooo good. consisting of avocado, mache, celery, roasted chicken, and green onions. And only god knows the recipe to this slad dressing. 
then we had a few apps.
Favorite- Burrata, English peas, mint and onions. I will make this my personal goal to replicate this dish. it was so light and fresh. sometimes burrata can me on the oily side, not here! it was perfect fluffy. so delish
fried calamari- i only had a few bites because of my gluten issue but wow these were amazing. 
grilled shrimp and scallop ceviche- this was pretty good as well.

for dinner my boyfriend and I each ordered a different steak. I had the filet and he had the Spencer. I must say, the Spencer won. What an amazing cut of meat. After going 2 years without a bite or red meat Im pretty happy i chose this meal to break my no red meat diet. When i saw this piece of beef melts in your mouth.. im serious. Accompanied with their house chips this dish was pretty outstanding. We also had the horseradish creme to go a long with it. YUM! 
And the wine... wow. We had about 6 bottles for the table of the Emblem Cab. This wine went perfect with everything. It was so drinkable.. too drinkable. I highly suggest it.

Im going to keep the ""bad"" short and sweet since the meal itself was so amazing. Jason, our server was a total amateur. My bf and I had to wait to eat anything because he didnt know if there were nuts in anything the table ordered. Since we shared everything family style almost everyone was done with sides\/apps\/salads before we were able to start eating. It was very frustrating. Next time we come in it will probably be to sit at the bar instead. And when I asked to see the manager (because i actually knew him) Jason said he told him to come over. This ended up not true at all. 

Other then that the meal was amazing. I highly recommend this place over any other in Tivoli Village... or Summerlin for that matter.",3,2,4

We were here in March for a worldwide catering convention and had this restaurant recommended by someone. We had 9 people in our party and were sat next to the kitchen and could watch, and hear, all the action on a busy night. 

Don't remember all that was ordered but as chef was announcing the order to the kitchen he stopped and made a comment to the kitchen that this was the perfect order, we all had ordered nothing more than medium rare. 

We started out with the portobello fries and sweetbreads and as a professional chef, with 2 other chefs at the table, they were excellent!  Several at the table had never had sweet breads before and are now huge fans. 

Dinner couldn't have been better with the steaks cooked perfectly and flavored exquisitely.  Well done chef!  

Having been in both the restaurant and catering business for over 25 years I understand the importance of a well trained and enthusiastic wait staff.

The restaurant is located upstairs and the downstairs entry area is pretty cool.  They showcase their fresh and cured meats and the space is very modern and pretty.  They also have an awesome butcher book.

We got seated pretty quickly and there were various people who greeted us.  Everyone is really friendly and nice.  They started us with two free dishes, a quinoie salad and the cauliflower on the vegetable list.  I loved the cauliflower because it was roasted and sweet with a slight spicy kick.  The quinoi salad was fresh but wasn't nearly as good as the cauliflower.  We ordered a bottle of wine, appetizers and entrees.  A lot of my friends got the ribeye cap, the ribeye cut and I was the only one to get the spencer steak.  We also ordered fries, corn, brussel sprouts, mac and cheese and broccolini.  The vegetables and side dishes were good.  Fries were alright, nothing spectacular or special..but I liked the sweet corn, the brussel sprouts (though i've had much better elsewhere) broccolini and mac and cheese.  The dish i was disappointed in the calamari salad.  There were few pieces of squid and the whole plate consisted of fava beans.  It was tart, the squid was chewy, not crispy and wasn't flavorful.  I think its Mediterranean inspired and it doesn't suit my palate.  Really didn't care for it at all.  The mac and cheese was good though.  Not too cheesy but very homey and hearty.

As for the entrees, everyone enjoyed their steak except me.  I had a bite of my friend's ribeye cute and it was very juicy, tender and perfectly cooked.  I think the cut naturally has a lot more fat so its way more flavorful.  I had the spencer cut and it reminds me of a NY cut.  It was much thicker, dryer, and with less flavor.  It was cooked well but I think i prefer a fattier cut of steak.  Each meal came with chips (mehhh) and stuffed mushroom.  Liked the mushroom but would have much prefered mashed potatoes or a vegetable for a side dish than chips.

Service was very attentive, the food took a little while to come but they gave us more chips to apologize...no one touched it.  They also have this amazing hand scrub in the bathroom.  That might have been my favorite part, that and the company.

Being Echo & Rig, I had high expectations for their brunch.  I orderee their poached eggs with smoked salmon but opted for my eggs to be prepared differently.   The eggs came out wrong but my point in bringing this up is because of the way it was handled.   Good greif, you would think it was like a relay race in there.  It was taken care of with such speed and grace.   From the busser to the server, they didnt skip a beat.  My eggs were at my table, on my plate and in my belly on no time flat.  My point is, that NO restaurant can get things right all of the time,  but it's how they recover from it that will keep me coming back.  My husband and I will be entertaining friends from out of town tomorrow.  Normally when we have friends in town, we take them to the strip.  My suggestion to him was that we take them to Echo.

Came here for lunch and there was no wait.  The layout of the restaurant is nice.  Downstairs is the butcher shop area, the reception, and a bar.  Upstairs is the actual dining area where there is indoor and outdoor seating.  I like how it's very spacious and airy upstairs.

The service we got was great.  Our servers were nice and just attentive enough.

Now on to the food.  My friend and I ordered:

Sweet First Cauliflower - Tasty!  Just had the right amount of crunch and saltiness to it.  We really liked how the sliced chilis complimented the cauliflower.

Bone Marrow Asada - A-Ok.  One of the toasts we got was burnt on the end (..BOO! to them for not replacing it).  This was the first time I've had this type of dish before.  I saw the pictures on yelp of others raving about the dish.  But overall it was just OK.. not worth a repeat order.

Black Spaghetti - my main dish.  Not quite what I was expecting.  The broth was a bit too tangy for me.  Pasta itself as well as the seafood (which was shrimp, calamari, and mussels) was not bad.  But I was disappointed overall.  Won't be order this again.

Trenne Pasta - this was my friend's dish.  Much tastier than mine.  I had no clue what trenne pasta is and therefore did not know it was suppose to be a crunchy texture.  I didn't care for the crunchiness of the pasta but I did like the prime rib eye and tuscan black kale that was part of the dish.

Overall - I would go back.  The prices are overall are reasonable.  Staff was nice and the restaurant itself is lovely.  Next time I will order some  kind of steak.  That will be the make it or break it deal of whether or not I will make future repeat visits.",0,0,0

First, it has been a long time since I have received service like we did at E&R. The hostess was very polite and friendly, but at the time I just assumed she was bubbly. Little did I know that the entire staff was going to be that way. Although it was packed, our waiter came over taking drink orders and introducing himself. Water and bread were there immediately. The manager came over, introduced himself, thanked us for coming, and told us to let him know if we needed anything. And the service didn't stop. Suffice it to say the waiter and bus people were as attentive as any, without bothering us--meaning they kept an eye on us to make sure we didn't need anything, and to get it if we did.
For starters, we my wife had baked brie. It was delicious. I had crab cakes. They were good; my wife thought they were some of the best she's had. We also shared an order of Portobello fries--they were addicting. Definitely get them. My wife had the butterfish for her entrée. She thought it was going to be like sea bass, very flaky and buttery, but thought it was much closer to halibut in taste and texture. She enjoyed it, thought it was prepared perfectly, but was expecting something else-not E&R's fault. I had rib-eye cap which was great and cooked perfectly. We also had broccolini--very tasty--and garlic mashed potatoes--just right. For dessert we had ice cream that was as good as any you will have anywhere. 
Finally, the manager returned, thanked us again, gave us his card, and told us to call if we ever need anything. It really felt like an old style Vegas gourmet room where they treat everybody like a high roller. It was awesome.",1,1,1

We went on a Friday night with a reservation for 14 people at 6:30.  They had to seat us at 2 separate tables.  We were seated within 5 minutes of arriving and it was a good 15 minutes before our drink order was taken.  Our server kept coming by our table and saying ""take your time-no hurry"", well we were ready the first time.  Drinks took about 10 minutes once we ordered them and then we had to make the effort to ask for additional drinks that arrived just as slow as the first.  It was about 25 minutes till we received bread and they took our order.  Needless to say we had 8 people at our table and they only brought enough bread for each person to have one VERY SMALL piece and only one VERY SMALL thing of butter.  It took 30 minutes to get our appetizers and we had to request 4 additional bread refills because we were all sitting there starving...plus EACH time I had to ask for additional butter.  25 minutes after our appetizers the main dishes arrived.  My husband's porterhouse was over cooked and had way to much sinew.  I only got a grilled cheese so really no need to comment on that.  However, most meals came with a side of ""garlic chips""...these were homemade, deep fried slices of potatoes with absolutely no taste.  Complete blah with no hint of garlic or any seasoning.  The mushroom served with all meals was plain and stuffed with very dried bread crumbs...  They must have felt bad for making us wait so long for our dinner because they threw in a complimentary deep fried spinach salad...Way to much oil on that!  Ooops, almost forgot--I ordered a side of Brussel Sprouts which they never brought so I had to request they remove that from my bill.  Over all this dinner dragged on and on and was not relaxing nor enjoyable.  Only great or memorable thing was my husband's drink- Kentucky Peachtree, VERY good!",0,0,0

He explained the menu, gushed over the birthday girl, and made sure we ordered the perfect amount of food. The manager came over and greeted our table.

They have contact information to make reservations ahead of time on their website, but I wanted to try my new app, and it worked successfully! The restaurant had our reservation with no hiccups. 
We had gotten there about 15 minutes earlier than the reservation time 'cause I figured there'd still be a night crowd on a Sunday, and I had read previous Yelp reviews about patrons still having to wait even though reservations were made. Anyway... We get there, and I was right. There were 2 large groups and a few couples already waiting at the hostess' podium. I think I overheard someone say that she was helping another group settle in, but no biggie. She was nice and chatted it up with us when showing us to our table, and it only took us about 10 minutes to get to our table after checking in. In that time frame, the boyfriend got to look around the butcher shop which he found cool and unique for a Vegas restaurant. 
Shortly after being seated, the manager, Lisa, introduced herself and wished my boyfriend a ""happy birthday."" That was quite thoughtful of her. Also noticed that she checked on other patrons throughout the night as well. Now that was impressive for a manager 'cause I rarely see that. Our server Ramon and his assistant was just as friendly and helpful\/knowledgeable when it came to answering my boyfriend's questions about the menu. They checked on us repeatedly throughout the meal, making sure we were happy with the food and drinks, etc. I didn't think they'd do anything else beside wishing him a ""happy birthday,"" but they brought us ice cream with a birthday candle to share. LOL. No wonder Ramon's assistant conveniently forgot to bring us a dessert menu. Thank goodness they don't sing to their patrons! That would've been mortifying! XD Onto actual food and drinks... 
We had ordered the Lamb Cigars & Tzatziki Sauce that is extremely yummy, especially with the sauce, but really potent when you mix in the pickled onions(?). Then comes the Portobello Fries & Herb Aioli -  breading gives it enough crunch to match the texture of the Portobello and the sauce pairs so well! He couldn't stop eating those, and he was hesitant at first. There was also Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes & White Cheddar - wanted more of that, but the boyfriend limited what he shared with me. We both ordered the Rib-eye, cooked differently, and the chefs had made 'em right! Love the char on it, but I love how tender the meat was overall. I didn't really have to struggle cutting through it (that night or as leftovers). Oh my gah... The Salted Caramel Ice Cream they brought out with a candle was amazing! It wasn't overly sweet, and I love the candied peanuts it was topped with. I'm not really a fan of caramel, but that was an impressive find! 
After dinner, they didn't rush us to leave or make us feel guilty for taking our time talking more, which I like and appreciate. The cool ending was that the manager wished us a good night and hoped to see us for another celebration. Not gonna lie, but I'm seriously contemplating it for sooner rather than later.

There are no appetizers, I would greatly recomend to add that to the menu...we ended up starting with some orders of sides, the cigars are awsome! 

The only reason this is not a 1 star is the owner of the place seems to be a very nice man, came and sat in our table and told us a little about him and the place. Second, the prices are fairly reasonable.

I came with a couple girlfriends for brunch on a Sunday morning. The hostess informs us the dining room is booked for a special event, but that we could dine in the bar area. No problem - I was there for the delicious drunken goat I devoured months before. 

Long story short, avoid dining at the bar because you will be IGNORED, unless you are sitting at the actual bar affront the bartenders. After we finally ordered our drinks, it took so long to come out - how hard is it to get a diet coke and a couple waters when the bar is RIGHT THERE? Next, it took over 25 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered - it was just a couple drunken goat sandwiches and some poached eggs for veggies. While waiting, we were not offered bread, nor refills drink refills. Wth...

Then the food finally arrives. The sandwiches were soggy :( After raving all morning about the deliciousness that was the drunken goat, what arrived were thicker layers of semi-toasted bread that became soggy from sitting out too long.... sighhh.

At first, the lady who welcomed us gave a bad impression. She didn't write my last name correctly. I don't really mind, but if it's a nice restaurant, they usually address you with your last name. She told me it did NOT matter, but she wrote it on another paper. She wrote it incorrectly, again. 

The ambience was perfect. Fancy, yet not too fancy to stop you from getting a good steak in jeans or in my case, scrubs! 

When we were seated, the manager, Lisa, promptly asked how to pronounce my name correctly. Again, murdered my name. Anyhow, they serve flat or sparkling water complimentary. My friend and I wanted sparkling water. It took a while for us to order but Lucas, our main server, was very patient explaining the differences of each cut. 

For sides, we ordered portobello fries, grilled octopus with green olives and beans, roasted garlic mashed potatoes. Lucas suggested he serve the portobello fries and grilled octopus first. My friend and I were awestruck. Where have we been before Echo and Rig? The grilled octopus was tender and cooked perfectly. The vinegary sauce matches the saltiness of the octopus, green olives and the crunch and freshness of celery. Portobello fries was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and paired with an excellent herb aioli! 

My friend and I got the grass fed wagyu medium rare. Lucas made some arrangements for us to taste all sauces. There is a free mushroom rockefeller and freshly made crispy potato chips that came with our steak. The steak was cooked on point! It is good on its own, but my favorite sauces are horseradish, blue cheese and brandied mushroom for a creamier side. The charred onion was my fave for the non creamy side. 
Ari, another server, helped us out when Lucas was in another table. He was very friendly and took the time to get to know us. 
Got caramel turtle for dessert. Everything was made in house so basically it is outstanding. We also wanted coffee after. We got cappuccino. The froth complements the sweet espresso.

When you come in, you are struck by the Butcher shop to your right and the bar area to your left. Both very attractive. We were led upstairs to the patio area. This was an unusual night for Vegas because it wasn't too hot or too cold and it wasn't windy - a perfect night to eat outdoors. The tables were very nicely spaced so you didn't have to hear the conversation of your neighbors. My wife and I decided to share the black spaghetti and a rib eye steak. Because of the rave reviews for their Portabello fries, we decided to give them a try as well. Our waiter let us know the steak would take some time. Not a problem. We told him to bring out the spaghetti first and the steak when it was ready. We waited a pretty long time. The steak came out first, then the spaghetti. The fries came out last. We asked for the steak to be pink in the center. It came out way too well done. We sent it back. It came back a second tome. Again way too well done. However, we decided not to send it back again. Despite being cooked too well for our tastes, the meat was delicious with an excellent rub. Our waiter never did ask us if we wanted one of the sauces available. I only realized it when I heard him offer it to the folks at the next table who were ordering the same steak. Don't get me wrong. The steak was delicious and didn't need a sauce. But it would have been nice to be asked.
The black spaghetti was incredible. This was cooked to perfection. There was a good amount of seafood mixed in (mussels, calamari, and more). All in all, one of the best pasta dishes I've eaten. And the portabello fries were incredible. The reviewers who recommended them did not lie. It is worth eating here just for the fries. 
At the end of the meal, the manager came out and apologized for the confusion on the meat preparation. We explained that while we prefer our meat much rarer than the way it was served (ie pink throughout), we did eat it and enjoy it. However, he insisted on taking it off the bill.
Overall, a very good dining experience. I will return when I am in the neighborhood looking for a good steak meal (or a good pasta dish). If it weren't for the errors on the preparation of the meat, this would have been a 5 star review.",1,0,1

See http:\/\/echoandrig.com\/history\/ for info behind the restaurant.  In short, a well known chef re-invented the steakhouse by making it light and airy; providing great steaks at a good value and topping this off with excellent service.  As our server stated you don't need to mortgage your house to purchase a steak. 

I really like steaks cooked over a wood grille.  Here they cook over red oak.  Cooking over wood adds a nice flavor.  Wood cooking can be a bit harder in the kitchen because the grille can have wide temperature swings.  Echo and Rig nailed the cooking and delivery.

Many steaks are what they call Natural prime where beef is fed natural grass and finished with grains to create prime marbling.

On top of this you have two ways to purchase steak: 1) from the menu or 2) a larger shareable piece from the butcher tray.  The larger pieces are priced by high the ounce.

Service at Echo and Rig really stood out which started with excellent staff communication.  The hostess found out it was our first time and where we were from.  Magically, our server then asked us why we came from our home town to Summerlin Nevada.  Before the evening was over the manager stopped by to talk and give us his card.  He promised to give us another special evening when we came back which he did.  

So all was present to give Echo and Rig a five istar rating.  We will be back when our travels take us to Las Vegas.

We haven't found one downtown that was exceptionally good or worth the high Strip prices. Echo and Rig fills the bill for us. Quality was very good, prices were in line with what they should be, service was good to excellent. One thing that impressed both my wife and I was the appearance of the wait staff. Traditional black pants, white shirts and whlte aprons....but neat, clean, well-groomed. Polished shoes, even! You know how it is in most places......billboard style tattoos, no shave for 2 days, generally sloppy look, etc. like no one cares as long as the prices qualifies for a bigger tip. There was almost a military crispness among the staff. Kudos to management.
   Menu was fairly complete.......limited, but not in a bad way. I had wild mushroom soup and shrimp\/artichoke \/lemon butter capers. Very good! Wife had fried portobello mushrooms and a steak. also excellent. No room for dessert and some of the steak will be tomorrow's lunch.
  Will we go back? Of course. One of the floor manager""s thanked us as we were leaving, (Kevin) and asked if we ever needed anything special, to call ahead. He even gave us his home phone number. Quality service and dining experience at respectable prices. (Probably one third lower prices than downtown) We weren't expecting the reasonable price, but it is a bonus with the quality of food and service.",0,0,0

At 5:30 apparently there was no wait, but when we arrived at 6:30 it was 30 min, not bad on a Saturday. The host crew was friendly and professional. Upon being seated our waiter promptly introduced himself. Bread water, sparkling and still, were served complimentary. Our group experienced a bit of confusion with the menu; what appeared to be sides, the waiter referred to as appetizers and as tapas. The one knock, our waiter seemed to be pushing for the up-sale. He seemed annoyed that we didn't order from the bar and pushed hard for the larger steaks. Some of their steaks were absolutely massive. ""Sorry bud, we just ate a late lunch a couple hours ago and were out with the kids so no alcohol, nothing to get annoyed about."" We were seated next to the kitchen, lots of energy. In our case it was entertainment, but if you want relaxing request a table away from the kitchen. Our waiter didn't make frequent stops at our table, think we saw him a total of four times including the check. If you are reading this review do decide of you want to go here, I wouldn't let my mediocre service experience stop you. I'm sure it was a fluke as the rest of the staff seemed overly helpful.

The food here is simply amazing! We ordered the steak tartare and onion soup with gruyere for our appetizers and the filet and spencer steak for our entrees. The tartare was the best I've had, with the right combination of salt and spices (green chilis cut up) and the soup was simple but extremely flavorful. 

Now to the steaks. The medium filet was melt in your mouth quality and char was all the flavor you needed. The Spencer's was equally juicy with a different flavor all together. Both cuts were accompanied with gourmet sauces, that you honestly didn't need due to the natural flavors of the cuts themselves. Wound up using the sauce with the garlic potato crisps they where served with. 

The entire meal put a smile on our faces and my wife was extremely pleased with this selection for her birthday dinner destination. 

To top it off our server Ari was top notch. He was very attentive and obviously knew his stuff. My wife and I were very impressed with his professionalism as well as his ability to be helpful with our questions. It's not often we review servers by name, but Ari you are the man, thanks for making our trip memorable, we appreciate it!

Lastly, the prices there are very good for the quality of their food. Other places that charge more should learn a lesson from Echo and Rig. Well done guys, well done. You don't have to charge an arm and a leg to appear to be a 5 star steakhouse, just serve great food, your customers will do the rest. We'll be back here for sure.",0,0,0

I told them about this great restaurant and took them here. I was furious at my server that day.  This was on the 7th of November and we had a 5:15pm reservation. The manager came and greeted us and introduced the staff and our server.  Our main server who took our initial order never came back to see us after we ordered our food.  We only saw the other servers assigned to our table.  What angered me the most were these: 
1. our main server was annoying (and that is saying a lot since he spent very little time with us), telling me to order more food because it was not going to be enough.  Asked me to order another steak because from his experience this is not enough food.  News for you buddy, we didn't come here to order based on your experience, we like to dine however we prefer to dine, which in our case, if we need more food we will order more. His ""experience"" was total crap coz we had a lot of leftovers, glad I didn't order more than the sides for dinner. If he were a little more observant, our party of 8 comprised of 6 seniors, which ""experience"" will tell you they don't eat much and probably have dietary restrictions but they were there to spend time with family and enjoy some food while doing that.
2.  he never came back to us when I didn't order more, then he served more appetizers we did not order nor asked for.
3.  When we asked for 1 bottle of wine, he set down two bottles on our table.  We asked them to take away the extra one but he said to leave it on the table just in case. I told the server not to open the other one unless my parents wanted, which by the way they didn't want, but since they thought I ordered two bottles they drank it all. 2 out of 8 people drank the last bottle of wine.  
4. WHERE IS MY SERVER? After 1 hour of talking and eating appetizers we were wondering where is our steak?  I had to call someone to bring out steak. Guess what? IT WAS ALREADY READY but was never brought out. I asked the server, who was not the main server who took our order, ""WHY didn't you bring the steak out?"" he answered "" You were still eating the appetizers and we were waiting for you to finish them"". I thought to myself ""Is he *#$%ing kidding me?""  I am at at a restaurant to eat and how the #uck should I know when the kitchen is done preparing two 34 oz T-bone steaks unless they bring it out? When I asked them to serve it already they said they were going to heat it up again (HEAT UP AGAIN?! It's like telling me, oh wait let me microwave your food for you so it comes out as if it's freshly cooked) but it ended up charred and my wife couldn't eat any of it without gagging.  NEXT TIME, pay attention to the table because we were done with our appetizers within the first 15 mins they brought them out. Everyone was grazing on whatever is left (which was a lot still, but you can tell people were just talking and were really DONE) while waiting for the steaks. AND had they not served the extra appetizers we didn't order, then they wouldn't think that we were still finishing our appetizers!
5. Do you guys train your servers to upsell on the table? And when they don't take you up your offer, do it anyway coz they won't say no once the food is on the table?  Serve extra food we didn't ask for and sneak it in the bill? SHADY!!!
This night was absolutely the worst Echo and Rig experience for me and embarrassing in front of my parents and their friends.  I probably won't go back for a while. This is BS because I had to leave early since my pregnant wife was starting to get nauseous, but I am sure my parents still paid 20% tip on this BS bill.  I am actually surprised how different my experience was compared to my first visit (maybe because we ordered the top of the line, most expensive steak that time?).  How can you tell when a restaurant is not confident about their own food? When it is a tad saltier than normal.  That night was extremely salty on every order including the burnt steak.  

I don't recommend the almost bald little heavy set server with short hair (the MIA main server).  He is a little loud when he talks and likes listen to his own voice.  He didn't like it when I cut him off because I didn't want to waste his time since I knew what we wanted. Please train your employees better.  Next time I visit (just to see if there is any improvement) and this happens again, I will yell at the server. 

THIS IS WHY I HATE THE TIPPING CULTURE.  IT'S STUPID AND IT SHOULD BE BUILT INTO THE PRICE SO THE RESTAURANT WILL BE MORE LIABLE FOR EACH SERVER'S ACTION AND THE REPUTATION YOU ESTABLISH WHEN YOU HAVE TERRIBLE SERVERS.",2,2,1

Let's back up and start at the beginning.
From the time you enter Echo & Rig, you know you are in for a unique experience.  There's the cute little bar tucked off to the left.  The white staircase which must have heaven at the top.  The cute group of hostesses in their all black attire.  And then there's the meat.  That's right.  A full butcher shop with big, beautiful hunks of meat pornographically on display.  Meat-centric heaven. 

We went with friends on a Saturday night at 7 and arrived a little early, expecting a wait.  No need, a table was ready for us and when our friends arrived, we were quickly taken to the upper echelon where the real deal happens.  The overall vibe of the restaurant's upstairs is that of a very inviting, rich person's dining room (No travertine decking out my house!).  The lighting is low and warm, but not so low that you need a flashlight to read the menu.  I am also a fan of open kitchens and really like how it is set back enough that the noise from the kitchen doesn't take over the dining room.  

Now for the stars of the evening.  We took the advice of Yelpers and ordered the Portobello fries although I was a little unsure.  Don't question it.  That crispy, fried goodness is delicious and unlike anything I've ever had.  We also started with:

Fried Spinach Salad - One of my favorites.  Just the right amount of oil and the crunch of the cauliflower is bomb
Kale Salad
Caesar Salad
Fried Oyster Sliders (2 orders) (Didn't try because fried oysters are not for me)
Small charcuterie plate - this was a last minute addition by my boyfriend who knows all too well that there's not really anything I like more than a beautiful plate of meat, cheese and accoutrements.  I have insanely high standards and Echo & Rig's plate exceeded them.  Fresh prosciutto and salami, two housemade pates, sour gherkins, whole grain mustard, some sliced turkey and toast points.  I literally had to force myself not to eat the whole thing, knowing a bomb diggity steak was in my future.   

My friend and I both had the Spencer Steak which was recommended by our server and our other halves both had the New York Strip.  I really liked my steak, but be aware that the char on the outside of the steak may require you go a little more raw than you normally would.  My medium rare was a little too done but now I know to order rare.  It was still an incredible cut of meat and I really enjoyed it.  You get a steak sauce of your choice and I went with the horseradish cream.  

As everyone has said, there's no corkage fee at Echo & Rig.  I hope they continue this practice, although I know it has to be difficult to make money doing so.  We brought a few bottles of wine for dinner and then ended the night with some espresso and coffees.  The manager visited our table and all around, the wait staff was just fantastic.  Finally, a dining denizen that I can love in the snooze fest that is Summerlin cuisine.  Echo & Rig, don't do me like Rosemary's.  Don't you ever go away.",6,2,3

But yesterday, I decided to go to their Happy Hour. I had heard about the great specials, especially the $1.99 Steak & Eggs and Shrimp Cocktail. 

While there were 2 bartenders, one of them seemed to be designated to getting the drinks for the waitstaff. While the other was strictly serving sitting at the bar. My boyfriend and I were 2 of maybe 6 people sitting at the bar. Not ONCE did the bartender ask me if I wanted another drink, while my empty glass sat there. And each time I tried to get his attention, he must have been in his own world and seemingly ignored me. He also carried on all his conversation with younger bus boy behind the bar with him, who hovered waiting to grab your empty plates\/drinks before you were even done.

I do enjoy the food, but the service at the bar left me with mixed feelings. I think most people would agree who enjoy sitting at a bar over a table in the dining room, that a friendly attentive bartender can truly make your experience great.

This last time coming to Echo & rig I decided to have dinner by myself. I came in late in the evening without a reservation and was sat promptly on the outdoor patio which is exactly where I wanted to be. I had a lovely View and my servers name was Dylan, and he was incredible. I was greeted promptly by the manager on duty whom I can't remember his name right now but we chatted briefly about the weather and my water was filled and I looked over the menu. I am extremely allergic to butter milk and cheese all the good stuff and Dylan walked me through the menu thoroughly and helped me make a few choices that I was super pleased with. Usually I'm faced with compromising a good meal because of my diet restrictions but the server was so nice and explained each dish even though he was quite busy with other tables he took his time and helped me without being irritated which is usually the reaction I get. I ordered the watermelon salad which was incredible and actually has yellow watermelon. It's delicious whether you have an allergy or not. I also ordered the signature steak which on the side comes with a stuffed mushroom. Staring at my steak and the demi glaze I was allowed to eat, Dylan came over to me and I looked at him and we shared this thought of yeah I can't eat this. He told me that he told them to leave it off the plate but it was fine because he caught it in time before I ended up eating it. I never had a steak here and always wanted to try it since that's what they are known for. I will say it was not the best steak I've ever had but it definitely was one of the best services. I ended up sitting there for a good 20 minutes more enjoying the eclectic music playlist the cooler weather and a cup of decaf coffee. The environment is very friendly and relaxed and perfect for group outings or a date night or especially a night to  have dinner alone. I will definitely Return To Echo & rig and recommend it to friends and family coming in town who want and ala carte dining experience with Incredible food and incredible service.",2,2,2

For starters, the service is excellent, from the host to the Asst. GM.  The staff is not only friendly, but passionate about their food.  The dishes we selected on our own were good, but the dishes that were recommended to us were exceptional.  Another important attribute, the prices are reasonable for what they produce.  

On to the meal:
The restaurant offers complimentary purified still or sparkling water.  This is a nice touch, one I wish more restaurants would adopt.

Portobello Fries & Herb Aioli
They call this one of their signature dishes and it was the first item that was recommended to us.  We were not let down, the fries were delicious. They're not too greasy\/heavy and the aioli is a perfect accompaniment.  

Steak Tartare
I love a good steak tartare and Echo and Rig deliver a great version.  The dish is well balanced and the toasted bread is a good vessel to deliver the meat with just the right amount of crunch.  The caper\/beef combo is so delicious.  

Brussels Sprouts, Pistachio & Fresh Lemon
This was probably the most basic item we ordered, but that in no way is a criticism.  In comparison to other dishes, the flavors were simple, which I often welcome in a vegetable dish.  Great crisp in the leaves, just the right amount of citrus.

Fried Spinach
We were about to order the Arugula Salad, but knowing we were open to recommendations, the server steered us towards the Fried Spinach.  This is one of my favorite dishes of the night.  Flash frying the spinach, gave it a kale-chip like texture.   Throw in the chile-lime vinaigrette and thinly-sliced red onions and you have harmony on a plate.  The vinaigrette was almost sweet, but just the right amount to play off the spinach and onions.  Bravo.

Cauliflower, Chili de Arbol, Crispy Shallots & Onions
Another impressive and inventive dish.  The cauliflower almost tasted candied.  There were so many layers of flavor and texture, I'm not sure I can do a technical description any justice.  

The Spencer Steak
This was an excellent cut of meat.  Cooked to perfection, the steak was tender and smokey (they say their steaks are cooked over red oak).  We sampled three of the steak sauces - Charred Onion, Red Wine Demi and Brandied Mushroom, which I liked in that order.  I didn't always taste the garlic in their garlic-chips, but they were tasty nonetheless. The mushroom Rockefeller was so good.  

DESSERT - Caramel Turtle
Another staff pick, the salted-caramel sundae topped with peanut brittle, whipped cream, bourbon sauce, etc. was quite good.  Their dessert menu is entirely sundaes or an option for seasonal berries and sorbet.  


On top of everything, the restaurant contains a full bar and wait for it...  a butcher shop!  I don't know about you, but this is exciting for me.  It's a very smart concept and one that surely adds to the culture of the restaurant.  On my next visit, I'll likely take home some cuts of meat and WOOD (assuming it's red oak), for my home BBQ.  

I look forward to returning to try some of the other dishes that I was simply too full to order.",1,0,0

Everyone and everything was great. We couldn't ask for anything more. Well worth the drive,0,0,0

It wasn't cold at all, it was so warm. Now, going to the service, the best ever from the moment we walked in until we left. Our waiter Ari I think that was his name, was awesome.

But regardless a brunch here is a great choice to make worth the amazing options they give you. Also give the grilled bacon a try super tasty and the flavor is mild enough to go with other dishes trotted the ceviche also but it was a bit lackluster to say the least I expected more citrus in the dish. My entree was the NY breakfast sandwich very well put together great flavor profile loved it.  My gf got the rainbow breakfast which she said was very tasty so withe would be a good option for you to try. I would also like to put out a big thank you to Brian Rosenthal the brand ambassador for making us feel so welcome and taking the time to share some stories with us while we waited for our order it made our experience a memorable one.we look forward to our next visit for the dinner service.,0,0,0

On 6\/12\/16, we were served by Nicholas and Julian.  Service was outstanding!  Ice teas and water glasses were always topped off.  Appetizers were amazing - chorizo  (butcher's sausage), ahi poke and grilled octopus. The chorizo was out of this world, we ordered it both nights.  The grilled octopus was served with beans and green olives, so very tasty!   Ahi poke was fresh!!  For our entrees we had the horseradish crusted butterfish and ribeye. Great choices. 

Second night we were served again by Nicholas but his partner was Enrique this time. Again service was perfect!  We enjoyed the chorizo and fried calamari for our appetizers this time. We decided on the tomahawk ribeye and we did not regret it.  Yummy!!!

The restaurant balcony has an sunset view to die for.  If you have a choice, weather permitting, get a table on the balcony.

Both nights we were greeted by the manager, Xavier Dillard.  Xavier was very welcoming and attentive.

We come here pretty often considering a neighborhood steak to go place but recently service has gone worse & worse each time we visit. This place from hostess to server, busser, food runner have no smile whatsoever. Tonight the server name is Sam. The place was very loud as usual when he was taking our order, he stood across the table from me and said I can't hear you. We're 2 pax at 4top I'd think he should stand between us? Or do you expect me to yell at your face? I looked at him for like 2secs waiting for him to come through but no he just stood there. 

Then I can see his not so happy face again when I ordered steak salad as my entrée (I'm 7 months pregnant can't eat too much w small stomach) he didn't even ask how to cook the steak I had to remind him. The food runner dropped the food my mid cooked steak was too raw (I can't eat raw meat throughout the pregnancy) my hubbys ribeye was way too salty. he never asked us once if everything is ok so we couldn't address it. When we were ready for our check he finally showed up! 

Hubby usually tip over 20% , tonight he still tip around 13% (I'd just tip $0) our bill was around $80. When we about to walk out He has the freaking nerve to stop us and asked us about the tips. Wow really? You know your service sucks.He asked if we would like to talk to the manager. We said no we are not here for a comp dinner. There's no need at this point.

Not only are the steaks melt in your mouth delicious the sides are amazing as well. The customer service is off the hook. If you've never been there before they definitely give you all the info on their steaks and what they have. They bring them out on a wooden plank and explain everything to you as far as what stakes they have according to what you like. They are very attentive and are always making sure your glasses are filled and making sure you don't need anything else. My favorite is the filet mignon it melts in your mouth and the flavor is to die for. The garlic mashed potatoes and the mac & cheese and the portobello fries wow... so yummy. I have to say the prices are good compared to some of the other steak houses I've eaten in Vegas. And if it's your birthday not only do they bring you ice cream they bring enough for the whole table.

I had also heard from a few other people that this place was a must-try & I'm glad I finally did! There was so much on their menu that I wanted to try, but it was just impossible to order everything in one sitting. It does get awkward when you're the only one ordering 6 different things and everyone else orders a salad.. so I really had to control myself.

All of their dishes are really unique, but my favorites were: 
Spencer steak -- the seasoning was excellent! And the texture was a perfect medium-rare the way I like it. They give you the option of a variety of sauces (blue cheese, red wine demi, green peppercorn bernaise, charred onion, horseradish, lemon chimichurri) but personally I think that would've taken away from the flavor. The price for the steak was also very reasonable & came with homemade garlic chips and mushroom rockefeller. The garlic chips weren't a big deal to me, but the mushroom rockefeller was goood.

Cauliflower, chili de arbol, crispy shallots & onions -- this was a ""small plate"" (appetizer I'd say) option.. it had this unique flavor that I just can't explain.. crunchy..spicy..sweet.. something you'll definitely have to try if you like cauliflower.. or just a twist on veggies.

Portobello fries with herb aioli -- I've never had anything like this before. This is another very unique dish that is a must-try. 

Some other things I ordered were the fried spinach salad (with red onion, cauliflower, broccoli & chile-lime vinaigrette) and fried calamari (which I find the need to order wherever it is offered). I am a calamari freak but didn't think the calamari here was anything special. The portion size was large though, for a ""small plate."" I've also had fried spinach at another restaurant before and absolutely loved it + the concept. The salad here reminded me of those packaged seaweed snacks you can find at trader joes\/asian markets. That was okay, but I wasn't a huge fan of the chile-lime vinaigrette as it was kind of sweet (not a huge fan of anything too sweet in general.. let alone salad dressings)

If you're looking for an off-strip restaurant, definitely try this place.  I loved sitting on the balcony upstairs\/outside-- the atmosphere was relaxing, and the misters were a perfect addition to the hot weather that we are all used to here.",3,2,3

The meats are obviously the highlight, but the rest of the dishes are done fairly well too. I especially appreciate the small plates setup, as that's how I prefer to order my meals.

BONE MARROW CARNE ASADA: Can we have a moment of silence for this dish? It was a spectacular start to our evening, my only wish is for more. Loved the slight char to the crostini, the marinated red onions added the perfect acidity to cut through the fat.
CAULIFLOWER, Chili de Arbol, Crispy Shallots & Onions: such a great combination of flavors, but the toppings don't really stick to the cauliflower making it a bit difficult to actually enjoy the dish as intended. Advise cooking the cauliflower a bit softer.
BRUSSELS SPROUTS, Pistachio & Fresh Lemon: I love sprouts but didn't care for them in this dish, BF enjoyed them though. Seemed under seasoned to me.
Texas Slow-Smoked BRISKET, white grits & braised greens: thick-cut, smoked to deliciousness, brisket with a delightful barbecue sauce and some really great parmesan and garlic grits. Really enjoyed the kale and onions. Would order again! 
CARAMEL TURTLE sundae: salted caramel ice cream topped with peanut brittle pieces, bourbon sauce, bittersweet chocolate chunks, and whipped cream. An upscale take on a classic chocolate-and-caramel ice cream treat, beyond indulgent to begin with and also an enormous portion. Loved the texture that the brittle added.

Service was on point, starting with an introduction by the owner and continuing with Luke throughout the evening. Sat on the heated balcony with a great view of the Tivoli Village fountain and the full moon in the sky, classy and romantic ambiance.

When you come thru the door, the first impression you get is the culture of happiness that permeates the staff. It's like the Zappo's of steakhouses. From the hostesses to the servers and chefs, everyone exudes such pleasantness and just an excitement to be in the building. My party of 8 (which was supposed to be 14 which they accommodated with a great table by the open kitchen) was seated quickly and the server Sam greeted us with a broad smile. A litany of amazing appetizers followed (pictures to follow) and Kevin the runner kept our sparkling and still water glasses full the entire night. The chef, Ben stopped by the table and greeted us, inquiring about the food and how we enjoyed it. THEN, a lovely woman greeted us from the kitchen, informing us she was our griller for the evening. Jeannine was sweet and her smile never left her face! It made me confident I was in for an amazing treat! A tray was brought to the table with two beautiful Tomahawks and a porterhouse to die for, and we chose our steaks. 
Now , at this point, I surveyed the atmosphere in the restaurant and watched the staff, bustling back and forth. Even when they thought no one was observing them, they greeted each other warmly and we're even smiling to themselves! 
The steaks and other entrees arrived and were the picture of perfection. Cooked with almost obsessive precision, there were moments I lost myself and closed my eyes and savored the greatness. Then our desserts were various ice cream creations that were demolished so quickly, I couldn't get pictures! My favorite was the Apple Pie Sundae. 

Overall, the genuineness of the staff, the skill of the chefs and the experience made my birthday dinner a success, I will be repeating and very soon! Where else am I going to find a restaurant with a delicious Viognier and a warmth that isn't overbearing, but simply and obsessively delightful.

Our server had to fix that.
The food: we ordered the sausage of the week (haha!), the portabello fries, the roasted squash with pepitas, slow-cooked brisket, and the spencer steak. Here's what tasted the best: the stuffed mushroom that came with the steak. And I will give them props for making the chicken sausage taste good (we had a LOT of nasty tasteless chicken sausages in Singapore, which tries to cater to the taboos of all religions).
The Spencer steak was ""meh"". It had a nice char, and was cooked to order; but just wasn't that good. Modest beefy taste, and very difficult to cut. It didn't seem that tough; so maybe the steak knife wasn't sharp enough. Don't order the Chimichurri sauce for your steak...it was all oil and had none of the bright taste that a good Chimichurri sauce should!! My husband loves lean brisket that falls apart when you put a fork to it...nope. This was fatty and chewy. Portabello fries were good (esp. the dipping sauce), but I've already learned to make them better at home...and I serve mine HOT. These were not :-( The roasted squash tasted good, but I was surprised they didn't remove the rind, which was tough!   
So...I am taking off a star for service slip-ups, and another for less-than-stellar food. (When you spend $100 at lunch, yeah, it should be stellar. I felt like we were just helping pay their soaring rent at Tivoli; not getting a memorable meal.) But hours later, I decided to take another star off, for using MSG in their food. I have a very specific allergic reaction to MSG (you don't want to know!), and an upscale steakhouse should NOT have to resort to it to add ""savory"" flavor. I don't know whether they have always been over-hyped; or they are on the downslide, but we won't be back. 
Tips: for a delicious inexpensive steak,. try the flatiron steak at any TGI Friday's: beefy, tender, and sides are included. For a truly memorable steakhouse experience, try Andiamo at the D. We have now tried all the upscale steakhouses in town, and that continues to be our favorite.",2,0,0

I have been to Echo & Rig previously and have enjoyed spending my dinners there for special occasions. I've recommended friends and family to try the restaurant out due to it's normally good food and service. A few days ago was my son-in-law's graduation dinner and we decided to celebrate there per his request. We had a reservation for 9:30 PM. We arrived shortly after our reservation, around 9:35pm or so. After checking in, the hostess didn't really explain what was going on. Soon it became 10 pm and we still weren't seated. Why did we bother making a reservation then? When we first came in, they said they wouldn't seat the party until the whole party arrived. Our whole party arrived, and still nothing... Just continued to sit downstairs in the lobby. Then when I came back and check in to see what's the hold up, they said they're waiting for the people sitting at our table to stand up. Why are you giving me the run-around? Just tell me straight off the bat. The restaurant closes at 11 PM and still around 10:10 pm now we are not seated.  I know they're not going to shut down, but we have places to be and don't like to feel rushed and make employees stay after hours to accommodate. We were already starving because the only reservation time they had was 9:30pm. 10:10 pm and we still weren't even seated for dinner yet. The waiter we had was decent. Nothing special. Service was meh. However I didn't quite catch the name of the assistant waiter (he was darked skinned and was refilling our waters)... he did a great job and was very attentive and professional! The manager (?) I'm guessing on duty, came and apologized for the wait and offered fries for the kids but he did not seem sincere. He just seemed like he was doing it by force. He never did come by again to check on the table. I can't help but feel out of place here. I really did feel like I was treated unfairly because of the color of my skin. I really do feel like this place caters to ""white folk"" and if you don't fit within that, you get crappy treatment and service. Won't be coming back or recommending anyone here anymore...",1,1,0

Many thanks to Yelp for helping me to discover this gem. I arranged a group meal for my old college buddies during our recent trip to Las Vegas. I explained this to the woman I made the reservation with (who inquired if this was a special occasion). Upon arrival, we were greeted at our table by the manager who welcomed and thanked us for choosing his restaurant for our college reunion. I must say that this was a very nice personal gesture, and demonstrates an emphasis on a great customer experience. The space is a more modern take on the traditional steakhouse. I've been in many with the traditional dark wood decor and old time character. That's always nice and fun, but Echo & Rig is one of those foodie-centric establishments which understands that sometimes it's best not to have anything to distract one's attention from the meat (like too much decor). The space was clean, elegant, and minimalist. Perhaps it could be called a new take on an old-school steakhouse. I knew it would be outstanding the second I walked in. Just behind the entrance is a butcher counter with a refrigerated case filled with an incredible array of carnivorous pleasures in the form of cured meats and Charcuterie. I'd say that any steakhouse which is also a butcher shop is almost guaranteed to be great. The service was constant, attentive, and well orchestrated (this despite my rowdy compadres). We ordered a wide assortment of their small plates for openers. Each was better than the next. My personal favorites were the Asparagus & Fried Egg and the Bone Marrow Carne Asada. Please note that this is not totally la-la-carte. Each steak is served with a stuffed mushroom cap and their home made potato chips (all delicious). For my entree I chose their ""Spencer Steak."" This was the center eye of a Rib Eye (I'm usually not a Rib Eye kind of guy, but this was absolute perfection in a steak)! There is of course an excellent wine list, and a great selection of mixed drinks to accompany a fine meal. Like me, all seven of my friends were completely thrilled with their meals. Another thrill was when the check arrived. Let's just say that we ate a lot of food. In my opinion, the $$ out of a possible $$$$ for the Yelp price review was right on the money (if you'll pardon the pun). One could easily spend twice as much at almost any other steakhouse in Las Vegas, and probably no be as satisfied as we were. Echo & Rig is located just a few miles away from the main strip. It was nice to get away from the craziness of Las Vegas Boulevard for a while, and was well worth the trip. The folks there go the extra mile for their guests, and the results show.

We ended up at our usual spot-Echo & Rig-for one of our indulgent dinners for the month. We dined and had cocktails, ending on a high note--complimentary dessert--their turtle sundae. 

I tried their rib cap, flat iron, sirloin, and hanger steaks. This was the first go at the bone in ribeye.  Nicholas, our amazong server, helped us choose a great xut. The chef cooked it perfectly, simply seasoned to allow the quality cut to speak for itself. I tried a dip in the peppercorn, charred onion, and red wine sauces, but they are unnecessary with the steak. It's succulent, sexy, and the salty fat crust that turns into a heavenly cracker on the sides of each slice made my eyes roll back in ecstasy with every bite. 

I began a love affair with this restaurant since their doors opened, and continue to return for the surprises in every meal, the quality, the impeccable service, and the fact that what costs 5 bills on the strip is readily available in the neighborhood.

- What happened to the managers?

I think my friend and I waited about 45 minutes for a table for two - late dinner, on a weekend. We sat by the bar and had cocktails while we waited so it wasn't too bad. I was a little annoyed when our table was ready. The hostess came over to tell us but we still had to close out our tab with the bartender. He was quite busy tending to everyone else so we had to wait a bit and the hostess didn't look too happy about that. Oh well. 

We decided to order a bunch of the small plates since we weren't too hungry and neither of us wanted to gorge on giant steaks. We got the bone marrow, Mac n cheese, broccoli, and steak tartare. They came out all at once, and pretty quickly. It ended up being way too much food for the two of us but definitely worth it. Anyways, as we were working our way towards clearing the plates, one of the bussers came over to take an empty plate.... And ended up taking away all our plates! It was extremely awkward because my friend still had her fork in her hand, eating off her personal plate (which he took away). There was probably some miscommunication but the whole thing was a bit awkward. Our server's great personality outweighed the awkward experience. He convinced us to get dessert so we ordered the cappuccino sundae. It was way bigger than I expected and oh so delicious!!

The food was decent enough, even for the price, but the service was horrible. It took over 3 hours to have dinner due to waiting, order issues and having one of the worst waiters you could possibly imagine. But I refrained from ever finishing my review and decided to give them another shot. It took a while, but we came back and chose a Sunday to check out their pretty highly praised brunch.

Right off the bat, things were starting out way better than our first visit, and was quite possibly some of the best service I've ever gotten. We walked in at about 10:30am, the hostess took our name and got us seated in less then 10 minutes. They were able to get us a nice seat on the patio and just moments after being sat down we were greeted by the manager, who knew our names. Shortly after that, our waiter (who also had our names by the way) came to take our drink order. He asked if we'd dined at E&R before, and when we told him only for dinner, he went through the brunch menu and explained some of their most popular items. During our whole brunch, every person who came to our table knew our name and were as friendly as could be. It was very impressive and a complete 180 from prior experience, but then the food came...

As per the waiters suggestion, I ordered one of their signature dishes, the Short Rib Hash. For $15 you get a healthy portion of short rib, finely diced potatoes and veggies, poached eggs and a smoked paprika hollandaise sauce. What made the dish so disappointing was the fact that half of it seemed to have sat under a heater or something for too long. Basically half of the plate was excellent...the short ribs were moist and tender, the potatoes had a nice little crisp to them, and the egg was poached perfectly. Then I got to the other half of the dish. All the meat was dry and crispy, and the egg was way overcooked. It was nearing hard boiled egg, complete with a cooked yoke. For me, those things combined just through the dish way off and was such a major let down compared to the other half I'd just eaten. 

We also ordered a side of their thick cut bacon, which rings in at $8. They bring out a nice stack of grilled bacon served with a side of BBQ dipping sauce. This bacon is definitely thick, and has a nice charred flavor and texture from the grill. It was fatty, tender and even though I'm not a huge BBQ sauce fan, it complimented the overall flavor nicely. It's something I'd definitely order again.

For what Echo & Rig is, their inconsistency issue are crazy. We had a great steak with terrible service once, and then came back to less then stellar food, but impeccable service. Obviously this restaurant is a bit on the ""higher end"", but if you're going to charge $15 for a breakfast hash, you better be able to properly poach an egg. I can only speak for myself, but half a decent dish and a tasty side of bacon certainly isn't going to get me to come back alone. And because we had such a bad experience during dinner, I'm not so sure a 3rd visit for any meal would be a charm.",7,3,4

First, this place allows you to bring one bottle per two people with NO corking fee! I mean if that's not enough then I don't know what is. However, it's not pricey if you want to just buy cocktails. 

Second, the steaks are really affordable. The steak price point is only $30-50. If I order the steak on the menu then I usually always get the filet mignon. It comes with potato chips and stuffed Parmesan mushrooms. You can also order a variety of different sauces to eat with your steak. I usually just eat it plain because the flavor is so good.

Third, you can order specialty steaks. My husband and I usually order the Tomahawk steak and it's seriously the best steak ever. For sides we also love the portobello fries and the bacon for an appetizer. 

Finally, this place has bottomless mimosas on both Saturday and Sunday for only $16! They also have a filet mignon steak scramble that's literally my favorite scramble in all of vegas.

You walk from a curved staircase at the bottom into the eating area located at the top. It's fairly romantic inside at night, and everyone is either dressed fancy or in their casual, yet appropriate Sunday clothes. 

I would suggest this for an intimate date night. 3rd or 4th date, maybe? It's a ""will you be my girl?"" or a ""fancy some dinner after work, dear?"" kinda place. 

Service: 5 - Like I have said many times before, no one knows service like Summerlin does. This place is just excellent. The servers basically treat you like you are the only table they have. He was quick and efficient, except at the end, where he took a while to get us our check. It was just so refreshing to have amazing service for once.

Food: 2 - We ordered the Spencer Steak, The Rib-eye Cap, Calamari, Portobello Fries,  Crab Cake, and Pork Belly. 

I thought my Spencer Steak and Pork Belly was a little dry. The pork was definitely overcooked and a bit hard. I don't know if it was just that day, but I was pretty disappointed..it just wasn't as great as I thought it would be.

4 buck premium vodka cocktails, Hanger 1, yes!

2 buck, steak and egg app. The steak was perfectly seasoned and tender. A bit over cooked for my taste but made me want to return and try the full size version rare. The egg was perfect cooked as well. Really solid app. 

2 buck shrimp cocktail app. Tiny little cutie shrimps tossed in cocktail sauce. I prefer my sauce a bit more spiced with horseradish but it was good. It came on a little bed of good quality salad greens. Over all this was good but I'd probably skip it next time.

1 buck hot dog with in house made sauerkraut. Man, I love me some meat, always skip the bun and this was good. Nice and charred with classic wiener flavor, takes me right back to pigtails and the park. The kraut was solid and the spicy mustard right on the money. I'd order this again for sure.

One of the best valued steakhouses around. Service is always top notch, the hostesses are nice and make small talk while taking you to your seat, and the managers always make a point to stop by and say hello. It's nice to have an establishment pay attention to little details like that. Most servers are pretty awesome, there are a couple who really try to upsell you on different things - we just ask not to be seated in their section. 

We love rib cap, and Echo and Rig is one of the few places that have this cut in town (and for such a great price!!).  We have received our steaks overcooked a couple times, and they are always quick to re-fire a new one and bring it out ASAP (Derrick, one of the managers, even boxed an overcooked one up for us to take home once, talk about superb service). We've only tried the steaks, so I can't say anything about the entrees. You can't go wrong with any of the cuts. The appetizers are generally pretty tasty, too. I love the baked brie in the garlic-butter brushed sourdough. It's perfect with the gooey cheese and tangy fruit compote on the buttery toasted bread. If in the mood for charcuterie, they do have one available and they make all the meats in house. It's not on the dinner menu, so you'll have to ask for it. (I wish they would add some cheese!) 

I'm a sucker for a great Hendricks martini, and I promise you the bartender (I'm sorry I don't know your name) makes one of the best ones in town.  I've been all over looking for a good martini and places like Picasso, SW, Mandarin Bar, Olives, Other Mama etc etc don't even stack up. 

No corkage fee, and we take full advantage. We've even stopped by Total Wine a couple times before dinner to grab a bottle (just call me a lush).  Don't forget to scrub your hands with the divine salt scrub in the restrooms too!

Husband ordered the center piece of a prime rib.  He's a big red meat eater & even though the selection & presentation of the meat was unmatched my most, this steak did not do it for him.  Wasn't anything special & somewhat grainy.   The garlic mashed with cheddar we ordered on the side was room temp - hence we didn't eat much of it.

To the left, behind the host station, is the bar. They didn't have the best selection of scotch but definitely knew what's up in the whiskey and bourbon department. I asked for a Laphroig and they poured a perfect portion of this delicious scotch over the most clear and perfect block of ice I have ever seen. I could see my finger behind the ice, totally kept my ADHD entertained. 

We were seated and immediately greeted by our server Alfius (hope I spelled that right.) Now, if you can't have an amazing experience with him, there is something wrong with YOU. He took our drink order, got a feel of what we were in the mood for and brought over the plank of different steaks for me to choose from. I picked my 41oz tomahawk and my girl got the sea bass. We ordered mashed potatoes, octopus and pork belly as well. 

Everything. Was. Amazing. I was only able to knock out 38 of 41 ounces (with a 2 minute nap in the middle) but I was still proud. 

I forgot to mention that almost immediately after being seated someone came over to fix the wobbly table. It wasn't a problem for us but the staff insisted they fix it. 

The food was amazing. The steak was perfectly cooked and the sides were NOT made with pounds of butter and flavorings to mask the chefs shortcomings. 

5 star service all day and they even recommended a desert for us which was a perfect way to cleanse and cap off the night.

For texture eaters, this place is Divine! The rocker fella consisted of a mushroom stuffed with bacon, crispy crumbs, and some type of filling. It was soft and crispy and crunchy... Yum! My friend shared with me her cheesy garlic mashed potatoes, which were so soft and fluffy (as opposed to the usual starchy rough mashed potatoes at restaurants).

To end, my friend was given her choice of a birthday Sunday, and she chose the caramel turtle ice cream. The ice cream was rich and sweet, filled with candied nut morsels that were absolutely wonderful.

The speed in which we got our food was fast! The attentiveness and teamwork of the staff was very impressive. If a waiter dropped a receipt, the manager immediately noticed and picked it up.  If a waiter didn't get bread to a table in a timely manner, another waiter would notice and tell him or do it for them.  Everyone was friendly, helpful and attentive.  Each time we needed more drink, or finished a plate, there was always someone there filling up our drinks, or taking away dirty dishes.

This was by far the best restaurant we went to in Vegas.  The service was above and beyond, the price of the items were not bad at all, the food was outstanding with such mouth watering flavors and textures!  Overall, the quality of this restaurant was impeccable! The ambience was also nice... Modern decor and such a beautiful, classy, romantic atmosphere.",0,0,0

We were early for our reservation, but they seated us anyway, and the girls up front were so cheerful and upbeat.  The manager Xavier came over to introduce himself---we are not famous, I am an attorney and my husband is an airline captain--and this impressed my husband.  Our waiter Jessie though---STOLE THE SHOW!  Not only was he friendly, energetic and professional---he has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the menu and took the time to inquire if we had any time constraints (show to get to, etc.) before we began.

The drinks were strong but great!  The sea bass was heavenly (I could just eat the skin and be happy), and my husband who never ""cleans"" his plate, did here with the Ribeye.

But the best was at the end of the meal.  Computer issues prevented our check from being issued (along with everyone else in the place).  Yet Xavier took special care to take our information and ensure us he'd get back to us when it was sorted out.  Which is extraordinary when you think he had to do that with 30 tables!

We decided to eat and the first thing you notice is they record you name in a ledger downstairs and then the Server greets you by name (great point 1). The menu is a mixture of so many items you could get dizzy trying to decide which way to go. They had a small but diverse pasta selection (my favorite) and their butcher fresh meats and chicken, fish, sandwich and salad offerings (great point 2). They also have a large selection of ""small"" plate selections and again a lot of choices.
They also on the menu back have a good selection of wines and liquors.
My wife had the grilled cheese\/short rib sandwich selection and on our servers advice the portobello mushroom\/parmesan fries (do not pass those up).
My pasta was served nice and hot very well done and a great bolognese meat sauce. It was a very good selection. My wife's sandwich while a good combination was somewhat greasy for her taste and she picked at half the sandwich. We mentioned this to our server and she apologized for her not liking the entree. She stated she would mention it to the chef for his knowledge (but we have heard that before).
Several minutes later Keith the Manager came over to chat with us about our meal. This was not a casual sorry have a nice day chat but he was concerned about our experience (great point 3). He told us that this selection was a greasy type of combination, but if she didn't like it that was all that mattered. He spoke with us for about 10 minutes and then removed the entree from the bill (great point 4).

It was very hot out that day, and being from a cooler climate, we opted to sit on the patio. So she had other servers come check on us through out the meal. When we went back a couple of days later she came out to talk to us again. Also, their managers and other staff are very friendly and attentive. Any server that came would bring more water or ice if needed, as opposed to a lot of other restaurants where only your server will do anything for your table.

I would recommend all of them. Portion sizes are perfect. You can choose a side salad or chips as a side for the sandwiches. Prices are very reasonable for what you get! 

The bathrooms are quite nice. At the sink they have a scrub that has some oil in it (I think) so it is very moisturizing. It's sold in their store downstairs and is quite pricey, but might be worth it since it smells great and seems to work well.

* Watermelon cucumber salad 5
* Spencer 4.5 cooked perfectly great mushroom sauce
* Caramel ice cream 5

Service 5\/5
To say service is a 5 of possible 5 is an understatement.  The service in this restaurant is leaps and bounds of what one would expect at this price point. During my stays over the last 20 years in Vegas, I have visited dozens of high end expensive restaurants and this is by far the best experience I've had.  Some highlights:

* Everyone was acutely aware it was our first visit - It REALLY mattered to them.
* Communication was high between the wait team and with us as well.
* Full court press was in full swing - everyone was REALLY working to impress
* Teamwork was excellent: waiters working together in a way I hadn't seen before.
* Warm and friendly by everyone.  
* Structured system in kitchen w pass & Quality checks.
* Wait team anticipated needs and was ahead of it before I even asked.
* Energetic everywhere - Lots of synergy in the dining area
* They remembered my special request from my Open Table reservation which most of the time gets forgotten. 
* Manager was very active with handshakes hello and goodbye along with some really nice conversation.

Value 5\/5
Our bill was about $105 which if you are used to the Las Vegas strip is a deal and a half.   I've had way worse experiences for double the price.  That included drinks and dessert.

Cleanliness 5\/5

Restrooms 5\/5
Perfectly clean.  Attractive. Smelled good.

I take my ""5 star"" ratings seriously (as you can see by the spread on my profile) and in this case a 5 is a slam dunk.  All things said, this is probably the best dining experience I've ever had.

The dining room is sleek and modern, but it is very loud because there is no carpeting in the restaurant.  We had a hard time hearing each other across a medium-sized round table.  We ordered a rainbow salad, sauteed spinach, apple and fennel salad, pork belly, bone-in New York Strip (you  pay extra for this), grilled cheese sandwich (has shortrib in it), and a hamburger.  All the small plates were ok - nothing to write home about.  The pork belly was very sweet for our taste.  The hamburger came out cold and was sent back.  The second time it came out, it was overcooked and cold.  The third time it came out, it was good.  That said, our friend did not get the burger until we all had finished our meals.  The waither, however, did bring our friend a cup of mushroom soup to tide him over until the burger was ready. The steak was good, but I felt the meat was oversalted.  The sauces and mushrooms that came with the steak were good.  My brother enjoyed the grilled cheese.  To compensate for the burger problem, that meal was comped, and we got two free desserts - a turtle ice cream sundae and a berry sundae.  Both were quite good.  
Service here is very attentive and friendly.  I think they might have had an off night when we were there.  Overall, I would come back and would try a different dish next time.",1,0,1

The reason it is getting four stars rather than five stars are for two main reasons: the first is that the service needs improvement in terms of how they serve their bottomless mimosas. There is one person that is assigned to pour champagne and he filled everyone's glass as he kept coming around. The problem is that he would pour champagne in your glass without asking if he could pour it into your glass. Some people like a little more juice in their Mimosa so I did not like the fact that somebody kept pouring champagne into my drink without asking me. I'm sure that if we asked, we could get a carafe of champagne to pour ourselves as we please. This should be the standard for this restaurant and not somebody coming around, pouring champagne into your glass without asking first. To me, that is seriously bad service. The second reason for the four stars is that we reserved on OpenTable and got their way earlier than other people, yet we were told that we could not get a table outside because they were already requested? At no point does the restaurant indicate that on OpenTable, nor in all of the times that I have been there which have been plenty. That was not cool to me. The restaurant tried to rectify it by giving us a complimentary serving of avocado toast, which was very nice of them, but we didn't really care for it because we ordered plenty of other food already.
With that being said, we had a wonderful waitress who was just awesome. We ordered the steel cut oatmeal, the salmon with bagel and cream cheese and condiments, and the waffle with berries. It was all delicious.
I will say that I did not order coffee, but I know there was a problem in serving with coffee. One of my friends was pretty frustrated because the person pouring coffee, which was the same person pouring the champagne, kept pouring coffee into her cup without asking first.
Therefore, this is a great place for brunch, yet you want to make sure that if you are ordering a bottomless Mimosa, you are OK with a lot more champagne and a lot less orange juice, due to the way that it was being poured. Secondly, make sure to add notes to your OpenTable reservation or call to request a table on the outside patio.",0,0,0

Echo is about 20 minutes from Vegas and is located in a quaint shopping plaza. You walk in, the butcher is on the right next to their fridge with different charcuteries and patè.

We were seated indoors next to the patio overlooking the square. Upon seating, Xavier, the manager, greeted us and introduced us to Laura. I couldn't be further from home but they made us feel so welcomed. They even brought us a glass of champagne to celebrate the engagement!

Started out with a Caesar salad which was big enough to share and the pork belly with spicy slaw. Pork belly had a nice char on the outside and it just melted in your mouth. It was a nice bite with the crunch of the slaw and the vinegar acidity of the sauce. 

The rib eye was an 8oz cut prepared medium with a blue cheese sauce on the side. Hands down, best steak I've ever had.. Sorry Mom! The salty outside char on this quality of a steak was perfect.

This was our first time actually dining at Echo and Rig. Having purchased from the butcher counter before (it's a great place to get quality meat after exploring the Tivoli Village Farmer's Market!) we knew our expectations would be high for the restaurant itself. 

When my boyfriend made our reservation, he mentioned to the hostess that we would be celebrating our second anniversary. The hostess told us that they would make sure it was a special night for us... And they really, really did. It's not an exaggeration to say that every single person who came to our table -- from the restaurant manager, to our waiter, to the bus boys, to the servers who refilled our drinks and brought out the food, to the guy who lit a candle on our celebratory sundae -- EVERYONE knew that it was our anniversary. We were congratulated at least 10 different times! It was such a nice touch that truly made us feel like VIPs. 

The service was wonderful. Our waiter, Ari, was knowledgable, friendly, and patient. He had some knockout suggestions and a fantastic way with words. Everything he described sounded delectable. It was a wonder we didn't order one of everything. The restaurant manager was lovely, visiting us at the beginning and the end of our meal to ensure we had a nice time. All of the other waitstaff were rockstars too. The only hiccup was that Ari seemed like he was juggling too many tables at the beginning of our visit. My boyfriend wishes we had a bit more interaction with him while we were in the process of exploring the menu\/asking questions, etc. 

The atmosphere was modern and clean, but the music was a bit too loud for my taste. I was hoping for more romantic ambiance -- but that might have just been a bias, since it was our anniversary. 

And now, of course -- THE FOOD! We sampled:

-- grilled thick-cut bacon with homemade BBQ sauce. OMG. If you get NOTHING else, GET THIS! The sauce was fabulous. (Ari said he pours it over ice cream. After tasting it, I can see why!) The bacon was thick, juicy, and oh-so smoky! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

-- sweet fire cauliflower. This wasn't my favorite. It was tasty, for sure, but there were other things on the table that made me happier. 

-- 32 oz tomahawk steak, for two. During the ordering process, Ari brought us out a VERY IMPRESSIVE tray of raw meat. The thing probably weighed 10 pounds! We chose directly from the tray, opting to have our steak cooked medium rare. (Boyfriend likes rare, and I prefer medium... The steak was cooked and then sliced in such a way that I got the more cooked outer slices, while my boyfriend enjoyed the rarer center.) The best part were those outer edges, where the fat got crispy and delicious. One bite, and the fat would just pop and melt in your mouth. Sooooo good. However, I did notice that some bites were rather chewy. Could have been the cut of the meat. This was my first tomahawk! 

-- sauces! We tried charred onion, horseradish cream, brandied mushroom, béarnaise, and red wine demi. All were awesome, but I loved the mushroom and béarnaise best. 

-- garlic potato chips. Duh. What's not to love?! 

-- caramel turtle sundae. Yes to the yes to the yes. Just get it. Salted caramel ice cream, homemade sauce, fresh whipped cream! Ready, GO! 

All in all, it was a great anniversary meal. I'm grateful to the staff at Echo and Rig for making it such a special night. I am sure we will be back!",1,0,1

Mahalos! The best thing about eating with yelpers is its buffet of food samples on table. Yay!! Between the four of us ordered bunch of apps too start just about ran out of room for my pasta course. It would take too long too mention all the apps but the bone marrow app was amazing (loved the fact something that hardly see on any restaurants menu, the bone marrow cooked perfection spread it like butter on the bread came with or straight up bone marrow heaven on spoon), oyster slider (mini po boy), portabello fries (truly all its HYPED too be! It nice crispy on the outside and the aioli comes with its tasty more so order more till the last fries), mac and cheese (another solid solid dish), and forgot order bunch more stuff. Those things stood for me. 

My entree order the bolognese. Honest all the things I tried it was average. I know asked for it not getting STEAK the thing most known or trademark dish. I not in steak mood. The process if you where too order one is pretty interesting. They literally show you the cut of meat that going too cook for you on really nice sliver platter and ALSO literally butchered that day or hell if I know maybe that minute. In the front of the restaurant they have open butcher shop that can see all the cuts of meat. One of the things known for is fact they get in whole carcass and break everything down. No joke it comes too getting fresh cut of meat here at Echo and RIg. Maybe the next time I come in will get my steak onnnn.

The service was good. Although sharing long family style table with another group of four seem odd too me. The hostess told us before and had no problems with the idea. Not sure great way too get repeat customers knowing another party literally on the same table. They had our servers all out of whack thinking which side of the community table does this go too.

It interesting that the restaurant is upstairs but yet the bar is located downstairs\/butcher shop. I love the fact they have little patio area on the first floor and second floor.

We were seated quickly, but ignored after that for about 15 minutes, when the waitress finally came to take our drink orders, she blamed the hostesses for the wait, kind of annoying. My boyfriends ice tea came out pretty quickly, but my glass of wine took forever, so did the water for the table, so I was left without any thing to drink for quite a while. It also took forever for the server to come back and get our order, in fact, the server didn't come back, another person came and took our order, odd but, okay. They finally brought us some bread, which wasnt even warm and was nothing special, but it made no matter because the server took it away before we could finish it, weird! The appetizer of portobello fries was good, probably the best thing we ate, though the portion was quite small, and once again it was taken off the table before we could finish, kind of awkward. The arugula salad was next, and poorly dressed, with whole peppercorns lurking beneath, waiting to bust a tooth, hah. My boyfriend had the horseradish crusted butterfish with roasted veggies. The butterfish was not horseradish crusted nor did it really seem to be butterfish, it was cooked well, but had zero taste. The roasted veggies were still raw and unpleasant to eat. I had a filet, which came out so overcooked some portions of the crust were burned, also, the meat was flavorless. The garlic chips were flavorless, the  stuffed mushrooms garnish was also flavorless. The garlic mashed potatoes were okay, but seemed as though we were served the bottom of the barrel, because they were lumpy and cold. The squash with maple and rosemary was okay, but there were parts that were so overly roasted that they were hard and completely inedible. I was picking pieces out of my mouth. Yuck!

This is after I waited 45 minutes for the dish. 

What this has going for it is very good quality meats. The downside is the INCONSISTENCY. Some of the waiters and bartenders are good, and others horrible. 

Last time I sat down at the bar, hungry and thirsty after a long day, the c*nt bartender ignored me because gossiping with a waitress was more important for her. When a customer comes in, your job is to give them a menu and take a drink order ASAP. Get it?  
This is not a place I would consider for any important date or business dinner again. 
They have a good idea, but execution is clearly a problem here. 

I have a suggestion for management: you are a f*cking steak house. So hire some REAL waiters. Not bimbos based on looks. And get your kitchen in order. Try to be a real steakhouse like Peter Luger etc. You have the potential, and this town needs it.",0,0,0

I've dined here 3 times and each time, everything has been impeccable. My first time was for lunch, and I am surprised the inside was packed during lunch time. But don't let that fool you, they also have a very cozy patio area with heaters if you want to go al fresco. 

On the next 2 occasions, we made reservations because we had a large party of 8 and we were whisked right in. Servers are always very courteous with plenty of recommendations if you ask. In these trips, I have tried a crazy array of their food and all of it is amazing! For appetizers, you HAVE to get the Portobello fries. They are the best fries (potatoes and other vegetables included) that I have ever eaten. I dream about these babies and would come here just to eat 3 orders of fries and leave (don't judge me). 

Other noteworthy mentions include the spinach salad (not healthy, fried spinach, but the texture of it is incredible) and brussel sprouts. Wow. their brussel sprouts are so tasty with each leaf peeled off individually and a lemony tang and crunch from pistachios. They are a must-have to offset all the protein you're about to ingest.

For proteins, we've had the filet, spencer, rib-eye, skirt, brisket, salmon, and butterfish. Each protein is cooked perfectly to your request and the quality of the meats are obvious. There is no chewy stuff you have to cut off and pile onto the side of your plate. Knives cut through everything in one foul stroke. Although the sign of a good steak is not needing to have any condiments, they have the best condiments if you want to shake it up. I personally love the chimichurri and horseradish. Lastly, it was my first time trying butterfish this week from Echo & Rig, and let me tell you that it is my new favorite fish. If you're not in the mood for steak, GET THE BUTTERFISH!!

Their dessert menu is simple with everything being ice cream. I would like more variety, but will not complain because I still love that caramel turtle sundae. If you haven't been in awhile, go back. They have added many new signature items in their menu. If you're a vegetarian, don't be afraid to come here. There are so many vegetarian and vegan options on the menu that you will leave stuffed and happy.

Few cobblestones and a courtyard doesn't  transform it to an Italian Village. There is no eatery that is healthy and ethnic enough to make my visit worthwhile. The shops mostly cater to women and whatever is there for men is overpriced junk or for teenagers on a sled. Having said that, Echo & Rig, is a valid reason to visit. This newest steak house by Chef and owner Sam Marvin (who is busy opening few more steak houses-one more coming to Vegas next year- I was told.) The concept is unique-even for Vegas ! A Butcher and Steak House. Buy your meat and eat it too!

I love a good steak like London Broil and Pepper Steak,  that I used to imbibe in Chicago, but none of the chefs here know to how to cook London broil, not to mention the meat should be extra lean like sirloin beef or knuckle beef with fat less than 5% as opposed to a porter house steak that is close to 50% fat. Not only the steak houses don't have that kind of lean meat but there is no butcher on the premises. 

At Echo & Rig. the meat is displayed on your right as you walk in glassed freezer-the biggest walk in freezer-at a temperature of 32 degrees at all times and you can order knuckle steak or burger or sirloin steak.  Next to the freezer is the biggest solid butcher block (on a broad day light when no one is looking I intend to take this to my kitchen.) 

You can also get Wagyu beef from Wyoming or Kobe beef  from Kobe, Japan. The beef is from grass fed cows with no steroids or antibiotics and the sirloin cut of meat (which is on display but not the knuckle beef, which has to be ordered 24 hrs before the cooking time) can be cooked as steak or burger..

The Master Butcher, by the name of Trevor, is lean and healthy looking and  conscious of nutrition, unlike most of the chefs who are ruddy faced and rotund  like Orson Wells or Hitchcock (by the way Alfred Hitchcock, who liked to be called Hitch, was a prolific eater and he believed that a good eater also had a good libido and imported meat, lamb and Dover sole from England and claimed he served the best steak in in LA at his own house.) They serve what ever people ask for and choose. The steak starts at $22.50 but this kind of meat in some gourmet houses are selling at three or four times the price and few of the chefs serving raw meat from unknown butcher.

The Echo and Rig is located in the circle where the fountain is, with the valet parked cars around the fountain (generally speaking, valet's are first cousins of Mario Fittipaldi and they have racing streak in them. They park my car at 45 miles an hour. I saw a valet in LA changing tires at 60 miles an hour. The seat and mirror are adjusted to a midget driver.) This is one complimentary gesture that  I will not make use of.

There are two patios, one on the ground floor facing the Alta Drive and the other on the second floor facing the fountains, which is perfect for private parties. The ambiance is good but there is lot of wasted space.and the one mini bar with waitresses carrying full glasses of wine up the stairs-is a disaster to happen. The bar only serve draft beer and I was not a happy camper, since they have no beer mugs or tall frosted beer glasses (one downgrade) the glasses are the kind you find in a biker bars or bars on main street or the English pubs.

However, they do have half \/ full glass of wine which is a great idea and they are reasonably priced, On my next visit better the red wine be chilled (and not Las Vegas room temperature of 120 degrees, as the master Somme-liars! tell them to serve) If not I will downgrade another point. The also sell organic beef jerky, cast iron skillet and other items.

There is no Theme here, with antlers head poking out of the wall or mahogany wood or some gimmick to make it look like it is inhabited by macho men or men with fat cigars and fake display of wealth with borrowed BMW's. Good healthy steak is the Theme. Better the other steak houses follow the theme and pricing or they will be extinct..along with the antlers head !",3,2,1

It's a comfortable place, to be sure. Inside is a bit more sedate, but still has a pulse. Outdoors, on the 2d Floor patio, is refreshing and luxurious - and also considerably louder with the music pumping. Our server was a pro: He offered guidance and encouraged ordering all at once to avoid interruptions to us. I can appreciate how that can help the flow for the kitchen and everyone, really, but it seem slightly disingenuous. Our party was catching up and a few beats behind that sort of pace: we needed a moment. The only other thing that felt a bit awkward is how much the appetizers were over-ordered. The irony is, I think the appetizers were the most interesting dishes we were served. I just think we had twice what we needed.

The portobello fries are wonderful. I wasn't crazy about the accompanying sauce, Herb Aioli, mostly because it didn't improve an already clear winner. We had several pair of oysters, too, and those were lovely and fresh. We also got the fried calamari which looked good, if almost too typical for a place that seems to thrive on invention. (Sorry, but I skipped it) There was a spicy cauliflower dish (Cauliflower, Chili de Arbol, Crispy Shallots & Onions) that I liked, not too spicy. I believe the sautéed jalapeño peppers came with the avocado toast, but don't quote me. We had an eruption of apps, and I did my best to keep it all straight. (I loved the jalapeños, by the way). The avocado toast -- not so much. I tasted mostly lemon and left it alone after one bite. There may have been one other appetizer (with octopus?), but I didn't try it. With so many apps (some double ordered), I was pretty much thinking that we got a tremendous amount of appetizers - with little regard for entrees, let alone dessert.

I love a great steakhouse, and I think that's what's going on here - but, honestly, maybe it was an off night. A New York Strip Steak didn't taste right and was sent back. I had the lamb chops  (Colorado Lamb Porterhouse Chops, Peewee potatoes, dried apricots & violet mustard) which is not the typical cut I'm familiar with. The chops were seasoned very nicely, I thought they were just OK. The meat was tough, at times. And my requested medium-rare came out mooing (or rather baa-ing) at super rare.

We did have some positives in the Entree department. The butterfish (Horseradish Crusted Butterfish Roasted, root vegetables & tarragon pinot sauce) was received very warmly; it remains a big hit. The grass-fed cheeseburger also got high marks. Fries are extra (and at first they did forget the fries). Otherwise, the burger comes standard with what seem to be homemade potato chips: good, simple, not too greasy. The one meat entree that got high marks at our table was the Jumping Beef (Filet mignon tips, roasted tomatoes, red onions, crispy potatoes & Peruvian demi-glace). The Peruvian demi-glace does have a kick, but that will only make you enjoy each bite more slowly. 

Some memorable sides and veggie plates include: Black Tuscan Kale (we boxed the remainder and made a tasty scramble the next day); The Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes & White Cheddar is another well-seasoned winner. 

I passed on dessert, but those who partook in the berry shortcake liked it a lot..

A nice surprise about Echo & Rig is that the corkage fee here is zero. 

So, there's obviously a lot going on here. Some of the food we had was great; some of it really wasn't. I'm not so sure our local hosts are as eager to return, but there you go. And again, it may have been an off-night for Echo & Rig. We had our challenges just sitting still, ourselves, so I'm sure that didn't help, either. However, I would like to try them again. They have Brunch; they have a nice looking bar with tasting sounding cocktails. It's a lovely looking place with generally excellent service.

The ritzy cocktails, bottles of wine, fancy suits and extravagant dresses. You'll find all of these in every steakhouse and casino. These days modern day concepts and celebrity chefs are all the rage. Gordon Ramsay Steak, Jean Georges, Stk, Mastros Ocean Club, the list goes on and on. It's an experience to enter one of these places to enjoy great cuts, fancy drinks, and hopefully fond memories at astronomical but fair prices one would argue. Good cuts should cost that much right? What if one were to wander away from the neon lights, pass the quiet Vegas suburbs and into a little village called Tivoli?  

Service: Our server Ari alone was pretty much worth the five stars. Even with only an hour left in his shift he didn't slack or cut back at all. Instead of asking for drinks first which is what almost all servers do he asked about us. How our night was and wether we've visited before. ""what took you so long."" He quipped and I couldn't agree more at the end of the night. he went into a brief history of Echo & Rig, described the popular items, why they were popular, how they tasted, how they were made with every detail. He was selling the food in a way that I wanted to just order everything he mentioned. He was honest and genuine about it and it wasn't just someone reciting the specials. After some time of looking and processing the menu he came back with a full platter of Meats. New York, Ribeyes, Tomahawks, all in full wholesome glory. Ari went into full detail of the cuts described on the menu drawing out each imaginary cut on the steaks and describing the sauces used if any, cooking process, marbling, and flavor profile. Everything you needed to know. I like my steak rare and I wanted to order the New York Wagyu. Ari seemed concerned and quickly told me the reasoning as to why it wouldn't have been as good. (Due to the low cooking not being able to melt the fat and release the true flavors) He recommended another cut and refused to let me settle for medium rare. He could have just sold me a more expensive steak but instead he sold me a cheaper one just to match my preference and to allow me to truly enjoy optimal flavoring. Absolutely phenomenal. 

Food: I love the concept of Family Style being Asian an all. It's even more interesting to see the concept brought to a steakhouse. The starters were all shareable, delicious, and well portioned. And don't worry the steaks are not small, and they also come with a side of Chips and Mushroom. The best part is of course the price. Any one of these dishes would have been 15 or more on the strip but here it was 8-10 for starters. Steaks on the Strip $50 or more on a small cut. Here, $28 gets you an amazing cut with sides. Absolute steal, Good Prices and Amazing food is probably one of the many great joys in life.

Starters:

Bone Marrow Carne Asada: A giant Bone Marrow with Carne Asada as a garnish as well as four pieces of bread on the side. With recommendations from Ari we squeezed the orange slice all over the Bone Marrow and Carne. Although I don't have much experience eating Bone Marrow this one was great. The bone marrow melted in my mouth, Carne was juicy and flavorful, and the orange citrus gave it a refreshing tang. 10\/10 would recommend

Portobello Fries x Herb Aioli: They taste like giant fries, and it's not overly greasy but full of crunch and flavor. Then it tastes like perfectly cooked portebello mushroom. The Herb Aioli was also amazing. Not a big sauce person but I found myself and my girlfriend dunking everything in the Aioli. 

Mac x Cheese: Made with 7 different cheeses and very rich. It was delicious but we wish we didn't get this as it was just too much when it came out with our steaks and found ourselves barely picking at it. 

Entrees: 

The Spencer Cut: We both got this cut and we were both extremely satisfied. It's basically a giant Filet. The temperature was just right on both of ours, rare was cold in the middle and medium rare was hot but not too hot. The outside was perfectly seared with just the right amount of seasoning and not too crunchy or salty. You can tell a good steak just by cutting into it and it was like cutting butter. And like butter the steak melted in your mouth unleashing great flavors. The Garlic Chips were delicious and fun to snack on while the mushroom rockeffellers made the perfect compliment. We also got a choice of sauce, I got Bernaise and my girlfriend Lemon Chimichurri. The Bernaise was hearty and comforting while the Chimichurri a little exotic in flavor. 

Thoughts: Was close to going on the strip for a good steak but I'm glad I remembered passing by this place a couple days prior and giving a local place a chance. I've found myself doing that alot recently and I""m constantly pleased. Sometimes It's good to not be blinded by the glitz and glamour and stray off the beaten path, you never know what awaits.",1,0,0

Located in the Tivoli center off of Rampart and Alta, this meat house could not be in a better spot. Vallet is right outside, the butcher shop next door, and a beautiful shopping center to browse around. This is a 2 story restaurant with balcony seating upstairs.

This was a belated wedding dinner from our lovely maid of honor and best man Aurora and Michael, and I admit  a great choice. We walked in and was greeted by 4 hostess. Already reserved for a 6-oclock dinner, our table was well and ready upstairs  by their huge windows. Perfectly spaced tables, medium  low ambiance lighting, and uptempo music set the mood to the room. Servers were on their toes being attentive to their tables always on the move. Mellow fast paced. 

Proud to say that Ramon was the perfect server. Aurora and Michael got us a (Nothing Bundt Cakes) wedding cake, and for no charge Ramon took it to the kitchen where it was kept for us until dinner ended. Ramon also gave us the 101 on all their different types of meat cuts and boy did we get a full run down.

Bone Marrow Carne Asada

Calamari, bone marrow, and fried portebello fries were served to us first. Oh my, the fries. Who would have thought that mushrooms make a good fry. Served with what looked like a avacado sauce, this app. was amazingly tasty. The marrow, mmmm mm mmmmm! The starters so far have set a great tone. 

Tables cleaned after apps. were finished. New plates were set, new cutlery for the steaks, and yup, dinner is served. 

""Do you see the size of these asparagus?"" Thick, perfectly grilled\/seared, with a perfect sunny side up egg to blanket them. The rib-eye nicely rubbed, served with house chips and a side stuffed portabello. At this point my shirt was soaked from all the drool coming from my watery mouth. lol.... The first cut into the rib-eye was buttery, and red just like I ordered, and that first bite, Oh my! The kitchen had to put me in the freezer after I melted onto their floor. It was that good. In fact the moment of silence throughout our table spoke for itself as to how good the food was. Their house chips by the way is ""A Maze Zing!!"".  All I can say is, I asked for a side of ranch\/buttermilk, and this is the first time I eliminated a full rib-eye, side , and its flaky friends without having to dip. 

Family + Great food + Ramon + Awesome service = 5 stars

I ordered the carne asada bone marrow, fried spinach salad, and Portobello fries for starters. They were all quite delicious and highly recommend them! 

For the entrée I ordered their ribeye. I had it cooked medium and it was perfect! You cant beat a 8-10z ribeye steak for about $35 bucks. This is definitely a hidden gem and I suggest everyone visiting vegas to check out Echo and Rig. The plaza where the restaurant is located is also quite nice and I thoroughly enjoyed its ambiance.",0,1,0

Ordered the following items:
Appetizers....
Tomato, cucumber, watermelon and red onion - my friend wanted this dish because she LOVES watermelon during the summer season. I was like, let's give it a try cause I like cucumbers. This dish was very refreshing, sweet and hint of onion-y taste. 5\/5!

Asparagus and fried egg - I. LOVE. ASPARAGUS!!! Yes, it does make things smell funky when you're in the restroom but hey this vegetable is stalk-y and green! They grill the asparagus to perfection where you can eat the bottom (the white end). Crunchy and delish. 

Grilled octopus, gigante beans and green olives - I love octopus. I thought it was weird mixing octopus, beans and olives altogether. I was wrong!

Pork belly and spicy slaw - Ok so the slaw wasn't spicy but the pork belly was surprisingly porky! Good marinade and cooked well.

Maryland lump crab cake - The crab in this crab cake tastes so fresh out of the water! 5\/5!

Ceviche ""Peruvian style"" - I'm torn between the two seafood I had but this one was the home run in my tummy. Fresh. Lime-y. Spicy. Amazing 6\/5!

Portobello fries and herb aioli - I'm a fan of mushrooms...Portobello specifically. The portobello was cut into wedges so they looked like steak fries. I wasn't paying attention eating it, thinking it was, seriously, french fries. BUT OMG PORTOBELLO!!! The sauce was amazing!

Main course...
The Spencer Steak with brandied mushroom sauce - I named my steak Steven, I wanted to marry him cause he was so soft, pink and delicious. But I ate him. 'nuff said.

Dessert...
Cappuccino sundae - Pound cake!!! Yes, there's pound cake in the bottom! It also has chocolate shavings and fudge!

Caramel turtle sundae - bourbon and salted caramel ice cream. That's all you need to know about this dish!

The service was spectacular. They changed our utensils everytime a new dish came out. Filled our water everytime it was empty. I felt bad that I was making the servers work. Oh well. Great service!

Bottom line: would come here again.",7,4,4

I cannot believe I have not tried this place sooner. I am a local so I stay away from most overpriced, overhyped strip restaurants and it is VERY hard to impress me as most restaurants in Vegas unfortunately DO lack in either consistency, service or food quality. But holy freakin moses I was SO impressed here. Took my teenager for a mother\/son dinner and we decided to give it a shot instead of going to Cheesecake Factory down the street.
SO glad we did! I have NEVER had better service in my life at ANY restaurant here in Vegas. They were on top of everything! I mean they freakin re-fold your napkin anytime you get up, water always filled, fabulous friendly service all around! WONDERFUL! Ricky was our waiter and he was great!! 
The food, amazeballs! My son had the rib eye, he ate the whole thing. I had the sole and it was perfect!

We came here late afternoon and there was one other party in the restaurant.  We were brought our iced tea quickly and it was refilled frequently while we were there.

I had looked at the menu online and I took some time to decide once there.  For a starter, we ordered their portobello fries which were served with an herb aioli.  This was the first I noticed that anything that stated garlic or should have had garlic (herb aioli) had no garlic taste at all.  The herb aioli was good but missing the garlic flavor.

My wife ordered the tri-tip steak--medium--even though I suggested she get medium rare and I ordered the hanger steak blue.  She was drawn to the tri-tip because the menu said lemon and garlic neither of which was evident in any way.  Garlic fail number 2.  All their steaks come with garlic chips (no garlic flavor here either--garlic fail #3) and a mushroom Rockefeller, a breadcrumb stuffed mushroom cap.

The portobello mushroom was wonderful with the light coating and the cheese shreds.  Then we waited.  We saved some of the mushrooms fries for our steak, and then we waited some more.  Approximately 20 minutes later, our server said the steaks would be right out.  He took our small plates and silver away.  About 5 minutes went by and he stopped by once again and said the steaks would be right there.  About 5 minutes later, he stopped by to say they'd be out in about a minute.  This time, he was right.

When the steaks arrived, I noticed that both had been cut in slices and I just cringed.  I absolutely hate it when this is done.  Maybe that's why so FEW places do it.  I asked if there was a culinary reason and the server said he'd ask.  When he came back he told us that the chefs said it was to make the steaks more tender.  My steak was good, but it was cooked a little more than I would do it at home.  My wife's steak was less tender and because of her medium order, which they did, the steak was less juicy and there was a fair amount of sinew that you wouldn't expect.  She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.  But above all, I'd say, please don't cut my steak.  I'm not a two year old and I'm not infirm.  I Googled this when I got home and found that the only reason (perhaps) to do this was to cut the steak against the grain the right way.

We each had a sundae for dessert.  They were OK.

I left Echo & Rig very disappointed.  The length of time from ordering to getting our mains was ridiculous when the place is less than 1\/10 full.  It was a Tuesday afternoon--not date night USA at 8 PM.",22,8,13

The ambiance is wonderful and the staff is so attentive and friendly. We had to wait a little to be seated but they made up for it by coming by with some samples of their homemade sausage. 
I came with a large group who all have well developed palates and everyone, everyone I repeat, loved their steaks. We started with the portobello mushroom frites and the cauliflower. Both were so yummy and not too saucy or salty which I feel is a common problem at most steak places. I got the ribeye cap medium which couldn't have been cooked any more perfect. It was juicy and tender and practically melted in my mouth. I got the mushroom sauce which was yummy but the steak is so dang good that you don't even need sauce! I love the mushroom and chips that come with. Always great to have a little crunch with your steak! For dessert we got the peanut brittle sundae and the berry shortcake both also so delicious.

The first time was definitely a 5 star review, hence I booked a reservation here for the second time to celebrate my boyfriend's 30th birthday. A well deserved 1 star review. 

First, we were sat on the patio. It was FREEZING cold and the hostess and servers could see my immediate distaste, but did nothing about it. In fact, a comment was made about how the inside was so full with bigger parties (even though we had a reservation). I didn't want to make a big fuss of it because the night was not about me it was about my boyfriend. There were several other people struggling as well. The table next to us was shivering so bad because their heat lamp wasn't working we offered them to join us and share our heat lamp. 

Second, our server and manager were kind of pushy with alcohol. We don't drink and it was extremely annoying to say over and over again that we wouldn't like to order any cocktails. The disappointment was evident on our server's face. 

Third, we decided to try oysters (never tried them before). We ate three of them but were extremely dissatisfied. I don't know if it's oysters in general or just theirs. Mine actually tasted gritty. When our server asked if we liked them, we politely said ""Eh, definitely not our favorite,"" and he said, ""Yeah, they're not for everyone."" That was it! No, ""Oh, I'm sorry about that. What didn't you like about it? Can we offer you an alternative?"" 

Fourth, we ordered the Salmon and New York steak. The New York steak was good. The salmon was EXTREMELY bland. Definitely needed more seasoning. 

Fifth, our server barely stopped by the table. His assistant servers did all the work. He barely even stopped by to say Happy Birthday when we were already half way through the dessert. 

Lastly, the manager stopped by our table a couple of times ( I think to make up for our server's lack of presence). However, he seemed so preoccupied and insincere, we felt even if we did complain it would fall deaf ears. 

Overall, we felt completely overlooked and not special on this special occasion.

Definitely, won't be visiting again. Such a shame because our first experience was so great, but this experience was bad enough to never return.",2,1,1

The butcher shop is truly full service.  The slab bacon is excellent, the burger patties are amazing, and the sausages and terrines are lovely.  They're the only butcher I have put special requests in to that actually produced, and since they bring in whole animals, I can always get pork skin on, which is very rare these days outside of a Chinese market (which don't generally have roasts).  Oh, and give their experiments a try, never been disappointed.

Service at the bar is friendly and competent.  The beer selection is respectable for the small number of taps and the house wines are decent.  The happy hour menu is great, sadly they've reduced the happy hour hours.  From the full menu the bone marrow carne asada is excellent, and they do not treat their calamari as an afterthought.  The Mac and cheese is not the best in town but it is not disappointing.  

The one real problem is the weekend.  Since they do brunch the regular menu is not available before 4pm, which is kind of a bummer if you go to the farmer's market, which ends at 2pm, and want to grab a proper bite there afterwards.

Bottomless Mimosas - thank you very much!  With fresh squeezed OJ and a decent champagne and truly bottomless - they just kept pouring and pouring them until you put your hand over your glass.

Complimented my date and was very enthusiastic about her dishes when I asked for suggestions. We ended up getting the King Salmon, Ribeye Cap, Oysters, and the Portobello Fries with Herb Aioli. Ribeye was requested medium and came out perfect, portobello fries were interesting and tasted amazing with the aioli however I only really enjoyed the first few. The king salmon was cooked well and went great with the carrot puree.

As for the negatives out of 3 selections of oysters only one was available during our time eating, we came at a rather busy time so it is understandable, along with that the garlic chips are really unappetizing with the steak and I believe that mashed potatoes or a savory green dish would be a better complement instead of the chips. Mushroom side was good however there was only one with the steak. Would have definitely enjoyed the steak more if sides were different.

Price wise in terms of food with a drink and side for dinner would likely hit you around $40 however this place is also good for a quick bite with the sandwiches, salads, and soups at around $7-15

The brunch menu offers both savory and sweet options, from benedicts to blueberry pancakes. I started my order with a classic Bloody Mary (a Bloody Mary isn't on the menu but they will make one for you that is fresh and still has a great kick.) We also ordered the restaurants portobello fries served with a herb aioli ($9) as a starter. The fries are a signature item for the spot and they go through more portobello mushrooms than any other restaurant in Las Vegas. The breading was light and the mushrooms were sliced at a great size, plus I'm a sucker for any aioli.

In addition to being a restaurant Echo & Rig is also a butcher shop which made savory an easy decision for my main brunch plate. I decided on the short rib hash ($15) and I was so glad I did. The short rib was perfectly cooked and the potatoes and peppers were diced to the perfect consistency. Plus the hollandaise sauce had a dash of paprika on top which I was obsessed with. My friend got the same hash as me and my other friend got the grilled cheese ($12) which was ALSO stuffed with short rib and was equally unreal.  

I capped off brunch with a final cocktail from their signature cocktail menu. I got the echo gimlet ($9) which was beyond refreshing, sweet and delicious! It was a vodka based cocktail with peach and mint, definitely one of the better cocktails I've had in my brunch explorations. They also offer bottomless bubbly ($16) if that's your thing, which it totally should be.

My husband and I are not flashy or well to do by any means, but we were treated as paying customers that were worth the time which was extremely appreciated!

We had the grilled bacon with barbecue sauce which was very yummy, but the sauce was taken away right before our last savory bite. The black and white salad was a perfect combination of intriguing yet comforting appetizer. My husband had the crusted butterfish that was perfectly cooked and complimented with perfectly tasting parsnip. I had the rib eye cap which was flavorful all by itself but even more tasty with the blue cheese sauce, which was not overpowering as it can sometimes be! I would have eaten the entire piece but some was a little more rare than medium. We were also treated (on the house), to cauliflower which I have never eaten in my life but would definitely order again!

I saved room for a couple of bites of the caramel turtle dessert, which was sweet but not too sweet! Definitely loved by my husband who left maybe a bite. Highly recommended by us Vegas locals and we will definitely be back for more!

Needless to say that I highly recommend Echo & Rig for locals, tourists and anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience without all the uptight snobby persona. Real good food for real people, for half the price of the strip!",0,1,0

We both watch the Food Network fairly often and have known about this place from Chef Sam beating Bobby Flay in a cook off. After visiting Trivoli Village a few times I knew that it would be a great place to come try for a special occasion. I had made a reservation the day before and arrived about 20 minutes early.  We were sat almost immediately.  Greeted by the gracious AGM Xavier and welcomed personally with an introduction of our server Sam.  

We started our night off with a debriefing of the menu, as neither of us have tried half the cuts they offer on the butcher menu.  Sam brought out a few dinosaurs and explained we could share one of these monsters with a bone about as long as my arm sticking out the end.  We passed as the menu cut options seemed fitting for the portion we wanted.  We got both rib-eye cuts, the standard and the cap.  He offered to have it pre-cut as to make it easier to share.  We ordered the Portabello Fries (as it seemed everyone on yelp said it was a must try) and got the Brussels sprouts (my fav veggie) mashed potatoes, and mac n cheese as sides for our dinner.  Also ordered a cocktail to sip on while we wait for our dinner to be prepared.   

First arrived the cocktail which was a gin w\/ lychee, passion fruit and lime. We both loved it.  One drink each lasted us through our dinner.  Then came the surprise of the night. Xavier gave us two complementary appetizers, a watermelon and tomato salad, and a breaded spicy cauliflower dish.  First time I ever tried a yellow watermelon and was amazing! The fries with the dip are one of the best things either of us have ever tried! This alone would bring me back again.  

Then came the dinner.  Three servers neatly placed each plate on our table and I think we then realized why we are here.  We had our steaks cooked medium, and I have never seen a more perfectly cooked steak in my life! I had some of the best bites of food I have ever tasted!  We both could not believe how good the steak tasted, and we did not even touch the sauce as we found it not necessary at all! We had some leftovers, and they prepared our to go bag before we got our desert which was fine because we were so full! They gave us a complementary desert for her b-day, and she got the Caramel Turtle Sunday which was amazing! 

If you want to have a great food experience, and need somewhere to go on a special occasion, this is a great place to eat! I will recommend this place to all my friends and family and we already were talking about the next excuse to come back! Xavier gave us his card and said to give him a call if we ever were to come back so he could take care of us on our next visit.",2,0,1

-cauliflower with shallots and onions: sweet like candy! crispy and delicious.
-ribeye cap: very flavorful and tender cut.  it was recommended medium but mine was definitely a medium rare.  comes with mushroom stuffed with bread crumbs and side of potato chips.

This is absolutely the best steakhouse off the Strip. You can't beat the food, the service, or the atmosphere. The restaurant is just so beautiful...this place is really amazing.

I've been here for dinner and for brunch - both are spectacular. My first Echo & Rig experience was dinner - my husband and I came to celebrate our anniversary and they made it really special for us. Champagne upon seating and the salted caramel sundae after dinner were really nice touches! Our server explained the menu in detail and brought out the different cuts of meat for the day so we could choose. We started with a caesar salad which was fresh and delicious, and for our entree, we ended up doing a tomahawk ribeye for two with roasted garlic mashed potatoes with white cheddar (on the side was this mushroom gravy...it was the most delicious gravy I've ever tasted), and macaroni and cheese. Easily the best dinner I've ever had in Las Vegas! They have an awesome wine list and we had a malbec - delicious and the perfect complement to dinner. The staff that helped us was awesome and couldn't have been more accommodating - Nicholas, Jared, and Jay M., you guys rock and made our anniversary so special. We just moved and didn't want to do a big trip for our anniversary so we kept it low-key...to have such awesome service, food, and wine made it a really unforgettable night.

Since then, I've enjoyed brunch once at Echo & Rig and it was also amazing. I went with friends and we sat outside to enjoy a beautiful day - their balcony is so beautiful. My friends had breakfast and I chose lunch - I had the grilled cheese with short ribs, gruyere, white cheddar & parmesan. It was THE BEST grilled cheese ever! If you're feeling something super indulgent, get that. I can't remember our server's name, but Beth, the manager came out to say hi and she was amazing. 

I can't wait to come back to Echo & Rig. Definitely recommend for brunch, dinner, date night, or a special occasion...whatever it is, they will make it memorable.",3,1,2

Absolutely loved our experience. From the hostess, to the manager (who ""touched"" every table! Way to go), the bussers, the cocktail server, and our server everyone was wonderful and beyond friendly and attentive but not pushy or nosy. 

The food was very good too. 

The pea gnocchi: wonderful! A must get for appetizer

The bone marrow carne asada: I'm not a fan of bone marrow texture from anywhere but this flavor was amazing and my boyfriend lovedddd this

The Mac and cheese: cheesy goodness 

The pork belly: make sure to get a bite of the fatty side with the tougher side and it's heaven 

Both rib eyes: sooo good. I got the fattier cut and it was to die for! Listen to what the server says about how it should be cooked, based on what the chef says. They know best. 

The chips that come with the meat: beyond delicious. I had to take them home with us they were that good. 

A little insider note: they don't have a corkage fee, so if you're a wine drinker bring your own bottle and drink it with dinner. 

The only sad note was the lack of dessert choices. I was kind of expecting some different choices seeing as there are a lot of wonderful culinary experiences on the menu. But I'm sure dessert is good just wasn't what we were looking for.

What I love about Echo & Rig?

1. GRASSFED - They're steaks are grassfed, which makes them incredibly beneficial for your health. In addition, I honestly think this is the only steakhouse in America where you will find dry-aged, grassfed steaks. 

2. TOMAHAWKS CUTS - They're steaks are GIGANTIC, often preserved in their original forms. 

3. CUTS - Amazing selection of cuts, including many Kobe steaks available. 

Lastly, they have a beautiful patio, with outdoor seating, for those who want a little more sunshine (or moonlight).

Cons: not so awesome steaks which surprised me because this place is known for their steaks. I asked for medium rare, but I got a steak so well done that all the juices were burnt out of it. One thing I've noticed about a lot of steak houses is that if 3 out of 4 of your table ask for well done steaks, and you ask for medium rare, then you're steak is coming out like everyone else's... well done!

Echo & Rig is one of those restaurants that is very welcoming.  What I mean by this is that it's wide open when you enter It's also spacious, clean, and your treated with smiles\/greets.  But then there's a wait just to be seated and for them to take your order.  It was roughly 50 minutes between waiting for a table and taking our orders.  Another issue...we were a party of 4 and had to share the rest of our table with another party of 4.  We were asked if we were okay with it and we were...only because we didn't want to wait much longer. Enough said...Yes, there's a wait for a weekday night.  

Our group ordered a mix of food.  
-Mac & Cheese:  Pretty good stuff. Got the light creamy, cheesy mac here.  Love the thick macaroni too. 

-Butternut Ravioli:  Buttery good

-Garlic Mashed Potato:  Yikes...not the best.

-Pumpkin Squash:  Amazing!

-Portabello Fries:  This was a good highlight for me.  Mushroom fries?  Yes sir!

-Bone Marrow:  I didn't try. So, I can't judge

-Fried Oyster Sliders:  My opinion, not a good mix.  I like oysters. I like sliders. But oysters and sliders together?  This just didn't mix well for me.  Slimy and greasy all in one bite. 

-""Over the Rainbow"" Salad: I'm not a salad lover, but couldn't help myself with their ""Over the Rainbow"".  Tasty and they even added quinoa. What is it? It's Queen-No. 

Now for my main entree. I originally wanted to try their Spencer Steak, but was talked into the filet mignon.  Our waiter suggested the filet since it's supposedly their best cut and best tasting steak.  Honestly, I was not impressed with the filet at all.  I regret that I didn't ask them in advance how juicy a medium and how dry a medium-well was.  I usually get my steaks medium-well.  What I got was a filet mignon that was well-done at the top and medium on the inside.  I guess that's what Echo & Rig considers medium-well. I wasn't impressed, but the price was super cheap for a filet mignon. I guess I can't complain either.  You get what you pay for.

My partner in crime K.O. had the Hawaiian cowboy which tasted more like korean style marinate for kalbi than Hawaiian flavoring. Wish it wasnt written as a Hawaiian cowboy as it was very misleading.

Ambience was good and it looking at all the butchered meat while waiting for a table gave me something to do.  They also dont try to upsell you on bottled water and have their own state of the art filtration system and offer flat or sparkling water.

They have a variety on the menu from small menu items to regular options. The wife and i always order several small plates and 1 main steak dish and we feel STUFFED.  Not gonna talk bout the menu bc its a place you need to experience yourself and people put up many pictures here that you dont need me to talk bout it.  Im sure all the staff is great although Austin (server) and Kevin (manager) took care of us this night. After eating take a walk around the mall if its not too hot. As i always say.... try this place... you might like it !!!,0,0,0

Our server, Lucas I think, was very knowledgeable about the menu & all the meats they had. 

Everything was delicious & definitely worth the money. The only thing I would change is, as another reviewer mentioned, toast the bread! The bread & butter they brought us was very bland.

On the other hand, the food was just so average. I just kept thinking this place is surface above substance. Perhaps we didn't order the right things. 

The hostess recommended the short rib hash so we ordered it with the roasted chicken sandwich. The poached eggs were good, but the short rib and especially the hash were subpar. The shortrib was dry and tasteless. The hash wasn't seasoned well and also dry and over cooked. However, the watermelon and tomato salad which was very fresh. 

The best thing I ordered was the Arnold Palmer. They brought out a refill without my asking, but they just brought out an iced tea, not an Arnold Palmer.

After all the rave reviews about Echo & Rig, we were looking forward to another Sin City delight. We had our chance last night and first impressions did not disappoint.  The atmosphere is airy and the host staff was courteous and polished.  After seating, the Manager personally greeted us and welcomed us as first timers and introduced his waiter who gave us a splendid review of the menu and the trimmings.  After the menu introduction, he brought an up sell meat board to our table to present large share steaks.  When asked if all steaks presented were prime cut quality, we were told that some were Japanese wagyu and others from a prestigious cattle ranch.  Game on!  We ordered the 44 oz tomahawk rib eye with garlic cheddar mashed potatoes, fried egg asparagus and a crab cake appetizer.  The bus staff was efficient close to the point of annoyance but a welcome reprieve from being ignored in some reputable eateries.  From this point forward things turned around a bit.  The waiter told us ahead of time that our large rib eye would take a bit longer to cook and would be served to us medium.  We fully understand the extended wait time and eagerly waited for the monster Dino bone to arrive.  The steak arrived sliced tight on the bone by one of the support staff along with our side dishes all looking fabulous.  The waiter very briefly glanced by the table to ask about satisfaction before being given the opportunity to inspect.  A quick okay and on his way. We separated the steak and found most of the expensive meat to be nearly raw.  A bite of the end piece was chewy and not the superior quality we expected.  The potatoes were cold and pasty and the fried egg asparagus was little more than a cold fried egg on overly al dente asparagus.  We waited for some time for the waiter to respond to us for a satisfaction check without luck.  The efficient bus crew arrived at the table before being able to speak with the waiter to ask if we were saving the meal.  At that point we decided to box up the uneaten steak to slice up for sandwiches later.  After sitting for some time with our carry out back at our side, the waiter finally stopped by for the glowing review and was shocked to learn of our dissatisfaction.  He asked if we would like to speak with the manager which felt like a bit of an insult.  An establishment with a glowing reputation would send the manager without question for resolution. To further the insult, the waiter whisked away and reviewed  our signed bill while we were gathering our belongings at the table presumably to make sure his gratuity had been added. At this point, we felt our review and the loss of our future business would be most appropriate.  On to the next adventure.",0,0,0

So we'd been here for lunch on a Monday before.  We came in for Saturday this time and found out it was brunch.  We wanted the bone marrow and steaks which aren't on the brunch menu.  The server and manager went to see what they had.  Turns out, any steak we wanted, from the Tomahawk to the ribeye cap to the Wagyu were available.  But not the bone marrow.  :(

We also got mac and cheese off the steak sides menu.  And portobello fries from the brunch menu.  Plus we were looking at the burger in the butcher fridge downstairs, so we split that 3 ways for an appetizer.  Fresh chips for everyone!

Did I say we enjoyed it all?  We did.  Great meat, great cuts.  My ribeye cap was medium rare as ordered throughout except for a little rare bit in the center.  The smoke from the red oak grill flavored the steaks and burger.  And the sides were fantastic.  Bearnaise, chimichurri, and horseradish cream sauce for the table.

Beer is draught or can which is fine because they have a good draught selection.

I myself thought the grilled cheese was like candy and am still thinking about it days later.  But that's where it stops for me.  My experience is a classic example of how one server can ruin a meal simply by having a non ""customer first"" attitude.  I'm sorry to my server for not wanting onions and aioli on my burger.  I'm sorry that I asked about the home-made chips and wanted an undressed salad with a side of fries instead.  (The salad ended up coming dressed and I couldn't eat it, by the way).  I'm sorry that when we discussed the temperature of my meat, you were annoyed by me wanting to be clear that I wanted it pink\/juicy, but not rare.  Sometimes when I say medium, it's under-cooked, so I like to try to explain that somewhere between medium and medium-well is perfect.  You insisted medium-well and quickly followed up with, ""ok, she can't order anymore.""  My burger was indeed over-cooked and while you stayed and waited to make sure it was ok, I was done back at the ordering process, so I just said it was fine.  I couldn't handle anymore interaction.  We finished up and everyone enjoyed their meal except for me.  Thank GOD for the 1\/6 of incredible short rib grilled cheese.  

The take away here is this:  not every customer can just hand you the reigns and say bring me whatever.  Some people want things the way they want them and that doesn't make them any less of a person.  Maybe another time when I'm in Summerlin, I'll try again.",18,14,11

Sides included Macaroni and cheese, grilled asparagus with egg & cheese topping, caesar salad. My plate had tasty homemade chips and a baked Portobello mushroom. My wife ordered the butterfish. Both meals were excellent!!

FYI, we did not order any alcohol with the meal, just 2 waters and a diet coke. Dessert was complimentary and consisted of a giant cookie broke in half with ice cream, sliced apples and fresh cream topping. Yummy!

My boyfriend and I happened to walk by this restaurant a few months ago and were intrigued by the fresh meat and butchering demonstrations in the window. We went in and met the butcher \/ chef. Aaron and he was very friendly and informative. He even gave us a personalized crock pot receipe and some fresh ingredients!

After that, we knew we had to go back and try the dining experience. We went back this weekend and there was a 40 minute wait, but it flew by. We enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar downstairs and chatted with the Aaron again while he was breaking down some meat for the evening. 

Now for the food - - AMAZING! First we started with the sausage and peppers and the portabella fries. Now, I don't like mushrooms but the waitress said we had to try them so we did and they were great! The breadding was light and crunchy and not at all greasy and the dipping sauce complimented them superbly. For entrees my boyfriend had the new coulotte steak and I had the roasted chicken sandwich (I know, I know a sandwich at a steak place? But the balsamic onions had me at Hello). For sides we had the cauliflower and fries. The steak was scrumptous, perfect crust with just the right amount of seasoning to let the natural flavor of the meat shine. The cauliflower was unlike any vegetable I have ever had. It was sweet and spicy and all the different flavors popped in my mouth with each bite. A MUST TRY! The sandwich was great too - the bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and the onions, arugula and onions merried perfectly with the chicken.

They also do bottomless Bloody Mary's for a few dollars more. 

I ordered the Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had the Steakhouse Scramble.  The Eggs Benedict were good but the plate had such an overwhelming amount of spinach that I ended up pushing most of it off to the side. The Steakhouse Scramble was also good but the server forgot to bring out the sauce my boyfriend requested and brought it 20 minutes later when he was almost finished eating. I know he forgot about it because he walked passed us plenty of times empty handed and asking people at other tables if everything was okay. It wasn't a huge deal honestly it was just awkward when he finally brought the sauce out and my boyfriend had 2 bites left, he could've mentioned something or even apologized. Again, not that big of a deal for us. 

We also ordered the thick cut bacon and it comes with homemade BBQ sauce, you must order this! I wasn't a huge fan of bacon until I tried this it was so thick, flavorful and juicy. I will make sure we place 2 orders every time we come because we were fighting for it, it was that good ;)

The ambiance is modern, open, relaxing, and somewhat minimalist. The balcony overlooks the Tivoli Village shopping center, making it almost feel like it's located in the middle of Tuscany.

Being part-butcher shop, Echo & Rig offers several unconventional cuts of meat. You can order a ribeye cap (the best part) on its own for less than $30! Where else can you find that? Each steak comes with a choice of sauce, but we found these to be totally unnecessary. Our steaks were well-seasoned and cooked to a nice medium rare.

As far as side dishes go, the creamed kale was my favorite by far. Imagine creamed spinach with a more complex, springier taste. Very unique and delicious. On the other hand, the white cheddar garlic mashed potatoes were just OK.

We had a large group. We were able to sit on the second floor patio, and were protected from the slight sprinkling of rain that made dinner all the more enjoyable. 

Starters were great, and for a mushroom hater like me, the portobello fries were delicious. I remember saying that this was the only way I would ever eat a mushroom again. And it's still true. 

Steak was seasoned and cooked really well, to the delight of my scrutinizing taste buds. The baked mac and cheese was a crowd favorite, and everyone went back for seconds. Potatoes were potatoes. You can't really go wrong there. The sauces were amazing, and brought out the taste of the meat like they're supposed to. You had the usual suspects, the wine sauce, the bearnaise, etc. ALL delicious. P.S. Drop some of those sauces on your potatoes for a potato experience you'll never forget. Also got to try an amigo's roasted chicken and another's salmon, and they did not disappoint. Wine list was appropriate for the restaurant.

We road the elevator instead of doing the stairs, both my husband and I have bad knees, the hosted left us at the elevator and said she would meet us at the top?  Last time the hosted road with us! Felt abandoned. 

Then we walked through a very busy restaurant, straight to the out door seating area, corner table next to the railing. Next to one of those space heaters. I am warm bloody and chose to sit as far from it as possible. Bad decision, wind coming across that corner was too much for me, had to change seats, a little better but still windy. 

After a good 20 minutes, a server finally acknowledged we where in his section and took our drink orders. Then it took another 20 minutes to get them. After what seemed like another 30 minutes, our server came back to take our food order. 

Now on Sundays they have a 'brunch' menu with limited items, mostly breakfast things, by this time it's after 230pm, we got there at 120pm. They offer unlimited mimosas for $16 and unlimited bloody Mary's for $22.   We are not much for drinking, tea and coffee is our usual and occasionally a cocktail. 

We ordered a couple of things for appetizers, we had a small plate, crab cake and the goat cheese sandwich, the drunken goat. Red wine marinated goat cheese Brie, cranberry chutney, herbs de province green apple, petite greens, aioli and walnut bread. 

I really liked this combination, loved the walnut bread, it was toasted and three layers. Loved the goat cheese. The whole thing was really good. It's a really big sandwich enough for two to split. 

The Maryland crab cake was also very tasty with big chunks of crab with red pepper coulis and lime. This was a 'small' plate and you should expect that, small taste for two, for one person it would be just right. 

For main courses my husband got the Summertime Steakhouse salad. It's a natural USDA primeflat iron steak with red onion, mango, avocado, basilromaine & white balsamic-lime vinaigrette. Very good size but only three small strips of steak. It was cooked to order, my husband said he was satisfied, so I guess it was the right amount. 

I got the Flat Iron USDA Prime steak, roasted anaheim chilies spinach & preserved lemon chimichurri. It was on a baguette and came with home made potato chips.  First bite and I ended up using a knife and fork to eat it, steak was tender, cooked to order, but big pieces and not able to take smaller bites, so I just cut it up. 

Our food was good, our service on the other hand was a disappointment. Seemed very slow and we where still eating our apps when our main entree's came. Then getting refills also took some time as well.  We've been before when it was not so busy and service was great, so not sure if it's the time of day we came this time or that's the new norm.

We hit tons of traffic on the way, and so we were 20 minutes late to our reservation. I had called ahead to warn them but still didn't have high hopes, but Hannah kept us in the queue, and we received a table almost immediately. We had to make a 7:30 curtain for a show, so we had only precisely an hour to get a meal in, and Raelynda was incredible at expediting the entire dinner yet not making us feel rushed. She also made excellent suggestions and maneuvered our party's long list of dietary restrictions with aplomb!

Everything was delicious and impeccable: some of the dishes (pictured) we sampled were:
Colorado Lamb Porterhouse Chops peewee potatoes, dried apricots & violet mustard; Asparagus & Fried Egg; Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes & White Cheddar; Lamb Cigars & Tzatziki Sauce; I also had 9 oysters from the raw bar - fresh and yummy!

Off to a good start, as the ground floor is a nice butcher shop and was then seated upstairs on the balcony, which was very comfortable.

Rather than specific starters, they offer different small plates that can accompany the main or serve as a starter.  My group shared steak tartare and grilled thick cut bacon with barbecue sauce.  Both were very good.

For a main, they offer steaks on the menu or you can choose a larger steak that they bring by on a tray raw (a little overused by steakhouses these days).  I shared a T-bone with a friend, again good but not in the same league as Wolfgang's or Peter Luger's in New York.  

Overall, a good meal at a reasonable price but not an unforgettable steak house.",0,0,0

I don't often make it up to Tivoli Village but on the trips I did I would always peek in the windows and see how things were going at Echo & Rig. Tonight I finally got into the place and it was great.

When we entered they walked us through the lower level, we got to check out the butcher shop, the deli\/charcuterie counter, and the bar before heading upstairs to the dining room.

The layout is a little random with the bar\/butcher shop downstairs, and the dining room & kitchen upstairs. The dining room is very open and there's some room between the tables. There is a patio off the dining room and an exhibition kitchen along the entire south wall of the dining room.

The servers were attentive, the hosts were friendly, the bussers were quick to refill the water glasses (complimentary sparkling or still water), and bringing the proper weapons(utensils) to make sure we could properly enjoy our meals.

The food was really, really damn good. We had several things off of their expansive (Over 90 item) Menu. The hardest part of the entire meal was selecting which items on the menu to try and which to keep for another visit.

The meal started with a bread basket, it was a pretty basic looking basket with 3 slices of bread and no butter, at first I thought it was odd, but after trying the bread I realized butter wasn't needed.

Next up was our small plate ""appetizers"". First up was the Thick Cut Bacon and BBQ Sauce. The Bacon was grilled which added a great flavor, the BBQ sauce was ok, but I mainly ate the bacon plain and it was good. We also had the Bone Marrow Carne Asada, yes you read that right it's not only ""Gods Butter"" Bone Marrow it also comes with carne asada as well a perfect combo on the toast.

After that was the Charcuterie Plate, Prosciutto, 3 different Salamis, Pate, and Head Cheese all were delish, but the Prosciutto was my favorite.  Next was Grilled Octopus, now I myself am not an octopus guy, but this dish was amazing and made me rethink my hatred for octopus. We also had the Mushroom soup, it was creamy and delish.

Next was the Entree Course, I had the Butcher's Cut Ribeye which was a 14oz steak cooked medium rare (possibly a touch over), served with Garlic Chips and Mushroom Rockefeller. This would have been enough on it's own, but not for us. We also added Portobello Fries, Mashed Potatoes, and Heirloom Carrots for bonus eats. The Potatoes and Carrots were amazing, but the Steak was the stand out item of the meal. I'm not a fan of steak sauces, but if you are, unlike most places that charge $5-7 for a sauce, Echo & Rig includes one free sauce with your steak, which is a nice touch.

As if all this food wasn't enough the waiter told us about the dessert menu. They  only serve Ice Cream Sundaes. And after hearing him say ""salted caramel ice cream"" I was getting the turtle sundae. It was the perfect end to an amazing meal.

I can't wait to get back and try the rest of their menu. I really am looking forward to their late night menu for a late bite before heading to La Casa down the road for the a Cigar.

Also the have free wifi for all your food porn posting needs which is a great added bonus",19,6,15

Five stars all around. There's really nothing more I can say about Echo and Rig's Sunday Brunch that hasn't already been said. The food is amazing and I definitely recommend the Short Rib Hash, Eggs Benedict, and the Portobello Mushroom Fries. 

The Short Rib in the hash is super tender, the eggs were perfectly cooked so yolk smothered this meal once I cut into it, and finally, the potatoes are cubed very small, perfectly made for eating with a spoon. If this is your first time here, get this dish you won't be let down. 

I'm huge Portobello Mushroom fan and Echo and Rig has the mushroom game on lock. Sliced Portobello mushrooms that are tempura fried and served with an herbaceous aioli. Fantastic flavor combo!

Considered to be one of the best Steakhouses in the Las Vegas suburbs, and undeniably one of the true success stories at much-maligned Tivoli Village, it was with three friends that dinner at Echo & Rig was enjoyed on Saturday, and although Chef Sam Marvin was preoccupied following his televised win over Bobby Flay the experience, none-the-less, was one of exquisite service and top quality ingredients prepared in a manner no different than some of the area's best - at a mere fraction of the cost.

Now approaching its third year in business, and outlasting concepts from several more 'celebrated' chefs with nearly universal accolades arriving from locals since opening its doors, Echo & Rig pairs the all-too-common farm-to-table concept with in-house butchery in the style of a steakhouse and leveraging the later knowledge of sourcing and artisan cuts to curtail costs the restaurant happily outstrips the likes of nearby Flemming's while retaining a local sort of feel, the two-story building upscale yet extremely comfortable with a feel that is welcoming whether one is seated in a jacket inside or sporting sandals with a glass of wine in hand under misters on the second-floor patio outdoors.

Admittedly known to the restaurant as a result of reaching out to management with questions regarding the concept and thoughts pertaining to the Echo & Rig's longterm success in a complex where little else has thrived, it was on arrival that the party was escorted to a sizeable four-top at the top of the stairs and greeted by a handful of the restaurant's sizable staff the evening started out with a comprehensive rundown of the menu followed by a complimentary plate of housemade charcuterie joining warm bread and butter as cocktails were sipped and an order was put forth.

Served largely by a man named Brian, first described as the restaurant's best waiter and later as a 'brand ambassador,' it was not long after ordering a first course of food that the plates began to arrive and treated to a bowl of crispy cauliflower tinged in spice along with the items that we'd ordered one would be hard pressed to name a single bite that did not shine, the signature Portobello fries probably the weakest of the items as seasoning seemed to obscure more earthy notes while both the housemade sausage and ricotta with fruit and honey were entirely irresistible, the same to be said of vegetables that were simple yet satisfying while the 'grilled cheese' was every bit the crowd pleaser that rumors would contend.

Already questioning an order that proved quite large when accounting for portion sizes and enticing presentations that made it difficult to resist finishing each plate, entrees saw four prime proteins paired to a trio of sides and although the ""Santa Maria Rub"" unfortunately served only to overwhelm one friend's tri-tip, the quality of an enormous pounded pork cutlet and both the Spencer as well as the Cap were undeniable, the sides a bit of a mixed bag with both corn and potatoes pleasant amidst their accoutrements while the Mac & Cheese featuring ""Seven Cheeses"" was nothing more than run of the mill.

Unfortunately short-selling on desserts, an odd choice for a place going so far as to bake their own bread, it was in a duo of sundaes that final bites were invested and although both were well comprised of high quality ingredients one can't help but wonder how much better the experience could be with a dedicated pastry chef, or even a cheese board considering the fact that baked brie is featured amongst the side plates while candied fruits served with the ricotta were also quite good.",14,4,8

I chose the Steak frites ($21). I figured it was the best choice at a place known for its meats. 
The steak was seasoned great, cooked medium rare like I asked and the flavor was delicious. 
The downside was that it was very small and I could only eat about 3 bites because the rest was fat and gristle. The fries were very good, though it did not fill me up. 
My friend loved her smoke salmon but the guys said their Steak Scramble fell flat. Eggs were not fluffy and very rubbery. 
Luckily we ordered dessert (apple pie and the turtle) and due to an order mix up got a free cherry berry ice cream dish too. All three were delicious and we scarfed them down.

Any of their sandwiches are fantastic... The BLT and Porchetta sandwich are my favorites
The crown jewel of the brunch menu is the short rib hash. 

The real specialty of Echo & Rig is the butcher shop.  Not cheap, but by far, the best quality meat you can buy in Las Vegas. Makes the BB or VM&W look like Walmart's meat case by comparison.  

They also make their own pate, sausage and other charcuterie which changes daily. Always something new or unusual you don't see anywhere else.  Butchers will cut to order just about anything for you as long as they have it in stock.  If you want super thin sliced shabu-shabu style, or a 50oz (4-5 inch thick) bone in ribeye... they will cut it for you.

When I ordered pork chops, the butcher went back and brought out a whole side of pork, then broke it down by hand and hand carved some 1.5in thick rib chops, rind off, but fat ring still on.  Just incredible when grilled over oak charcoal.  The fat from the Niman ranch pigs is so rich and flavorful and is very soft to the bite. Whereas supermarket pork chop fat ring can be tough and hard and usually have to cut it off at the plate.

Definitely buy their hamburger patties... because it is ground from their prime steak trimmings after cutting the steaks for the restaurant.  Usually always available.",4,0,0

If I had to rate the grilled cheese alone it would be a 2\/5. Short rib hash always a 5\/5. I had a bite of my husband's burger and that had WAY more flavor.",0,0,0

Except for a misidentification of the source of one of the oyster selections, everything was great from appetizer to sundae dessert.  

Despite the identification faux pas go ahead and try the oysters they're varied and fresh.  The steaks were prepared perfectly, and we agree with our waiter Brian that the side sauces may be delicious but they are not necessary.  In my case the rib eye was flavorful without being fatty - just the right level of marbling.  And the different sundae options were unique and ours was very tasty.  

Service was very attentive.  The wine list and drinks were interesting and I love that sparkling water was offered along with still.  

While I wouldn't recommend paying the prices in the butchery on the first floor, it does add an interesting flair to the restaurant.

We thoroughly enjoyed pretty much everything we ate, but the standout by far was the delicious ""Grilled Octopus, Gigante Beans, Green Olive Vinaigrette"".  We ordered this as an appetizer while waiting in the bar.    It was so good that we ordered another one as part of our meal.

We sat in a nice corner table on the upstairs patio, which is where I'd recommend sitting if you want something on the somewhat romantic setting;  the atmosphere inside was too open and felt more like a place for a group dinner.

Their specialty cocktail with jalapeno was disappointing to say the least; it tasted like a ton of sweet and sour mix with a dash of spiciness thrown in....the flavors didn't meld (I was hoping something more like The Spicy Pear cocktail from  the Union Kitchen & Tap Room in Encinitas; now that is a specialty cocktail).

We went early on a Sunday night for my husband's birthday based on recommendations and Yelp reviews.  We had reservations and this was the first time we had been in this particular shopping center.  Valet parking was easy and convenient and we were seated immediately.  Our hostess asked if we were celebrating a special event and thereafter everyone who came over wished my husband a happy birthday.

Our waiter was extremely courteous, made sure we knew everything was a la carte and made some recommendations.  The whole service team was great.

We ordered the butcher's sausage, bacon and a caesar salad for starters and the southern fried chicken salad, salt & pepper pork chop and a rib eye for the main course.  Dessert was a caramel turtle.
The starters were great. I am not sure the bacon was as ""life changing"" as our server mentioned but it was pretty amazing.  I believe the sausage changes weekly - this one was a turkey sausage with Anaheim chilies, it was very tasty.  The Caesar was pretty standard but good.  Everything had lovely presentation.

The main courses arrived promptly.  My pork chop was to die for.  Amazingly tender.  It came with a phenomenal baked apple and some beet greens that I did not care for, but that's me, not the fault of the beet greens or the chef LOL  My mom had the Southern Fried Chicken salad and loved it.  Everything was fresh and delicious.

My husband who ordered the rib eye found the steak to be too salty.  He didn't want to complain because the steak was cooked perfectly but he really wasn't enjoying it so we let the manager know.  The team could not have been more accommodating.  My husband thought maybe it was his taste buds and after tasting my pork chop thought he could easily switch his order to that and be assured he would like it.  The manager however wanted my husband to have what he wanted to eat.  He spoke to the chef that prepared it, explained to my husband how it was prepared and suggested we just ask the chef to cut down the salt a bit.  Honestly, I think my husband just is sensitive to salt, not that the steak itself was over salted.  The managers could not have been more gracious.  They also brought my husband a tomato, cucumber, watermelon and red onion salad on the house while he waited for his new steak.  When it arrived (very quickly) my husband couldn't rave enough about it.  It also had a side of perfectly prepared potato chips.  I can't tell you how much we appreciate the management caring about my husband and his experience and never making us feel like we were a bother.  

After dinner we were stuffed but they brought my husband a caramel turtle on the house with a candle for his birthday.  OMG, it was the BEST and we managed to eat it all LOL

In addition to the attentive staff, the phenomenal service, and the stellar management, we so appreciated the little details such as the staff folding your napkin when you left the table, the wait to clear the plates until everyone was finished and never feeling rushed to leave even though they were packed. As a plus, the prices were exceptionally reasonable.

I thought they always had a full steak menu like Smith & Wollensky but it is limited to steak and eggs during brunch. The host was nice enough to ask the chef in the back if I can order dinner instead. I wanted steak and kettle chips ...nothing fancy. They were nice enough to accommodate my request. The waiter raved about the fried portabello mushrooms so I took a chance on them . They were tasty and worth a try! My steak was medium well which I had with some bearnaise sauce. I love people watching here so I stayed for some dessert . Plus it was a perfect day to sit on the balcony . I'm not typically the eat outdoors type unless it's beautiful out.

I really enjoy a good steak so we typically eat at steakhouses on the Strip and that is really my main comparison. How does Echo & Rig compare to steakhouses on the Strip? The food is at least as good, service is possibly better, and the atmosphere\/dress is much more casual. The pricing is shockingly reasonable considering the top notch service and quality of the food.

The first floor is actually the butcher shop where meats are available to purchase and take home. The restaurant is upstairs with a large indoor dining room and an outdoor patio overlooking Tivoli. The décor is clean and minimal. The atmosphere is very laid back, it's not a steakhouse where you have to get really dressed up. We even saw a few tables with children. 

Our waiter and the entire staff were on their game. Everyone was very attentive. We didn't have a long wait between courses, every food item was explained upon arrival, waters were constantly refilled, and any crumb on the table was removed immediately. 

We started with two cocktails that were both delicious. After ordering I noticed that they even offer half glasses of wine. I would probably take advantage of that option next time since I'm not a huge drinker. Our appetizer of choice was the Lamb Cigars, my husband's pick. Delicious! Think Greek eggrolls. The filling inside was so flavorful, they weren't too greasy, and the dipping sauces were great. We would definitely order this again. The bread basket is a basic French bread with butter.

My steak of choice was the Spencer Steak. I loved the flavor and tenderness of this steak. The homemade chips on the side were abundant and pretty good. The mushroom Rockefeller was a highlight on the plate. I loved the mushroom and took my husband's too. My sauce of choice was the Red Wine Demi and it was delicious. My husband went with the Bavette Steak and loved it. He had the Charred Onion sauce and it was out of this world delicious. We both varied from our usual steak choices and were glad that we did. 

Our shared sides were Mashed Potatoes and Butternut Squash. The butternut squash was well prepared, but was probably not the most exciting of what they offer so I'd pass on this next time. The mashed potatoes were flavorful and a good choice. The dessert menu is all sundaes. We shared the Chocolate Cherry Sundae and loved it. The sundae is definitely large enough for two.",7,0,4

Great steaks, the spicy cauliflower side is excellent, and the portobello fries made my mom and I get into an argument over who got the last one.  The sandwiches at lunch can tend to be greasy, but they are delicious (especially The Drunken Goat).

BUT, the restaurant is not my favorite thing about this place.  The BUTCHER SHOP is.  We come here to get all of our steaks.  The butchers are so nice, helpful, and friendly.  They make some excellent rillette if you can catch it before it sells out!  The steaks are high quality, and not much more expensive than buying them at the grocery store.

One other note: we have ordered Thanksgiving To-Go twice from them, and it is convenient, fast, and delicious.  I like how everything is ready to go for you, but you still get the ""Thanksgiving smell"" like you've been cooking all day when you stick the bird in the oven to fully cook it.

I took off a star for some small things that bother me, but may not bother others: I'm not a big fan of their cocktail list (but I like their wine list), the restaurant tends to get very LOUD (so I always sit on the patio when able), and sometimes I feel like we have 6 waiters because so many people come to the table to take orders and say hello (it's a bit overbearing for me, but I bet some people like all the service).",3,1,3

We ordered the portobello fries (neat to try but wouldn't get again), fried spinach salad (even though the main component is fried and I generally don't order salads with fried chicken etc...this salad is unique and the dressing and texture of the spinach leaves this salad front of mind), garlic mashed (great garlic flavor) and the Ribeye-Cap cut and the Spencer steak (eye of the ribeye and apparently my Grandfather's favorite cut).

The waiter was working on his david copperfield act,he was very good at it too,he disappeared and never returned. I had to ask the very helpful hostess of all people to get what was needed. I may try again but probably with so many untried places I wont be back soon. Next up..Poppy den :)",2,3,1

A man in a suit came by a couple times but didn't introduce himself as our server so we were alittle confused. He ended up taking our order and gave us a tiny wine tasting so we could figure out what bottle we wanted. 
After a good 20 minutes our server finally came by. I think he was the only server on the patio cause he was backed up beyond belief, even other tables were complaining.
The guy that ended up taking care of us, Alpheus (coolest name ever, like a Greek god) was outstanding. Some if the best customer service we've ever had. Even the hostess Arianna was great (which is always an awesome surprise haha) 

Food was outstanding!
We had;
Lamb Cigars- tzatziki sauce was refreshing and very light
Pork Belly- fell apart in your mouth, full flavor
Thick Cut Bacon with homemade BBQ- HIGHLY RECOMMEND 
Cauliflower- light appetizer but bursting with spice!
Brussel Sprouts with Pistachios- light and subtle flavor with alittle crunch
Skirt Steak- Carmelized with brown sugar, very juicy and full flavor
Bavette Steak- popular European steak, similar to a rib cap cut. Not as tender as a rib cap but full of flavor

The server was knowledgable and attentive. She offered to bring out a meat plate, but we decided to pass. When we got our food everything looked and smelled amazing. The only complaint I have would be about the St. Louis ribs. They were very dry and Unenjoyable. We were there for a birthday party and after dinner the server brought the birthday boy a complimentary dessert and sang him happy birthday.

This place seem all too familiar thanks to Chef Sam Marvin who's behind both Bottega Louie and Echo & Rig. I'm so happy I could eat portobello fries whenever I please now.

Located in suite #120 in Tivoli Village. Across from Brio and Barton gym where there's a roundabout for valet. The only signage you'll find are carcass hanging and pig heads. This is afterall a butcher shop and a steakhouse. You can also buy Terra Blue chips, sauces from here aside from meats.

Our server, Brian was terrific. Great personality and knew the menu inside and out. He informed us that they currently have 3 dessert sundaes: applie pie, mixed berry shortcake and salted caramel. But that they would eventually have 12. He also told us that the 3 top-selling appetizers are octopus, portobello fries (of course!) and tomato watermelon and cucumber. Our busser, Shawn, also did a great job. Our tables were cleared immediately and our drinks were not even half empty and we'd already get another glass of whatever we're drinking.

For our appetizers, we got fried chicken, oyster sliders, portobello fries and grilled octopus. For steaks we had hanger (with Bearnaise), rib eye cap (with blue cheese) and filet mignon (with chimichurri) - all come with homemade garlic chips and mushroom Rockefeller. The sauces were excellent. We got a side of garlic mashed potatoes anyway. For dessert, we tried apple pie sundae and salted caramel sundae.

Fried Chicken:
Crispy fried chicken skin (not breaded), meat was tender and juicy, and the sauce reminds me of Korean fried chicken...the one with sweet brown sauce. 5\/5

Portobello Fries:
Breaded and fried strips of portobello sprinkled with parmesan cheese and parsley. Comes with the most wonderful aioli for dipping. One of the reasons I go to Bottega Louie and now they're here. Love it love it love it! 5\/5

Grilled Octopus:
Tender grilled pieces of octopus with gigante beans in garlic and green olive vinaigrette. The vinaigrette gives acidity to the perfectly-charred octopus. 5\/5

Filet Mignon:
Simply seasoned grass-fed natural beef. This is my favorite cut since I'm not a fan of animal fat (except for pork belly and bacon) and as usual, cooked medium-rare. I got chimichurri to go with it but honestly, the steak doesn't need sauce. 5\/5

Apple Pie Sundae:
Vanilla ice cream, half a cookie, apple pie pieces and caramel. 5\/5

Salted Caramel Sundae:
Vanilla and coffee ice cream, candied peanuts, toffee bits and salted caramel. 4\/5

The prices are totally reasonable. $35 for a good piece of steak? Oh, c'mon! For everything we ate, we only spent $160. We also got a complimentary bowl of cauliflower with chili. The only thing missing is macarons. Bottega Louie does have the best macarons in this country that isn't Laduree. So, when the day comes they start to carry macarons here, I've no reason to go back to L.A.!",21,8,13

The restaurant has a very interesting layout. Downstairs is the bar and very minimal seating mostly for waiting on a table which will more than likely be upstairs. The upstairs is also where the kitchen is which is laid out for the customer to watch the magic in the kitchen.

The staff are all well dressed in uniform and I've never had anyone who didn't know what they were talking about. Everyone has always gone above and beyond.

The food is INCREDIBLE. Not only is it the taste it's the price. I can't believe the prices on the food at this type of place.

Tonight I went to echo & rig with my girlfriend we were early so we sat at the bar had a cocktail and a glass of wine bartender was great and made a very good cocktail we ordered some appetizers ..... Portobello fries, arugula salad, beet salad  and salmon .... Fries were great, salads were good and  salmon was ok .... We then decided to have dinner at the bar ordered some more portobello fries, Brussel sprouts and I ordered a Hangar Steak (medium).  

The portobello fries came out along with the brussel sprouts and the Steak ..... The fries and the sprouts are great but once i cut into the steak its rare .... I show the bartender and ask for another steak he agrees and apologizes .... I am fine and say ""it happens"" ... Then they bring out the second steak and once again it is RARE TOO !!!!! At this point i pick up my plate and walk up to the kitchen and offer to teach them how to cook a steak because they obviously have no idea.  

Now you may say what do I know about food well i was the chef of a $1000 a night luxury lodge, I owned two restaurants in Vegas one of which was a Steakhouse with Kerry Simon and Elizabeth Blau so I can at least say i understand a kitchen.

Made a 6:15 reservation, we arrived nearly on time and maybe waited 5 minutes for our table? We were seated on the covered patio and it was lovely, comfortable furniture, pleasant views and several misters that kept it nice and cool though it was quite warm out. 

The manager came over and greeted us and introduced himself, welcoming us to our first time there and introduced our waiter, I believe the waiter was Ari and the manager was Jason. Very friendly and though I knew they have a thing for trying to make you feel like family (I had read reviews that mentioned it) it did not come as fake or contrived. 

Wait staff was very good, they made sure our water glasses were never less than half full and cleared dirty plates very quickly. Though some could have smiled a bit more, they all looked so serious. Our waiter made a point to ask about food allergies and took the time to explain where they get all their proteins and vegetables, which is always appreciated. He also explained that they do not charge a corking fee if you want to bring your own wine. I know of many places that charge and rarely see anyone bring their own bottle while almost every table that was seated around us had indeed brought their own wine. 

Food was absolutely great. They have a somewhat offset up where there is appetizer section but they have ""small plates"" which act as sides and appetizers.  We ordered the portobello fries and they were fantastic. They were crispy and thankfully were not that wet as mushrooms tend to be and the basil aioli was delightful. 

My fiancé got a rib eye and I had the filet tenderloin. Both were cooked well (we ordered them rare and medium rare) we also got the avocado toast and lamb cigars as sides and we were not disappointed at all. Steaks were tender and juicy and the sides were cooked perfectly with a lot of flavor.

First time, mainly because I was with my two awesome girlfriends I have not seen in years and we always manage to order the best dishes together and have a blast. 

Other two times were with my man and the dog and well.. I could be eating a frozen chicken drumstick in an NYC subway stop and have the most awesomest time ever. 

Other than great company, the food is also pretty good. I love a good off the strip steakhouse.

They used to have this gazpacho that is just ridiculous. It's off of the menu now. I recently 
e-mailed the GM asking for the recipe and they gave it to us! My love and I had an amazing time preparing it at home. Got loaded on some first class whites and enjoyed this amazing, cold and crisp treat. Just perfect. Thank you guys so so much!! I made two gallons of it, probably. Gazpacho for days, people.

The fried spinach salad is pretty amazing. Great texture paired with tangy and sweet Asian vinaigrette.

The grits and pork belly is just amazing. My steak was as pretty damn good too. Everything was lovely except the ceviche.... Interesting flavor, off putting color. Did not care for it, but only because I was craving the traditional chopped shrimp, onion, cilantro, lime situation.

That being said, Echo & Rig, culinary-wise, might just be in my top 3 favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  Their downfall is 80% of the staff and service! 

I started going there a couple if months ago and my first experience was amazing!! Since January I have been back AT LEAST 10 times and have been disappointed most of those times.  I return because the food is THAT GOOD (that is, IF I receive it, or if the kitchen staff cares to sear the meat right). 
First time I went, it was during lunch.  The server was casual but his recommendations were spot on.  Lunch was delicious and server was helpful friendly.

Returned several times after that (a couple nights back to back).  There are two evening hostesses that ALWAYS remember us, which makes us feel welcome.  However the staff upstairs acted too busy or were overwhelmed with tables.  Only a few times we were offered bread when we sat.  Offered the cuts of the house only once since I've been there.  Once they mixed the sparkling water with the still water.  Found a hair in our soup and they did nothing but take it off the check, did not offer a replacement or an apology.  One waiter made us feel bad about not ordering an alcoholic beverage.  Waiters seem rushed or impatient.  Management seems unconcerned.  Complained to a manager who did absolutely nothing and appeared completely uninterested.

Went for lunch once and, I kid you not, there were approximately 4 other tables there.  Ordered the Portabello Fries (YUM by the way) had a view of the kitchen and watched as it sat for 30 min while I ate the rest of my meal, all the while the cooks, waitstaff and management walked past it many times without a single person commenting who's dish was sitting out under the warmer.  Also asked for a coke, which didn't arrive.  At the end of the meal (fries STILL up in the warmer) I was presented with a check that still had the fries and coke.  Mind you there were only 4 other tables present. 

Also have issues with getting my table bussed, usually plates pile up before someone comes and clears them.  Also they'll take your silverware before you're even done.  

Positive notes: food is amazing.  Flat iron steak is my favorite and 9 out of 10 times it's seared right and cooked perfectly.  Portabello fries are always a favorite, Carne Asada bone marrow delish.  Love the grilled octopus but every so often it's tough.  Black spaghetti used to be my favorite until they changed the scallops to mussels.  Crispy bacon is decadent.  Ultimate BLT was one of the first things I tried and nothing short of amazing but have had it since and it didn't quite measure up (the bread seemed old).  Decent wine selection, white sangria is tasty, cocktail selection is ok.  They used to have a chaucuterie board that was really good but I no longer see on their menu.  Downstairs has fresh squeezed juices that they should put at least on their lunch menu, I am always curious about them but never know what they have.  Steaks are amazing, I have had several different cuts and all are tender and delicious (they should be, they're a butchery!) and prices are great, especially compared to a steak house on the strip.  All their meats or all natural grass fed.

Have been hesitant to return because of service, have returned solely because of the food, only 2 stars because of overall experience.  This restaurant definitely deserves better.",2,0,0

Got to Vegas last day here and wanted something special for dinner. Wanted beef (STEAK!) and wifey saw Echo and Rig. Pictures don't do it justice. Made reservations for 7:30. Wife, daughter and I arrived at 7:15 at Tivoli village, nice place. Went right to the restaurant. Open the door meat shop and bar downstairs cool. Hostesses greeted us with smiles and enthusiasm. One of the girl addressed my wife and we had a jovial conversation. We went upstairs nice decor. Wifey asked if we could be seated outside. They accommodated, very nice view. They asked us if this was our first time there and we said yes.  Within 5 minutes the manager Beth came to our table an introduced herself and offered sparking and distilled water and also took our drink order. Very friendly. Within minutes we got our drinks. Beth brought over our waiter who immediately introduced himself and reviewed the entire menu. Very nice touch. I asked him about the Bavette and Spencer and he gave me a thorough breakdown. Bavette had a porterhouse flavor and Spencer was similar to a ribeye. We placed our order, wife and daughter ordered skirt steaks and I ordered the Bavette medium rare.  Waiter explained that they cook the steaks more on the rarer side which is perfect. Also ordered sides Caesar salad, mashed potatoes and broccoli. The waiter recommended we get an appetizer which we did, calamari. I don't think we ordered enough. Within 10 minutes bread, Cesar salad and calamari arrived. Salad was fresh not heavy on the dressing,anchovies were fresh. Portion was big enough for two. Calamari was crisp and fresh, it came with two sauces cocktail and basil aioli. Basil aioli was delicious. Steaks and sides arrived within 10 minute. Plates nicely decorated. Steak came with chips and a stuffed mushroom and the sauce of your choice. To be honest the steaks didn't need it. We cut into our steaks and we're impressed. Nice beefy flavor, juicy and cooked to perfection. Broccolini was tender but not over cooked. Mashed potatoes were creamy and flavorful.  My wife and daughter did not finish their meal.  Of course I cleaned my plate. The waiter staff checked on us periodically. The busboy packed our leftovers for us. The waiter came back and gave us our dessert menu, good selection. He recommended several desserts but we had our minds set on the sorbets. Got the peach and blackberry flavor. Wife had to be different and ordered a after dinner drink, Remy. Dessert arrived in a bowl nicely decorated with strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and blueberries. Sorbet was cold fruity and flavorful. Berries were ripe and sweet. Very refreshing. We ended our meal and Beth came over to give us her card and told us to call her whenever we are in town and she would have a table for us. She also told us to bring our own wine because there is no corkage fee. What?Restaurants make their money from alcohol. Nice touch! 

The waiter brought us our check and told us it was a pleasure to serve us.  This place couldn't get any better unless they gave us a lifetime of free meals.

When we first walked in, we were a bit taken aback because we didn't realize there were two floors to the building. Downstairs is a full meat market and bar area, while the restaurant resides upstairs. 

Ok, now onto the food. We started with several ""small plates"": Ahi Poke Tuna, Portabella Fries, Cucumber\/Watermelon Salad. For me, the portabella fries were the hit of the appetizers, nicely seasoned and cooked and comes with a fantastic dipping sauce. The cucumber salad was also very good and refreshing. After that we got to the meat: Spencer steak, 2 Rib Eyes, and Brisket. All of the steaks were cooked to our individual requests and we all raved to each other about how great they were. My brisket was very tender and flavorful. My wife's rib eye was also very tender. We also ordered ""small plates"" of mac & cheese and brussel sprouts.  Nothing we ordered was disappointing.

Got a couple glasses of wine the portobello mushroom fries the skirt steak and the spencer steak. This place was great the food and the service were great. It wasn't until later that we got food poisoning from it that we had to think twice about this place. It was terrible and it ruined our weekend. It took awhile to get the matter resolved but ultimately seemed like they really cared about my experience and gave me credit back to my account and invited me in to eat again. So updates will be needed later on. But aside from the side effects the food was great recommend getting the skirt steak in medium and spencer medium rare. Get the onion sauce for your steak. Also the portobello fries are a must if you like mushrooms the dip for it is unique and great too. Also if it's a nice day try to request a seat on the balcony!,0,0,0

The space itself is beautiful, with high ceilings, modern decor and the butcher feel that's just plain cool (sorry, I know I sound lame, but it's the best word to describe it). I love the hot dog and cheese area you can order from while you wait, as well as being able to stare at all the awesome cuts of meat before heading upstairs. The bar also looked great and very cozy, but I didn't sit down since the wait was only a few minutes.

Onto the food - I ordered the steak sandwich ($12) and my grandparents the burger ($12) and skirt steak ($22). Everything was delicious, and the sides we got (mac & cheese and brussel sprouts, $7 each) were divine. Great wine and beer and cocktail selection. Wish we weren't so stuffed from the meal and had room for dessert!

The service was great, if not a little new. Some waiters were unaware of the menu and order of food delivery, and my grandfather's burger came without cheese and undercooked at first, but really it was quite enjoyable overall.

I was shocked at how affordable this place was. Even if you ordered a ton of food you could have a fantastic dinner for well under $50 each. The steaks, the sides, the drinks...everything. Really a fantastic new spot. Can't wait to return soon!",0,0,0

Decor is good, but their is nothing to dampen sound (carpets , partitions, etc.) so it is extremely loud when it gets busy which it was.  Very difficult to carry on a conversation, felt like I was at a concert almost.  

Waitstaff and Manager Beth were very attentive and very eager to please.  Forgot our server's name but he had this attitude like he certainly didn't want to be there which became evident throughout the night.  He showed us some large plate of meat cuts and I never understood what that was for as his explanation was very lacking and the large cuts of steak he showed us weren't on the menu.  

We ordered and our food came out within a normal time frame.  Portobello Fries were amazing, Steak Tartare was ok, appearance was average but it was drenched in some kind of sauce.

Our main course arrived and everything looked good, however my friends ""medium well"" filet was definitely not even close to that.  Once it was cut into it was plain to see it was on the Rare side of Rare.  We found out that another member of the table had ordered the same thing and the serving staff had served the wrong food to both of them.  Beth offered another steak to replace it and after we had all finished eating her replacement steak arrived.  It was supposed to be ""Medium Well"" but they barely managed to get it to ""Medium Rare"".  

We ordered some dessert and again the wait staff mixed up orders and served the wrong item to the wrong person. Nothing like paying to serve your own food. 

We asked for separate checks and after an extraordinary amount of time our server ensured to point out multiple times that a gratuity was not included on the checks.  He seemed to be hovering over us as we signed our bills as he scooped them up almost immediately - can we get a little privacy or peace please?  Sheesh.

Overall - meh.  Waitstaff is attentive but unable to properly serve food.  For being a steakhouse, the kitchen can't seem to cook a steak properly.  Cost is far too much for the level of service received and quality\/portion size of the food.   Definitely more than $$ place. 

Cross this off the list places I will go again.  I don't mind paying for great service and great food, prefer it actually but there are plenty of other steakhouses in town worth paying this much for ok service and improperly cooked steaks (think Outback).",1,1,1

What happened? Well for one was bad service.  To begin with our waiter Sam was great! He was right over to greet us, bring our drinks and inform us of the steak choices.  For the rest of the evening, we didn't see him until he brought dessert menus.  Usually I like to be checked on during the meal. Several others came to our table to refill drinks or bring the meals.  Sam was no where to be seen.  We had to ask another waiter to find ours so we could get the bill.  Very unfortunate.  

For my meal, I ordered the Alaskan Cod. Our table chose to share the sides of Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes & White Cheddar along with Mac & Cheese.  The cod was very very small.  The flavor was ok but could've been better.  I realize it is a steakhouse but I've had much better.  The potatoes did not have any garlic or cheddar flavor in them.  It was the first time I've had to salt and pepper potatoes at a restaurant.  I will say the Mac and Cheese was really creamy and delicious.

Food: Drunken Goat Sandwich. YUM. If I see the word Brie, that's what I'm ordering. The sandwich had Brie, goat cheese, thinly sliced apples, cranberry chutney, greens, and some sort of aioli (basil I believe), and came with the apple and fennell salad. All the flavors came together so well and it was absolutely delicious. Portion was big but of course I ate the whole thing because it was great. They are known for their cauliflower which was delicious. It had a little heat to it from the peppers, but it really was the perfect amount of spice, and cooked perfectly. 

We were celebrating a couple of special occasions which were recognized with some fabulous dessert, the turtle, and the berry\/lemon. WOW the salted caramel ice cream on the turtle was some of the best ice cream I have ever tasted.

We were immediately greeted by our server and they have a pretty good memory on our complimentary selection of flat or sparkling water.  Our table shared\/tasted the following:
-Portobello fries: slices of thick Portobello were lightly battered and served with a green aioli.  Yum.
-Bone Marrow:  A must try!  We all enjoyed this appetizer.
-Octopus with gigante beans and green olives: very refreshing.
-Lamb Chops: Seasoned to perfection and was very tender.
-Trenne: Our server Nicholas recommended this but for us to keep in mind that it is not like the typical pasta.  I loved it!  I liked the crispiness and charred taste to some of the trenne.  The prime rib eye was super tender as well.  The black kale went so well with it.

We tasted Nelson's hangar steak and oh boy, that was seasoned very well and again, super tender.  E&R sure knows how to cook up a piece of meat.

We ended the meal with the berry shortcake and the caramel turtle sundae.  Caramel turtle sundae was the winner of the two.

Echo and Rig has fast found its niche in the Vegas steakhouse world.  

1.  The producer, how they rear their cattle, and the breed, not USDA rating dictates what is served.  Corn fed beef with better muscle texture, Grass fed beef with more mineral overtones or at its highest level, Akaushi (Japanese brown wagyu) beautifully marbled wiith a sweet beef taste.  

2.  Offer ""butchers"" cuts (flank, skirt, hanger, tri-tips).  The best beef flavor at the most reasonable prices.  

3.  Offer sharable classics (T-bone, Porterhouse, NY Srip, Rib steak) cut to order.  Want to bring out the best in a steak?  Cut it like a roast.  Two, maybe three inches thick, 30, 40, 60 ounces, cooked right, the classic char on the outside, juicy and meaty through the middle.

In general, all steaks are well trimmed.  Evenly cooked to temp with a good sear (hard sear on the butchers cuts that shouldn't be cooked past mid rare).  

The flank, skirt, and hanger; all American wagyu, are outstanding.  Beefy in all the right ways, the muscle has deep grain (think the way perfectly cooked brisket can be stretched), very juicy with clean, not cloying melting fat.  All are inexpensive at $26.20.  Note: each has a different seasoning.  Honestly the beef and it's texture was the star.

For Asauchi beef, two cuts stand out: the rib cap (ultra tender, gently sweet, well integrated fat; the best part of a prime rib, AKA spinalis dorsi) and the Bohemian steak (tail end of the sirloin, denser, with a sweet beefy taste and melting fat),   Note:  both cuts priced by the ounce.  Prices vary so ask your server.

Finally the big boys.  While there are arguably better places to enjoy a huge hunk of beef, nothing says steak like a 40oz, two inch porterhouse.  Raw, it looked between Choice and Prime but the flavor, exactly as expected.  Great American beef.  Aggressively seasoned, cooked rare.  Firmer with good chew.  The sections nearest the bone... oh yeah.

I didn't think the restaurant look as nice as people made it seem. The meat market and the bar section are on the first floor of Echo & Rig, they have a warm inviting feeling that kinda says ""have a drink and buy some meats!"" The second floor is where the restaurant is at. I like that open kitchen that let's you see a little of what is going on, however, the decor of the restaurant itself lacks a relaxing atmosphere. 

When you sit down, you get complimentary flat or sparkling water and bread & butter. Well....you're supposed to. The service here is what may stop me from coming back. The waiters have the biggest attitude ever and they don't serve you unless you stop them repeatedly and ask them to take your order or to bring your bread & butter. I don't expect fancy service, but at least let me order my food...

The food here is good, but that's all. I had the beef tartare, the wild mushroom soup, the fried spinach salad, and the grilled cheese with short ribs. They were all good dishes, but they were not out of this world amazing. I will say though, there menu does have a lot to order so there is always something for someone to eat.

I have mixed emotions about this place. I was pretty excited about coming here. I heard so many great things. I was asked if I was celebrating anything from the host, I told her a new job, as soon as we sat down a manger came over saying congrats on my new job, that they would give me a sundae to say congrats. After he walked away we waited for at least 15 minutes before anyone came around, (the guy who was filling the water noticed us sitting there forever and tried to find someone to help us and couldn't ) So I flagged down a lady in a suit told her we still hadn't seen a waiter and if we could move outside(honestly just hoping to get someone to wait on us. Also she took my drink order, which I had ordered a bottle of wine. Was moved outside, she brought the wine. Then we waited another 10 minutes before we saw our waitress. ( also another manager(#3) came to say sorry and congratulated me on my job) the waitress finally came and took our order, a couple minutes later she brought a fruit salad(which I didn't order) thought it was complimentary since we hadn't been waited on for the first half hour in the restaurant . Got our food (it was delicious by the way) asked for the bill, I was charged for the salad I didn't order (and was not great) and never received a dessert. At this point I was so over it, I didn't even mention it, paid and left.

So I began eating the steak which was good (the ribeye) but didn't fully enjoy it since my wine came out 20 minutes later. So instead I ""enjoyed"" a cold steak with wine.

However I appreciate the family environment they are trying to create. Jay was our server who made the experience very pleasant- he was very informative, professional and not overbearing. It was brunch time so we tried the short rib hash, portobello fries and steak and fries. The short rib in the hash was killer tender and braised in house. The eggs were perfectly poached on top and drizzled over the perfectly sized potato cubes. This dish is obviously highlighted for a reason. The steak and fries were overly salted but was quickly fixed and perfected on the second serving. The best part of the wait was a complimentary tomato salad that cleared the palate while the steak was grilling. The chef didn't want only one person eating at the table- very nice touch. To make the experience even better, the manager, Xavier, sent out a salted caramel sundae that was heavenly. Who eats a sundae after brunch? Anyone that is served this sundae in particular.

Definitely not, sorry to say! I would think that with my hunger and grumpiness I would like anything I ate, but that was not the case. 

On a positive note, I liked hoe the butchers were cutting steaks and you could talk to them and sample some sausages and such. Personally, I am not a sausage fan and did not like what they had to sample, but I believe my hubby liked this sampling. I liked the displays of meat and opportunity to interact with butchers. 

Once we were seated (pretty area upstairs by the way), I already knew I wanted the rip eye cap and the portobello fries so I was ready to order. Well, come to find out they were out of the rib eye cap! 

At that point we had to ask for recommendations. I was a little confused by the steak choices. They had rib eye steak on the menu and rib eye steak that you buy from precut slices that the butchers were cutting downstairs. Apparently there is a difference in the quality of them. There is also a difference in the price, major difference. I just found it weird. I mean options are great, but this was a little bit too much for me to decide. I think they should just stick to whatever they feel would taste the best. The waiter almost made the rib eye from the menu sound like something I could have bought myself at the supermarket. He was really ""selling"" the ribeye\/steaks that were brought out raw on a platter. Maybe to some people they would appreciate this and it did remind me of my experience at Gordon Ramsay Steak, but the prices were almost the same as strip prices for those cuts of meat. It almost felt like we would be making a bad choice if we chose the steak from the menu. Again, why not just have one type of meat on your menu?

He claimed the fish was brought in from fisherman that same day and I did not understand how that is even possible?

Based on the waiter's recommendation, I ordered the slow roasted short ribs with castelvetrano olives, celery, walnuts, and horseradish. I'm not going to lie, these toppings did not seem like they would go well with short ribs, but the waiter was saying it was excellent so I got it. The olives, celery, and walnuts literally looked like they were sprinkled on top after the short ribs were cooked. I don't think raw celery, uncooked olives, and chunky walnuts compliments short ribs at all! I was hoping it was maybe chopped up small and possibly cooked in some way. I've ordered short ribs often at restaurants and just never saw it made this way. It was presented on a piece of paper and board (similar to how a charcuterie would be served), also weird. I think of short ribs as having a yummy sauce that you would want to pair with mashed potato or rice or something to enjoy the sauce with and some sort of cooked veggies. Instead, the sauce was dripping off of the paper. Weird presentation. 

My husband's ribeye steak was good and so was the mushroom. He also enjoyed the bone marrow (I did not try it) and I liked the portobello fries. The waiter was quick to move around and seemed to be good (except for his recommendation).

Overall that short rib and the long wait did not leave me wanting to come back for more.",2,2,1

When we first arrived, I could barely get him to keep walking to the door as he admired all the fresh cuts of meat in the window. We had a reservation and were seated quickly. Our water came out quickly as well; I chose flat, and my boyfriend chose the complimentary sparkling water. After this, the waiter took his time to come back and get our drink and appetizer orders. About fifteen minutes after our appetizer order was taken, a small loaf of bread finally came out. Considering how long it had taken, I assumed the bread would be hot and fresh - but it was not. The drinks came a few minutes after; I felt they really took too long for a simple loaf of cold bread and a single cocktail.

As appetizers we had the portobello fries and fried spinach salad. In retrospect we probably shouldn't have had two fried things together, but that was our fault not theirs! Both appetizers were delicious and the flavors were well balanced. 

For the main course, I ordered sides only as I am a vegetarian. I found they had fairly unique vegetable dishes; I didn't have to settle for a salad and baked potato like at a lot of steakhouses. I had a spicy cauliflower dish and black tuscan kale. Both were excellent. My boyfriend ordered a medium ribeye and reported it was cooked perfectly.  We also shared the baked brie and sourdough with stone fruit; I really enjoyed this at first, but after it cooled the bread became tough and chewy. If you get this, make sure to eat it while it's fresh! 

They brought out a complimentary caramel ice cream for the birthday boy. 

Overall we had a great experience, but the service was slightly lacking. We both felt the initial wait for drinks and bread took too long. Our waiter also seemed rushed and slightly inattentive. The busser Enrique was constantly smiling and courteous; it's a little sad I remember his name but not the waiter's name! Enrique certainly made more of a positive impression.

It's 6 people, not 20, and our orders weren't that hard!!!! He gave us HUGE attitude about it, so we just decided to split it 6 ways so we could get out of there (after 20 minutes waiting for our cards to come back) Can't imagine how long it would have been if we'd followed through with wanting our checks split.

We were met by the maitre d once seated, who then introduced us to Nick, our waiter. After talking to Nick, he brought out THE TRAY, steaks with bones..including the Flintstone or as they call it a tomahawk. Impressive...but far too much meat. We all ventured on a Spencer (you'll know when you go) with different sauces. We also shared a cesar salad and the portobello fries. Again...fantastic! Our glasses never emptied, which was nice. For dessert Nick recommended the Salted Turtle sundae, which we shared and he also brought out a complimentary birthday sundae.

- My fiancé had made a reservation over a week prior to our 7pm reservation. We waited 35 minutes to be sat at our table. 
- After being sat at our table, the manager (Kevin) approached us, apologized for the wait, and handed my fiancé his card. He said that next time we dined there we should give him a call and we will be sat right away. Kind of a tacky move if you ask me, but this was the only apology we received that evening. 
- We ordered oysters from the raw bar menu, and our server (Jess) later informed us that all were sold out other than one varietal.
- Food runners removed appetizers from our table without asking if we were finished. We were still enjoying our food as they were removed to make room for additional plates.
- My fiancé's steak was over cooked. He asked for the rare side of medium rare and it was medium.
- I ordered the ""over the rainbow"" salad and several ingredients in the salad were frozen.
- We were celebrating a birthday and no complementary dessert was offered. 
- A food runner dropped bread off at our table after our entrees were already cleared.

I requested on my check that 100% of my tip go to Jess. She was the only highlight of the evening, as she was friendly, professional, and attentive. Other than Jess' service, we had a terrible experience. I have worked in the service industry and I am sympathetic to minor mistakes, but everything that occurred had no excuse.

Really rooting for this place and hoping I can update to 5-stars soon!!",3,0,0

We had a reservation and we showed up 10 minutes early but it still took almost half an hour to be seated.  This was weird because other people were coming in without reservations and being seated ahead of us.  But to be fair, I requested a patio seat.  But then again, one of the couples that came in after us and seated before us was on the patio.

We were greeted by a great host once we were seated who apologized for the wait and wished us a happy anniversary.  But once he left, it took a good 15 minutes before we could place an order.  The appetizers came within 10 minutes but our steaks took almost an hour.  The waiter did apologize for the wait but it was disheartening to see other people seated after us getting their food before us.  

The first round of drinks came very quickly but the second took so long that we wondering if it was going to make it before we got the check.  

Maybe it was an off night for them.  The food - as always - was amazing but the service was really really slow.  To be fair, it was a Wednesday night and the place was really busy.  

In all, it was not an ideal way to celebrate my anniversary.",0,0,0

We also ordered the thick slices bacon and the fried portobello mushrooms appetizers.  They offer bottomless mimosas and an array of other  delicious alcoholic alternatives.

The restaurant is d delightfully decorated and they have an open kitchen where we admired the chef expediting the orders.

I can't end my review wo mentioning the rest room.  The rest room is very clean and spacious.  On the wash basin, they provided a bowl of honey salt to treat your hands.  Here in Las Vegas, the air is so dry it constantly sucks the moisture out of your skin.  This bath salt leaves your skin soft and moisturizer hours after use. I loved it so much I bought a jar of it in their gift shop.

First of all, the ambiance was beautiful. All of the dining tables are upstairs where you have the choice of eating inside or outside on the patio. We chose outside and every single table had a beautiful view of the giant fountain below with pretty lights hanging tastefully to give it the right mood. And to top it all off, they have their own private butchery downstairs where you can buy all the meats they cook at a very reasonable price. 

Now, my fiancé and I both worked many years in the fine dining restaurant service industry in south Florida, and those of you who are ""in the biz"" know we have unreasonably high standards when it comes to service in a restaurant because we're fully aware of what the best of the best constitutes. Well, with that in mind, the service staff at Echo & Rig completely surpassed my unreasonably high expectations. Arriiana (who, if you read on, is already yelp-famous) was so cute and friendly; she just set a great mood for the rest of the dining experience. As soon as we sat, we were welcomed by Xavier, the manager, who was extremely likable and helped to make sure we were taken care of the entire night. Also, what stood out to me and impressed me the MOST about Xavier is that (because I'm overly observant) he made sure to be a friendly, helpful presence to not only us, but EVERY single table in that restaurant! I watched as he seemed to effortlessly make a connection with every table while at the same time having great synergy with his staff, which shows a true understanding of what management is. 

Not only that, but the service staff was obviously trained very well. We had Sam as our server, who was friendly and very knowledgable of the menu.  Sam was also that rare balance of attentive but not overbearing. We never got the feeling of being ignored or pushed out of our table, which can often time ruin your experience. We will definitely be asking for Sam again.  

Now for the food! (Sorry this is so long, but if you're like me, these details are important when you're looking to try out a new restaurant)

I wanna start out by saying everything we ordered was beyond delicious. I felt like I was a judge on the season finale of Top Chef and the chef contestants were making it impossible for me the choose a winner. 

We ordered the portobello fries and baked Brie for starters. My fiancé ordered the bavette cut steak and I ordered the skirt steak. We shared a side of broccolini and garlic mashed potatoes and then shared the caramel turtle ice cream for dessert. 

...I'm going to have a hard time not ordering that exact combination of food every time we dine here because it was so amazingly good. 

It's safe to say this is my new favorite restaurant!!",0,0,0

The location is a few miles off the strip which is great, because it gives you a chance to drive out and forget you're in one of the most touristy destination places in the Western world.  It's a newly developed plaza, so it may not show up on older GPS maps as I found out.  Better to use your phone instead.  

So you pull up to this sprawling Italian influenced shopping center, Tivoli Village, complete with huge center fountain.  The restaurant is prominently located at the entrance across from a popular Italian restaurant and sports bar, near the fountain.  There is plenty of free parking if you don't want to valet.  When you enter Echo & Rig, it looks like an upscale butcher's, with fresh meat and sausages on display.  The hostess is extremely friendly, and got to know our party a little before selecting our table (where we were from, if it was our first time, etc).  They had tables out on the patio and a larger, beautiful dining area inside, next to the kitchen.  We sat inside, which was perfect.

The hostess took us upstairs via the elevator although there is a winding grand staircase, and she really makes us feel at home.  Once seated, we were greeted by I think the M'aitre d, Derrick, who welcomes us and thanks us for coming.  Our waiter, Raoul, then walked us through the menu and the specialty items, going through the ala carte menu as well which you can also order as appetizers.  There are so many small tapa like items to order, we got the lamb cigars and crab cakes which I highly recommend.  The small dishes range from $6, $8, and $10.  I also ordered a baked potato, which wasn't on the menu (although there is a baked sweet potato) but they happily made anyway that came with the steak.

For the main entrees, they have surprisingly a large variety of choices besides steaks.  There's several chicken dishes, seafood, pork, and even duck.  Of course, they are known as a steak house and their choice of cuts is superb.  I got the Rib Eye Cap (the best part of the ribeye) and was not disappointed.  Each entree came with homemade chips and potato cakes.  Every cut is, I believe, 10 ounces and was plenty big.  Grilled to perfection too, of course.

You can't go here without noticing the excellent service and modern technology implemented.  Derrick who I think is the M'aitre d again came out to chat with us after our appetizers came out to make sure everything was to our satisfaction and asked if there was anything we needed.  I ordered a beer and then less than a minute later someone from downstairs comes up and delivers my beer.  How did that happen so fast?  Also, we noticed that there were a couple of people with iPads just walking around making sure and double checking that everything was being done, which was somewhat surreal.  The level of communication and service here was extraordinary and worth another visit just to observe!  

Finally, the GM of the restaurant came out to visit after the meal to invite us back and make sure everything was exceptional, which it was.  He even mentioned that they were planning to open another Echo & Rig in Los Angeles by next year and that the owner already owned a popular Italian steakhouse in DTLA, Botega Louie which I now want to try.  We were too full for dessert, but I would have to assume it would have been awesome.",4,2,2

I have been lusting over Echo & Rig since they opened, but hadn't had a chance to visit until this weekend. I'd say that all in all, they pretty much live up to the hype. Echo and Rig is located in a prime location in Tivoli Village. It is a beautiful restaurant.  The downstairs level has the bar and butcher shop, while the upstairs has the kitchen, dining room, and a balcony which also seats diners. The dining area is on the smaller side, but it is all very open and airy.

When we arrived, we were informed that the wait was about an hour. Yikes! Granted, it was 7:20 on a Saturday night, but I wasn't expecting so long of a wait. But we were there, we were hungry, and we were not to be dissuaded from our plan. So, we moseyed up to the bar for a cocktail. I enjoyed the Strawberry Bliss, while my companion had the White Sangria. Both of the drinks were very well crafted, and all of the bartenders were really friendly and personable. I always enjoy when I can see them muddling ingredients and putting drinks together with care. My companion made an off-handed comment about the sangria being full of ice and not enough drink (because it was so good), and the bartender fixed him another at no charge! It wasn't even a complaint, and we certainly weren't expecting that.

The wait only ended up being about 35 minutes, and we were escorted upstairs to the dining room by the hostess. We were seated in a very cosy corner with the booth portion accented by lots of cute (and comfy) pillows.  Our server, Ramon, was very nice and made some recommendations for us. He was also serving a very large party near us, so service was on the rather leisurely (slow-ish) side.

The bread wasn't anything special, but it was soft in the middle, which I appreciated. It was served room temperature.  We initially started our meal with the octopus, which was one of Ramon's picks (he talked us out of the calamari). Unfortunately, it wasn't what we expected and it wasn't exactly to our liking. It actually was like an octopus salad, with white beans and a light vinegar sauce. The octopus didn't have much flavor and was rather chewy.  This was the only negative portion of our meal. We mentioned to Ramon that we didn't really like it, and he brought out an order of calamari at no charge. The calamari was delicious! Hot, lightly breaded, and had two sauces that were equally good.

The main course.... STEAK! I got the ribeye, medium-rare, while my companion got the Spencer steak, medium. Both steaks are served with a large mushroom with breadcrumbs in it and chips. The chips seemed rather unnecessary, but they were fine. The steaks... absolutely delicious! They were highly seasoned (if you don't like salt, this may not be the right choice), and cooked perfectly. We also got a side of the portobello fries (essentially deep fried mushrooms). They were very tasty, but I don't know if I'd order them again.

Throughout our meal, one of the managers circulated to check on every table and make sure everyone was enjoying their meal, which was a nice touch. 

Echo & Rig had SO many yummy sounding things on their menu, that I definitely would love to return to try some more of their offerings.",4,1,1

To start, as soon as you walk in the front door you notice right away they have a full butcher shop in the downstairs area of the restaurant. The had a full range of options from pork, beef, and an assortment of poultry. They do all of their cuts in-house which was a great sign for a steakhouse.
We were greeted enthusiastically by our hostess and then taken upstairs to the outdoor patio. Their menu for brunch is very well thought out and had a wide range of options with some fun interpretations of classic dishes such as their egg scramble but they add in house-made sausage, filet minion, potatoes, tomatoes and burrata cheese. I decided to go with their steak frites, a hearty potion of their rib eye, shorestring fries, and a fried egg. After my first bite of the rib eye I know I'll be coming back here for dinner service. The rib eye was cooked a perfect medium rare, an abundance of fat marbling creating one of the most tender and juiciest steaks I've had in a while. 
They also have quite an extensive drink menu with a great range of wines, beers, and craft cocktails to choose from. We decided to go with the bottomless mimosas and gosh were they generous. They kept our glasses full the entire time, used fresh OJ along with a decent champagne, and topped them with Maraschino cherries.
Service was top notch, we always had people checking in on us, clearing our plates, and offering very helpful knowledge on the menu. They were a little busy so even the manager came over to help our her staff which is a great thing to see.

Now for dinner...having a restaurant and butchery mixed into one can be a little ""dicey"", but they make it work. I thoroughly enjoyed the Spencer steak reasonably priced in the $20-$30 range depending on if you want a la carte sauces and sides. They categorize their sides into 3 sections, each category based off price. We had the Mac 'n' Cheese and Sweet Potato, both being perfectly portioned for multiple people and extremely tasty.

Our waiter was unfortunately a little aggressive with the food and drink. He was pouring our waters  and drinks and spilled a bunch of water all over the table. When our food came out, he was scrambling to place the plates down because he had a lot. 

I had to have the steak since I am a huge steak person. GREAT STEAK! Great FOOD in general! When you're with great company eating great food with a great VIEW on the patio in Las Vegas, what is there to complain about? My mind was content, my heart was content, and most importantly, my stomach was content. 

I love Las Vegas and I will be coming back for more!!",0,0,0

Waiter couldn't tell how overdone it was without a flashlight??? After his thourough examination he agreed it was way overdone and said he would have it recooked. 2nd steak was an end cut of fillet with so many tendons I could not even cut it. A fillet should be tender enough to cut with a butter knife. Steak knife wouldn't even do the job. You would think 3rd time is the charm NOPE! 3rd steak very thin and again tendons prevented it from being able to be cut. We realized there was no sense sending it back so it was set aside. Shocked when there was no offer of any kind to make amends and charged $35.80 for a piece of rubber. Will never return.,1,0,0

I was out of town for half a year in 2016. So, I was pleasantly surprised when we cane back to Echo and Rigs for a great dinner with our out of town friends a week ago, to see its newly reconfigured, inviting first floor! Our guests were impressed with its locale; the high-ceiling entrance, facing the grand stair case; the charming bar and lounge on the left and the stylish butchery on the right! The butchery shop now looks more stylish with its glass display meat lockers and an attractive demo area.

The friendly, charming hostess greeted us warmly and seated in the gorgeous balcony upstairs (elevator accessible). As expected, we enjoyed our scrumptious dishes, drinks and the impeccable service from Sam and his crew, which was attentive, friendly, yet not overbearing! The nice Mgr, Xavior, also came by our table to say hello, and helped out when the restaurant got super busy. 

OUR DINNER: 

APPS - all 5*

1. Broccolini
- crunchy freshly and flavorful

2. Avocado toast
- Buttery and tasty!

3.  Fried spinach salad
- uncommonly crispy good! We ordered an extra! 

4. Portobello fries
- Simply must have! Yes, we ordered extra, too! 
 
MAINS 

1. Butcher cut - Skirt steak, with chips and mushroom, 4.0*
- Juicy, flavorful; a bit tough to cut

2. Butter Fish, 5*
- Flaky, tasty, buttery!

3. Steakhouse Cut- Filet mignon with chips and Rockefeller mushroom, 5*
- Melts in mouth tender, juicy and flavorful! 
We had 2 orders, BOTH mouthwatering good! Two of us ordered the same. 

Over the years, my wife and I have enjoyed lunch, happy hour and dinner here, and we often entertain our guests here. By the way, their specialty Tomahawk steaks continue to wow us!  The waiter would make an impressive presentation of the huge tomahawk steaks on a ginormous tray. We actually had them in 2 occasions and found them superb! But, their menu offer so many other delicious selections! 

I also like its happy hour (""HAPPIEST"" hour as they call it), 3-6 DAILY & 10p-1a M-Sat, featuring draft @$3, wine and well drinks @4; selected drinks FREE to LADIES! The bar dishes are $2+.

BOTTOM LINE: 

The quality of their dishes and service, and the casual yet almost elegant ambiance make us keep going back there for more. Our out of town guests like it so much that they even go back there by themselves!

Anyway, we started off with the Portobello fries. OMG, they are a must try. For my entree, I had the Tye dye salmon, which was delish. Their portions are just right!

1) It's so conveniently located by my office; it has become my second conference room.  (In case you don't know, it's located at Tivoli Village.)
2) Valet is right there! It takes me less than a minute to walk from the valet to the entrance of the restaurant, in three-inch heels! 
3) No one ever says no to Echo & Rig whenever I suggest this place, and I usually deal with picky\/snobby eaters. 
4) Service is always phenomenal.  They always make it a point to ask whether you're a first-timer or not.  They like to welcome you back and warmly greet new guests and explain the culture of the restaurant (this place is chef-owned, by the way).  For me, that's a plus because it gives me a couple minutes to breathe and watch someone else entertain my clients for a few minutes. 
5) The food is always exceptional.  My go-to is the duck because it is absolutely delicious, but the rib-eye cap is also heavenly.  If you do get the rib-eye cap, get it medium even though you like your steak medium rare like myself.  Due to the marbling of the cut, medium rare will make it too chewy.  I was a skeptic myself when the server suggested I have it cooked medium, and I made it a point to him that I will return it back to the kitchen if it's not good.  Needless to say, I didn't return it; it was perfection.  Yes, the portobello mushroom is their #1 seller, and yes, they are delicious.  Crab cakes are just ok even though it's 95% crab meat.  Caesars salad is well done if you really need a salad.  Their cauliflower is good and most people like it, but I like cauliflower without it being deep-fried, so I am biased.  
6) Extensive wine list and all their drinks are amazing and well done; the drinks keep getting better as you keep ordering...

i've since returned several times and now i'm at 3 stars.

upon each subsequent visit, i've experienced a problem that i hadn't the previous visit.
some of the problems i've encountered have been overcooked fish, inconsistent dishes (where one time it would be too salty, another time under seasoned, another time overcooked, another time perfectly cooked, etc.), pushy servers, forgetful servers, dirty dishes, dirty glasses, dirty flatware.
these are all things that i did not experience upon my initial visit but have been issues on every visit thereafter.

there are certain dishes that are always consistently delicious - portobello fries, grilled octopus, rainbow salad, kale salad, pumpkin squash, butternut ravioli.
then there are dishes that are sometimes good but other times not so good - black spaghetti, cauliflower, mac & cheese, bone marrow, garlic shrimp.
there are a few servers who are always consistently good and others that i would hate to have again.

i think my biggest issue with them is consistency.
the price is right, the concept is fantastic, the food is mostly good, they just need to be more consistent with food preparation and service.
and they really need to consider accepting reservations.
because at this rate, i would not be willing to wait over an hour for what may or may not be good food and\/or service.

After sending the plate back, I then received the same steak back (not a new one) that was completely charred. The only thing I could taste was this burnt, charcoaled flavor. The young and polite matrodie (or whatever title he held) noticed my displeasure and asked me how my meal was. After I showed him, it was obvious he was concerned.....BUT HE DIDN'T OFFER ME A NEW STEAK! They removed the charges from the bill, but I would have rather paid and received what I went to the place for. I ended up leaving the place hungry.  Very, very dissapointing.",0,0,0

That's how I have to describe my experience at Echo and Rig. 

Now, in all fairness, my doctor has banned me from eating red meat. I am not a vegetarian, vegan, or health nut. Therefore since I did not try their steaks, my review will be based on my experience of service and hospitality.

My wife had been here before, and just said it was ""so-so"". Why did we go here? Because my first choice didn't open for another 45 minutes, we felt Brio was less than medicore, and the other places in Tivoli were sandwiches, crapes, or Gringo Mexican,  and not real fare for dinner.

We were greeted by a very nice hostess, who took us upstairs, and wanted to seat us near the kitchen. Since the place was empty, I asked if we could be seated by the window. I was told that was ""a table for four"". After I showed signs of leaving, she reluctantly seated us here.

Our waiter, Jackson, started out okay, until we informed him we did not want any wine, and were not interested in alcoholic beverages. The ""air seemed to go out of his tires"", as we were not going to order items that raise the check and the corresponding tip.  After that it seemed like we were ""branded"" as ""undesireables"".

I told the waiter I was craving a large salad. He suggested the Arrugala Salad.

My wife ordered the Crab Cake and Trenne Pasta.

The Crab cake was decent. Better than what is served at  The Palm, and far better than what they try to pass off at The Yard House.

My wife's pasta and meat dish, was ""a cut above"" the Speghetti Factory. Pasta was over cooked, and the accompanying ingridients, an after thought.

My salad was very disappointing. Poor presentation, and very small portion. 
Had the waiter, Jackson, said, the salads here are meant for appetiziers, I would have ordered something elese. 

We also got a nasty stare, when we asked the food server for more bread. 

The saving grace, was the manager, Xavier. Very polite and doing his best to please. When I complained the Salad was not a satisfying meal, as the waiter told me it would be, he offered to take it off the check. Since I had consumed it, I said that would not be fair. 

He also offered to have the Chef, ""send something out"", but by then, the cold feeling we were left with by other staffers who looked at us like, ""you're not what we want here"", left us feeling unwelcome. 

Xavier is a good person, and tried to salvage the situation, by giving me his card, and telling me to contact him prior to coming back. I appreciated his thoughtfulness.

Again, in all fairness, this place is noted for its meat, not salads and pasta, and my friend Phillip, who I usually agree with, gives it a good rating. However, I was left with the impression that the staff ""judges a book by its cover"".

We were not dressed in designer clothes, and didn't have that trendy look when we walked in. The staff acted like we did not belong, and that's how we felt.

My wife might go back with her girl friends, but after getting the feeling that the staff  was looking at me with the thought of, ""why don't you go back to the Suncoast Buffet where you belong?"", I am done with this place.",7,1,2

Samuel was our server, he was super friendly, simply amazing and professional. Also, the chef (my bad I have short memory for names) actually explained to us about different dishes. We got the hanger steak (recommended by chef), lamb chop and a spaghetti, appetizers were thick bacon and fried chicken. Started with thick bacon, it has a very fatty flavor, totally what we were looking for, but just better. The fried chicken was awesome, it is crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside. My mother in law got the spaghetti ($12 ONLY!) It came with two big scallops and plenty of big shrimps. Very herbal taste and totally worth the price. I got the hanger steak ($22) medium rare, it's very juicy and tender and I enjoyed it a lot. The best thing was my husband's lamb chop ($17). We both agreed that it's the best lamb chop we have ever tasted. I kept trading my steak with his. It's just very flavorful and juicy! If he could i am sure he would totally swallow the bone! We also got to taste the pig's head cheese, it has a very interesting flavor and my husband and I both enjoyed it. It's certainly not something that everyone will like but if you have the courage, try this interesting dish. We are planning to order a roast pig's head when we head over with a bigger group!

Got the rib eye, portobello mushroom fries and egg with grilled tomato and the hot and bothered cocktail.

The cocktail was supposed to be bourbon based but it was so mildly burbony it mostly tasted of the avave syrup. So ya that's it the whole meal was ok.

Sometimes the bar service can be spotty if you are seated at a table, but the food always makes up for service, and other times the service is excellent.

My last three meals I have had the hanger steak and it never disappoints, it is flavorful and tender, in fact my Mom who had ordered the filet regretted her choice. The fried Portabella mushrooms are a favorite and always disappear quick. My meal came with Mushrooms Rockefeller and were wonderful. I can no longer eat gluten so many of these sides I need to scrape of the toppings but I will not hold my dietary limitations. The dessert we had an assortment of sorbets and they were outstanding. Our waiter overheard it was our birthday and delivered it with a candle and a great smile. He was attentive for our needs and was a great server, I wish I remembered his name. He was Latin and worked May 9th.

The dining room with its marble floors and high ceilings can be a little noisy. We requested to sit outside and they were able to accommodate us and it was absolutely wonderful. The setting is beautiful and weather permitting, it will be my first choice.

I also love their wine list, be sure to check it out online, it is not only extensive, but there are many options including ordering a half glass and I appreciate this when I am trying new wines or do not want a full glass. Very nice touch. I also love they have an great selection of sides, one can graze and be very satisfied.

Echo & Rig was phenomenal. Amazing food, excellent service, awesome price points, beautiful setting and ambiance. This is a what truly makes a memorable dining experience! 

My gal pals and I decided to come in celebration of my birthday, and it was indeed a memorable birthday dinner! We got lucky with the reservation, as late April is prom season (so make sure you reserve in advanced!). 

We ordered the Spencer steak, one with the red wine reduction sauce and one with the bleu cheese sauce, the linguini and clams, and the horseradish butterfish. 

The steaks were delicious, and cooked medium rare as we wanted. The red win reduction sauce is really something to rave about that...it was flavorful! The stuffed mushroom that came with it was a nice addition to the steak, and the homemade potatoes chips were well made. Not the greatest in terms of presentation, but a delectable dish nonetheless. 

The linguini and clams was such a refreshing dish! I haven't had a linguini dish that I've loved in quite some time...this was perfect! The sauce and spices used made the dish really enjoyable. It was flavorful but not overbearing, and went well with the perfectly cooked pasta and clams. The sauce was sooo good that we ate the remaining sauce with the complimentary bread! That's really saying something! 

The butterfish was also very soft and flaky and so enjoyable to eat. It just tasted like buttery fish! It was cooked to perfection, not overdone, and nice and crisp on the outside.

$1.99 Steak and Eggs
$1.99 Shrimp Cocktail
$1.00 Hot Dogs

Free Cocktail for the ladies
Free double upgrade on premium well drinks for the gentlemen
$10 pitchers of beer

Sometimes, you just want a little snacky-snack and not a heavy dinner especially this late at night. We happened to be in the area on TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS...

On our first attempt, we call in just to confirm that they are doing happy hour. The woman on the other line says yes, gives us a rundown of the days, hours, items, etc. 
Upon arrival, the hostess(maybe the same person we spoke to earlier) apologizes to us saying that there will be NO HAPPY HOUR because there was a ""Back of the house brawl"" type contest going on!?!? I was so ready to brawl with one of the sides of beef  hanging in the butcher shop Rocky Balboa style!!! Did we not just speak to you over the phone? Or was it another airhead that we called where our conversation went in one ear and out the other?

Time passes, and we decide to give it another go after a great evening(so far) this time, after waiting about 10 minutes one of the waiters drops off a dinner menu, and mentions that we can order anything off the dinner menu!?!? We try and get answers to what's going on, and I overhear him telling two other parties across from us(who also came for HH) that they are NOT serving the Happy Hour items. We express our disappointment that this is the second time we came here, and again we are denied? WTH??? The waiter AND bartender were supposedly going to check with the manager on duty to get some answers. Within that 18 minute span, the bartender whips up a complimentary ladies' cocktail for Wifey, and tries to get my drink order...TWICE and I politely tell him that I'd like to order some food first, because at this point, we still didn't have answers. We flagged the Hostess down and  hoped that she could get us answers. She disappears upstairs TWICE for a few minutes, and upon her return, this is what she told us: (**The manager on duty never came down because he was ""tied up"" on a phone call-at 10:30 pm? Right...)

""The cook who manages the Happy Hour Menu had an emergency and we are short staffed, HUH??? The Hostess also softly ""but my manager said it would be okay to order the HH Hot Dogs."" What's this? A pity party\/consolation prize??? At this point, it was just ridiculous. So you mean to tell me that there is NO ONE on the line that can duplicate the Happy Hour items except for the cook who went home? Let's see...there's the Executive Chef, Sous Chef, and Lead Cooks in each station...Three smaller, easier items cannot be duplicated, but you are still able to cook anything off a bigger dinner menu? It just makes no sense.
In every kitchen I've worked in, we served every item on the menu regardless if  we were short staffed or not. 

I'm even gonna side with John Curtas and agree that the butcher shop is not the brightest thing in that spot right now. Why not do like your big brother Bottega Louie
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/bottega-louie-los-angeles and put in a patisserie??? Not only is Bottega Louie making a daily killing from all their desserts and pastries, they are nearing almost 8000 reviews which makes them one of the most, if not THE MOST Yelped business! It definitely beats staring at carcasses and cuts of raw meat IMO... Let's hope you can get some consistency in your food and service, but for now, I'm VERY disappointed in you Echo & Rig...ALOHA!!!

portabella mushroom plate always great. the butterfish was a hit as well.
flat iron steak a good inexpensive choice, nice recommendation by waiter.
asparagus and egg....funny but worked. mac and cheese, can't go wrong.
bacon plate, again good, not spectacular (in lieu of missing pork belly).
watermelon salad was nice and refreshing and the butternut ravioli was nice too

only slight miss would have been octopus salad, would probably pass on next time
didn't really care for the devils chicken either (in lieu of duck....boo!)

for dessert, we had the berry shortcake, good, but not outstanding
salted caramel sundae......this was a hit....not sure if we liked better than the dark chocolate cherry, but next time we will do both for side by side comparison!

One drawback, I know we went on a Monday, but they seemed to be out of a few dishes again. missed out on the duck confit, which we were dying to try and the pork belly, which the waiter recommended only to come back to tell us they were out of

think it would be nicer if the wait staff were fully prepped as to the items on the menu which would be unavailable that day. we went around 5pm, so its not like they just ran out. would have saved us from a few disappointments

in any case, a nice visit again, this place is definitely on out fav list!",0,0,0

I ordered the Rib-Eye Cap steak because it says limited quantities.  Now I usually like my steak to be rare, very rare but the server suggested I get this as a medium -- good choice.  It came out perfect.  We got the Brussels Sprouts as our veg and it comes as leaves from the sprout, not as halved pieces.  Very nice.  I can't comment on the dessert since we were too full from the salad, steak, and veg.  One item to note, the drinks are prepared downstairs and brought up sort of en mass, so you might have a slight wait to get you Manhattan.
One item that is sort of funny was when the hostess seated us she asked me where I was from and what I did for work: Milwaukee & small manufacturing company.  A few minutes later the manager stopped by to welcome us and mention he know we were in town from Milwaukee.  Tattle-tail hostess.
I think this was a fun, classy steakhouse that is affordable since it's nowhere near The Strip.  Stop in and tell the hostess you're a film producer or Justin Bieber's personal pilot and see where it goes from there.  :-)",0,0,1

Dinner we opt for steak and our go to sides of choice tend to be the broccolini, roasted squash and brussel sprouts. We recently had dinner with a friend who ordered the fried spinach salad, butter fish and heirloom carrots. All of which were so yummy! Really, you can't go wrong!

Sat us up next to the kitchen (not happy at first) yet I will be honest and admit that it was not that bad and I did get to see what was going on especially by the man (picture) who ran the kitchen.
The waiter was good and friendly and very helpful with suggestions and I will say he was 100% correct on my $100 rib eye (picture) which was cooked perfectly.
I had a drink call the ""HOT MESS"" and it was so good I had to have several more.
I must also say that even though our waiter was good... the guy who helped out the waiter was a great helper who never once let anything go with out being there to correct the situation, serve us and even helped at end of the dinner... I never give the helper to the waiter but this gentleman was AWESOME and I did let the floor manager (picture) know about his awesome service.

But they do have a unique take that separates them from traditional steak houses.  In my book, nothing beats the ribeye and that's why it can be expensive.  Echo offers entres that are just parts of the ribeye for a small pricetag.  They also have other non traditional cuts and preparations named after people no one knows.

The appetizers and sides are very creative and more interesting than tasty.  We had the legendary fries, but I wasn't too impressed.

I took a chance and went with a flatsteak with a french name rather than my favorite ribeye just to try something new.  It was a mistake.  The edges were completely burnt.  I wanted to send it back but the waiter rarely came by the table and the cut was so small it didn't seem worth the trouble.

The next morning I was not well.  I definitely had food poisoning but I really don't know for sure if it was from Echo & Rig.  We had a big group and shared most the appetizers and I was the only one sick.  And I know it can take over 24 hours for the symptoms to show after you eat the poisoned food.  I'm just mentioning it because it was the last meal I ate before the sickness and I had a lite lunch the meal before no breakfast.

So to the food:

Brussel Sprouts - Excellent tasting, the nice lemon flavor and crisp brussel sprouts.

Cauliflower with peppers - If you like a little spicy kick and cauliflower this is a good side dish.

Spicy Sausage - Not bad, not too spicy but good flavors.

Crab cake - Decent, not a huge crab cake fan but still good.

Octopus salad - octopus was a little dry that I got, but the flavors were good. 

Bone Marrow Carne Asada -  AWESOME!  This is surprisingly really good.  The combination on top of a nice toasted bread.

Pumpkin Squash - A bit sweet, but I believe it's the sweetness of the squash.  Like a small grilled pumpkin.

Portebello Fries - Excellent appetizer, great pick as usual.

Pork Belly Grits - Not bad, pretty unique tasting.

Stir Fry Kale - Not bad, nothing that stands out.

Stuffed portebello - Decent, but didn't stand out compared to the other stuff.

Tomahawk Ribeye - Pretty tasty, cooked pretty tender.  A great thing we did get with this is a selection of the sauces, you need to ask for it though.  7 sauces tonight.

Black Spaghetti - DELICIOUS!  Still one of my favorite dishes here.  Nice lemony flavors with the sun dried tomatoes and seafood mix.  Highly recommended.",1,0,1

We had a large party of 11 with reservations but for some reason, the hostess sat the wrong group down and we waited even longer for them to accommodate us.  I was a bit annoyed at this situation since I checked in with them 3 times in a period of 15 minutes and told them where we were standing but they got mixed up with the other group (party of 9) and we were left standing there for another 15-20 minutes.  The managers apologized, there was nothing complimentary given but after eating there, it made up for the stars lost.  

Food here was amazing and at a decent price.  Their steak has a great char encrusted on both sides and cooked perfectly to my liking.  There are many sauces you can choose to pair with the steak.  Many different cuts but we went with the Rib-eye.  They also have larger cuts (Tomahawks) for large groups but we went with our individual cuts of meat.  

The side dishes are delicious.  I'd definitely recommend
- Asparagus with eggs
- Brussel sprouts
- Sweet cauliflower 
Each of these dishes has a grilled char or a roasted char which brings out amazing flavors from the vegetables.  Delicious and will definitely make you want another bite after another. 

Dessert - they have different sundaes which were delicious, but no unique desserts here.  

Service - was okay.  Our waiter was a bit bossy and some of my friends felt offended by how he addressed them.  I do understand that dealing with a large group is difficult, but maybe tone down the attitude just a tad bit.  

Ambience - clean, modern, slightly rustic.  Chairs were not the most comfortable.  

Even though the beginning was a rough start, the food made up for it and I'd definitely come back for the food.  There needs to be a new system for the hostess where they make a note on articles of clothing of the individual who checked in also verify if indeed it is the group they are seating.  

I was told the brunch here was something I need to check out as well, so next time!",3,1,1

Now I heard through the grapevine that Echo & Rig is from the same creators as Bottega Louie in DTLA, and being a native Angeleno, this restaurant is a staple in your life. I have not confirmed this, but the portobello mushroom fries are the same exact recipe to a T. So I'm hoping this is true!! 

Typically I just come here and order a ton of shared plates with my crew, so here are my suggestions: Tomato\/Watermelon salad, roasted broccolini, asparagus & fried egg, brussel sprouts (these are lemony and light, excellent summer dish), burrata, portobello fries, bone marrow carne asada (brilliant), garlic shrimp. I would not recommend the mac & cheese because it was kinda dry and a little bland. I've also tried the mache roasted chicken salad and the sea bass (sea bass was great, if you like a little salty). For wine I tried the Echelon chard, which was not impressive, but Stratton Lummis ""The Riddler Lot 4"" red blend was excellent!!  

I've sat upstairs and the service was incredible. I've sat downstairs @ the bar and the service was incredible. Last night our server was a bit odd, she did mention she was new, so I cut her some slack. But she didn't know which wine was which or what was in the blends. Aren't y'all supposed to be training your servers to know the wine before they serve it? Also, she snatched our ID's out of our hands after repeatedly asking for them when we already had them out on the table, and the third or fourth time she came around failed to ask us if we wanted another glass of wine (when our first ones were clearly finished). I get it - you're new. You're forgiven ONLY because I love the food, atmosphere, views, and music so much.

Echo & Rig = Bottega Louie. Happy native Angeleno Vegas transplant!",3,0,4

The atmosphere is more on the classy and higher end side. I came in with jeans and a hat, but it was all good. The restaurant center has valet parking for Free, so that always a plus.

After a long 3 days in the Vegas Strip, we branched out to the northern side of the strip and tried this restaurant. Entering the restaurant I noticed the staff was incredibly helpful. We were seated outside in the second floor. We first started with out drinks, I ordered an Arnold palmer and a water. My table then proceeded to start off with a the hawain poke small plate, some Portobello fries and a potato pancake. After our appetizers we continued with a grilled cheese sand which and a chicken breast sandwich.  Both were delicious and were served with unique fries. Every was delicious, but the things that I disliked the most was the food took to long to come out. I was starving and so were the people in our table. We waited a bit too long for our food, but other than that, the food was delicious.

It was a tad chilly outside, but they had heat lamps so it wasn't too bad. Not too fancy and big menu selection with decent prices. (Small salads: $9.30 & $11.40, soups $5.90, sandwiches $12.40, seafood dishes $21.70, entrees $19.60, side dishes $5.90\/8.20\/9.80, and various steak prices from $25.70-34.80) 

Started out with the first thing that caught our eye on the menu: PORTABELLO FRIES & HERB AIOLI. So incredibly delicious! Deep fried giant slices of mushrooms that were to die! If they weren't about 10$ an order, I think we would have gladly ordered 5 of those alone! 

FOR HIM: He ordered the COLORADO LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS that came with peewee potatoes, dried apricots and violet mustard. Well cooked and flavored, okay size for a $20 steak. He asked if there was a way to get a side of rice and they said no... even though I swear I saw rice included with a few of the entrees. But he devoured the whole thing easily and was overall satisified.

FOR HER: I ordered the JUMPING BEEF which were filet mignon tips, roasted tomatoes, red onions, crispy potatoes and peruvian demi-glace. Very flavorful I must say, but was a little disappointed with only 4 little pieces of meat and the ""crispy potatoes"" it was topped with were french fries. I did enjoy the roasted tomatoes! Luckily I wasn't too hungry from already eating the portobello fries and bread with butter, otherwise I don't think this meal would have filled me up ordinarily. 

Overall, a good dining experience. Wasn't too happy about being outdoors in the cold weather (and I would complain about that more if I wasn't dressed warmly that day with a long sleeve sweater & thigh high boots) and would have loved to dine inside, but the service was excellent and food was flavorful!

This place is right by my house and I intend to become a regular. The decor is fantastic, as is the service and the food quality. 

The place was packed and we had a 45 minute wait. It wound up being more like an hour, but it's close enough. We asked for bread because we were starving. We asked for bread 3 more times from 2 separate people and we finally got it. I gave them a pass because the servers were running their asses off. The service was so good that they even helped us play jokes on the table across from us that was having a family dinner. We may have happened to know the people at that table, so don't just try that on complete strangers. 

My first time here, I split a gigantic flinstones-esque tomahawk steak. They even bring out the steak and show it to you before taking it back to the kitchen to cook it. That was a nice touch. If you want bigger or smaller, you can let them know and they will accommodate. They warned us that the steaks take a while since they're so thick. We didn't mind, we finally had bread to snack on. It tasted fantastic, albeit cooked slightly less than we had ordered it. Every bite was incredible. 

Another awesome thing about Echo & Rig is that they sell raw steaks to go, and at pretty reasonable prices to boot. I need to stop in soon and pick some up to grill up at home. 

My only real knock is that this place doesn't take reservations. That's always a bummer. A reservation would have improved our experience by cutting down on the wait time tremendously. Oh well, can't win em all. If you are a carnivore and haven't tried Echo & Rig yet, you are overdue! Just make sure to give yourself time, you'll be doing a fair amount of waiting.",6,1,5

But I have to give special recognition to the manager, Kevin. Charming. Charismatic. Confident. And he's young. I'm guessing 25, 26. So he was raised right. Trained right. And a delight to interact with.

As soon as you enter, you'll see the place is unique, with a large butcher counter and organic juice bar on the floor level. The people behind the counters are smiling and engaging and are happy to tell you anything and everything about the sumptuous foods they're preparing. That includes where it came from as well as recipes for the specific cut you want.

Upstairs, via stairs or elevator, is the restaurant and kitchen. The kitchen is open for everyone to see with about a dozen cooks who really know their stuff. When I visited, the co-owners\/head chefs, Frank & Sam, were both there and I got to meet them. They are genuinely nice guys. So nice in fact, they served us a complimentary lamb porterhouse steak, which wasn't even on the lunch menu! This was after I told them I came all the way from Los Angeles to try their lamb. It was so good, I nearly cried.

All the food is delicious, we tried things from every portion of the menu: Portobello mushroom fries, burrata (cheese), charcuterie plate (assorted pates and deli meats), pepper fries, arugula salad, cauliflower with spices, the hanger steak sandwich (super good!), and even some of their ice cream desserts. EVERYTHING is made from scratch including all sauces, breads, deli meats, and desserts. They are primarily a butcher shop, so you can expect the highest quality of meat compared to anywhere. Their signature cut of beef is the hanger steak, which is not easy to get at most places because a single cow only yields a few ounces of it. Yet E&R has it at the ready AND at a good price.

The service is good, it's much like fine dining with a team of very courteous people flying around the table, each with their designated tasks. The thing that will win you over is the value. You get the same (if not better) food quality you would expect from a place like Spago or Mastro's, but it's half the price. YES, HALF.

If there has to be a negative, it's that it's a ways off of the Vegas Strip. About 15 miles (20 min) separates E&R from your favorite Strip hotel, but in light of that, there's a valuable thing I learned by going here. The best food you can find in any city is intended for local customers, NOT tourists. So get away from the sparkly lights and overpriced, mediocre buffets and taste something so good, it might bring tears to your eyes!",1,0,0

For my my entree I ordered the lasagna which exceeded my expectations. (This isn't an Italian restaurant and they quite obviously specialize in steaks) For dessert we had the seasonal sorbet & berries, apple pie & the caramel turtle. ALL AMAZING.

This is one of my favorite spots for the $$!  I have been here a few times now and each time I have been completely satisfied with the excellent quality they consistently put out and the reasonable price.  I'm not saying that it's my favorite steakhouse, but again, for the money, it is certainly one of the best around!

They are a butcher and a steakhouse.  This makes for a unique feel as you enter, but there's more... The steakhouse means that they have several regular cuts of meat on their menu all the time...the butcher part means that you can order from the shop to-go...but it also means that several additional cuts are available routinely that are not on the menu but sold per ounce.  Steaks are seasoned well and cooked beautifully.  I would not hesitate to order with confidence any cut that you fancy on or off the menu.

The real standouts for me are the small plates.  They have 30 different veggie and small plates that range from $5.50 - $9.30.  On this list you will find such taste-bud copulations as Grilled Octopus w\/ Gigante Beans, Bone Marrow Carne Asada, Maryland Lump Crab Cakes, Asparagus & Fried Egg, and their now famous Portobello Fries w\/ Aioli...start with these, then venture out to the Sweetbread Nuggets, Steak Tartare, Brussels Sprouts, and Mussels Mainiere...Looks like I need to try more of their veggies next time!

If you are here with a group of 6 - 8 you might want to see what Ribeye Tomahawks they have (or if you happen to eat on your own like a Thunder Cat.)  This cut receives nice flavor from the bone and marbling, and slices up nice to share.  All of their steaks come with the option of the following sauces: Blue Cheese, Red Wine Demi, Green Pepercorn, Bernaise, Charred Onion, Horseradish Cream, or Lemon Chimichurri...I'm a succker for the more traditional Bernaise.

E&R is a great place to take a date and share some of the small plates...or come with a group and order by the ounce.  Did I mention that they don't have a corkage fee here?...well they don't, so bring in your favorite bottle of vino.

They also have some incredible looking Happy Hour prices, but I have not sampled any of these options. I have however tried the wonderful boutique hand scrubs in the restrooms, and I'm a fan.

Come here for remarkable food for the price point
Come here with a group open to sharing and trying a lot of options
Come here for fancy hand creams in the bath room
Come here for a trendy date spot with a modern distressed interior
Either way...you should come check it out

If you tired of the strip scene, check out Echo & Rig. It's near Red Rock Hotel & Casino. Located in the west side of Vegas in Tivoli, Echo & Rig serves dry-aged beef. We tried the Porterhouse and Tomahawk Ribeye along with a crispy cauliflower side, arugula salad, and portobello fries. We ordered the steaks medium-rare. Our server brought out the uncooked meats to us and we chose our selections. Steaks were served pre-cut, so you'll need to eat fast otherwise the meat will get cold quite fast. I particularly liked the New York side of the Porterhouse. Tender, meaty, and plenty of umami flavor from each bite. They cook the steaks over red oak, so you can taste the smoky flavor. Don't get me wrong, the Tomahawk Ribeye was good too. Fatty, tender, and meaty best describes the ribeye. My least favorite, albeit very good, was the filet side of the Porterhouse. It was a bit too soft and a tad gamy. 

My favorite side was the crispy cauliflower. It's a must order. Slightly dusted with chili and subtle seasoning from the onions made this side well worth it. More than what I was expecting from a cauliflower dish. The portobello fries and arugula salad were standard fare. 

Service was prompt and courteous. We sat outside and the breeze was nice on a June evening day in LV. Sip that gin or whiskey, and you'll be glad to have visited this steakhouse.",2,0,1

Only one visit so far but will happily go back. The service as a whole was stellar, hostesses, sommelier - fab. Our server specifically - could have been better. When dining on christmas eve...all is forgiven. 

made resos three days before..thanks for accommodating us! 

three diners this outing, we ordered for starters - portobello fries (great), pork belly, w\/grits (ehh?) - maybe the menu should have said the reverse, what was delivered was way more grits\/polenta - so, this is how i think of this side. and mac & cheese - should have moved this to come with our main.

*i was wrangled in :( on my ordering of sides..

for din din - broccolini with garlic and mashied potatios (mash pots - for the needy) both decent. 

our party of  our three, we ordered two caps and i ordered the strip. 
Steaks are ""wood grilled"" - okay, probably more char and a tiny bit more well done that you would usually have, just listen to your server, that is what they are here for. - my strip was good at medium rare, the caps (swanky butchers cut), was good. cap was better that night at the restaurant, my leftover strip was better the next day (as leftovers, just saying!) 

happily go back, hope this local endevour makes it - real output, real delivery.

My second time here and the service is pretty good. Your mimosas never touch the bottom which is always a great thing. (Bottomless is 16 and for bloody Mary's its 22).The food for brunch is mediocre at best. So far we had the steak frites, the New York sandwich and the steakhouse scrambled, all three meals were nothing to brag over. And to be honest, it's very disheartening because the decor and the vibe from this place is awesome. 
Maybe I should try the dinner sometime? 

So to recap, decor check, service check, food the box remains empty but the bottomless mimosas keep us coming back.

Rest assured, you will not leave this establishment hungry. I was part of a group of 6, and we were going to dinner to celebrate\/mourn my departure from Vegas after a month of visitation (my girlfriend lives here, and I'm on break from school). When we were seated we were greeted by one of the managers (I assume) who did an exemplary job of running through just about EVERYTHING on the menu and what her personal recommendations were. In addition, the waitress we had for the rest of the evening (her name was Nina and was such a sweetheart) was very attentive and also very informative in regards to the cuts of steak and special bone-in options that were available. +2 for knowledgeable wait staff. 

Our group decided to split 7 appetizers, tapas-style before we each got our steaks. The highlights included Grilled Thick Cut Bacon with Barbecue Sauce, Bone Marrow Carne Asada (beef marrow bone garnished with carne asada, peppers, onions, and crostini...SUPERB), Sweetbreads with pickled cabbage, and Butcher's Sausage, and Portobello fries with herb aioli (pretty much the best fried mushrooms you'll ever have). I'm aware that's pretty much 5 of the 7 appetizers, but they really were all that good.

Then came the steaks. As far as steakhouses go, I'm not very experienced. I got the rib eye with a green peppercorn sauce and though it was good, but not great. This is where the value comes in; the VERY reasonable price (35 dollars for NY strip, filet mignon, and rib eye cuts) makes it extremely hard to complain. My steak was also quite fatty (about 1\/3 of the steak was gristle), but that is to be somewhat expected with a cut like rib eye. Sides were also excellent (Garlic mashed potatoes and broccolini). At the end of the meal, we were surprised by a complementary desert  of sea salt caramel ice cream and coffee from our waitress for the occasion. It was definitely appreciated.

- Food is delicious, but it takes a LONG time to get to the table. You should probably have a snack before you come or you'll be really hangry waiting for your food.
- We saw Siegfried (without Roy) there.
- The mac & cheese is the best I've had in a long time. Never had portobello anything, but the fries have opened my eyes--great dipping sauce.  The pumpkin squash is fabulous.  The garlic mashed potatoes are nothing special--you can skip them.

I ordered the crab cake it was delicious this was actually a crab cake with crab in it, was perfectly done. However the butternut squash which on paper sounded great was overdone squash under seasoned with a little tiny glob of some stratacella cheese it was supposed to have pumpkin seed and honey there was no pumpkin seeds in the dish and if there was honey it was undetectable.
The jumping beef was barely edible, it just tasted  like Worchester sauce. it's really more like a soup with one or two pieces of meat, and they put french fries in it ? not really understanding the concept being this this is a  upscale restaurant. french fries come on some nice red potatoe fingerlings or something and remove the overdose of Worcestershire sauce.

This place seemed busy from the get-go. My family and I had arrived 10 minutes late for our 8 o'clock reservation and was sat after a 15 minute wait. ""The first floor included a bar area (only enter if you are over 21 with an ID) and some round tables and chairs. It seemed like a waiting room. The music was already loud. There's a butcher shop downstairs as well.

Service 5\/5
When we arrived at our table, we were quickly greeted by the manager, Jason, who was very friendly and explained that he liked introducing himself to people who have never ate at Echo & Rig before. Cool beans! 

We were offered our choice of sparkling or flat water, complimentary, for each person at the table. Jason came back to explain the concept of the restaurant and a rundown of the menu and source of food (everything is fresh, basically!) Great information to know :)

Sam was our server and was very friendly as well. Not sure what my dad had asked, but Sam left and came back with a giant trey full of raw meat for the steak options. We ordered the Tomahawk steak, medium rare. 

Food: 4.5\/5
Not sure if they forgot the bread until last minute but the bread came a while after we ordered everything, very close to when the appetizers arrived. Anyhow it was still good as I was starving. The bread comes with very creamy butter. 

Our appetizers came shortly after the bread. Per Sam's suggestions, we ordered the Watermelon Tomato Salad and Portobello Mushroom Fries. 

The salad was very different -- yellow and red tomatoes mixed with sweet watermelon pieces topped with a vinaigrette sauce (reminds me of the sauce on mozzarella salads). I didn't love it but found it pretty good. May have to try it again for a real opinion.  The fries were delicious! The green sauce for the fries had a buttery taste to it that just fits perfectly with the mushroom fries. 

Next came our entree. The tomahawk steak was done at the most perfect level of ""medium rare"" I have ever seen. My arms had hurt this today (lol arm day!!) so I had a weak grip on everything. Yet without using force, the steak was easily cut into pieces. The four choices of sauce were in the cutest little gravy cups. Great to have these four choices -- my family and I were able to try all the different sauces! The two dark ones I didn't enjoy too much (one was red wine I believe and the other had an A1 Sauce flavor to it). The two light ones were better (one had a slight cheesy flavor and the other had a very rich flavor I couldn't explain, but this yellow one was my favorite). 

Accompanying the steak were the side dishes: grilled corn, roasted airloom carrots, and some chip dish I didn't particularly enjoy. The grilled corn was very rich in herbal flavor (something my mom didn't like at all). I'm indifferent about it... Would be wary with ordering this if you don't like strong herb tastes. The carrots were really good, fluffy and soft, with a slight burnt taste that made the overall flavor oddly delicious. 

We ended our meal with one of each seasonal sorbet (and for us, the flavors were peach, blackberry, and grapefruit). Topped with real fruit, I loved this! On the downside, I came here for my birthday but I wasn't able to get a special dessert or anything :( but I can't get everything haha. 

We shared all these dishes between four people perfectly and it was around $40 per person. Not too bad for the price!

Color me impressed! My first experience with Echo & Rig was quite positive. You can count on me to come here again for another occasion and bringing a fellow steak-lover.

BRUNCH REVIEW
Bottomless mimosas and bloody mary option for $16, which is one of the more affordable bottomless options I've seen. It really was bottomless... our server, I forgot her name (but she was blonde), was so delightful and always made sure to fill our cup. In addition to that, she was hilarious and very interactive with our table. It was also great because they gave the orange juice and champagne separate, giving you the ability to make your mimosas just the way you like it.

My friend and I both ordered the steak scramble eggs and short ribs to share. Even though we both shared two dishes, we had leftovers. Both were good options though I would opt to try something else on the menu next time. The food is definitely a lot better for dinner but still great to try.",12,8,11

We were warned that Tuesday was their busiest night but we didn't expect to wait for a table for over an hour. However, that gave us time to check out the butcher case and speak with one of the butchers, Kilan. He offered us a bite of some beef jerky they made the previous night, which was delicious. Also, the butcher working the cold meats section near the stairs took pity on us and offered a little appetizer which was also good.

We finally got seated at our table. Unfortunately, it was right next to the kitchen and in a draft zone. Whenever someone opened the door to the patio, the cold air swept in. Again, manage my took pity on us and tried to warn their servers to close the door behind them. Sometimes they forgot so we had to get up ourselves to shut the door. 

We ordered the calamari and crab cakes for appetizers and they were both delicious. The aoli for the calamari was perfect. I had a couple of bites of my friend's over-the-rainbow salad and I wanted to order one for myself since it was so good. I ordered the skirt steak with a chimichurri sauce for my main course. My steak was cooked perfectly but was a bit on the salty side. I also ordered a side of roasted cauliflower which was fantastic. On the other hand, my boyfriend ordered the jumping beef which was apparently filet mignon with peppers and onions and a kind of light gravy. It came a little too well done when he had asked for it to be medium rare so he only ate a few bites. The coffee dessert was a nice ending to my meal and everyone else enjoyed their desserts. 

Service was great, everyone was exceptionally friendly. Food was ok\/good with the exception of the well done beef, which was comped along with a few of the desserts. I would come back and give this place another try.",2,0,0

The waiters are so knowledgeable. My father, God knows why, insists on well done steak. When he order the cut he wanted, the waiter politely suggested he try a different cut or have his choice butterflied in order to avoid overcooking on the outside. It was so refreshing to have a suggestion along with an explanation. Often it can feel like you are being pressured into a more expensive cut, but this was the opposite.

The brandied mushroom sauce was AMAZING, as was the blue cheese sauce. Oh and dessert...We don't usually have dessert, but these were delicious sundaes and reasonably priced. The cappuccino sundae wad fantastic!!

The staff is generally pleasant and personable, while the service is on point with exception of our last visit.

Excellent:
Bone Marrow Carne Asada
Pork Belly & Spicy Slaw
Baked Brie in Sourdough
The Spencer Steak

Good:
Grilled Octopus
Over the Rainbow Salad
Sea Bass

Underwhelming:
Jumping Beef (it's more of a stew with poor quality, chewy meat)
Flat Iron Steak Sandwich (poor quality meat)

The menu offers some hits, and is a great place for reasonably priced medium quality steaks. I really disliked the Jumping Beef because I hate stews and that is exactly what it was, but the menu does not describe it as such. The service is generally pretty consistent.

As a matter of fact, Ramon, our server this most recent time was amazing and we appreciated everything, he certainly improved the experience. 

I tried Echo and Rig for the first time about a year and a half ago, my boyfriend and I loved the food and experience and from then on came for all special occasions including; our birthdays, anniversaries & valentines day. We even recommended it to our friends and family who have also made it their celebration destination. Which brings me to our most recent experience on May 21, 2016, for my sisters birthday. I called almost a week ahead of time to make a reservation, the hostess asked if it was a special occasion & if we had any special requests. I requested to be sat on the patio, as it is a much nicer experience than sitting inside (personal preference). The hostess assured me this would not be a problem because I had made the reservation so early. We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation, we checked in and sat in the bar area. The hostess told me that they were running a bit behind but would seat us a quickly as possible. I did not consider waiting a few extra minutes to be a problem, 30 minutes later we still had not been sat, so we went to check on the reservation. At this point we were not mad but we were frustrated, as the whole point in making a reservation is to avoid the wait. The hostess then told us that they were running behind due to prom and that they would seat us as quickly as possible. At 8:15 we were called by the hostess, 45 minutes late but we were happy that we were finally being seated. She takes us to a table inside. After waiting 45 minutes we weren't going to get a table outside as requested, after being assured that this would not be a problem. We spoke with a manager, he said he would have us wait a few more minutes at the table inside, get us started and then move us to a table outside. At that point we were all extremely angry because we had a 7:30 reservation and still hadn't been sat but were doing our best to understand, as we know that you can't control how long people stay at the table. So, we asked that they open the bottle of wine that we had brought so we could kill more time with a cocktail. He said he would get a decanter & take care of this right away, 10 minutes past and we had no wine glasses, no decanter and still no wine. Finally after asking another server who walked by where our wine was the manager came back over with no decanter & opened the bottle of wine. About 5 minutes later we were sat outside, at that point we had waited an hour for our reservation.... The manager explained that Ramon would be our waiter and that the manager who oversees the meal would ensure our experience from here on out was great. He also asked Ramon to get us started with something special, as I mentioned Ramon was great! However, they brought out a two salads for the table as well as a fresh fruit salad. This was very nice of them, however, they didn't ask what our table would prefer when it came to the salad options... I was a bit disappointed with that considering the experience we had already had. Also, the manager never came over to speak with us, apologize or address the problem. This was the second poor experience I have had when it came to seating. I feel this may be an ongoing problem that needs immediate attention. 

Echo and Rig used to be where we celebrated our special occasion, after this most recent experience we will not be back. We have a birthday celebration coming up and we have already decided to go to another steakhouse.",1,0,0

We ordered lamb cigars, brie in sourdough, bone marrow carne asada, beef tartare, portobello fries, and barramundi. I would highly recommend any of these dishes, although the bone marrow was my favorite and my boyfriend liked the lamb cigars. The barramundi was cooked perfectly with crispy skin. I would also like to mention that our busser was very attentive. When he came to take our plates, he saw me trying to brush off some bread crumbs and used his crumb scraper to clean up the whole table.

We waited about 20 minutes and were seated. The manager came to the table to introduce our waiter. He promptly took our drink orders then.... Disappeared. He was chatting with the table next to us for awhile before we got his attention. 

When we finally ordered, we ordered appetizers and meals all together. We were so hungry! So we told him to being everything out as soon as it was done. He was nice though. It was brunch, and he let us order the Mac and cheese and cauliflower from the lunch menu. 

The initial round of appetizers came out. But we're sitting right next to the kitchen. And those 2 orders of Mac and cheese (which can only be ours) is sitting under the earner light.. Its been there for 15 minutes.

 .....

Yay! We finally get our food! It is now 3:02pm. We waited about an hour to get our main course. And everything came out all at once. Including those 2 orders of Mac and cheese we saw sitting on the line. Everything tasted pretty good. But 3 of us ordered the burger. We all asked for it to be cut in half. Only one was. 2 were supposed to be medium, 1 was supposed to be medium raw. But all 3 came out medium raw and cold. Like so very pink\/red in the middle that I questioned if I could eat it. I'm pregnant so I can't take chances. I left it alone. Instead, I ate up the rest of my husband's grilled cheese. That was VERY GOOD. 

Even though the Mac and cheese sat there for a long time, it was amazingly still cheesy and tasted quite delicious. 

Overall everyone liked their food. (Except the raw burgers) and the fact that it was all rather cold already. The experience was nice. At the end, the server gave us a free sundae of our choice because it was my sister's birthday. 

But if you're in a hurry. You can't eat here. We got here at 1:45p and are leaving now at 3:55p. And its not because we sat around chatting. We spent a majority of our time just waiting on food (chatting too of course) but the food took very long!

The fried calamari is dismissible and not fried crispy. The bacon is delicious however and I would recommend their portobello fries.

We tried a few cocktails to start: 
1] Sweet Passionate Love - Gin, lychee liquor, green chartreuse, fresh passionfruit and lime juice, with citrus soda. I love gin and this was a great combination of flavors and not too sweet. There was a decent amount of alcohol in there, tbh I was pretty buzzed by the time our entrees arrived. 

2] A Rye Manhattan - Crown Royal Rye, Vermouth, and Tiki Bitters. This was a really strong drink IMO, but my BF seemed to like it. 

For our entrees we both went with the Rib-Eye Cap - they advertise it as being ""the absolute best part of the rib eye."" And I'll have to agree that the flavors were excellent, the meat was cooked to the perfect medium rare, and the presentation was just excellent. The meat was great on it's own, but we also got to try the Brandied Mushroom and Charred Onion sauces and both were delicious as well.

I love the idea of having a full butchery with an upscale steakhouse in one spot. They offer all cuts of meat and charcuterie and when I was onsite a few weeks ago, one of the butchers offered a guest to come in back and watch her filet a leg of beef. WHAT?!!?!? AWESOME! They have a full bar, (the bloody mary knocks my socks off!) and although we were not in for happy hour, the downstairs area can seat about 20-30 guests easily. The upstairs offers a full dining room , open kitchen and outdoor balcony with seating for guests. The bathrooms are big, roomy and always clean. I love that they offer a salt scrub for ladies to wash their hands after they grub done on some bone in meat! I have been here on two occasions, once for a dinner with a big family and once for brunch with another couple. Both times the food was outrageously good and the price point, well... on point.  Of course for dinner our table order steak, we went with the special of the night which was a huge cut of steak but family style for our table to share. We also had a multitude of appetizers (Bone Marrow! You're in a steakhouse! GET IT! And the french onion soup is EXACTLY what you think you should get when you see it on a steak menu) and the desserts were tasteful and elegant. But what is still sticking with me is the brunch items. I am a sucker for Corn Beef Hash with a poached egg. I absolutely hate ground up corn beef. Who makes a beautiful corn beef then grounds it up like dog food paste? YUK! And don't get me started with a ""poached egg"" that has a hard boiled middle. My dish executed by Rig was outstanding. OUT FREAKING STANDING! It was so tender, flavorful and so well done. I can taste it now. I want it now! HA!  So here are the down points, it can get busy and I have had service where I needed to grab some ones attention. The place was packed so Ill give them a slight break... my drink was never empty and that was a plus in a very slammed eatery. I also think that the upstairs when not dimly lite can be a bit sterile feeling like a cafeteria. For being in Tivoli they can add a bit of piazza and still keep it in line.

This place was PHENOMENAL! I can't overstate how amazing the meal was. My boyfriend's the steak expert and chose this place because of the in-house butcher shop, and it didn't disappoint. 

We stuck to their normal menu, although they did have a few special cuts for that night. Both of us got a steak and we split three of their sides. I had the bavette steak, which they recommended to be done medium rare. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and melted in your mouth. They're not small steaks but not overwhelmingly large. For the sides, we went with their baked brie, their bone marrow, and their mashed potatoes. All three were amazing and good sizes, and the mashed potatoes might even have been too large of a portion. 

The ambiance is very upscale and intimate without being pretentious. Our servers were both completely sweet and incredibly helpful, and the general manager even came around to make sure everything was alright. 

Between the two of us, with appetizers, drinks, steak, and dessert, the bill wasn't even $150 after tip. I'd consider that a steal for the quality of food and atmosphere. We will be back!",0,0,0

The food is amazing, the butcher shop is priceless, and the prices are reasonable.  My problem is with the staff.  I have been to this restaurant over a dozen times and, in the beginning when the restaurant first opened, the staff was very attentive and concerned that customers were taken care of.  I can't say that anymore, especially in the bar.  I stopped at Echo and Rig recently to buy from the butcher shop.  It was only 4 pm.  I ordered the sausage I came for and went to have a HH drink. The bartender  -- a blonde woman -- was at the far right end of the bar talking to ladies intimately as if they were her friends. I sat on the left between two women and waited. Then, another woman sits down to the left of me and the bartender comes over with a drink already made for her .. walks right past me and says nothing. Apparently, another friend. Then she walks past me again, not even a glance! Eventually, she comes back to talk to the new woman who is definitely a friend. I interject, asking about HH. She tosses a flyer to me and keeps walking.  It's not busy at all so I'm beginning to think it's a girl's bar .....she was laughing with the ladies at the end of the bar.   I left. Got my sausage from the wonderful butcher and went home.  I won't stop going to this restaurant.  But will only go for the butcher and for the food but, I won't be sitting at the bar any time soon.  I've heard similar complaints about the wait staff in the diningroom  from friends and I'm hoping beyond hope that it isn't true",0,0,0

I asked for a nice New York, 26oz or so.  The Waiter came back saying they only had a 20 - 21oz.  OK, I guess. Turns out they make cuts ahead of time, bring them around on platters, and you pick from that. 

My Wife ordered the Rib Eye Cap.  Waiter comes back 5 minutes later saying they ran out of Caps.  Ordered a Tomahawk Rib eye (much more than she wanted) to get the cap from that.  Wow, so far 0-2, and it was only 6PM. Made me wonder what the choices would be available at 8PM.

Onward.  Drinks come, Appetizers come, Wine comes, all very good.  Then....

My New York Steak.  
Impossible to cut with the supplied steak knife.  The reason? Gristle.  1\/3 of the steak was inedible gristle and fat.  When the waiter came by to check on our status, I pointed that out, he apologized, but that was that.  No manager to come by and at least check the plate of Gristle and perhaps replace the steak.

Her Tomahawk Rib Eye.
Cooked to perfection.  She enjoyed the cap part and gave me the rest since my steak was all but unedible.

Being local, and living in the area we like trying different restaurants available to us.  We expect to pay premium prices for ""high end"" restaurants.  We never mind spending $$$$ when we get the value. 

The waiter was good, bus service good.  But really, if you're a butchery, the steaks should be flawless, you should be able to pick the size cut you want.  This one clearly was not, nor did I have much of a choice.  Will never go here again.  Too bad really.",5,2,0

Side note: this place is a butcher shop too, so from 9-9 they're open for business.... The dining area is open till 11p. Dining is farm to table so everything is fresh fresh fresh! They even get their fish off the boat that afternoon! :)

Service here is really great, they are very attentive with water (complimentary still or sparkling), and even ask if you would like refills on your beer.  =)  

Entrees:
Spencer Steak - perfectly cooked and comes with as many dipping sauces as you'd like
Lamb (my dish) - tasty and satisfying.... i love lamb! lol
Trenne pasta - a bit salty for all our palates.  it was an interesting pasta, a bit crispy and chewy with kale and chunks of prime rib.

Overall I give this place a glowing review and will definitely be back. Not cheap, but worth the price for quality farm to table food.

Ok, overall I loved this place. I really appreciate a good ambiance and this was definitely a good one. 

I ordered the skirt steak. You get to pick a sauce (or 2 or 3) and I chose the red wine Demi. The steak was done perfect and the sauce was phenomenal. The only thing I didn't really love was the steak was very sweet on its own. It must have been the marinade that goes on the steak. Paired with the red wine Demi, it was way too sweet, and I like sweet. So I ended up opting for the bernaise sauce because for the most part, it cut the sweetness. 

We got portobello fries and calamari for an appetizer and those were both done perfectly. 

We also received a free sundae of our choice for our moms birthday, it was a very nice dessert for being complimentary. 

The service is great. She checked on us just enough times that it wasn't overwhelming but it wasn't too sparse. Our drinks were always full and they always offer more bread and butter. 

I would definitely go back but might try a different steak that maybe wouldn't have that sweet marinade.",0,0,0

We couldn't help but notice every other table received much more attentive service and the standard bone-in meat display choices to which we were not privy to. Could it be that 2 women out to dinner couldn't possible eat a large cut of beef? Or was there a passive discrimination towards 2 women who are a couple who dared to dine at this Snobberlin locale? We just couldn't figure it out. But on the merits of food alone, we would not return to Echo & Rig.
Steak Tartare - Good and enjoyed caper berries.
Tuna steak frites - Meh seared tuna swimming in a sea of sauce. Garlic mash was good.

I got in to Vegas really late on a vacation and went straight here... but the dining room kitchen had closed.  The only thing available was the Happy Hour menu, and what a MENU!

For $1 each, you can select from Steak and Eggs, Shrimp Cocktail and a Gourmet Hot Dog with a nice Cabbage slaw.

You may think this is just a gimmick of crap food to get people in the door and drink cheap beer, but NO WAY!  The cuts of steak are the trimmings from the high quality steak they serve of about 2 oz each, served with a perfectly cooked runny egg.  The shrimp cocktail does not skimp in the shrimp and the cocktail sauce is awesome.  And the hot dog, the humble humble hot dot, is done grilled to perfection.  It is a quality hot dog with a great flavor.  Crunchy casing and juicy as hell.

On a side note, the happy hour beer selection is nothing to scoff at.  

I cannot wait to come back here to try out the full menu!",3,1,1

It wasn't until our friend that had been given the plate by accident said she already cut into it and we should get new plates. They gave my husband (the birthday boy!!) the ""clean"" plate which was already cold. They did bring out a new steak after a while but only after our guest said we deserve a new steak. The way they handled the error was very tacky for such an ""upscale restaurant"". Aside from that, other guests from our party felt their food was bland. Then it came time to pay.

I had been to E&R for brunch, but John had never been, so he made us a reservation.

We were excited that they greeted us with a ""Happy Anniversary"" when we arrived. You enter on a lower level, where there is a long bar as well as the butcher shop with a large display case of available meats for sale. The restaurant itself is up a short flight of stairs (there is an elevator as well). It's a large, open dining room and there is also a large patio overlooking the shops below. 

As I had been there before, I was familiar with the menu. But that didn't stop my hubby and I from drooling over the choices and basically deciding what we wanted well before our reservation. We started the meal with a bottle of Pinot Noir - Echo and Rig has a great wine list with many reasonably priced selections and different varietals, ranging from $40 to $99\/bottle. They also offer wines by the glass and a decent selection of beers on draft, including 2 local beers (would be nice if they offered more local beers, but 2 is a good start). I believe they also allow you to bring in your own bottle of wine, but I am unsure of their fee for corkage.

I had been raving about the Portobello fries and insisted we order these as an appetizer. They are really amazing and come with an herb aioli on the side, which complements the fries perfectly. At $9.80, you get a large portion and we unfortunately didn't eat them all (we wanted to save room for the rest of the meal). My guy loves salads, so I knew one of our courses would be greens and he made a fantastic choice, ordering the vegetable chopped salad (also $9.80). This salad was unlike any other I've ever had - it was loaded with veggies! It featured hearts of palm, carrots, blue lake beans, corn, avocado, tomato, snow peas, summer squash, green onions, pecans, Pecorino and creamy cilantro dressing. Holy freshness!! What an amazing summer salad. It was a perfect segue into our main courses. 

It's a steakhouse, so you better believe we ordered steaks! However, they do offer seafood and sandwiches if you aren't in the mood for red meat. We both ordered the same cut of meat - The Spencer Steak ($28.60). All of their steaks are cooked over red oak and are served with homemade garlic chips and mushroom Rockefeller. They also offer you one choice of their sauces, which include bleu cheese, red wine demi, brandied mushroom, bernaise, charred onion, horseradish cream and lemon chimichurri. I love horseradish, but decided to get the bernaise sauce when my husband ordered the horseradish cream. We both agreed his sauce was the better of the two and our server brought us out some extra, since I was eating all of his. Our steaks were cooked perfectly and were really juicy and delicious. The garlic chips were a wonderful accompaniment to the meal, along with the mushroom Rockefeller. Although we ordered from the menu, I do want to mention that they do also offer cuts from their butcher shop. Your server will bring out a silver platter with some of the most glorious cuts of meat you will ever see! These cuts are priced by the pound and I thought the prices were very competitive (meaning they aren't gouging you). There were Tomahawk ribeyes of different sizes and we both talked about how that would be the way to go with a group of 4 people, as long as everyone could decide on the cut of beef. These steaks are cooked to your liking, then sliced and served family style at the table.

All of the sides are a la carte and great for sharing. We went with the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with white cheddar ($6.40) and the brussels sprouts with pistachio and fresh lemon. I am not normally a big fan of brussels sprouts, but will always try them and have found 1 restaurant in town where I absolutely love them. While I would probably not order these again, they were tasty and a large portion for $8.60. 

Although we were totally stuffed, our server mentioned that they would like to offer us complimentary dessert for our anniversary. Who can say no to free dessert?! Definitely not us. So we shared their cappuccino sundae, which is made with sponge cake cubes, chocolate shavings, affogato fudge sauce, and topped with espresso ice cream. It was sinful, rich and delicious. We really appreciated them recognizing our special event and surprising us with this kind gesture.  

This is a fantastic local steakhouse and we are looking forward to going back again soon! The service is knowledgeable and friendly and you'll definitely feel like you are at a much fancier\/expensive restaurant. If you haven't been - GO!

We were served by an older gentlemen (never got his name) and he was absolutely amazing. He brought out the thick cuts of steaks to our table and gave us the whole presentation of how they are prepared and served. Me not being a meat eater and having no clue of the difference in cuts of meat and so forth was fascinated by the fact that he took the time to explain this information in detail to our table. My friends ended up ordering different cuts of rib eye, which they all loved. I ordered the portabello fries, mac and cheese, and cauliflower side dishes. Everything was delicious. This was my 5-star experience. I loved the service and food so much that I decided to come back the following night with my boyfriend and his mother. This, unfortunately, is where my experience went from 5 stars to 1. We were seated and introduced to our waiter (caucasian mid 30's looking, also didn't get his name). This waiter did not have a pleasant demeanor like the older gentlemen the night before had. No smile, no welcome, no warmth, he was very cold. He gave us our menus and never mentioned or brought out the presentation of steaks. I questioned him about the steak presentation when he took our orders, I informed him it was my boyfriend's and his mother's first time being there and I wanted them to see the different cuts of steak. He told us that since they both wanted different types of steaks and at different temperatures (medium rare and well done) there was really no point in bringing them out (those steaks are meant to be shared). Ok.. good point. However, I feel that it should've been offered as an option prior to taking their orders so they can decide if they wanted to order them or not. Anyways, they ended up ordering the filet tenderloin and double ranch rib eye (they were out of the rib eye cap). I ordered cauliflower side, mac and cheese and caesars salad. When the food came out, my boyfriend couldn't eat his rib eye because it was extremely tough. I couldn't eat the cauliflower dish because it was overly burnt. Did our waiter ever once come by the table after the food was brought to check on us? No, he did not. Not even one glance. My boyfriend placed his steak on the side of the table hoping to grab the waiter's attention. More than 5 minutes went by when finally Xavier, the assistant general manager addressed if there was a problem with my boyfriend's steak. My boyfriend told him that the steak was too tough to chew and wanted to order the tenderloin instead. Xavier apologized and graciously took his request and reordered him the tenderloin. When the waiter brought out the tenderloin, he told us that the other steak was probably too tough because it was medium rare and the fat didn't render. This information would've been great while we were ordering since none of us knew this. I also pointed out to the waiter that my cauliflower was burnt and he apologized and brought out a new unburnt dish. Round 2.. again, the waiter never checked on my boyfriend to see how he liked the tenderloin.  Good thing Xavier was there, he made sure my boyfriend was satisfied. Which he was, he said the tenderloin was very good. When it was time for dessert, the waiter came by and dropped off the dessert menu. He didn't put it in our hand, he didn't go over the different desserts, he simply set the menu on the table and walked away. WOW. When I read these bad reviews on Yelp about customer's getting terrible service, I bet you anything, it is this same waiter.
Although his service was horrendous, I still tipped him over 20% because that's how I am. Who knows, maybe he was having a bad day, month, year? All I can say is that I can't believe I had 2 very opposite experiences at this restaurant. If it wasn't for the great hospitality and service of Xavier, our night would've been ruined. He is the reason I am giving this restaurant 3 stars instead of 2. There is no doubt that the food is delicious but a dining experience is not only about the food, but also the service which makes it an entire experience. Needless to say, I was embarrassed that I recommended this restaurant to my boyfriend and his mother, I said nothing but great things about this restaurant and set their expectations high.

Anyway this place is fun. They have a nice atmosphere, a good crowd and are always consistent. Ok things to try: Start with the Cauliflower it's prepared with Chili de Arbol, Crispy Shallots & Onions. They are very good.

It is conveniently close so you can easily just jump out and get your car parked for you and head on in. I went on a Monday evening and it was surprisingly really busy but despite this, it didn't take long at all to get seated, aprox 10 min. The hostess was very nice and our servers who introduced themselves by name were very well knowledgeable in the menu and gave some pretty good recommendations. We had the misfortune of being seated on the second floor close to an open door on a cold and windy day and right in front of the busy kitchen so it did hinder the atmosphere a little. The entrance is completely visually open to see all the meats hanging in the windows and according to the server they feed their cows only grass and keep them free of steroids and fresh! We ordered the broccolini, steak tartar, lamb, and berry short cake sundae. The broccolini was okay and was slightly overly charred with a bit too much ground pepper, and the medum rare cooked lamb was pretty chewy and dry. The steak tartar was delicious and the ice cream was pretty good as well. While inside I also took note of the head manager who was often at the cashier, overlooking operations, or talking and joking to servers. She made a trip to literally every single table around us, greeting guests but never once took the time to look upon our table or even greet us which disappointed me a little. At the time, every table was full of older crowds more in their 40's and 50's so it may be because we were the youngest (mid 20's) inside and taken less seriously as their older guests. This disappointed me a bit and I probably would of had left a smaller tip if it wasn't for our very nice server and host. Service is key in a fine dining restaurant. Over all I recommend this place, food servers are good, food is tasty, and the price is decent for a finer dine!",0,0,0

The menu is not that diverse or unique from any other brunch. The thick cut bacon is tasty and good which is to be expected since they pride themselves on the butchery on the first floor. However I feel as if the menu is expected and therefore not that special and lacking in flavor.  I enjoyed the views from the balcony where we dined but I'm not in a hurry to return.,0,0,0

I walked in and was not greeted with even the vaguest semblance of warmth. Just a fake half smile by the two hostesses. I asked for a table for one, to which they replied ""Uh, ok..."" and told me it would be 30-40 minutes - but - I could wait in the bar. Or sit at the bar, because y'know, it's empty, there are tables and no wait. I felt like they were pawning me off to the bar. I didn't state I was going to sit there and eat but since I could wait at the bar, I thought I would since there are TVs.

I waited about half an hour sitting down, and then got up to stand behind the hostess station. I'm hard of hearing and I thought it would be better that way. (Reading so far, they didn't take my name which I thought was odd but who knows how they operate.) They keep glancing at me, but make no attempt to talk or ask me anything. At all. Another 30 minutes pass, and this small group comes in and actually gives their name. I finally ask about the status of my table. The hostess puts on a fake look of surprise and sympathy and tells me ""Oh, we thought you were eating at the bar!"" Uh, no. I stood behind you and practically stared you down for 30 minutes. She offers to take my name - but - then tells me there are two parties in front of me. ARE YOU SERIOUS??! You still make me wait after your mistake?

I wasted an hour of my time, on my birthday, whom I had no one to share with. On top of that, it was fucking cold as shit in the lobby. Do you even have heat?? I was livid, hungry, getting tired and freezing. I did wake up the next day feeling yucky because of practically standing outside for an hour. This was, by far, THE WORST, restaurant experience I have ever had. I can't imagine ever setting foot inside your establishment again.",8,6,1

Since we were on a limited amount of time (heaven forbid I miss any minutes of ScarJo action) I decided our best bet was to just eat there, and it also allowed us to partake in the final moments of happy hour.   

Unfortunately and probably due to a mixture of too much Jack Daniels and just the right amount of ScarJo intake during the evening I don't recall our bartender's name. But he was friendly, engaging, and got our refills and food orders put in with perfect timing.   I heard him make some recommendations on food items to some other patrons, but I didn't need those as I'm a Yelper who does his research and generally knows what he wants to order before ever sitting down at a restaurant.

Here's what we went with (everything was shared)

1.  Fried Spinach Salad:   This reminded me so much of one of my favorite eats ever, Toro with Crispy Spinach from Izakaya by Katsuya in Los Angeles.  The spinach is melt in your mouth with a great flavor.   A must order

2.  Salt and Pepper Fries:  I would have normally gone with the Yelp favorite Portobello fries, but I thought my dining companion would enjoy these more based on her tastes.  Perfectly cooked, but perhaps not enough pepper to really stand out as anything other than a batch of decent salted french fries you can get all over town

3.  Brussel Sprouts:  The Yonaka effect.  Ever since Yonaka's version anytime I see these on any menu I want to try them.   These were tasty.   Perfectly grilled with lemon and pistachios.   

4.  Then came the star of the show, the Filet Mignon which is billed as ""Double R Ranch Sustainable Beef"".   It came with a Green Peppercorn sauce on the side which we chose, but honestly it might as well not have come with that at all.   We both took a bite of the meat with the sauce and enjoyed it, but then ate the rest of it without ever putting anymore sauce on it.   I tend to think beef stands on it's own and only needs the slightest of seasoning to make it perfect, and this was a shining example of that.   

All in all our bill came out to roughly $80 and was worth every penny.   Now I anxiously await a new Mila Kunis or Natalie Portman feature to be exclusively playing at the Suncoast so I can do it all over again.",12,10,8

We made reservations for our first night in Vegas. We got here a little early for our reservation and hung out downstairs for a little bit. I checked out the butcher shop they had downstairs and they had some nice looking pieces of meat. It's super smart for them to have a butcher shop right down stairs, lets you know that their meat is super fresh. When everyone arrived we went up to our table. We were seated in the back away from most of the customers, it was much appreciated that we got our own little private area. We brought a bottle of wine and the host that seated us joked that it was a $100 corkage fee, it gave some of my relatives a heart attack, but then she told us she was just kidding around and said they didn't have a corkage fee. I don't think I've ever been anywhere that didn't have a corkage fee so that was gracious of them. I really liked the style of this place, it was fancy, but a little rustic. The room balanced itself out, nothing too over the top, except for maybe that huge chandelier in the center of it all, but hey this is Vegas. 

Our server, Ramone, was exceptionally helpful. He recommended that we all share their 42 ounce tomahawk because they slice it up and make it family style. I wanted to try the duck, but the rest of my family decided to share the steak so I went with it. We also ordered a few appetizers to start, they all sounded incredible. I picked the pork belly with slaw and the chile cauliflower. The rest of my family also ordered the carne asada bone marrow, grilled octopus and portobello fries. It didn't take too long for our appetizers, and they all came at the same time. We each got a small portion of every appetizer. The cauliflower wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, it was actually more on the sweet side. We asked Ramone what made the dish sweet, he told us there were pieces of garlic that were caramelized in brown sugar. Even though the dish wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be, it was still wonderful. Those caramelized pieces of garlic were and unexpected delight. The cauliflower was roasted and had a nice bite to it. My Mom loved the cauliflower dish, it was her favorite. The pork belly was marinated in a savory soy sauce and served on top of cabbage slaw. The pork melted in my mouth and the slaw gave the dish a refreshing crunch. The carne asada bone marrow was really innovative and unique. I've never seen another bone marrow dish like it. The addition of the citrusy carne asada and red onions gave the bone marrow more than just one note. It really freshened up a normally rich and heavy dish. The octopus was grilled to perfection and the sauce was tangy and clean. Lastly the portobello fries, the dish that I thought I would like the least actually turned out to be my favorite. I'm not a big mushroom fan and I especially don't like portobello mushrooms, but I could eat these all day. They had an excellent crispy coating that was seasoned well with freshly chopped basil and parmesan cheese. I'm not sure what the sauce was, but it was thick, bright green and very addicting. I would come back just for that snack. Next came the salads, which I didn't order or try, but they all looked good. 

I did use the bathroom a couple times here and it's lovely, clean and has a lot of space. I liked the single couch they had in the front of the restroom, it gave the room a charming touch. I also noticed they had a balcony with seats. They had a good view of the elegant round about and other shops and restaurants. Next time I want to sit out there. 

Lastly our glorious steak came along with a couple of sides. The steak came with house made potato chips and stuffed mushroom. We also ordered the broccolini side. The steak was cooked medium rare, but it was more rare on the inside pieces. No one seemed to mind though because it was just melt in your mouth, meaty deliciousness. We also got some sauces with our steak. Everyone ordered separate sauces and we got them all free with our steak. The favorite was the red wine demi-glace. I soaked my steak in demi and got some thick and creamy horse radish sauce on the side. I also had a couple potato chips and a small serving of broccolini. The steak was unbeatable, it was obviously treated with love and care. The demi was like a gravy and the horseradish brought some zest. The chips were thin and shattered like glass in between your teeth. The broccolini had a nice bite. It was served with whole cloves of cooked, soft garlic and was seasoned with red pepper flakes which brought some spicy heat. I love broccolini and they did this vegetable right. Everything here was absolutely delicious. 

Not only was this place amazingly delicious, but the prices were low. The steak that everyone shared was just $100 and each appetizer was under $10. This is definitely our new to go place in Vegas, such a special find.",2,1,1

My only gripe, and this is minimal, is that they don't accept reservations. We arrived at 7:15 with a party of six and were told that our wait would be anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. This makes it very difficult to plan an evening if you're trying to get somewhere on a schedule (e.g., movies).

Sides:
The mushroom fries were highly recommended by our server, but unfortunately, was a disappointment. The batter was quite thick, and was too salty for my taste. The octopus salad also did not impress. Our favorite side dish was the cauliflower by far. 

Main:
The 46oz. tomahawk was shared between 4 people (2 men and 2 women). I don't think it was enough for the four of us (even though the server said it'd be plenty of meat)...but I guess it all depends on how big of an eater you are. We ordered medium rare, but was told by our server that medium might be better since it's such a thick piece of meat. We went ahead w medium, and to our surprise, it was quite rare.

It was shortly after 10 p.m. on a Tuesday, and I didn't expect our restaurant of choice to be closing up.  But the bartender there said that Echo & Rig was going to be the only game in town.  I'd been wanting to try it, so actually was happy with the suggestion.

I sure wasn't about to scarf down a full meal, so we sat in the bar area.  Happy Hour had just kicked in, and our first waiter told me that there's a ladies' drink and it's free.  What could be better than free?  I think probably lots of things.  The drink, with muddled strawberries and what tasted like grapefruit juice, was so tart that I was puckering up like a fish.  The bartender said there was another drink, a Black Betty, that I could try.  It was a rum concoction with pineapple and OJ, but that, too, was way too tart.  Maybe these drinks solely exist to get ladies to order from the regular drink menu??  Speaking of which, said menu has wines available by the glass, bottle, and HALF-glass.  Half a glass of wine??  While the size of wine glasses has grown in direct proportion to the price of an entree at a given restaurant, the contents has shrunk just like your favorite roll of toilet paper.  I imagine half a glass of wine will equal two sips.  

The waiter recited the Happy Hour menu - shrimp cocktail or steak and egg(s) for $1.99, or a hot dog for $1.  I didn't think any of that was going to hold us, so we ordered one steak and egg, an onion soup to share, and a hanger steak sandwich.  

The steak and egg was a cute little plate, with a child-size steak and a single fried egg.  Not a lot to eat, but hell, it was 1.99!  We both loved the onion soup.  I was surprised to see the hanger steak sandwich served on a baguette-type bread, something that is so hard to come by in Vegas.  I just wish the bread had the crusty crunch that a baguette sandwich should have.  The steak was on the rare side of medium, and the fresh spinach was good.  But it was all soooooo unnecessarily salty that I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have.  I would have also appreciated a lot less salt on the otherwise-delicious chips that came with the sandwich.

The bartender, Jeff, was a delight.  He took over as our waiter, and sat down with and went through the entire menu for a future visit, letting us know which items he particularly recommends.  And they weren't all the priciest, either.

I got to see the dining room upstairs when I passed through it on my way to the Ladies' room.  The dining room - and the outdoor patio - are beautiful, but the bathroom is gorgeous!  Loved the granite trough sink and the salt rub, which price I forgot to check out in their store.

I definitely will go back to check out the regular menu, but next time will try to have them ease up on the salt.",5,5,4

Echo & Rig really missed the mark last night. It started off great with James the manager coming by to welcome us to the restaurant along with our waiter Sam. Sam explained the menu and brought our their specialty steaks on a platter. 

I went with the 19 oz prime bone-in New York and our table shared the mac & cheese and roasted garlic mashed potatoes with white cheddar. The rest of our table ordered their entrees and that would be the last time we saw Sam for a very, very long time. One thing I like at E&R is that you can order 1\/2 glasses of wine if you want to sample a couple different glasses.

The drinks and bread came out pretty quickly, brought by two different people. The entrees and sides came out a little later, again served by someone else. I took my first bite and the steak had no flavor, I had to add salt and pepper. After a coulple more bites my jaw was actually getting tired of chewing. It was one of the worst cuts of meat I have ever had. Full of gristle and really chewy. For a ""prime"" cut it was terrrible. The others at the table were enjoying their filets and fish however the garlic mashed potatoes were very bland as we didnt taste roasted garlic or white cheddar. I thought the mac & cheese was good though. 

Sam never returned to check on us to make sure everything was ok and prepared properly. We had to flag down James and let him know about my steak. 

James apologized and had a medium rare filet out to the table in about 1 minute. Excellent service which I truly appreciate. He also returned to make sure it was satisfactory which it was. The filet was very tender and had great flavor (and cost much less than my prime NY). Still no sign of Sam.  We all finished our dinners, had our plates cleared and were just sitting there waiting for the dessert menu. Again we had to flag someone down to find Sam for us. I ordered the salted caramel turtle sundae which was excellent. 

Sam brought out the bill and I was a little surprised to see I was charged for the filet. I have absolutely no problem paying for what I ate, but in my business if a customer is unhappy you do everything you can to change that. I almost never send food back, so when I do it's a bad sign. Although I appreciate James quickly replacing my steak, the quality of the prime NY, the mediocre potatoes and the total absence of our waiter was a big let down.",5,0,3

Located in the perennially empty Tivoli Village, the modern, open two-story space features a butcher shop and bar on the first level and the main dining room and patio on the second. 

The menu is dominated by appetizers and small plates. The best of the bunch might be the portobello fries ($9.80) with their crispy, crunchy fried exterior. If you like fried foods, try the lamb cigars ($8.10) too. A thin, crispy egg roll-like wrapper covers a savory lamb mixture and is accompanied by a tzatziki sauce. Less successful was an excessively oily gratin ($5.90) full of caramelized onions, roasted pumpkin squash, sage and gruyere. You may want to avoid the steak tartare ($8.10) as well. Not only is it the least appetizing looking dish there, the mushy texture made it doubly unappealing. 

Craving a salad? They've got some good ones, like a kale salad ($8) with baby yellow beets, toasted hazelnuts, goat cheese and a citrus vinaigrette. If you want one with a little more substance the arugula salad comes with plenty of prosciutto and is large enough for two to share.

As for main entrees, the Spencer steak ($27.70) is a solid choice. It's a prime grade, center cut rib eye that had a modest amount of charring and a savoriness that was enhanced by their mushroom sauce -- a rich and earthy accompaniment that surpassed their other complimentary sauces.

Brussels sprouts are all the rage these days, and their version ($8.10) was enhanced with pistachios that added a nice crunch and salinity to the dish. Even better was a grilled summer corn ($5.90) dish showcasing a char and smokiness that reminded me of eating corn on the cob straight from the grill, but without the mess or random kernels stuck in between my teeth.

Not to be overlooked is their butcher blend burger ($12.40) - a great savory and juicy blend of chuck and brisket. Topped with lettuce, tomato, red onions, and the optional sharp cheddar cheese, it's a simple burger that's well proportioned and executed beautifully.

They don't have a kid's menu, but were happy to strip down their roasted chicken sandwich ($12) to accommodate my son's tastes -- chicken and cheese on ciabatta.

Prices are reasonable for their location and while it's on the higher end of the spectrum of what suburbanites may want to pay off strip, the solid and safe menu makes it a sure bet for most diners.",6,3,5

Finally a guy in a suit comes and apologized, Derek. He takes our drink order and says he will take care of it and send a waiter out and something for us to eat.

10 minutes after that the waiter comes. He says ""oh you put the menu aside so fast""

He had an energy that was both welcoming and warm, the kind you get when you hangout with an old friend after not seeing them for a while.

x Bouillabaisse (prawns, clams, calamari, mussels, fish of the day, black tomato broth) - Lots of flavor and good, but I prefer lighter broth\/sauces. Clams were a little overcooked, but overall this dish was good.
x 1\/2 dozen oysters - I forgot the name of the oyster, but they were the smallest ones they had that day and they were AMAZING! The sauces that came with it made it that much better.

Because it was gorgeous October weather, my +1 and I sat outside to enjoy the sunshine. Apparently prime brunch time in Las Vegas starts later than it does in San Francisco. It was around 11 am and we were one of the few tables occupied. It makes sense, since nightlife in Sin City doesn't really get going until 11 pm... guess that means the locals sleep in a bit more? 

There's an actual brunch menu, which has plenty of gourmet options to choose from. However, I was feeling adventurous and ordered a Drunken Goat sandwich (goat cheese, brie, herbs de Provence, green apple) with a special request: a sunny side egg on top. It was the best of both worlds, the perfect midday meal. 

Quite possibly the best part? Our server let me order one blueberry pancake at half the price of the regular dish. If you asked a server the same thing in SF, they'd roll their eyes and make you feel stupid for even trying. One of the many differences between these two cities. Vegas wins in the customer service department for sure!

The total bill for two people was less than $50, which was amazing. I forgot what food costs outside of the expensive 7x7 confines of San Francisco, too. So this is how the other half lives, huh? So jealous.

All the way through we encountered perfect and attentive service - the staff knowing we were celebrating our 5th year anniversary. 

We went partially with Yelpers recommendations and partially with our server Lauren's recommendations. The portabello fries went amazing with the herb sauce and the marrow carne asada was creamy, fatty and garnished with lime - all the flavors just went perfectly. Hubby got the rib eye steak and it was made to perfection, medium rare just the way he liked. I got the wagyu cut medium and despite it being marbled, I still thought it could have been more tender. All in all, great price point for the steaks we got. 

They were amazing enough to give us a complimentary dessert to celebrate...Lauren recommended the in-house cappuccino ice cream, and she was spot on. This dessert blew our expectations out of the water...we were stuffed by then but couldn't stop eating it. The coffee flavor was great, and paired so well with the bread that came with it.

To start, I am by no means a steak enthusiast, so I can't do a proper critique of a place that distinguishes and prides itself as a steakhouse\/butchery. That would be the equivalent of a non-drinking designated driver hitting up the bar and reviewing a Shirley Temple, while all his\/her friends got progressively drunk. This is why my star-rating is a little skewed. 

I'll tell you what I did have though: PORTOBELLO FRIES with HERB AIOLI ($9.80). Believe the hype! They're incredible. Huge slices of mushrooms, crunchy on the outside perfected with a delicate balance of melt-in-your-mouth goodness on the inside. Worth it. I also had a side of Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes with White Cheddar ($5.90) and indulged in The Seascape cocktail ($9.80) -- Ketel vodka, fruity yet potent. My friends had ordered side dishes too, and we just did a family-style thing where we'd try each other's selections. 

Service was great. We walked in on a Monday afternoon without reservations and were immediately seated upstairs. The interior was not too packed, but had to wait a little while before our waiter took our food order. Overall, an upscale and well-managed restaurant, but it's not really somewhere I'd frequently visit.

We tried Happy Hour stuff- hot dog, shrimp cocktail, & steak\/eggs. Shrimp cocktail is what we liked the most. The steak & eggs though, I don't know if their portions have just shrunk through time but our steak was literally the length & width of my thumb. I mean it is a cheap entree but the photos on Yelp were deceiving. We decided to try an actual steak on their dinner menu and was told that if we normally eat Ribeyes to try the Bavette- supposedly it has some kind of zebra or stripe-like marbling and is more tender. We noticed photos on yelp that this place serves their steaks very charred so I told the bartender I didn't want it charred but it still was. I'm not sure if it is their cooking style but I am not a fan. The temperature was good but the meat was not as tender as they said. Maybe I was served the wrong cut off meat? 

Anyway, we had high hopes for this place but it didn't quite meet our expectations. People we met here though were very nice and love the place.

Located in Tivoli Village, recently open (meaning less than a year old), this place is amazing!  I was first introduce to this place because my fiance heard about this place being raved about by his colleagues.  We came here for lunch and received the best service for a fine dining experience.  Usually when you go to a fine dining establishment during their ""non-busy"" hours, service has a tendency to be lacking but not this place!  Our server, Alex I believe was wonderful!  And everything he recommended was excellent.  He checked up on us when needed and wasn't to overbearing on attention.  It was just right.

The first thing he suggested was the Portobello Fries with Herb Aioli; it was battered lightly and when you take your first bite, you crunch and then you chew.  The mushroom is just soft and tender.

As our main course, we ordered the Hanger: Herb Marinade, grass fed and Skirt Steak: Hawaiian Cowboy, Wyoming Wagyu.  My entree was the Skirt steak, marinaded in a sweet soy sauce with a bit of a kick in spice.  So it was sweet & spicy.  The steak was tender and melted in your mouth.  As for the Hanger, wow, the flavor was just right!  The herbs that marinaded the steak was smokey and tantalizing in your mouth.  You can taste the smoke wood that the steak was grilled on with hints of simply seasoning of salt & pepper and herbs.

For the side we ordered the bloomsdale spinach, unlike regular spinach that wilt & shrink when cooked, they were crisp and mouth full!  The taste was sweetly bitter that you want to keep eating!

Unfortunately by the time we where done with our meal, we didn't have room for dessert.  So this would mean that we would go back and repeat the same thing again.

Now before I finish this review, I forgot the most uniquely important thing about this place...it's the butcher shop, the deli, smoothie counter and the bar!  When you first enter, you see a nicely set-up freezer that house all the meat you can possibly dream of!  From steak, to pork, to lamb...sausage...your mouth will drool!  To the deli station where if you are on the go, they make your sandwiches there while you watch.  With cured ham and all the deli meats that are ""hangable"" to lust after.  It also shares it's space with a smoothie counter where they literally take real fruit and make your smoothie or fruit juices in front of you.  You see all that goes into your healthy beverage!  Now if you are in the mood to be a little bit of an adult, the bar is conveniently located downstairs.  So while you wait for your table, you have ample space to sit at the bar or the lounge and enjoy a cocktail.

Overall the ambiance of the place is magnificent and greatly needed on this side of town!  I know where I will be going to get my meat when I am making pot roast or steak dinner.  I know where to go hang out with the girls for a low-key girls night out and enjoy gossiping!  This is definitely the place to be and so happy to have something like this on my side of town!

Even the most simple things are apparently extremely difficult for the wait staff to accomplish. A fine dining establishment needs two very important things in order to succeed: A great cut of meat, and great staff to prepare it and deliver it.  This dining establishment has neither (Unless I'm assuming you get their ""off the menu"" cuts which are priced around $3 an ounce).


I got the ribeye cap and the girl got the seabass.  Luckily her seabass was well cooked and nicely seasoned.  My ribeye cap was not flavorful and tasted of charred wood - as if you dropped a nice steak on the coals and served it.  Certainly left a bit to desire for a $30 steak.

Now the service.  There's the female manager, Lisa, who was very cordial when we first sat down, but would routinely come by our table, straighten the salt and pepper shakers and not say a word.  We did not receive bread. A couple of other tables did. It actually looked pretty good. To be honest I'm not sure what is complementary here.  I suppose it doesn't really matter.  It was almost as if after we ordered we were invisible.  Our server was not a fine dining server. He could not help me select a steak from their main dining menu but would suggest many times I get the 64oz tomahawk chop as of course it's the best that they have (and would cost around $192).  I ordered a cocktail and it went empty by time we finished our appetizers.  Not once did anyone in the establishment ask me if I'd like another. Never.  Our waiter would routinely come by our table, grab a plate or clean up something that we had dropped off our plate but not say a word. I'm not 100% sure how this place is still in business. These are pretty simple things for IHOP to do but a fine steakhouse cannot?

The level of service rivals restaurants with Michelin stars,  thanks to Hugo and the manager, Kevin.

Unfortunately,  I made the mistake of trying out their scallop crudo side dish,  which was not so fresh.  I know,  some might say... a steak house... why order anything other than steak.  Point taken.

One bite and it was just so fishy,  even after all the citrus and lemon on the crudo.  I let the manager know and they were more than happy to take it off the bill,  but alas today I sit typing this review with a bad case of food poisoning,  a dozen or so visits to the bathroom this morning.

My friend and I came here for bottomless mimosas and some brunch on a Sunday. Surprisingly, there wasn't a wait.  Awesome!  

We ordered several items and they all tasted fantastic.  Favorites were the avocado toast, beef rib hash, and the sherbet spiked with champagne. 

Echo and Rig offered fantastic service-probably the best service I've had in a while.  The hostess quickly greeted us, found us a table, and we were seated. Our server was extremely nice & helpful. I never felt like the staff was overbearing, yet they were attentive. 

Bottomless mimosas: $16 (June 2016) served with a bourbon soaked cherry at the bottom of the glass. They give you a glass with champagne and a carafe of orange juice. The servers walk around and top off the champagne. And bring a new carafe of OJ when you run out. Our glasses were never dry!  They also offer bottom bloody Mary's. I believe these were $21 

Avocado toast: simple yet delicious. No shortage of avocado. Avocado slices on a baguette, maybe drizzled with olive oil?  Served with peppers on the side- mild heat. Very tasty. Will definitely order again. 

Beef rib hash: my new favorite brunch item!  I don't usually favorite the highlighted menu item-but this one hits the spot. Beef rib with egg and hollandaise sauce and veggies. This is a must try!  

Steakhouse scramble: tasty, but I prefer the beef rib hash.  Steak with veggies and potato chunks.

Our server was a very friendly guy, who proceeded to explain all the cuts of steak, and the most popular side dishes, along with the best way to order.

The presentation was a bit over the top and long, but he was so nice, and concise with each description that we enjoyed it. Really, the service was impeccable, and a highlight as much as the food. I started with the berry mojito, which was fresh and delicious. Then we had 3 'small plates' that we shared of avocado toast, risotto, and asparagus with fried egg, while our steaks cooked. All three were excellent, w the avocado toast being the best. Next our steaks arrived. We both had the rib eye end cap and it was unctuous! The sear and crust was perfect, the flavor great, however my husbands was a bit blue, being about 1\/4"" thicker, but presumably cooked no longer. This is the reason I didn't give 5 stars. My biggest pet peeve in a steakhouse is when it's not cooked to request. They're all served with homemade garlic potato chips and a Rockefeller stuffed mushroom. Both were tasty, but I thought the chips not a great side because of the constant need to put your utensils down to eat them. You can also choose a sauce out of six, though the steak was so good it wasn't needed. Still, the red wine Demi and bearnaise were great.

This last time, however, Ricky and Xavier made us feel like royalty.  We were sat originally near a door but Xavier thoughtfully offered to move us somewhere less drafty.  We decided a corner table on the patio under a heat lamp would be the most comfortable.  

Ricky, our server, was very knowledgable on the menu and wine selection.  I am a server as well and I'll be honest.  I learned a thing or two from him.  We started with the pork belly which was out of this world.  For the main course my date went with Ricky's recommendation, the spencer steak.  She found it delicious but we both agreed my lamb chops were the best dish of the night.  We were both so impressed with the lamb that I put my knife and fork down and dove in with my hands.  We finished the night off with the shortcake and cappuccinos.

A high end gourmet butcher where you take a walk into the meat locker to discuss curing and cuts with a personal expert. Step out of the meat locker, and you'll see a bar which also has a chef making sandwiches and other treats. 

I should mention that Echo & Rig is located in a very upscale shopping area where most of the cars are high end showroom exotics and the people walking around are all well buffed, shined, and jeweled with the finer things that money buys.

So for most people going here is a high end rare treat, not the kind of place us mere mortals eat at often. My family and I showed up here after a long day hiking and we really were not dressed to be here. We also had a few small kids with us, embarrassed we asked to be seated outside even though it was a cold night.

The staff could have been rude, or ignore us for our honestly dirty and sweaty clothes, but we were treated with all the importance and respect as the well dressed wealth around us.We were seated outside on a third floor balcony with an amazing view over the fountains and view down the street of all the upscale shops and lights.

The balcony had very well placed gas heaters above us and the typical pedestals kind which gave our table a surprising warmth absorbed by the heat making the cold patio perfect even in the cold of a winter's night.

We had two waiters, one who never spoke to us but kept the bottled spring, and sparkling water flowing (which is included without charge) and wonderful bread. He kept our table clear but was never intrusive or interrupted our conversations, in fact we were surprised how rarely we noticed him. Our second waiter was the spokesmen as well as server. He brought out the most beautiful and huge cuts of meat and described how they were aged. The meat he presented would be your actual cuts they would grill for you. Because I had a very large group with me, and I was buying for all we opted to stay away from the $75 dollar steaks and went for  burgers, sandwiches and other items. Even so we were treated like kings. We also ordered a few appetizers.

Our waiter also brought out several things to try that we did not order and were not asked to pay for. He was great about educating us and describing each perfect treat he brought out.

Everyone was pleased with what we ordered, even ordering a few things to take back to our hotel rooms. If we lived in LV this would be high on our list for date nights and special occasions. We were served with such expertise and professionalism even as we were so poorly presented that we can't wait to go back!

And yes all the food was great, it's a couple weeks later and we are still talking about it, this meal was the highlight meal of the week long trip for all of us.",2,1,2

The sides were awesome as well. The Brussels were amazing with a slightly tangy flavor. The greens added the perfect contrast to the meat. The cauliflower was lightly crispy and really tasty. The peppers that they had gave it a nice kick. The portobello fries were a great change to your typical fries.  Really crispy and the sauce it came with was perfect.

Heard about this place from my Sunset magazine. It's a drive from The Strip in what seems to be an up-and-coming area of town. Great shopping center that it was in.

The waiters are introduced to you and are there for questions. 

I got the Spencer Steak after asking if the description was related to Jocko's Steakhouse in Nipomo and they said yes (which is also a great steakhouse, but in a very different way than this place). The steak was huge, I didn't really even need the chips and mushroom it came with, especially after splitting the mac n cheese. 

Again, amazing service, delicious food, and surprisingly reasonable prices.

My boyfriend and I went to dinner at 9 PM on Tuesday night, and although we were there two hours before closing, we were still one of two tables inside. The patio seemed decently full though. Upon sitting down, the manager Jason came by to welcome us back as we had dined their before and basically thank us for choosing Echo & Rig. After Jason leaves, our server arrives and goes over the menu. We ordered a caesar salad to start, a glass of wine and flat water. 

Caesar was very good, our server even split it for us instead of us having to share the same plate. The dressing is very rich, but none the less, still good. 

After our app is cleared, we order our dinner. I ordered the filet (medium), and my boyfriend orders the ribeye, medium as well. As for sides, we ordered the black tuscan kale and the macaroni and cheese.

My only real issue that evening was our steaks. My steak arrives, it's cooked perfectly. It's definitely a more sad piece of filet, as there was a tendon running through it, but it was cooked perfectly and flavored amazing. Ultimately, I give the filet a 4.5 out of 5.
My boyfriend's ribeye, completely well. Nowhere near medium. Maybe near medium well, and that's generous. However, our server was more than willing (and it didn't seemed bothered or annoyed) to send his ribeye back to get it recooked.  A short time later, his steak arrives, cooked basically perfect. We were happy. We enjoyed our dinner as the sides were amazing. The macaroni and cheese is gooey and great, and the tuscan kale is my favorite side dish in this city.

When the dessert menu is presented, the manager stops by one more time and informs us that dessert was on the house due to the mistake with the steak. We were absolutely thrilled. Not only did the replace the steak promptly, but they really went above and beyond to make sure our experience was exceptional despite the hiccup. 

Ultimately, I think this is a great more fairly priced steakhouse. It's not the upscale steakhouse where the atmosphere is stuffy. At 35 dollars for a 7 oz filet you can't be mad at all. Sides are priced fairly, and portions are good. They have a gorgeous patio that's great for these nice summer nights, and it's great to get away from the strip.

It's not that it's overpriced because obviously $2 is a steal, but it is inconvenient. In fact, they shouldn't call it happy hour they should just call it kids menu (and not elementary school kids, more like toddlers). It's weird that an eatery would even do their happy hour in this style. The shrimp cocktail and everything else on the happy hour menu was the same way.

It's important to note that service was exceptional and attentive. The servers, bussers, and managers do a great job to make sure everyone is well taken care of, and that is evidenced by the very large numbers of very obvious regular and return customers. 

Unfortunately, I was very underwhelmed by the steaks, and surprised by how expensive the off-menu specialty cuts were. To be clear, if you order from the menu, I think the prices are as fair as it gets for a nice steak restaurant in Las Vegas. But we paid $117 for a Tomahawk Ribeye and $77 for a T-Bone. That's Las Vegas Strip expensive, and more expensive than all but 1 steakhouse I've visited anywhere in the country. Had we been on the strip, I would have had no problem paying those prices...but not in Summerlin. 

The biggest concern we had was that both steaks seemed entirely unseasoned, like someone pulled them out of the cooler and put them straight on the grill with nothing on them. Some purists say this is the right way to cook a steak, but every steakhouse I've visited at least salts the meat, and that is what the American palate has come to expect. 

Of less concern was the fact that both of these monster steaks were undercooked. T-Bone ordered medium and was delivered medium rare at best. Tomahawk ordered medium rare and varied from rare to blue in the center. 

Side dishes were mostly tasty - some hits, some misses, but all perfectly acceptable. 

Based on my experience, I'd say the 4.5 star average on yelp seems a bit generous. Echo and Rig isn't bad, but it's not 4.5 stars good.",0,0,0

Had the roasted thick cut bacon, portobello fries, and the roasted broccolini as sides.  The portobello fries were amazing and I would say are a must-try.  The restaurant did not have the ribeye cap available that night so I opted for the full ribeye medium rare.  First 2 bites were filled with a piece of gristle which was very disappointing and essentially inedible.  I tried to then work around the steak to a different area to avoid the offensive section - of which the next 3 out of 4 bites were also gristle filled.  At that point, I gave up and shared my concerns with the waiter who was polished, gracious, and professional.  The manager stopped by coincidentally to discuss the wine we were drinking and I shared the dining experience with him which he also received very professionally.

The small plates make excellent starters. They're not tiny, single serving portions, but these can be shared between two people. 

Butcher's Choice Sausage: Chicken sausage was served with onions, a sweet tomato sauce, and slices of of jalapeño peppers for added heat. The combination of flavors was just perfection. 

Bone Marrow Carne Asada: Fatty, melt-in-your-mouth, the amount of meat was generous when compared to other restaurants that basically just serve you the bone.  

For my main entree, I ordered a Hanger Steak sandwich. This is perhaps one of the best steak sandwiches I've eaten. Prepared at medium rare, it was juicy and tender enough where I didn't have to tear into it animal style and look like a cavewoman in the process. 

Dinner closed with a Chocolate Cherry Sundae. The ice cream isn't your grocery store variety; it was creamy, rich, and chocolaty. The pecan toffee cookies added crunch, and the brandied cherries were pleasant. A great way to finish off a marvelous dinner. 

When it came down to service, our server Edward wasn't all talk and no game when he mentioned how he provides impeccable service. Not only was he professional and personable, he was knowledgeable about the restaurant, the food, and the history of the cuts of meat offered on the menu.

I called and made a reservation for our second wedding anniversary, which was quick and easy.  

On Monday night, we arrived a little early, and were seated right away. 

Echo & Rig is not only a swanky, elegant restaurant, but it is also a butcher shop.  I absolutely adore this concept.   We were checking out the meat display when a hostess asked us if we preferred the stairs or the elevator.  We opted for the stairs, and I thought this was really nice of them to ask if there was a preference...it shows that they are looking out for their customers who may appear to be able bodied, but have problems walking or climbing stairs.  The hostess wished us a very hearty happy anniversary.  

When we were seated, the manager came over and also wished us a Happy Anniversary.  Talk about attention to detail.  Everyone we interacted with that night congratulated us and wished us a happy night.  

Our server Hugo arrived and took our drink orders.  
We ordered the ""Sweet Passionate Love"" (for me) Nolet's Dry Gin, lychee liqueur, Green Chartreuse, , fresh passion fruit & lime juice, citrus soda.  This was perfection.  I absolutely loved every last sip.  Light and refreshing, I was actually quite surprised, since I'm not usually a gin fan, but this sounded too good to pass up.  I'm glad I ordered it.  It was wonderful.

We also ordered the ""Black and Blue Mojito"" for my husband.  He's a huge mojito fan.  Atlantico Platino Rum, blackberries, blueberries, fresh mint, fresh lime juice, sugar.  This was a lovely mix of sweet and tart, and was really a great drink.  

Hugo was, in a word, incredible.  Attentive.  Prompt.  He went over the whole menu with us, answering all of our questions, making suggestions.  Service is always a deal breaker for me when it comes to dining out, and this was no exception.  The food was wonderful, but the service really sealed the 5 stars for me.  From Hugo, to the food runners, to the manager who seemed to be very hands on, and checked on us and several other tables frequently, its obvious that the staff takes pride in their work and want for their customers to enjoy every moment of their experience here. 

Now, the food!!!

We opted for 3 small plates:
Grilled Octopus, Gigante Beans & Green Olives:  tender cuts of octopus.  Delicious.  Whatever sauce this was in, I want to drink it.  The beans were amazing!  Every element of this dish was great.
Crudo, Diver Scallop, Tangerine, Asparagus, Cilantro.  Raw scallops?  Sign me up.  Something we normally only get at sushi, I'm a huge fan of raw scallops.  This was light.  It was refreshing.  There was a tiny hint of spice that I'm honestly not really sure where it came from, but what a delightful appetizer.  
Mac & Cheese.  You knew I had to order this.  Being the mac & cheese snob that I am, we almost didn't order this, but decided to as the first 2 small plates were very light, and we knew we'd have room.   This is a 7 cheese mac.  SEVEN. CHEESES.  Of all the mac n cheeses I've tried out there, this one is second ONLY to Gordon Ramsay's truffle mack at his steak house.  The noodles were perfectly cooked.  It was creamy and cheesy.   For me personally, it could have used just a tiny pinch of salt, but that's just being nitpicky.  

For our entrees, we had: 
Barramundi (for me) flash fried, spring onions, fresh peppers, sprouts, Ponzu.  
Is it possible to be in love with a fish?  I'd only heard of barramundi one time before:  Saturday watching ""Hell's Kitchen.""   Its a very hearty, meaty fish, with a wonderful flavor.  It was cooked to perfection, and paired really well with the peppers, onions and sprouts.   The ponzu was delicious.   Seriously, one of my favorite meals ever.  

My husband ordered the Bavette cut steak.  Hugo recommended having this cut cooked to medium, as it is a highly marbled cut, and he said that their cooks tend to lean towards the rarer side of the temperatures.  We took his recommendation, and it was perfect.  Well seasoned, cooked to perfection, it was tender and delicious.    The mushroom Rockefeller was a nice touch.  We weren't super impressed with the garlic chips, though.  It seemed just a touch...under elegant, if that makes sense.   They're actually pretty tasty with the horseradish cream sauce.  We tried that and the brandied mushroom sauce with his steak.  They were both incredible, but the mushroom sauce was a perfect  pairing.

We ended the night with a complimentary sundae, the Caramel turtle, at Hugo's suggestion.  It was delightful!  Definitely a great ending to a delicious meal.

Echo & Rig, you've stolen my heart.  We will most definitely be back again.  Thank you for making our anniversary even more special and enjoyable.",7,3,5

We ordered the cauliflower, thick-cut bacon,  lamb cigars, butcher's sausage, baked brie, ahi poke, and the grilled octopus.

Ribeye is the way to go, tomahawk if you have a big appetite like me. Every side we had was great...carrots, garlic mashed, cauliflower. If your one of those crazy vegans, the Butternut Squash Ravioli is killer. Service has been top notch every time.

      Made reservation a week out and came on time for reservation only to be told ""There's 7 or 8 parties ahead of you"". Had to wait 20 minutes past reservation time.

- Atmosphere\/ambience:
     I felt like I was eating in a mess hall. There was close to no decor in the big open room and it was very drafty. We were seated so close to the table behind us that I elbowed them several times accidentally.  Nothing even close to resembling a romantic or comfortable setting. 

- Food:
      We waited two hours from our reservation time until we received our food.  Many wife's ""well done"" steak was medium.  Our friend's medium was raw.  My steak was cold and they never asked how I wanted it cooked.
      Our sides were cold and had to be replaced. Awesome.
      The bread was bland and nothing special.

- Service:
     AWFUL.  The ""manager"" came and had to take our drink order 20 minutes after being seated because we were ignored.  Our drinks were often empty and the food took at least an hour from the time we ordered it to actually receive it cold.
     The waiter was Gone most of the service and the manager was extremely condescending and disingenuous.  He had no clue what he was doing and had no right being. A manager.
     I was so fed up with the crappy everything that we sent our steaks back and snacked on our cold sides. They offered us two bowls of ice cream in a cereal bowl as a ""kind offering"" for their complete lack of culinary ability and people skills. When they brought out the ice cream, they stated something along the lines of ""Don't be mad at this too! This is supposed to be cold.""

- Price
      What a rip off. I would have had a better meal and experience if I ate a bag of frozen White Castle cheeseburgers off the ground of a public restroom.  After taking two steaks off our bill it was almost $150-$200 after all was said and done.  Luckily we were with our favorite people with us....this subsided some of the pain. 


- Summary
  I wouldn't send my worst enemy here. It just wouldn't be right to send them to this place. I can't name one thing they did right during our experience. Not one. TERRIBLE.",11,4,1

We told him we had a tab at the bar and he said he would take care of it. We assumed it meant transfer. No. He actually took care of it. He asked questions about our day and evening. We told home it was our last day without kids. He made a point of telling our captain and waiter it was a special evening and to treat us right! 
Food was impeccable! We had Caesar Salads, The Spencer cut (like butter) and the bone in NY Strip. The garlic white cheddar mashed potatoes and asparagus with a fried egg were great additions. They bring different sauces try with your steak. Yum! 
I like that they have wine by the glass and half glass so you can try several if you want. 

The only drawback was we had a small table in the corner of the restaurant. It was very warm in the restaurant. I was getting uncomfortably hot. 
Our server Jason I highly recommend. He had great knowledge of all the cuts of beef. He even made a rec for our next visit.

I searched the menu on line and it looked incredible along with their in house charcuterie. We were seated in the dinning area and I noticed a few things that initially put me on high alert. The wait staff situation seemed chaotic. I saw some dishes sitting under lights for a long period of time and just a bit of general uncertainty. Usually warning signs to me. 
   However the floor manager managed to ensure our service was prompt and took the orders himself.  The menu was simple but everything sounded so good it was hard to make a decision. I ordered the kale salad, with goat cheese, the salt and pepper ff and brussel sprouts. My friend got the bravett cut steak. Our food arrived hot, and in a timely fashion. I am thinking about going back today for the salad it was so good. The ff and aioli were just perfect. THE STEAK ..... Seriously one of the best tasting and perfectly cooked steaks I have ever tried.

1. Baked Brie in a Bread Bowl - absolutely fantastic. A bit small but honestly that's the only complaint. It was like the world's most decadent cheese bread. 

2. Grilled Bacon appetizer - Also very good but small , looks like it's 2 pieces of bacon grilled and then a toothpick placed through it. It was delicious though.

3. Portobello fries- The biggest disappointment based on everyone on yelp raving about them. They're just fried mushrooms with a herb mayo. The only dish that missed with both of us. 

4. Garlic Mashed Potatoes with White Cheddar - We had this with our steak. They were everything you would want a mashed potato to be. Excellent. 

5. Chips - These also come with the meal and for just a fairly simple potato chip these too were excellent. 

6 - 25oz NY Strip (Bone in) - price was in line with most steak houses and it was a beautiful cut of meat cooked perfectly medium rare but still had a nice wood char to it. Really great steak.

It was about 4pm on a Fri, we were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated in the restaurant upstairs immediately upon arrival. Our server Nicholas was an absolute pleasure to deal with. He was very thorough in explaining the whole menu and even brought out a steak tray to see for some off menu selections. (I'm going back for the tomahawk next time!!) He was very accommodating to our son who was eating with us to make sure that the way their items were prepared were suitable for him to eat as well. 

We started with the Caesar salad, which one order can be split between two people just fine. Portobello fries - quite unique, never had these anywhere else. They were quite tasty.

For our main course the wife got the ribeye cap and I went with the spencer steak. They were only 8oz portions but were perfectly sized to go with the broccolini and Mac and cheese we ordered. (Broccolini was a little heavy in oil but hell its deep fried, Mac and cheese was amazing) The steaks came out great, my only criticism is that we ordered medium rare and they definitely came out medium.. BUT every single good steakhouse I've ever been to seems to have that issue anyway. So.. I suggest ordering one temp cooler than you want to stay within your liking. 

We were treated to a complimentary ice cream dessert for my wife's birthday which was much appreciated.

Anyways, this place alone deserves the greatest praise for customer service. Customer service is everything when it comes to dining in to a fancy restaurant. A group of us were here for dinner during our last weekend in Vegas as suggested by our friends who live here to try this place out as it raves awesome reviews. 

From beginning to end, service was impressive. The waiter offered us water (with a complimentary choice of still or sparkling) all around and the way that they all presented themselves in pouring our drinks were quite the service. Our waters were constantly filled even when it was only half way. They even poured the rest of my cider when I drank just enough to fill up my cup again. The waiter who served us brought different cuts of meat and explained the different types of meats we could get. He offered recommendations as well to preferences we may have had. Very informative to any questions we had. 

Everyone else on my table got steak but me of course. I got the Roasted Chicken Sandwich with a side of Portobello Fries & Herb Aioli. All our entrees came with potato chips as a side. As much as I love potato chips, these were too salty for me. The chicken was tasty, the sauces made the sandwich more flavorful. The portobello fries is a must! It was really good with the aoli sauce that complemented the perfectly battered crisp fries.  It was the highlight of my meal. It has a unique taste to it but its full of flavor. 

But really, if you're a steak lover, this would be the place for you as it's well known for their steak cuts. They also came out with a complimentary dessert for our friend who was celebrating her birthday and so we all sang for her. I would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a nice place and atmosphere to celebrate something special.

We were seated inside right away next to the window overlooking Tivoli Village and were given the choice of complementary sparking or flat water.  The space was open and not too noisy.

Now about the food:

Portobello Mushroom Fries - Probably the highlight of our meal.  This dish was jam packed full of flavor and perfectly battered and fried.  It went amazingly well with the aioli dipping sauce.  This is a definite must if you visit.

Smoked Salmon Benedict - One of the more expensive brunch menu items, but oh so worth it.  The eggs were perfectly poached and I loved that it came with a potato pancake instead of the usual English muffin. Smoked Salmon and healthy portion of spinach were great as well.  It was filling and tasty and I would recommend it to others 

Steak Scramble - This dish was unfortunately disappointing.  The server said it was one of the two most popular dishes (the other was the short rib hash).  The portion was smaller than expected and flavor wise it just couldn't keep up with the other dishes.  

Since we were celebrating our anniversary we were given a complementary dessert and we choose the Chocolate Cherry Sundae. It was such a nice treat and such a sweet way to end our meal.

Appetizer--Portobello fries with basil aioli is a must have.  There is parmesan on the mushrooms that is really, really good.  We were also going to order crab cakes, but Im glad we didnt, because the bread the bring out with butter, along with the fries were more than enough.

Baverre cut steak--really good.  Our server suggested the charred onion sauce and if you love onions, youd enjoy this sauce.  The steak really didnt need a sauce, but its free, so why not.  The steaks come with these potato chips that I didnt care for, and 1 mushroom rockefeller which was delicious!!! I would have preferred no chips and 2 mushrooms.

Skirt steak--this was so\/so...my friend said the Baverre tasted better and Id agree.  She got the lemon chimichurri sauce with it, and it tasted ok, but the steak didnt need it.

Sides--mac & cheese (amazing, very cheesy, I loved it); broccolini (amazing, with a lemon flavor)

Bottomless mimosas--They usually only have the bottomless mimosas on the weekend with their brunch menu, but this was the day after xmas (on a Monday), so they had bottomless mimosas and bloody marys....they give you a full wine glass of the sparkling wine and a very small flute of orange juice and they come by to refill both constantly...honestly, they never refilled my oj because I like my mimosas with minimal juice!! Lol.

Service--a little slow for lunch time on the day after xmas, but we werent in a rush and it allowed us to have more mimosas!!

I will definitely return!",0,0,0

Our waiter was apparently training another server.  My wife ordered her steak to be well done and she realizes that chef's hate when someone asks for the steak to be cooked well done but that is the way she likes it.  They offered to butterfly the steak to ensure that it was cooked correctly and she agreed.  When the runner brought the meal out, a vast majority of the steak it was medium-rare at best.  She also ordered the Heirloom Carrots which most of them came out burned.  Unfortunately, neither our waiter nor his trainee came out to check on us for at least 20 minutes after we received our meal.  My wife ate the part of the steak that was cooked to her request and some of the unburned carrots.  We both ran out of water and she ran out of her soda and it sat empty on our table for at least 10 minutes.  Luckily, we were sitting in the corner so I reached over and grabbed the bottle of water and refilled both our glasses.  Our waiter walked near our table several times but never checked on us.  Normally, I would have raised my hand and asked for something but after awhile, it became a test to see just how long this guy was actually going to go without even asking how our dinner was.  This was a Saturday night during dinner and I understand that it was busy, and I understand that our waiter was probably busier than normal because he was training the other guy but there is absolutely no excuse for not checking on our table for roughly 20 minutes after the meal is brought out.  When our waiter finally checked on us, I asked for the manager.  I explained to the manager that we had 3 problems, 1) the steak was not cooked correctly  2) most of the carrots were burned  3) our waiter never came by to check on us and my wife's soda had been empty for most of the meal.  The manager left the table to go speak to the chef.  When he returned, he partially apologized but mostly he took the position that the steaks are butcher cut not machine cut so it makes the steak thicker and apparently harder to cook.  This is total BS to say that a chef is unable to properly cook a steak to the customer's request because it is thick, especially considering that it was butterfly cut.  He also stated that the carrots are supposed to be charred but most of them were this way while the others were normal.  The charred carrots were cooked too much and tasted burned.  He offered to take the carrots off the bill but we stated that it would not be necessary since my wife ate some of the unburned ones.  The waiter promptly returned with a soda while the manager was talking to us the second time.  Probably the most shocking thing is that the waiter never apologized.  I expected him to say that he was sorry and that he is really busy tonight but he didn't say anything to us.  There is no doubt that he knew exactly why we asked for the manager.  My dinner was fine so this experience was not entirely negative.  We also expected that maybe they would comp a desert or do something to make the situation right but they did not (although I did decline to have the carrots taken off the ticket).  I realize that almost everyone on Yelp loves this place, which is why we went there but I expected way more.  We spent nearly $100 for the two of us and I realize that it is not the most expensive meal in the world but we should most certainly have a better customer service experience.",1,0,0

Price is astounding. In a good way. This is in the heart of Summerlin, at Tivoli Village, and the prices that are listed are so unreasonably LOWER than what I expected. And the Quality? Speechless. Ambience? Not one square cm has been left to it's own. These guys know what their doing; they're passionate about the food, the place, EVERYTHING. They want you to have a good time, and they've gone through great lengths to do so. The staff are very good; they're educated on everything on the menu (they take actual tests before their allowed to work and go through rigorous screening processes) and are highly educated on the different meats and the best ways to have them. I challenge you to find a better restaurant in all of Vegas. Seriously. I don't know of one.

More: As I've been in Vegas for the past 4 years (Really??! That long already??), I rarely come across any restaurant on or off the strip that I get so excited about that I would race to tell people about. Rarely is there a place where the owners are so passionate about not only opening a business, but pouring out their hearts and soul to anyone who will listen about their concept and show you their thought process. 

Actually, rarely do you see that anywhere these days. It seems that the only ones you find with said mentality could be found in food trucks. Maybe it's just my fondness for detail in the most minute areas, but I digress.

The restaurant is divided into three parts: a butchery, a lounge-type are complete with a butcher bar (think sushi bar, but for meats like prosciutto) and mixology bar, and then finally, the restaurant. 

The butchery is amazing. You need a meat? Go there first. Prices are so reasonable and the meats are the some of the best quality you can find. The staff are very knowledgable and can give you advice on the best ways to treat and cook the meat.  You can see the cutting from the outside of the restaurant through large windows that reveal probably the largest walk-in fridge unit in Nevada. Also visible are different meats hanging just like in a butcher. Because that's what it is. Adds a super nice touch to the whole look and feel. The mixology bar is awesome. Bartenders are great and awesome, seating is comfortable, and the Butcher Bar is definitely something that is a MUST TRY. I won't ruin the surprise, but trust me, I'm taking the time to actually write this long review and say TRY IT. You'll think: ""Why isn't this already in existence???""

The restaurant is upstairs with an open view of the kitchen. Let me say that the ability to have Kitchen side dining is awesome. To be able to see the magic happen is just as awesome as eating the wonderful and delicious food. Now when I went, it was a soft opening and there weren't menus yet, so I can't recall much about the names and what was in the food. Sorry, I was just more blown away by the actual food and place that I pretty much just forgot. Which I will chalk into the ""It's a good thing"" category. I wasn't concerned that when I go there again that I'll only want that item; I want to try them ALL.

So, do yourself a favor: Give this spot a chance, and find out why this is one amazing place.

Edit: By the way, if you eat at the restaurant and want awesome service, I highly recommend asking for a waitress named Courtney. Probably one of the best on staff.",10,0,0

I came here only once last summer with a good friend. We've heard all about how cheap yet delicious the steaks here were so we had to come find out for ourselves.The ambiance has a modern sophisticated feel. The downstairs has a butcher shop and a bar seating area and the upstairs has restaurant seating.

I recall it being packed when we went and we had to wait for a table, but not too long. Everything we ordered came out at a slow place. I can get pretty impatient, but a steakhouse on a busy weekend in Tivoli Village can be understandable. 

We ordered a few appetizers and got a bottle of wine. We both went for the ribeye, $35 is a price you can't beat! There was a bit too much salt added for my taste but it was very juicy. (I do like salt so I still devoured my steak). It was a thinner cut of ribeye than what I'm used to at restaurants, but for the deal you're getting it for it doesn't come as a surprise. My only advice would be to order rarer than you'd like. I like mine medium but because of it's thickness it came out closer to medium well. The steak also came out with homemade chips which was different to see paired with steak but nonetheless delicious. 

I was telling one of my coworkers who had also tried out Echo & Rig about how I thought their steak was a little salty and she thought that was strange because she thought her steak could have used a little more flavor! Different chefs? Different cuts possibly? 

Good price for good quality meat, they just have to master that steak seasoning ;)",4,1,2

Importantly, it's BYOB!!! From what I heard, it's usually a bottle of wine per four people. Our waiter was kind enough to allow us to have several bottles open throughout the night. In addition, we were a party of nine and we were ordering so many items and couldn't order the charcuterie board because we thought it would be too much food.

We kept hearing about this place and thought it was about time we gave it a try. Selected the two mot popular\/best items on the menu: Their Short Rib Hash and Salmon Benedict with Potato Pancakes. Oh. Em. Gee. Savory, delicious... and bottomless mimosa and bloody Mary's to boot! 

Ambiance is wonderful. The staff was kind and very attentive. We have to come back when it's Fall since we so badly wanted to sit on the patio outside to enjoy the views but it was over 100 out that day!

One of our favorite brunch places so far in Vegas. Only downside: if you're there on a Saturday they have a bit of a Farmers Market going on... if you had more than 2 mimosas steer clear because you will end up purchasing things you would have never purchased sober. (*My fault entirely.)",0,1,0

I looked over the menu about 5 times. We finally went to eat there tonight since we got a sitter. The place looked amazing. The hostess takes you passed the butcher area up the stairs to the restaurant. When we got there she sat us in the corner which I thought was nice since I was on a date with my wife. We were greeted right away by someone offering us our choice of sparkling or still water. After that it went down hill. The server took about 15 minutes to come over to even talk to us. Then he gave me a hard time when I asked about the menu. He said he was going to get us bread and would be right back. He didn't show up until after our small plate of garlic shrimp showed up...which by the way is not what it sounds like. It's shrimp chunks and a crouton. Then he disappeared for another 20 minutes until they were serving the steaks. When dropping the entree off he asked if we would like anything else. I asked for the drink menu... He forgot the menu.  Then he didn't show up until we were almost done with our food and I asked again. He leaves right away and comes back. I ordered a beer and it didn't come until we were done. Then we realized he never brought the Mac and cheese we ordered that we saw such great reviews about. He did at least apologize and told is he failed us. The only saving grace was how perfectly cooked the steak was. Also the mushroom stuffed with bacon and garlic chips were good. The chimichurri was straight up oil... But the horseradish sauce was delicious. I wish this experience would of been better, the location and potential for this place is great. I honestly would give this a worse review based on the service if I didn't like the steak so much.",0,1,0

First the place is really cool, located in Tivoli Village near Summerlin, it is a nice place to walk around when the weather is nice. The restaurant itself is two-story high, they have a see-through fridge on the bottom floor that lets you look at all the meats they use for the restaurant. They also have a bar area and lounge area for you to sit and wait. Then you walk upstairs and that is where the main dinning area is. 

The first I was here everything was amazing. Service was great, food was good, had a great time and everything was great. 

Came back the second time with my entire family to celebrate my sister's birthday since we enjoyed the experience the first time. This time was not so great. Our server seemed really busy and distracted, he would talk to us while looking at his other tables which I thought was really rude. He then spilled water all over the table when he poured water for my mom and I and ignored the incident, didn't apologize or even clean up the water, my mother and I used our own napkin to clean the water up because it was a mess. I looked at him kind of taken back but of course he wasn't even looking at me, he was looking elsewhere. 

We did not say anything because we did not want to make a big deal but that was a terrible start to the dinner. The rest of the meal went fine, for appetizers we ordered: calamari, steak tartare, porky belly and spicy slaw, bone marrow carne asada, and lump crab cake. The apps were all  very good. 

The pork chop schnitzel was really dried and the flavor was not impressive. The rest of the food was really good, we ordered different steaks, duck and fish. 

Then I told our server that it was my sister's birthday and I asked for some kind of cake with candles, which the restaurant gave us for free for her birthday. The runner, not the server, that brought out the ice cream lighted the candle and said ""Here you go"" and pretty much threw it on the table without any enthusiasm. Im sure they have many birthday celebrations here and it wasn't his first time doing it, but come on! For a place that is considered fine dinning I expect better service ... he can't find it in himself to say ""Happy Birthday"" or even just a smile? It made us feel like he didn't want to be there or he didn't like giving us the ice cream... the dinner started out bad and ended bad.

I really liked the food but the service we got that night was terrible.",2,1,1

There is a butcher and bar on the first floor and the restaurant is on the second.  Very classy how they take your name and walk you to your table. All the meat comes from the butcher downstairs, so naturally we had to try the burger, which was recommended with cedar cheese.  This was an excellent, juicy, well put together burger. For $16 it is well worth the price.  We also shared some portobello mushroom fires - lightly battered server with an awesome sauce.

Came for brunch, namely bottomless mimosas. What a deal! 
Good champagne, and the waitstaff never stopped pouring-  served my favorite style with a small kicker of OJ on the side. Did I mention that the glass was never empty? Day drinking has never been so choice!


Pick a meal, they've added a steakhouse twist to most of the dishes. Delicate hollandaise, bold smoked meats, perfectly poached eggs. Seems like it's hard to go wrong with this menu. 

Reservations a must here in the heart of Summerlin, don't be afraid to wait a little longer to get a plush seat on the balcony overlooking the obelisk fountain and continuous parade of super cars at the valet. Our server Adam was a real professional.

Everything started off fine even though the wait for a table ended up not being the '10 minutes"" they promised but well over 30 minutes. They sit you down and get your order and everything seems fine. And then you wait.

Over 45 minutes later, without a peep from our waitress to check in and let us know what is going, then dump food on our table. I say ""dump"" because we had ordered several courses - soups, salad and main dishes and side dishes andmost of it came out at once...other than the soup and a veggie dish, which we then had to wait another 15 minutes for.  How the heck does the soup come out last?! The worst part about it is that most of the dishes were cold. 

Rather than serving us dishes as they were ready, it was obvious they waited or forgot about our order for a very long time.

We mentioned our frustration to the waitress in a nice way and she said the kitchen was backed up. Then management pops up while we are still waiting for some of our food and asking how is everything.  We mention having some issues with the wait and he makes a snarky comment rather than apologizing or trying to make things a bit better. We weren't at all rude but he handled it all very badly. 

I think the popularity of the restaurant has made management think that it's ok to treat people badly and that they can afford to lose a few customers. I was appalled and will never go back.

It was one of the worst evenings we've had in a long time. We can't suggest anything other than just avoid the place until they work out the service kinks unless you are in the mood to take the risk of really bad and rude service.",1,0,0

First impression walking in was great. Dry aged meats hanging everywhere while a butcher chops away at carcasses.  
We were told seating will only be a matter of minutes, but after hearing that many times, an hour went by before finally seated. When the waiter introduced himself, he also introduced the long list of steaks that we could NOT order. Really?? How are they out of steaks?! Anyway, this carnivore will not be stopped, so luckily I had a variety of interesting body parts to choose from. I have no problem raving about he food. When available, everything tastes amazing. BUT the wait staff completely overshadowed it with horribly slow service, arguing in front of the table, and just when we thought it couldn't get any worse, vinaigrette was dumped all over the back of my friend. A manager came by and told him, ""oh, it doesn't look too bad?"" Umm, that's because we've already scrubbed him down with napkins. He offered to pay for dry cleaning...which was a nice try, but what do they expect him to take his shirt off, or worse yet, come back to pick up dry cleaning money? Look, damage is done, comp his meal at least.
In the end, we just couldn't wait to leave. We arrived at 6:30, seated at 7:30, got our meals well after 9, and still couldn't get out before 10pm. After requesting a check many times, they brought out complimentary desserts (which again, the food was great) but at that point, a bandaid can't patch up a severed limb.

Today we had Derek and Xavier visit us, along with their team featuring our server Nicholas and Master Oyster shucker Leone.

While we prefer Other Mama for oysters...having a great bottle of wine without corkage fee, it was a rational choice for us to dine at Echo & Rig tonight and as fortune would have it, it was one of the best among my dining experiences here. Good thing for no corkage fee, right? 

Our table wasn't immediately ready, so we waited a little in front of the oyster raw bar area on the first floor where we got to talk to Leone...the French gentleman who knows everything about the Oysters that Echo & Rig have to offer. Kushi being sold out for the night, he kindly explained to us the rest of the evenings offerings...he was very fun and informative...say hello to him if you get the chance...after all, he is directly across from all those beautiful and friendly hostesses.

We ordered a dozen of oysters, Cauliflower, Arugula Salad, Hawaiian Tuna Poke and Maryland Lump Crab Cake.  Most of Items we regularly order since they are always on point for flavor. The Crab Cake was new to us...sometime you have to keep poking to look for the actual Crab Meat, but not at Echo & Rig...it was meaty, juicy...yummy.

Not having to pay extra for your favorite bottle of wine for two is nice, but receiving excellent service from the aforementioned staff is a very good thing...especially when Leone goes beyond merely shucking our oysters and paused to educate me...a very good thing indeed.

Everyone at the table got a steak. Filet mignon and Hanger steaks came out great as well.

Incredible service as always. Servers know the menu up and down and inside and out. If you describe what you're feeling like eating but don't know exactly what to order, they will quickly tailor a custom order for you. I love that.

Huge fan. The Rat Pack would dig this joint! As good as it gets - and certainly for a steak lovin' town like Vegas!

We are locals that live in Summerlin. We brought four friends from the LA area who had never been there.  From entering the front door, where we were greeted by five smiling beautiful hostesses, to the end of a spectacular dining experience, the evening could not have been any more enjoyable!  The attention we were given from Derek, the general manager and Austin, our food engineer(waiter) was spectacular!  The quality and presentation of our dinners was the BEST!
We all had steaks, from their Special selection, Rib Eye and New York cuts. We all agreed that they were the BEST we have ever had. Our evening ended by  celebrating my birthday with two delicious desserts!  So, if you are looked big for the best steak house in Las Vegas,

Had never heard of it and were looking for a nice steakhouse in Summerlin area.  Although it was busy and it was prom night, we only had to wait about 15 minutes or so for a table.  The manager came over and introduced himself and let us know who our waiter would be.      The service was great and very reasonable prices although sides are ala carte.  I had the Spencer cut and my husband had the tri-tips and we thought this was one of the best meals we ever had.  For dessert, I had the sorbet and he had the Caramel Turtle sundae which were huge portions and we both enjoyed it.  Like many restaurants in Vegas, there was an extensive wine list but very few by the glass.  I don't know why they do this as not everyone wants a bottle.  I ended up asking for a Mai Tai even though it wasn't on the cocktail list and it was pretty good.  Our only complaint, again a restaurant trend, is the music was extremely loud which made it hard to hear the waiter and if we had other people with us, we would have had a hard time with conversation.  We would definitely go back and plan to recommend to friends.  I checked off Casual but we were a little dressed up.  Nicer casual, I'd say.

Main course. she had the rib eye cap (med well). i had the steakhouse cut rib eye (med). both juicy, tasty and had the right char on ends. 

For dessert we shared an espresso ice cream which wasnt nothing to write home about but it didnt exactly suck.

Overall, it was worth the price , this is definitely a dining experience one must try atleast once. and compared to the strip, what a value you get! my only gripe if had one was 2 days before i called saying i had reservations and was celebrating a birthday . they even took her name down and said we would surprise her and bring out a bday sundae. they never did , no biggie still had a great time, they must have been busy. i also should have reminded the girl at reception regarding the surprise",0,0,0

The hostess that seated us was from Maui, one of the servers was from the leeward side on Oahu, and one of the floor managers was from the Big Island.  The very cool thing was they all made it a point to chat a bit about Hawaii.

Well, I've been wanting to eat here ever since I saw chef and owner Sam Marvin on Beat Bobby Flay and the restaurant didn't disappoint.  We started with a cocktail and some apps...the portabello fries and mac n cheese.  Both apps were good with the portabello fries being exceptional. Thick sliced portabello mushrooms battered and deep fried, soft and earthy on the inside and hot and crispy on the outside.  Served with a nice herb aioli to dip into.

For dinner I got the Steakhouse cut Rib eye with red wine reduction and Mark H had the Steakhouse cut Tenderloin with a bearnaise sauce.  Both had a good meaty flavor but I definitely like the fattiness of the rib eye :) .  I also really liked the garlic potato chips that the steak was served with.

My first visit, our little group of 3 got seated immediately at around 9pm on a Friday.  We ordered a few appetizers and ribeyes off the menu.  Stand out appetizer was the portobello fries, as many other reviewers attest.  The steaks were cooked to perfection, cut like butter, and tasted great.

The next time I went alone with the husband.  We arrived around 8:15 on a Saturday and had to wait about 20 minutes, which was fine.  Wait staff was quick to get our drink orders.  This time we decided to take the advice of others and selected a bone-in rib eye to share. Appetizers came out quickly, but our steak took near 45 minutes to make its way from the kitchen.  Apparently, our expectation that a steakhouse should never mess up steaks was asking too much.  We asked for medium rare and got well done instead.  For whatever reason, I don't like to send food back.  We ate a few bites, and even at well done, it wasn't bad, which is a testament to their cuts, but our ribeye's pre-cooked weight was 26oz and cost ~$2.50\/oz ($65).  I couldn't sit still for a $65 piece of meat, so we called our waiter over.  He saw our plate, instantly recognized that our meat was overcooked, and called the manager to come over.  While we were waiting, the couple next to us sent back their salmon for the same problem.  The waiter's reaction seemed to indicate that this was happening all night long.  

The manager was professional about the situation.  He told us that he would comp the steak and asked if we would like another.  We were already running late for a movie, so we opted for just the comp. 

We ended up missing the movie.  Although the manager handled the overcooked steak in a most appropriate way, I do think it is a sin for the kitchen staff to mess up, what seemed to be, multiple orders.  It's a relatively new restaurant, so I'll give them one more chance, but if they screw up steak again, there is no way I could recommend this place to anyone.",0,0,0

Despite being two people we wanted to try everything! We started with the portobello fries with the herb aioli. It's to die for.

Our course we had to have a Caesar salad since that is my favorite and it was perfectly dressed and seasoned! Oh yeah and order the bone marrow. Two generous bones filled deep with marrow! 
Finally the main course! We did the special 48 oz tomahawk steak with a side of creamed kale, roasted cauliflower and mac and cheese. Get your steak cooked medium even if you like medium rare as it is a large steak. My husband loved the rib cap which was slightly charred and well seasoned. I loved the middle pieces which were more lean but perfectly medium rare. Delicious!! We wished we brought our dog to Vegas as he would have enjoyed the bone.

The prices seem extremely reasonable until they present you with a salad or appetizer that is the portion size for a child. The tropical green tea tasted like something went wrong with the brewing. The rainbow salad sounded really good, but very disappointed with the portion size and lacking flavor and it didn't seem like it was made fresh. The ingredients seemed pre-mixed and like they had been sitting for a few days in the fridge. 
Also I found it a little much that as soon as we sat down the manager came over and introduced himself, and then a waiter and his assistant, I don't feel this is necessary and kind of odd when a restaurant has $5 appetizers on the menu. I just feel like they are trying to put on this kind of atmosphere to compensate for the really really bad food and very poor presentation of the food on the plate. The crab cake was pitiful and the taste was scary, I felt like the crab was canned and the mix had been sitting in the fridge for a few days before they served it to me. 

I won't be back.",0,0,0

Yah, you heard me. 

""But I like Craftsteak and Carnevino, and Delmonico,s.""  

""Oooh, I like Prime the best. I get to see the Bellagio fountains when I smear the hostess a Benny and she lets me sit outside under those misters, so my GF thinks I'm a VIP"". "" The misters leave a fine dew on my Bosley-hair making it look thicker and more natural than it already is"".  

""I want to go to CUT. I heard someone once saw Wolfgang Puck there one time.""  

""Can we go to Baazar by Jose Andres?? I heard there's lots of eye candy there"". 

Been there, done that. 

In the amount of time it takes you to walk your date from Lavo to CarneVino, (and for the same $'s) you could have Uber'ed yourself and three of your best friends to Echo & Rig in Summerlin to enjoy undeniably superior steak, more professional and friendly service, and personalized attention by management. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the price--about 1\/3 of strip prices. And the eye candy?  Look at your plate, Einstein. 

I know what you're thinking. ""I get comped and can order whatever I want at SW and they treat me like a high roller there when I flash my Wynn card. Makes my girlfriend with the fake rack and ass-sized lips all sexy inside.  I don't have to pay for MY steak when I go to Vegas and I know what's waiting for me after I loose my roll in the casino and stumble up to my 2,500 sf comp suite for sleepy time"".

GREAT point. For the rest of us, do yourself a favor and Uber up to Summerlin for absolutely the finest steakhouse and butcher shop in Vegas...and anywhere else for that matter. Anywhere!

The thing is - I am a card-carrying vegan. And this classy joint has hunks of meat showcased right at the entrance. Hello, carcass!! So why on earth would I not only go, but actually choose this place to brunch?!

The avocado toast. The breakfast potatoes. And this fried spinach salad that I am pretty sure was blessed by the pop himself because damn, it was good. 

Despite the carnal offerings in the window, Echo & Rig offers an upscale option for discerning vegans. Don't get me wrong, I love my local tofu-scramble cafe as much as the next chakra-cleared eggplant eater. But that's eating, and sometimes you want to dine. 

Our waitress, Rae I think her name was, should open up a hospitality school. You know those people who are so wonderful and nice it actually makes you a little uncomfortable? That was her. I basically felt like a selfish slob compared to her manners and grace. She was incredible. 

Word to the wise: when you order the fried spinach salad, make sure you ask for the dressing to be made without the fish sauce.

It was Christmas eve, so perhaps this night was an anomaly.
Echo & Rig, we may be falling out of love with you. :(

Starting with the positives: 
-Cocktail was great (I finally figured it out! Just order a real up cocktail such as a Martini or Manhattan and stay away from the cocktail menu.)
-Downstairs staff were pleasant and helpful.
-Steaks were good.
-Charcuterie plate was very good.

Now the draw backs:

-Had to wait over an hour to be seated. At least we had seats downstairs and could order drinks and a charcuterie platter while we were waiting.
Why are reservations only for parties of 10 or more?
-Stella on tap is great but no Stella glasses?

Negatives:
-Upstairs Service SUCKED
-We were not offered water choices and not told that there were no specials nor that what we wanted was not available until we asked (rib eye cap and asparagus.)
We waited a long time between visits from waitstaff.
Steaks took a long time.
Staff seemed generally confused. Example: food porter stared at ticket after placing our entrees on a jack stand for at least a minute before bringing our plates. We saw several sides plates sent to tables who refused them because they didn't order them.

-Our guest said this is the second time he's been here and no rib eye cap was available. The server said ""it shouldn't be on the menu since it hasn't been available for 2 weeks"". So why is it on the menu?
-My water glass was empty for a long time, more than once.
-Server was borderline rude.
-There seemed to be no secondary wait staff (no bussers?)

Xmas Eve or not, it was a high traffic night for the restaurant. Not trying to be harsh, but they've been open for a while now and have probably had other busy nights. Bottom line, seems like E & R needs to get their reservation protocol together. Maybe if they took reservations for smaller parties they'd be better prepared with appropriate wait staff. Also, we really miss Nora's Wine Bar.",2,0,0

yummy list:
- black and blue mojito - awesome yummy flavor
- all the steaks have been yummy and cooked with probably the best consistency possible. i've grilled many steaks and it's very tough to consider width\/height of steak then to figure out how long to cook at what temperature
- lemon chimichurri sauce - the odd thing is i don't think this belongs with steak, but damn is it tasty. maybe it belongs with grill shrimp. there's a magical fusion of flavors in this sauce, but i don't suggest it with steak.
- brandied mushroom - awesome!
- steak tartare - great value compared to other fancy establishments!
- caulifower, chili de arbol, crispy shallots & onions - in my original review i raved about it, i'll raved about it again! so yummy, so magical in flavor. a must order, a must order on repeat visits

decent no compaints:
- bourbon & blood cocktail
- bearnise sauce
- fried calamari
- roasted broccolini

good but missing a bit of the echo & rig magic (it's tough to have so much magic, and i'm not docking points here because each item was still decent):
- portobello fries - maybe it needs a peppery flavor added?
- bone marrow carnde asada - the bone marrow was awesome in size, but it seemed to need another element of flavor, the lemon on the side helped to add flavor but more is still needed
- steak tuna - it was a little bland
- dessert - the ice cream sundae is somewhat plain compared to the awesome dinner. oh well :)
- brussel sprouts, pistachio & fresh lemon - there's so much here, but the magic fusion flavor isn't. did i miss something? oh well it was still decent

The differences between this place and our regular favorite steak houses are that the cuts of meat are smaller here (which allows you to fully enjoy it and the sides) and the music was fun and hip and didn't make it seem like we had to be on our best behavior, although none the less of a fancy and classy environment.

Made a reservation about a week ago due to my brother visiting from out of town. Arrived for our 10 am reservation at about 9:50. The hostess said to let her know when one more person arrived. Right at 10 let her know our 4th has arrived. Waited 26 minutes before finally being sat. Hopefully the rest of the experience doesn't follow suit. 

Previous Review:

Everything is so amazing. I always get the tri-tip with the caramelized onion sauce. Portobello Fries are amazing. The grilled cauliflower is amazing. The seabreeze drink is amazing. Everything is amazing. Come here all the time. The new blonde manager was extremely friendly and introduced herself, the seabreezes made me forget her name. Our waiter was very attentive as was the buster that was constantly cleaning the table. 

On a side note, the hostess was extremely professional. There was another lady ahead of us that was complaining about waiting for 10 minutes  to be seated and was extremely snarky and rude to the hostess. The hostess just smiled and apologized and remained professional.

I thought of a few restaurants but decided to go with Echo & Rigs because they never disappoint me. The food per usual was very good. My favorites of the night was the portobello fries, the lamb chops and the jumping beef. The lamb chops had a nice crust on the top and was very tender. The jumping beef was full of flavor and as well very tender. You honestly can't go wrong with either choice. 

Normally at Echo & Rig I have great service but the waiter that night was so so. We described the kind of wine we wanted and we let him make the recommendation. He brought out the bottle and had us try the bottle but it was nothing like we described. We kindly told the waiter we didn't like it and then he told us, he didn't have us try the wine to see if we liked it or not, he had us try it to see if it was too corky. That was the first time we ever heard of such a thing but we just looked at each other and said okay. That almost ruined our experience but then this nice gentleman name Xavier turned everything around for us. He came to check on our table to see how we were doing and after we explained what happened, he was very apologetic and got us another bottle of wine that fit our description perfectly. Xavier also sent us some dessert that was also very delicious. I would of gave this place a 3 or 4 stars because of that waiter since customer service is very important to me when dining especially at a nice establishment but Xavier really made up for it so this place is getting 5 stars. 

I highly recommend this place if you want to go somewhere that's a nice local spot off the strip. The price is very reasonable and the ambience very nice.",0,0,0

Our server James was horrible. He was condescending and every time one of us asked about menu options he tried to downplay the portion size and quality to up-sell us to a steak that was off the menu. I ended up ordering a porterhouse, not knowing the price and found out that it was a $90 steak once the bill came. The steak was nowhere near worth $90. Was it good? Yes...but I've had MUCH better in town for far less....and I feel like I was duped when ordering it. 

When we sat down to order we all ordered various small plates to share to get the dinner started. We were in no rush and just wanted to enjoy the experience and food. We told this to James our server and he became irritated that we'd be taking our time. Keep in mind our reso was for 8:30pm and we didn't get seated till 8:50pm...so it's not like they were going to turn the table again after us. 

James tried rushing us into ordering entrees again once our appetizers hit the table and rolled his eyes at us when we told him we weren't ready to order. He started going on about how the kitchen needed time to cook the steaks because of their thickness and again we had to explain we weren't in a rush....and we didn't even say we were ordering steaks at this point. 

When a guest isn't ready to order....they aren't ready to order. 

We eventually got our food and while there were some hits and misses on the table, overall the food was good...but not worth the price. For $400 for a party of 4 I would have MUCH rather gone to Carnevino or another steakhouse on the strip.

James was tipped 10% because of the poor quality of service, the misrepresentation of their pricing and his condescending attitude. I knew I did the right thing by tipping him that amount when we came by to grab the signed bill while we were still leaving the table, saw he was tipped $40, scoffed and gave us dirty looks. 

For the record, I'm usually a 25-30% tipper when the service is good and when I know I'm taking up a table a little longer than most guests in a server's section. There was no need for James to be sneaky with the pricing. If a steak is $90...then it's $90...but tell me that it's $90 upfront.",7,0,1

I have, however, had some rather unsavory characters come between me and my Rib-Eye and I don't like it (more on that later).

I have said this many time before, sometimes it takes a few visits before one can get a good feel for a place. Of course, the opposite is also true and those places typically get what they deserve. 

When it cam to Echo & Rig, I was determined to take the time needed to formulate an honest and straightforward review. Which is why it has been several months and several visits before I sat down to write this.

The breakdown:

The happy-hour: is amazing. Plenty of people have already exalted it's greatness, so I feel I have nothing to add on the subject.

The butcher shop: is rather spendy, considering they will cook the darn thing for you for nearly the same price. Still, as Vegas is desperately lacking in good butcher shops, I am delighted to pay a few bucks more to save the trip to the other side of town. Plus the quality of meat is pretty good. Oh hell, it's worth it.

The bar: is a friendly enough place and the bartenders are usually very attentive. I like that you can order dinner there, sometimes a guy doesn't want to sit at a table all alone. I am very disappointed in the selection of tap beers. There are way too many of what I would consider very hoppy brews. Despite everything Mr. Koch from Sam Adams would like you to believe, the whole world is not mad about hops. How about a nice amber lager? And what's up with all the ""goofy"" beers, aren't those better suited for bottles?

The restaurant: is very open, which is not always my style, but the patio is always good place if there's room available. The decor is simple, but well lit, which is great because some of us like to see what we're eating.

The food: is excellent. Echo & Rig care about the quality of the meats and it shows. There have been a couple of occasions where the kitchen completely mucked up the beautiful relationship I share with my Rib-Eye (one-sided though it may be). If you're a steakhouse, getting steak prepared correctly is crucial. Do you really need me to explain to you Pittsburgh Blue? 

The staff: is sometimes great and sometimes disappointing. I don't know if there is a pattern to figuring it out, but I hope they do soon. There is a lot of standing around and talking going on. I would think some of the other reviews on Yelp would have alerted the staff to the need for better attention to the customer.

The price point: is the real winner at this place. These steaks would cost you twice as much down on the strip, even the other steak house close by (Flem-something or other) charges one and half times the price for a lower quality cut.

I think this place can honestly make headway toward a 5 star rating, and in fact there have been occasions when it has, but there are still times when it falls short. 

Until then, I will continue to make regular visits to Echo & Rig. Maybe they let me step back in the kitchen and teach them how to make it Pittsburgh Blue. :-)",42,26,28

Absolutely the best customer service, table-side manners and professionalism of any restaurant I have dined at in Vegas.  Although I don't have a lot of Yelp write-ups...yet, I have dines at a number of upscale establishments in town.

Max-Props to Xavier (manager) and our ""regular"" server(s) Sam and Julian, capital 'A' Awesome.  I am a fan of servers helping with the food selections and Sam did a fantastic job.  All the dishes were spot on and dining on the upstairs outdoor patio was superb.  ALSO, One of my top reasons for patronizing Echo & Rig is their continuing support of the ""No Corkage"" policy.  Although, they have a nice wine selection, but I do as well, and prefer to bring wines I am positive my wife and I will enjoy.  Hopefully other restaurants will take note and lower or eliminate their corkages fees, some around town are at a totally ridiculous level. (i.e. $35-75)

Enjoy your time here and I highly recommend asking for a table that Sam services.

Echo & Rig was recommended by a family member who clearly knows great food & with confidance, I can now also vouch for E&R's deliciousness. 

I love love love that there are over 30 ""small plates"" on the menu. Grazing is my eating style, & if i weren't hell-bent on having filet, I would've ordered more than the superb portobello mushroom fries & herb aioli. Tried a bite from his stack of thick-cut bacon w\/ BBQ sauce -- smokey, fatty, more like baked ham than bacon. 

Love love that you get a (free!) sauce with your steak. His ""charred onion"" paired beautifully with his rib-eye cap, & my horseradish cream pick elevated an already lovely filet. Say yes to their garlic mashed potatoes. 

And finally, love that our service issue was immediately & professionally addressed. My filet arrived medium after we'd waited 40-minutes for our steaks. They whisked it away with sincere apologies, & the filet was returned well done as I had ordered. Desserts & coffee (as if we could eat anymore!) were comped for our troubles (carmel turtle sundae is a must.) 

Room for improvement: though I love (lust) that they pour ketel one, my cocktail, A Love Affair, delivered zero buzz, & tasted like a weak lemonade. 

Provided they don't make a habit of making customers endure excessive wait times for their steaks, E&R's extensive menu deserves a second look the next time we're in charming Tivoli Village.",4,5,4

NO CORKAGE fees and when the manager saw that we had our bottle in hand while we were waiting, she took it to go get it chilled and brought it out immediately when we were seated.  

We ordered the Spencer Steak (specialized rib eye) and the Lamb chops which was some of the highest quality and best bang for the buck steaks you can get.  This was accompanied by portobello fries fried perfectly with a little crisp and all the fresh umami meatiness from the mushrooms.   The cauliflower you could practically feed to kids...so delicious.

- Portabello fries with garlic aiolo sauce: lightly battered mushroom slices, you have to try this; the sauce is bomb
- Fried calamari: fresh & flavorful.  Light batting that didn't fall off in the dip. The calamari sans sauce is s still tasty.
- grilled cheese sandwich: short ribs, gruyère parmesan & white cheddar.  I still dream about this and want to go back and try it again.  
- Jumping beef: not what I expected.  I expected a dry dish with tomatoes and potato, but it was more saucy.
- the Tomahawk steak shared family style for was not good by any means.

To be honest with you, the more expensive places from this place to Capital Grill etc, seem to have the most issues with cooking a steak correctly. I've gone to Tony Roma's and they have yet so mess it up. It  frustrates me no end that I can go to a less expensive restaurant and they nail it every single time but as soon as we go to shell out more money damned if they don't almost screw it up. It's medium rare. It's not rocket science. Get it right. Cook with confidence and timing for the love of good. I don't want rare or almost rare, I want medium rare. Most of the time I just settle and order medium these days. I am not confident they can't get it right pretty much everywhere but this time I took a shot.

How can this be? It's Summerlin, but alas it's true! 

We came here over the weekend with a larger party of 15 people. This restaurant has a cool layout. The bar is located downstairs while the restaurant and open kitchen is located upstairs. 

The menu is easy to read, priced affordably and offers an arrange of delicious items, including cool cuts of beef.

We ordered the tomahawk bone in ribeye, what a show stopper! Great for the Instagram feed! We also ordered the famous spencer steak, the horseradish crusted butterfish, the Mac and cheese, the white cheddar mashed potatoes, the portabello mushroom fries, the baked Brie, thethick cut bacon and every sundae on the menu for dessert. Don't judge me. 

The spencer steak was incredible. The meat was cooked perfectly, well seasoned and full of flavor. The kind of steak you wish you had more of and salivate thinking about. One of the best I've had in Vegas. Even better then the tomahawk in my opinion, although that one was killer too. The butterfish was just that, like buttah melting in your mouth. The balsamic sauce it was served with made the dish. All of our sides were awesome, the mushroom fries were unique and tasty along with the dipping sauce they are served with. 

My favorite sundae was the cappuccino and the peanut butter. 

Our server was Ricky. He was top notch. The celebratory guest of our party was slightly demanding and he took care of her needs as well as ours incredibly.

AMBIENCE: High end decor. Very spacious seating area. Dim lighting, perfect area for an intimate gathering. Outdoor seating is perfect for the night time, perfect view of Tivoli Village. 

SERVICE: The service is the ONLY reason as to why this place is receiving 5 stars and an A rating. Our server was absolutely phenomenal! I have never been to a place where I felt absolutely taken care of. Waiter was very informative, friendly, and attentive. Our order was messed up in the beginning, but the waiter took care of it and more! Not only compensated our wait with a complimentary kale salad, but also gave us a complimentary desert at the end of our meal.

FOOD\/FLAVOR: 
1. BAVETTE. $27.6. Medium rare. Highly recommend ordering this. It is ""One of Europe's most popular cuts."" Complimented with a Red Wine Demi sauce on the side. 
2. BERRY SHORTCAKE: Highly recommend this desert at the end of the meal. Phenomenal colors and plating. The tartness of the berries compliments the sweetness of the vanilla ice cream as well as the citrus shortcake. Great desert for sharing. 


RETURN CHANCE: 8.5 likeliness. Very likely to return for dinner. Possibly try their brunch in the near future. 
FINAL THOUGHTS: The service made the whole Echo & Rig experience worthwhile. Absolutely phenomenal service.  The food was a solid 7 out of 10. This was the best service I have ever received in all dinning. Please go check them out, will not be disappointed.",0,0,0

They messed up on the guest note and put ""Mr."" down on my girlfriend's name, which was funny because they addressed me by my girlfriend's name, but that's not a big deal, especially considering how great of a time we had.

Quick note on the restaurant layout: the restaurant itself is upstairs and the floor is lovely with plenty of spacing between tables and a nice view of the tivoli roundabout. Not loud. Very pleasant.

Our server was Ricky and he was amazing. So friendly, funny, and he gave us such a great overview of the menu and explanation of specific items. We started with two cocktails: the le passion, which was great, very well balanced, and the white lightning, which was way too sweet for my taste, but maybe I shouldn't have chosen a cocktail with brown sugar in it. Then Ricky recommended the portobello fries as a starter and they were a revelation. You must try them.

For our meal we had the kale salad, which was sweet, light, exactly what you'd expect, then followed with tie-dye salmon, which was incredibly moist and went perfectly with the asparagus one coconut rice its served with. The kitchen also sent us a cauliflower and chile dish gratis, but I can't remember the name of it. It was incredible, a perfect balance of sweetness and spice. I'll certainly order it when I'm back.

We finished with sundaes: one with all three sorbets and the other and apple sundae, which tasted like an apple a la mode. Both were absolutely delicious, but also enormous. I expected them to be medium in size like the other dishes we had, but no, these things were enormous. Definitely meant to be shared.

Also their price for bottomless mimosa beats every price in town for a measly $16 bucks as opposed to the going rate of $20 . My favorite thing about the bottomless mimosa is that the champagne come in a glass separately with a brandy soaked cherry at the bottom of the glass and the oj comes on the side.

We were seated by a friendly local young lady and immediately greeted by one of the managers who warmly welcomed us. We weren't aware that there was outdoor patio seating or we would have requested it. Oh well, next time. Our server was immediately introduced and he took our drink order and also offered flat or sparkling water. Our server was amazing! His name was Hugo and we will most definitely request him when we return this summer. Hugo carefully explained the menu and presented a large tray of the most beautiful assortment of steaks. We selected the 32oz Porterhouse which was charged to a med. rare perfection! The steak would take awhile to cook so our server presented us with a beautiful salad of watermelon and heirloom tomatoes.  Our steak arrived cooked to perfection and sliced by the chef as we requested. We ordered a couple of sides, the garlic mashed with cheddar and a sweet potato.

I called ahead for reservations thinking Saturday night would be a busy night. It was even busier than I thought. Reservations or not, we still had to wait 15 minutes for a table and watched someone who walked in 5 minutes after us get seated before us.....(?) One wonders when they set their reservation for.

Upon being seated, I saw a table open on the patio and inquired about it. We were told that table is not available and took our seats where the young lady sat us. About 5 minutes later a couple of ladies were seated next to us and when I looked over 5 minutes later they were not there anymore. Well, I think you can guess where they were sitting now.....yup, the very table I had asked about. No good for us, but fine for them.........

I will say the waiter was pleasant. All business, but when you show up on Saturday night at the time we did, you have to understand the balancing act. He did a good job while still maintaining his pace. I can appreciate this kind of waiter as my family owned a restaurant for 72 years. Kudos, Sam.

Cocktails were fine, nothing special, but definitely drinkable. Still, when making a mojito, please just bruise up the mint. The idea is just to release the oil to infuse the drink, smashing it until it crumbles will insure every sip is filled with broken mint leaves. (this was one of their specialty drinks?)

Appetizers were fine (we ordered three), but once again, not especially praiseworthy. The portabella fries were good enough for a mention, though. Crisp and tasty, I might have to try making them myself.

Entrees......this is where a so-so experience totally fell apart. We ordered our steaks medium, we like pink throughout, but not raw or cooked to ash. Our steaks arrived and one cut determined they were still 85% raw. Seared less than 1\/4 inch outside and completely undone inside. Japanese call this tataki and if I had ordered that, it would have been fine, but I did not. We called the waiter and he immediately took them back and said that he would have them cooked to order. When they came back, they were charcoal.

Since the waiter was not the one who brought them back, I don't hold him responsible. He knew what we had ordered and I am sure if he had seen them, he would not have brought them out to us. Another member of his team brought them and one look told us all we needed to know. Still, we cut them to check; leather and brown all they way through, ash on the outside. I like char, but this was two fine pieces of meat ruined beyond eating.

It needs to be said that Echo and Rig is a butcher shop and their specialty is meat. Hmmmm?

Curiously, and this may not have anything to do with anything, but I wonder what kind of grill they use since there was no cross-hatching on the steaks. Since they sell books on grilling and have charcoal also for sale, doesn't that mean they cook over open flame with wood, too?

We called the waiter and said politely that we were done here and could he bring us the check. I told him I would not pay for the steaks, but that I was willing to pay for everything else. He apologized and tried what he could to fix the situation, but one little thing after another ending with this total fail was enough for us. He called the manager Derrick and he also apologized and said he would like a chance to fix the evening, so invited us back another time and made sure his fellow manager Xavier was aware of our situation.

I'm not sure we will take them up on the offer, but the fact that they offered was appreciated. Thank you gentlemen and kudos to our waiter, Sam. (I hope I got your name right, because I'm trying to forget this experience)

Still, until we give them another try (read ""if"" here), I cannot give them anything other than the ""one star"" that this experience was. Sorry guys maybe next time?",3,2,2

We made our reservation in advance 48 hours before because we read that this place can get packed and reservation is a must. When we arrived on time the hostess made us wait. She said our table is getting cleaned up. So we waited and waited. 25 minutes later I went up and asked what's going on? She said it's coming soon you're up next! So we waited and waited... 35 minutes go by we are still sitting at the waiting area... Now I'm becoming a bit irritated. What's the point of making a reservation when we can't even be seated on time? 

45 minutes goes by, a group of 8 people walks in and I assume they have a reservation, they waited about 5 minutes and got seated before us... Just to be clear we had a group of 7. I'm sorry but that was unacceptable. Clearly something is wrong. Either with management or the hostess was incapable of managing the reservation list. No updates were given to us. No water. Nothing... Just coldness all around.

We finally got seated after 55 minutes of waiting... Again, what's the point of making a reservation? 

As for the food, honestly, if people think it's good or great, I can tell you from experience this place is nothing special. Yes they have different cuts but it's just a fancier version of BJs and Wood Ranch. The fish according to the server is flown in ""daily."" Their sides are ""amazing"" and their beefs are ""spectacular."" LOL. Thinking about this place just makes me want to laugh and cry. The way that people talk about this place makes it sound like JoEl Roubochon, but this is nothing compared to Joel. Their fish was certainly not flown daily and their their sides are decent but overly priced for what it is. The beef was good and priced quite well for what it is.

Oh yes the manager came out and apologized and gave us free dishes which consisted of 2 sides (cauliflower and squash), equivalent to a total $10 dollars. $10 for waiting almost an hour, LOL. I honestly felt cheated and abused. Oh yes they gave us their ""best"" waiter, whom was nice but a bit too headstrong and overly confident. Seems like he was in a rush. But it was a slap in the face. I felt like calling out the manager and speaking with him but what's the point? We are never coming back.

Overall, the wait killed it for us. We had a reservation and we waited for over 55 minutes. The worst was when a group of 8 got seated before us and they only waited 5 minutes. The food was mediocre. The bread is a joke. Serving cold bread? Hahahah. The service and he management was just piss poor and I seriously thought some of the reviews I have read made this place feel like the next Joel Robuchon but this was nothing close to a high end BJs or Yard House. There are so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas and this one was a big disappointment. If I'm going to fork out $60 per person (no tips includes) I rather do it on the strip when I know the service will be good and the quality will be better. 

Save your money and go elsewhere. This was a joke of a restaurant who is trying too hard with their ambience and the whole meat bazaar.

1 star for the service (waited 55 minutes when we had a reservation. Got seated after a prty whom waited for 5 minutes and only got 2 sides for free, LOL)
2 stars for the food (cold bread and mediocre beef\/sides)
2 stars for the value (just a high end version of BJs and Yard House)

Stay away from this place...",8,4,1
