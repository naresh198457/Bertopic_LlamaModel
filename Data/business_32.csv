After all, with a name like Pho Kim Long, you might think this is the Las Vegas Chinatown equivalent to the Chicken Ranch. 

You might also forget that you have already slurped on the savory dishes here. 

Pho Kim Long is a popular Vietnamese restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. It is very large, and at lunch there are at least 10 people working here, doing a brisk business. The food is solid but not spectacular. The menu is very extensive, the ambiance clean, upscale and modern, and the service is very good. Prices are a little more than you are used to in California's Viet hot spots. 

They do have a lounge adjacent to it now, which I haven't tried yet. Maybe it is a Viet Cafe or classic Viet men's lounge? It might be closer to the sound of the name sake, Pho Kim Long, at least in some parton's minds.",11,11,9

Quick seating and service, and a hot and tasty broth make it worth the trip.  I'm not one to get fancy with pho, so I usually go with pho tai or pho tai chin.  A bit of hot sauces mixed up for dipping the meat, and I'm happy.

The egg rolls are served nuclear hot, and unlike a lot of other places, appear to be home-made... at least ours always appear that way, from their non-uniform shapes and funky bulges.  Oh, and they're tasty, too.

A bowl of pho runs you around $7 with a large being $1 more.  This is expensive for pho compared to places in L.A., but is about the norm for Pho here in Vegas.  It's one of our default go-to suggestions when we're hungry and cruising up Spring Mountain.",0,0,0

I ordered the CafeSuDa and it was already mixed, which I don't like personally - it was too sweet for me.

I always start off with ordering their calamari which I find very tasty.

Cause this most recent trip (though not completely sober yet not completely famished, either) I did not find much enjoyment in their food.

This go around, I had the chicken pho. The chicken was cut up into thin slices of white meat which was a bit chewy. The broth was pretty much a fail with very little flavor. At 8 or 9 bucks for this bowl of noodle soup, I definitely expected better. And since my food was unsatisfying, I took a few bites off of a friend's fried rice. That  was too oily for my taste. I was not feeling that either.

So aside from the very quick service (got our food in about 5 minutes after they took our order), the complimentary hot tea, open 24hrs., and the fact that the name does have a tendency to make people laugh and tell off colored jokes at 3 in the morning, it's just not the local spot for good Asian eats.

As for me, I haven't been here since December of 2008. Back then, I really wasn't into pho. Since then, I've been to quite a few places. While I'm still no expert, I obviously know what I like. I've been meaning to return so that I can properly evaluate this restaurant.

Simply put, PKL is A-OK. Their pho satiates the appetite. Their broth is pretty good and the rest of the ingredients complement the soup nicely. Unfortunately, they do not serve tripe, which for me is a bummer. However, they do have that ""home made"" style chili sauce that I strangely prefer over plain old Sriracha. There's nothing wrong with Sriracha of course; I'm just weird like that.

One thing that PKL has going for it is the decor. Places like Pho So 1 make better pho but are completely devoid of any personality. You would never confuse PKL with a diner. That's really not that important to me though.

In the end, it's all about the pho. In that case, PKL is good enough, especially when no other place is open.",0,1,0

It smelled like they've used the same old, dirty, moldy, rag to wipe down the tables for 100000 years without washing it. The whole restaurant had an old wet towel smell to it.

You can tell how they divided the tables and one side were the drunk leftovers from the club. The smaller side were just regular people ready to dine. I went there after picking my girlfriends mom up from her late swing shift. We get there around 4 AM. No crowd but the security guard actually seats us which was fine. 

We sit down and were given menus. My girlfriends mom waves to her coworker that also just got off work. We were finally given some water and looking at the menu and after about 10 minutes we are finally asked if we're ready and sadly we weren't. So he said ""Okay"" no customer service with a take your time yadiyadiya... just left. Then comes this solo diner that sits next to us. After about 5 minutes of him waiting he was upset and walked over to the security guard. Security guards asked if he would like to start with appetizers. Guy replies ""no I just want to order, number 13"" blam.  Done deal. He places the order and security guard comes back to us asking if We'd like ""fast"" appetizers and sorry for the wait because they're back up... which is believable but.. I know for a fact they weren't. The same guys that were ready to take our order saw us. We figured okay maybe they think we're still pondering our great options at pho kim long. No we want pho homie. It's simple. Surpringly our spring rolls came out just minutes after ordering. At the same time our solo diner already had his food but tells the server ""you guys forgot my drink and napkin"".. they didn't apologize because they knew they didn't want to serve him as it seemed he was a ""regular""

We sat there with our empty plates and half empty glasses of water. The guy who supposedly wanted to take our order then starts to clean up the table that was next to ours and the girlfriends mothers coworkers said a peep and he walked over, placed there order. Right after that the solo diner was done he paid and left. Before we even had a chance to order. The guy cleans up and another guy basically asked how much and he said zero. And the employees seemed a bit off.

Now everything was cool it seemed fine until after our meal. Sure I can understand horrible service for people who always have to deal with drunk leftovers from the club... but you sat us on a side with regular people just waiting to dine. We asked for a to go box and the check. I work in the tipping industry and understand we should tip. At least. As for restaurant tipping I truly believe that is based on the customer service we received.. I felt like we didn't get any.. so do they deserve any? Sure. I gave them 3 dollars. I felt generous. I usually double the tax but for this I kept it as is. 

I walk up to the cashier and pay with card. He rips off the first receipt and says it very bluntly ""choose one"" and circles the tipping options and stares at me. I say ""no thank you I already tipped you cash."" So he immediately steps back and calls on the ""radio"" which was clipped to his shirt but says very loudly where the restaurant can hear ""get the money from table 6"" and the guy responds ""Okay I got It"" cashier responds ""What?"" And no longer using their little walkie talkies they said 3. And everyone was like ""THREE?!"" I didn't realize it at the time because I spent an hour waiting for food it was 5 am. I was tired and ready to go home. It was just completely rude. 

If they wanted a generous tip they should have given top notch customer service to sober people versus kissing ass to a bunch of drunk idiots who more than likely gave them a stiff. It's a common spot to go here and I've never experienced customer service like this before. Only quality thing they had there was security.. so if you want late night food\/pho with a high chance to see a fight(why else is there a security guard at a restaurant) go to pho kim long.

The food was delicious, and though I must say that it is hard to mess up Pho like it's hard to mess up a burger, you definitely can taste the difference.  However; PKL does not meet that standard.  There are a lot of Pho chains out there, and PKL is decent in that regards.  They are open late at night and good for some midnight cravings after a night of gambling if you're a tourist.  Or whatever you happen to be in Vegas for.

There is a bathroom, service is decent, and I have and probably will visit this place quite often.

First of let me say that I work overnights, so when I get off at 5am my options are extremely limited. Pho Kim Long is probably the healthiest option if i want to eat out. The place is always clean but the service is lacking. Usually one person takes your order, another brings you the drink (a lot of the time after receiving food), another brings you the food.

The food always comes out in random order. Sometimes the Pho comes out first, sometimes the entrees. Sometimes it takes forever and sometimes its quick.

Because I've been there at least 20 times I've tried a lot on the menu, but not everything (the menu is extensive). 

The combination pho is good, it's not the best I've had but its consistently good. no complaints.

The spring rolls are fresh, but they are small. A lot smaller than any other place I've been.

Some of the entrees I've had we're just mediocre including Kung pao chicken, mongolian beef, curry chicken, and walnut shrimp. They weren't bad, just nothing stood out.

One dish that did stand out was the Honey garlic pork chops. I don't know if these are Vietnamese or Chinese or what, but they are some of the best food I've had at an asian restaurant. So tasty!

Trust me, if you visit this place during peak hours, good luck finding a seat to wait or a place to stand cause there's not much space to do so.

$5.50 for two of the shittiest spring rolls I've ever seen. It just looks skinny, sad, and... flaccid. God knows how long they've been in the fridge because the wrappers are tough. Shrimp are small, and they're just dreadfully bland. 

Pho options aren't the good stuff, like tendon and tripe. They don't even do the legit stuff here. Their Bun Bo Hue doesn't come with blood sausage, and they don't have cooked cabbage, lemongrass, or any of that other stuff that normally comes with BBH.

After a night of enthusiastic fist pumping to Armin van Buurin at Marquee, our arms were sore, our feet were hurting, and our stomachs were empty. My friends had already gone the night before (in a limo, no less -- we do it big in Vegas), but pho just really seemed to be a really good idea. 

The taxi line was monstrous but we managed to squeeze into a 5-person taxi and off we went to pho heaven!

I had pad thai and a bowl of regular pho with rare steak. Even though it was busy during my visit that gives no excuse to NOT prepare food correctly. The soup was not as hot as it is usually and the combination Pad Thai looked okay to me. I felt okay up until around 7pm on 11\/26\/2018 and then it all hit me. I could not stop throwing up from 7pm until I went to the UMC ER and they gave me medicine to bring down the nausea. My stomach pains unbearable which was reason enough to go to the ER and get checked. I really believe this restaurant should follow lawful procedures when preparing their food. Things like would never happen if you people took the time to care for your guest eating at your restaurant. BE CAREFUL EATING HERE PEOPLE!!!,0,0,0

Coming off of the best pho I've ever had at Vietnamese Central in Westminster, Orange County, CA...  this place was flavorful, but not AMAZING.

I'm assuming if you're a visitor, you'll come here either for cheap lunch or for a late-night, post-clubbing chow-down.  I think this place will do it for either one -- as long as you're craving pho.

[=SERVICE\/WAIT=]
We came in with a group of 10 for a late-ish lunch.  Parking wasn't too hard, even though the lot was pretty full.  They seemed pretty busy too, but we only had to wait 5 minutes or so to get seated, so that was surprising.  Waters came out quickly, so OK on the service.

[=THE FOOD: PHO=]
Pho is definitely the thing to get -- cheapest for the most food.  I had one of the pho with three cuts of meat.  It was a little salty and I wish they had more noodles, but no other complaints.  I wish they had given more bean sprouts and basil for our large group, but I'm sure we could have asked and they would have gladly obliged.

[=VERDICT=]
I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here next time I visit Vegas unless I was specifically craving pho -- but chances are, I'll get something better\/more expensive, or cheaper\/closer.  If you're only visiting Vegas for a few days...  why get something you can get anywhere else?",1,1,1

Our team waited only ten minutes for a table in the back room, where it says "" Employees only""  Looks to be a room that they will slowly expand into and perhaps was another restaurant before?  

d.  Pho - Had Number 13, which has everything in it and also the Bun Bo Hue with Pho noodles instead of rice noodles (vermicelli).  OK, don't hate that!  I know it is traditional to have BBH with the rice noodles. It is just that the consistency of the Pho noodles is soooooo much better and the texture is amazing. The way the noodles drape over your chopsticks as you shovel a huge portion into your mouth is just what the doctor ordered.  Hard to do with the rice noodles as it is bigger and the consistency is such that you cannot pack a bunch into  your mouth.  Hey it is part of the noodle experience if you ask me.  Just watch any movie where you watch the Japanese salary-men at lunch slurping down a bowl of ramen and I think you will get my drift.  Noodles are meant to be hoovered!  

e.  Pho Part II - Anyway, the Bun Bo Hue at 1:00 am is a very, very good. The broth is just right, they serve the spice separately so you can make the soup as hot as you want.  They serve all the bits of tendon, offal, pork hock and everything you can imagine that was eaten in the city of Hue due to well, the poor economy.  I finally learned that offal is the stuff in meats that you cook that most people don't eat.  The offal is awfully good!!! It is what makes the soup.  My son had number 13 which is nearly like BBH without the pork hock and the spice. He slurped that up, but I won because my BBH came first and I had a head start!

f.  The Chicken - Yep, ordered once again the Salted Baked Chicken with Ginger sauce.  Why?  Because it is so good, nutritious and a very good measure of the chef and the restaurant.  Simple to cook, yet easy to over cook, the meat has to be so juicy and tender. It is either that or overcooked as the entire taste is from the chicken itself.  It has to be on the bone, and it has to make you caveman like to use your hands to gnaw at every morsel of meat on the bone!  The ginger onion sauce has to be so good that you are putting it on the chicken like you would butter and you have to ask for more.  This time, the chicken was great.  I went there two weeks ago at 8:00 am and it was absolutely horrible.   So, I think that the chefs know at 1:00 am they will have a ton, so they are making it and storing it just right. At 8:00 am, the last time, I probably had a heated up stored chicken and it was as if ""I made it myself.  just mehhhh"".  Fresh and hot is best and it was rocking at 1:00 am.

Overall, great menu, many of other choices on there that you would find in a Chinese restaurant and a great place to end up!

Now they serve brown rice for 1.50 more.  This Chinese people are so good at making money on rice!  Here is the dealio though. At 1:00 am most of the people there are drunk or buzzed and needing greasy fatty foods to recover. I don't think they are so worried about brown rice....

I've been here twice now; once being at 6am with absolutely no one in the restaurant and another time being during the lunch rush, on a Friday, on a holiday. Both times were at two extremes, but I know for certain that this place does get really packed during peak times. The restaurant is so big, so the wait time isn't nearly as bad as it feels with so many people around. The most recent time I was here, we counted a total of 25 parties ahead of our name, but our party of 7 got seated within 45 minutes, so all in all, pretty reasonable. We unfortunately got stuck sitting in the back room which seems like an extension of the restaurant with what looks to be like an old kitchen counter in the back. Not an ideal seating arrangement, but it was spacious so it worked.

Our table got an order of eggrolls, which tasted pretty much like your average Vietnamese eggrolls. I ordered the #15 Pho Tai Chin, which was rare steak and brisket and was amazing. Perfect size portion and the broth was so soothing for the cold day. There is plenty of meat and noodles in the bowl and the whole thing was the perfect temperature and full of flavor.

The wait is ALWAYS a pain in the ass, because it's always freakin' packed!! But, the wait's worth it. They redecorated since the last time we've been, and it looks like a mini jungle near the windows. lol It's always very loud in this place. 

Service is typical of any busy Asian restaurant - you don't have a specific waiter : you ask anyone who will come to you for service. haha 

Their food is delish. We had the sweet and sour soup, which had pineapples, beansprouts, catfish, and more. Yum. Their hainam chicken is okay, but it was a big portion. Their stir fried veggies were cooked just right. We also had something called  ca kho, which is catfish simmered in some kind of sauce... I don't know what in the world that sauce is made of, but it's addicting! Mix it with the rice and nom away. 

Their pho is pretty good too, although I forgot how much it was. A lot of places attempt to make pho but never succeed. Luckily, this place does, and does it well. 

What I didn't know is that they charge each person for rice. At first, I was kind of miffed by that, as many place don't, but I realized that this is very reasonable, considering that many people don't finish the whole thing and waste a ton of it.

we ordered fried rice, some orange chicken and pho-- funny thing, the pho came out last.  you think they would bring that out first since it requires barely any work to prepare.

anyway, the pho was decent-- it hit the spot alright.  but portion wise is a little small... i mean for $7 bucks, you can't expect too much-- it was enough food for little o me, i don't know about anybody else though.

CON
1. chinese menu is OK.   my american friends enjoy it.^^;

PRICING
average cost...  nothing that will blow out your wallet.

CLOSING
i love eating here because it's always busy, even at 2am...  and that lends to a very exciting upbeat atmosphere.   my only gripe is it tries to do too much with it's menu and the result is not all that great.

NOTE* i hate being served only 2 meatballs for my Pho Dac Biet.!!",0,0,0

I am no pho expert, and as a matter of fact, I order bun and not pho, but I find this place to be only OK. On our most recent visit, our table ordered together, and my #32 didn't come until everyone was done eating and we inquired about it. It's on the pricey side for pho...most dishes around $9-12. The shrimp spring rolls are popular with my krew, as are the rolls with the shredded pork skin, but I'm not particularly fond of either, especially considering the price. Service is OK at best. Decor is nice, almost classy, even. They're open late, and they're pretty close to the freeway, which are very good things. I'm not in love with the place, but some of my more pho-knowledgeable friends are very fond of it. I'll continue to go, but I'm definitely keeping my eye out for something better, or at least cheaper.

PRO-TIP: They won't split checks, so if dining with a group, bring cash.",2,2,0

Later I ended up ordering a Asahi beer for my husband which he got right away and a Thai Ice tea for me which I had to remind them about 20 minutes later because they forget. I got the combination beef Pho which is always good. My husband ordered the hot wings which weren't hot and when he asked the waitress if these were the right wings, she said ""yes"" and walked away. He also ordered the honey walnut shrimp w\/mayo. They were good but not as good as I remember. Also you have to eat them right away because as soon as they cool off the sauce leaves a film in your mouth. Also I think it's crazy you have to pay for a side order of rice ($1.50) to go along w\/an entrée. My friend ordered Kung Pao shrimp and they had to pay for a side of rice too.

All of my friends have at least been here once, i've been here multiple times late at night, and even for lunch. I've experienced pho at many other restuarants and can say Pho Kim Long is just about average.  

My most recent visit was yesterday. As it was hot, i didn't feel like ordering something too hot like a soup or rather pho. I wasn't too hungry either, so i ordered Pan friend udon, yes I know, a Pho place wouldn't specialize in it, but another place i've been to had superb udon.

It was around 3pm when i arrived and there was a good amount of people. Glad to see they're still getting service. I walked in and it took me 10 minutes just to get seated. Like i said there was a good amount of people, it wasn't packed or very busy. Once i got a table i browsed the menu, already knowing what i wanted, udon. I eye'd the waiter down or rather signaled him to come over and he looked away, but he did eventually come around after 15 minutes of waiting. I ordered my chicken pan fried udon and he went on his merry way. 

The order came faster than i expected took about 3 to 5 minutes aha. Not bad. I tasted my first mouthfull. Not bad, but not good either. It was very tasteless. I put some sauce on there, it made it better but i could still taste that blandness in the noodles. Nearing the end of the dish, I noticed a lot of bean sprouts leftover. I like beansprouts and i tend to eat those first but there was still a lot and it watered down the sauce so much that it just tasted like water after eating most of the udon.

Again, I suppose having udon at a pho place isn't ideal, but i wasn't feeling up to having a hot soup on a hot noon day. Perhaps at dinner? 

This was an average day, i was full after eating, but wasn't satisfied with how it tasted. Eat anything but the udon!",1,0,0

But, this time it really wasn't anything exceptional and I had wished I just ate somewhere else after. I think my main issues is the poor customer service. Anytime if I ask a question or if we're low on the items at the table, they usually give me a dirty look and make it seem that I'm such an annoyance to them. I think the last straw for me was when my dad was asking about a dish and the guy was like if you're so worried about it then don't eat it. Ridiculously rude.

It really hits the spot and never fails to fill your cravings because it's open 24hrs.  The convenience and price of the food is truly what makes up for my rating!!  I'd give it a 5, only sometimes the food isn't always consistent and service is just alright (although I don't expect much from a place with such inexpensive food).  

Anyway, the food I usually eat is pho tai with the steak on the side.  Squeeze in some lime and you're good to go.  I also really like the stir fried beef cubes with seasoned rice.  That dish is always on point.  The grilled pork chops is something I used to always get, but i've noticed that this dish is sometimes poorly prepared (undercooked) so i rarely ever get this anymore.  Spring rolls you can't really go wrong with and the egg rolls are pretty yum too.  That is the extent of my menu knowledge, but i have also tried the  mongolian beef, walnut prawns and some of their vermicelli dishes through my friends.  

One thing I always get here is the pineapple shake!! YUM!  I've tried their other shakes and noticed them to be a tad bit powdery or artificial tasting.

I had never tried the spring rolls which from my recollection are shrimp and chicken with veggies wrapped in a rice paper and paired with peanut sauce.

Our party of 8 got sat quickly even with several names before us on the list.  It took a bit for the ordering and the food, but nothing awful.  What was kind of a bummer is we ordered boba, appetizers and entrees - the appetizers and entrees came at appropriate times but the boba came halfway through the entree.  I don't know if that was on purpose or not, but everyone in my group thought it would have arrived first.

Spring rolls were a bit chewy but the overall taste was ok. The peanut dipping sauce was good.

Their bun thit nuong cha gio (grilled sliced pork & fried egg rolls over cold vermicelli and vegetables) is actually better than some of the other places I've tried in town, but I felt it was more expensive with less food.  Chalk that up to the 24-hour convenience, I suppose.

Coconut milk slush boba was pretty good, especially for a place that isn't a standalone boba shop.

My friend let me try some of his pho broth and I do have to say it's pretty darn tasty.

Pho is solid - can't go wrong with any of the choices.
I also tried the clams in black bean sauce (good), fried mussels (ok) and mayonnaise shrimp with walnuts (good).

They asked if we wanted rice, we said yes. Was charged $3. Wish they said something before we saw it on the check. Plus, most places give you white rice for free if you order mains (I can understand if we just ordered pho).  3 mains (in addition to a pho per person) and I'm charged for rice? I'm big on principle.

It's a good deal compared to 99% of restaurants on the strip (for those visiting) but by the time you add in cab fare round trip, it loses some of its value.

The one thing that had me really not happy was that when my girlfriend and I wanted to pay our bill, they took the money quick but didn't bring back our change. Not sure if they were just expecting us to leave and forget about our change, but it seemed like they did that to a few tables. Very sketchy thing to do.

Deco:  it was very simple, many big family tables.  My bf and I were seated at a table that fits 6 people.  We had the entire table to ourselves, even though there were people waiting for a seat.  In NY Viet restaurants, they would easy make you share a table with total strangers!  Overall, the restaurants and waiters seems somewhat clean.

Food:  I had the pho with sliced raw beef.  The broth was very tasty.  I very much enjoyed it.  I have to say that it was comparable to the pho in NY.  It tasted just as good but cleaner.  It sounds strange but if had the pho from pho bang in ny, you would know what I mean.  

Service: the waiter was attentive and quick.  I'm there for the food, not to make friends.  I just got out of airport security, 5 hrs flight, 1 hr car rental line, I just want quick good food!  This Viet pho spot definitely satisfied my taste buds and made the trip well worth it.",0,0,0

Way back in January, I'm sitting on this shuttle bus that runs from the convention center to Rio, Palms, and Caesar's. The bus goes over the highway, and I happen to glance out the window at a billboard on my left side. ""Pho Kim Long"", I read, out loud. And proceed to giggle like a little girl. I think to myself, 'Pho King is a clever name, but Pho Kim Long is genius.'

Fast forward to the next day when we were hungry for dinner and not looking forward to the long drive back to LA. We couldn't think of anywhere to eat, and then all of a sudden that billboard flashed in my mind. We all agreed to go to Pho Kim Long, because with a name like that, you've got to at least try it.

They seem to be the only restaurant around that isn't ridiculously overpriced and offers many options. Vermicelli noodles, rice dishes (not com tam\/broken rice though), ph, soup, etc. 
I've been here twice because my dad only enjoys viet food.
My first visit I tried their mi xoa Kim long (crispy egg noodle house stir-fry) . It wasn't that good. Too sweet and not enough savory. Oily and most of the noodles where already soggy by the time it got to me. And a small variety of vegetables too.
This morning I tried com bo luc lac(shaking beef and rice). It completely lacked flavor and the rice tasted dirty. It's presentation did not look like it was worth $12.50 either. Plus I ordered an egg which came out fully cooked(I wanted sunny side up), broken (I'm a perfectionist), in a pool of oil(plain nasty), and 7 minutes after my rice plate came out(wtf?).
My parents order one of Kim Long's more popular dishes. Canh chua (sour soup) and ca kho do(braised fish clay pot). 
The soup was sour as expected, the fish tasted fresh and clean so this was good
The fish clay pot as overly seasoned with oyster sauce so I wasn't a fan.

It can get busy at different times during the day, but the service is always very good, considering.

I always order the Pho Ga, for the pure simplicity & deliciousness of it ;) I have tried other things on the menu as well, but this is the dish that gives me the warm & fuzzies. Imagine consuming a bowl of hugs & that is what this dish is for me.

Well, they really aren't that as they are more of a Vietnamese restaurant with several Cantonese style Chinese dishes. But the food we ordered was pretty good nonetheless. I have been back many times, mostly for lunch and love their barbeque pork with Vietnamese eggrolls and vermicelli (number 23 on the lunch menu). I always ask for extra fish sauce which I really enjoy with this dish. The lettuce and shaved carrots are fresh and crisp, the pork is always done perfectly and the egg rolls are delicious. They add crushed peanuts on the top so beware if you have allergies. I have always found the service to be prompt, attentive and personable even though they are usually very busy at lunch time (particularly on Fridays).

So you're probably thinking ""well, your two star rating doesn't really indicate that"". It doesn't. I love the pho and the food in general. It's great! I've had pho at a few other places and it's just not the same. I also love that this place is open like 24 hours (maybe they close at some point, but I'm pretty sure I've ended up here past two a.m) The chicken pad thai is pretty freaking bad ass too! 

So the reason for my two star rating is because I've had pretty crappy customer service at this place. I like to rate food establishments based on a few standards....quality of food, cleanliness, and customer service! Quality of food gets an A+, however, the other two categories fail miserably. I've been here plenty of times, which gives this place a lot of chances to improve their customer service, and they just don't! 

One time we had to wait forever (which you can usually expect if you're going on the weekend or anytime during the dinner rush) and our waiter was just generally unpleasant. Nothing specific, just a bad attitude. The most recent visit, the waitress brought over our water and said she'd give us a few minutes, which happened to be maybe twenty minutes (I'm indecisive, but I don't need twenty whole minutes to choose my dinner). The water had a very tiny bug in it, which I really didn't think was a huge deal. I don't get grossed out easily so I just asked for another one. What really kind of got me thinking was how calm and casually the waiter reacted to it. He just nonchalantly said ""Oh, sorry. I'll bring you another one"" and quietly walked away with my bug infested water. Not the worst part. While still enjoying my pho and chatting with my girlfriend I was asked TWICE if I was finished with my food and almost got my plate taken away if I didn't respond fast enough! That was the deal breaker for me. I like to take my time when I eat, especially if I'm having good company and good conversation. So that really irked me. I felt rushed and uncomfortable. I wasn't asked if I wanted a box for my leftover food (didn't really want one, but I feel like servers should always ask, specially if there's a lot of food left on the plate). There's been other occasions in which they just refuse to accommodate a simple request or just show absolutely no enthusiasm. Lame!

So, in conclusion, if you want good pho and shitty customer service. This is the spot!",5,0,0

The Pho broth is nice and tastey, not overly salty and not overly oily, and which you can find at alot of other places. 

The major downfall of this place is the horrible service... you really can't call it service at all... We were ignored for a good 12-15min before a manager came over and just said ""what do you want"". The plus side is the food comes out quickly and the tables turn fast so you don't have to wait long... but you really don't expect good service in a place like this i guess.

The guy charges my card without my consent and I see he charged me the whole bill when i asked him I was only going to pay for certain entrees and he said that it is IMPOSSIBLE to do my request. So I tell him to VOID the transaction and so my other friend comes to pay for it and we just all give her cash. I come home to check my bank statement and see that THEY HAVE BILLED ME FOR THE MEAL AS WELL! Im going to wait a few days to see if he really did void my transaction, but this is ridiculous! Usually when I void my order it shows in my bank statement right away.

So if you're coming in a big group, make sure everyone has cash because this place does not accept split checks! Better yet go elsewhere!

Been coming here for the past several years...lunch, dinner, business trip meals. and most often, after clubbing, hehehe. Not on the strip, but worth the little trip to China town. 

I always order combination pho, but I have on occasion, partaken in the pan fried noodle dish, I forget what it was called.  The pho is good enough to satisfy my craving; the broth is pretty good(before I add in all my extras) and the fixins are fresh. 

Service has always been pretty good here, so no complaints there.  PKL can get pretty busy late night, so I expect service to take a step back due to the stress of the volume of people, more of them drunk and crazy, coming in and out during those times.

For me, this is definitely not the best place for Viet cuisine but they do a good job considering it's Vegas and it's open 24 hrs. I definitely needed an asian fix down in vegas and this place is really well known.

The service at 11 am was friendly and attentive. I must say, if you need a pick-me-up, their viet iced coffee hits. Like 2x more than a regular coffee. Loved the chicory flavor and the brew was strong as fuhhh but I needed it. Would definitely recommend.

I must say I am very very particular about Viet food since we have abundant options in Seattle. I am also highly picky about my cha gio and bo kho. I really needed something nostalgic so I opted to try to the bo kho. Man. I probably should have gotten the rice plate instead. The bo kho with rice noodles were subpar. The noodles were decent but the beef stew itself was a 2 star. The pros were the tender meat that just melted in your mouth. It was different types of meat and helllla beef (more than any Seattle portion). That was filling and tasty. However, the broth was bland and tasted more like a pho broth than stew. Very loose and had no uumph to it at all. The dish had no body to it and no distinct spices. 

Now the cha gio  (chicken egg rolls) were okay. I'm picky because I can make good egg rolls too but this one was decent. Nothing memorable for ~$5-$6. Good sauce though and loved the pickled carrots!

The spring rolls with shrimp were really good though. I must say the roll was so tender and everything was just so refreshing and clean. The soft wrapper really impressed me and the noodles were really soft too. I loved their thick peanut sauce and would definitely eat this again!

Overall, great service for Asians. Decent priced. For all of this we spent less than 40 bucks. And portions were pretty big for noodles. Next time I'd probably try the rice plates. Lots of menu items (includes chinese and thai dishes) to choose from. There's a parking lot but I heard on the weekends it is crazy packed.",2,1,2

Depending on the time of the day you go parking can be tough, but 99% of the time you will find some, it might be a bit of a walk. 

Upon entrance we have never waited more than 10 minutes. Their table turnovers are relatively quick. It's always at least half full to nearly entirely full. This restaurants brings in a lot of regulars. 

Our waiters are always very friendly and attentive. The menu is very straight forward and easy to order. The ambience and look has a very transitional Asian feel. This makes it look like you'll be eating authentic food. Once we have our orders placed it didn't actually take our food very long.  

I always order the traditional pho. The soup bowls are rather large. If you don't have a large stomach I recommend you share and split between 2 people. The broth is perfect. Not too salty and not too bland. I love mine spicy so I always ad chili. The hoisin sauce is also good if you want more salt. It won't ruin or change the flavor of the broth too much. The noodles have a great texture and man is it good. I love the vegetables on be side allowing you to customize the amount of veggies you want.  

I always order egg roles to go. The egg roles come with veggies and a lettuce wrap with some sauce on the side. Some people don't know this but you're supposed to wrap the egg role into the lettuce so it gives it both a refreshing and savory flavor. It is a must every time you come!

Four stars you ask...well the broth was pretty good and they gave a generous portion of meat for the large size. Prices are very good but then again this is Vegas and food seems to be reasonable. However the broth did have a citrus taste to it and I didn't squeeze no lime or lemon in it so I'm thinking it might have been remnant from the sprouts.

First off, the portion sizes. The spring rolls were so small and just most of the meals served are small. My girlfriend ordered a large bowl of pho and it was small! 
Secondly, my vermicelli I ordered was very greasy and I managed just to eat a quarter of it before I had to discard it. 
Lastly, customer service is mediocre; could've been more better. Usually handing change to your customer is the way to go but I guess the guy doing transactions thinks slamming my paper and coins on the counter was the most acceptable form.

1. Spring rolls with no pork: I love these. Slightly smaller, but flavorful with sweet tender shrimp and the obligatory peanut dipping sauce. My bf wasn't too please but then again, he might have been eating in his sleep.

2. Pho with flank and rare steak: The broth is the winner hear, flavorful and oily. The meat and noodle was standard. Nick said he prefers more and better meat, but I was more than pleased with the noodle and broth.

She was sitting by herself and looked like she was really enjoying her meal.  I asked the waiter what is she eating.  He said Honey Garlic Pork Chop.  So hubby and I ordered that and shared it with two orders of rice.  OMG!!!! It was amazing.  It was probably one of the best things ever.  I highly recommend that you just TRY IT.  You got nothing to lose while in Vegas (foodwise).  Anyways, even hubby was skeptical and was like what the heck are you ordering just based on what the next table is eating.  He loved it.  We are foodies and have pretty good palates.  We loved it. 

Only complaint is that they charge per serving of rice.  To me this is almost unheard of for a Viet restaurant.  I was very surprised but they give you a decent amount.

The serving size is good for the price you are paying. I usually get the Pho with beef balls and rare steak (in the soup). Most of the time the servers are quick to get our orders in and we usually get our drinks refilled in a timely manner.

2 stars for eh food.  I was pretty sobered up by the time we got here, maybe it's ah-mazing when you're drunk?  My bun with bbq chicken and spring rolls was ok.  Mike C. didn't like his roasted chicken with rice at all, said it was super dry.  The pho was eh, not the best.  The porridge was tasteless, had to add hoison and fish sauce to it just for the sake of adding some flavor. They did have a pretty decent variety on their menu from what I remember and our dishes came out pretty quick.

1 star for my friend having to wait forever for his fried rice.  Everyone got their dishes before he did.  Fried rice?  That should be the first thing out, I was about to go to the kitchen and whip some up myself.

1 star for bad service.  The servers gave looks like they hate their life and lagged on getting our check and filling our waters.  Sure it's 3am and they probably don't want to be there let alone put up with a bunch of drunk Asians, especially some of the ghetto fabulous ones I saw there.  But sorry, you're in customer service so please try to fake it for us at least.

1 star for being stranded here because our crazy ride ditched us and we had to walk along the street to flag down a taxi to take us back to the strip.  This place is not walking distance from the strip but only 10 minutes away by car.  Ok this isn't Pho Kim's fault, but just thought I""d add it in anyways haha

This place is terrible! My whole family got sick after eating here. As I lay here feeling full of regret and in disbelief of how disgusting our dinner was here, my stomach is extra tender and sore and my mouth is numb and dehydrated. 

I'm full Vietnamese and this place is such a huge embarrassment and a disgrace to real authentic Vietnamese food. 

First offense - the goi cuon (shrimp and pork spring rolls\/ summer rolls) were tiny and barely had any filling inside. A piece of lettuce, a tiny bit of noodles, a sliver of meat and 3 slivers of shrimp. Oh, and that so called dipping sauce was so gross! Super watered down. What a ripoff. 

Second offense - Msg was never really an issue for me and it never really caused me any problems, until I ate here. Also, my uncle is really sensitive to it and he had a lot of issues with his pho. He didn't drink any of his pho broth because it had too much MSG and by the end of dinner he started to feel sick. 

Third offense - the nuoc cham (fish sauce\/dipping sauce) was so watered down, that I ended up asking them for 3 bowls for my meal - but even 3 bowls was not enough and I finally gave up. It was disgustingly bland. I was pretty much pouring sugar water onto my rice. 

Fourth offense - my pork chop was dry and the marinade was bland. The charring on the pork chop tasted artificial. 

Fifth offense - our tongue is all sorts of numb and shriveled up after eating here. I guess MSG does that to you. We're extremely weak, thirsty and dehydrated now. 

Sixth offense - the chow fun beef noodles in gravy (hu tieu xao bo) was so unappetizing and unappealing, I was in disbelief they served it to us. They overcooked the chow fun noodles so they broke up into a billion of small pieces when you tried to pick them up with chopsticks, the gravy was all watery and goopy. It was not tasty at all. 

With so many options in Vegas to get Vietnamese food late, this place is not one of them.",12,5,5

When the bill came out, we realized they ripped us off. We ordered tons of food, they brought out white rice and charged us $15. First of all, a bag of rice is $25 that will last you for a year. They freaking charge you $1.50 per small bowl...WTF??? We didn't even ask for rice and they brought it out for no reason and refused to refund us the money until we argued with them.

I would never come back and I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are tons of restaurants around, there is no reason to come here.

Whether you pronounce it correctly or not...it all sounds alike. ""PHO KIM LONG"" ... Yup that's the name of this fine restaurant.  Don't let the name fool you though.  The place has since been remodeled a while back with simple yet beautiful decor & backdrops that really make a difference and give you an ethnic feel to your Vietnamese dining experience.  Whenever one feels the crave for some luscious pho, this place will do justice.  They open early and close late practically open 24 hours...this place is great for lunch with family, a dinner date for two or a cure for your late night hang overs with friends.  In fact Pho Kim Long is great anytime to fill your tummy to satisfaction.  

This place can get packed, especially on a weekend at peak hours...so be prepared for the crowd.  A downfall to this is their small waiting area up front.  With very little seating and standing area, this can be and is a fire hazard. But when this happens you know they must be doing something right...to have such an audience of hungry on goers wait amongst each other.  

When you do get seated, be excited for once you decide what to order, the food is prepared quick and comes right out.  My favorite Pho here is the combination.  This comes with chewy yet tender tendon that melts right when you chew, also has your usual thin sliced flank raw meat & other goodness...the broth is very soothing and comes packed with flavor.  Their Salt & Pepper Calamari is scrumptious, but eat it fresh and hot as it will get soggy after a while...but still a yummy snack even after.  For those non-pho PHOnatics...they do have rice and other dishes to get your palates tainted with flavor....from pork, to beef, to fish, to even pad thai noodles...they par up pretty well.  My favorite dessert drink here is their Avocado Shake Smoothie with tapioca boba!  They must have atleast 100 pieces of boba....sounds like fillers...but they do give a generous amount of avocado shake in it.  You can also request the shake without boba.

All in all...I may be too generous giving this place a high rating with 5 stars.  Others would disagree with me, as I can understand...I should be giving it only 4 stars because of the waiting area (but only an issue when it is packed) and also because prices here tend to be just a tad bit higher than some close rivals that are side by side comparable in quality,  I do give it 5 stars though because for some reason...I still keep coming back here for more ... rather than 2 others who are in my top 3 of Pho places in Las Vegas.

Don't forget, you can also take out! and Pho Kim Long is very generous in portions!  You may pay a dollar or 2 more, but the portions are respectable and they wont rip you off like some other places:

Made our way to a strip mall a little off the Vegas strip. Tried the small #15. Pretty decent. Broth was superb but the noodles were a bit off for me. Not horrible though. Can be fixed with the right ratio of siracha, limes, cilantro, bean sprouts, and jalapenos. Began to work my magic and soup was delicious. 

We ordered the fried Calamari as appetizers for the table. Amazing. Must come back for these. Its the traditional calamari but with a Asian twist. Loved it. Portions were pretty generous as well.",1,1,1

I'm sorry non of them tasted as least reach standard point to me. Thick skin egg rolls, plain fried rice which much needed of flavoring. I do believe the fried rice they served was not freshly stir fried, not to be mean it does tasted like Panda Express fried rice. Now comes to the order of myself. meatballs noodle soup. Flavor is ok but the meatballs!! The meatballs....oh my god! For a moment I'm not sure it's real beef meatballs or something.

I used to love coming to this Vietnamese restaurant whenever I visit LV.  I always look forward to eating here whenever i visit LV.  However, during my last visit, it is sad to say that the quality of food here has gone down tremendously. Not only the quality of food but the service as well.  I was fine waiting for an hour in exchange of a quality food and service, but this time everything was not how I remembered this place. 

I ordered spring rolls, my usual beef stew, and beef ball pho. None of the items wowed me. The beef stew had so much tendons and meet was not cooked well (see pictures). The egg noodles were too soggy, not fresh!
The spring rolls were a joke! The shrimps are so tiny and only placed on one side (see picture).  My fav Viet restos serve big rolls with big shrimps and placed on both sides of the roll.  On top of that veggie was not that fresh.  I like the peanut sauce tho!
Both soups had meat that looks old (shiny surface, orange and green color), yuck!

This place was recommended by a fellow parent that was there for the same tournament as us, so a bunch of us went. 
That was actually my first time ordering a bowl of Pho for myself. I usually just order rice and some other meat. My husband is the Phô lover and eats it on a weekly basis. 
My bowl of Pho was really good and for that bowl alone, I'd give 5 stars. My husband of course enjoyed his and so did everyone else in our group. 
The low stars are because the service was just terrible. To be fair, we were a large group, however, we did split up into 3 separate groups to make it easier on the staff. Or so we thought. 
Food came out sporadically and we were ignored by the staff. One guy dropped off two bowls and walked away, and when we were trying to tell him it wasn't ours, he ignored us and continued to walk away. We had to stop another waiter and let him know it was someone else's food. 
As our food was coming out (sporadically) the same rude guy would stand so close to me that he almost hit the side of my head with a plate. And later, as we were eating, he reaches right between my husband and me to fill up the spoons that are in the middle of the table! Could he not wait? Or could he not ask us to hand the thing over? And as he was passing through behind our table, I heard him say ""behind you, move out of the way"" to a customer! He was horrible and seemed miserable to be there.

The ONLY reason I'm giving them a one-star rating is because I can't give them any lower.

Went with my family, I ordered a plate of chicken wings, they ordered some other stuff. Fast forward, everyone else has their food, I assume that my wings are taking long because they have to fry them up, sounds reasonable right?

We ask them where my wings are and they say they're coming, and I don't wanna be THAT guy who keeps asking where his order is, so I continue waiting.

Fast forward again, everyone is done eating, my wings are nowhere to be found, so we ask them about it again. Turns out they didn't even start working on the wings until that moment, the SECOND time we had to ask them about it.

So because we're fed up of waiting and I'm tired from a whole day of driving, we tell them to just cancel the wings.

Seconds later, guy comes out to my table with a plate of wings, so we figure since they're out, we'll just pay for them and take them to-go. Nope, cashier gets defensive and very RUDELY tells us we can't buy the wings anymore, tells his waiter to go grab the plate right as I'm about to grab a wing.

Never coming here again, and definitely WOULD NOT recommend this place to anyone else.

If you're in the Las Vegas area and looking for some great Vietnamese cuisine (I would know, I'm Vietnamese), I'd recommend you SKIP this place, and take the time to drive a little further down the road (same street actually), and eat at Pho So 1 (literally translated as #1 Pho) instead.

We had a total of 11 people, so they had to split us up (we weren't allowed to move the tables closer together). So the breakdown was 5 people at one table (the table I was a part of) and 6 at the other. My table only had a total of 3 orders (I shared with another and one of us wasn't hungry, but just wanted to hang out). Anyways, in the end they combined our orders (even though we were at separate tables and weren't able to talk to each other). As a result, the imposed gratuity was much more expensive. I walked up and complained that they should split up the order into two separate transactions. They gave me attitude since I was adamant about it. WHEN MY TABLE GOT OUR RECEIPT OF JUST 3 ORDERS, THEY STILL CHARGED US GRATUITY!!!! I was at my breaking point but my friends persuaded me to let them go. 

Other nuisances:
- Some people at the table ate there before. They have always had pickled onions. This time when we asked for them, the waiters claimed that the restaurant never had them. Liars.
- My cousin asked if they had different sizes and they said, ""No."" Later on, he found out that his friend was able to order a small. Liars.

I reside in Little Saigon, California. All I can say is that the food is mediocre for the price offered (around $6-8). Here, a delicious bowl of pho could sell for $4 for a large.

As for the food, we ordered a classic pho which was rather large and had plenty of noodles- the broth its self was certainly homemade but relatively bland. The best purchase we made was the Mongolian beef and beer. The Mongolian beef isn't served with rice so make sure to get a side order.

Brought some out of town friends here on Monday (Labor Day) around 1pm.  People were everywhere inside and outside waiting.  I almost gave up immediately but my inner gut & the ""best of RJ's"" on the windows made me stay.  When we finally made our way to the front to put our name in we asked the guy how long the wait was.  His reply, ""really fast"".  I couldn't help but chuckle but who are we to argue. LOL

Surprisingly, our wait wasn't too long before our name was called.  With all the people everywhere I was halfway expecting to be waiting a while.  We were seated by a window.  Literally every table full.  A guy came to take our drink order.  While we checked out the menu every meal was numbered making it easy to order.  Each item had a detailed description underneath for white girls like me or at least I'd like to think. haha  BTW the menu is gigantic.  I'm often overwhelmed by such menus but I knew what I was looking for.  My BF and I decided we would share each of our orders so we could try a couple different dishes.  We had settled on two things to share until I heard my friend say...UDON Noodle!  I just discovered Udon Noodles when I was in Cali. I honestly cannot have enough of it.  To describe it to someone I would say its like a really thick soft spaghetti noodle.  Here is what we ordered:

*Beef Udon Noodle - I thought it was fantastic.  The BF thought it was a little peppery (you could actually see the black pepper in it) but it was still our favorite.
*Chicken Pho - A little bland broth flavor (I remember it being better), chunks of chicken, thin rice noodles.  We added a bunch of hot sauce to spice it up and give it a little more flavor. Pretty good even though it felt like it was the hottest\/humid day of the summer.  We did only eat half the soup.  The bowl was as big as my head.
*Our friends also got the Beef Udon and love it.  They also got the Teriyaki Chicken with Rice and it was a huge portion.  She only had half of it.

We waited a bit for the check.  The servers were running around like crazy but she eventually came.  Our bill came to around $70 I believe-our friends had bought.  Overall it was good.  Just super crazy busy.  This is definitely a popular spot.

The reviews say that its opened 24 hours.  I cant imagine really wanting a drunken night soup bowl at 3am but it sounds like a lot of people do.  (I secretly opt for a drunken night Fat Burger at that time-but that's just me) but if its your thang have at it!  Its there for your enjoyment!  24 hours.",5,6,6

Those are just some of the weird reactions I get when I say I want to eat here. I guess you can say it doesn't sound very nice to say, but the food here is my favorite Vietnamese cuisine. I'm not a huge fan of the pho but I'm a very big fan of their vermicelli noodle bowls! It's the perfect amount of food for someone with a middle sized appetite. They're open late night so if you're out on the strip with your friends or are looking for a late night snack (hardly the size for a snack), Mr. Pho Kim Long is your best bet to satisfy your Vietnamese craving.

The service isn't super because of the lack of personality their staff has but they bring your food out fairly quick. Does one base service on how quick you get to eat or how pleasant they make your visit? I say it depends on both but lucky for Pho Kim Long, their service is very fast and consistent.  It wouldn't hurt the staff to crack a smile or two, crack a joke, or laugh even. They don't have a problem splitting your checks as long as they get their money.  The atmosphere is very traditionally Asian and being of Asian descent, it doesn't do much for me.  In other words, you wont catch me with my iPhone in hand snapping shots like some tourist or something. Maybe, the food for Yelp but that's all ;)

Never had a problem customer service-wise, always accommodated the big groups of friends I go everywhere with, and doesn't take log to bring what you ask for. That's a big thing for me when the server takes the detour to bring you something you've asked for. And having to ask for it twice really peeves me but as busy and as impersonable as their staff is, they go and get what you ask for right away. Maybe to get you to go faster? If I wanted to be In -n- Out of a joint, I'd go get a burger! Hahaha!

Pho Kim Long is the first pho place I've tried in town, and it seems to have a pretty big menu and draws a large crowd.

It seemed smaller in size than I would find at a typical San Jose pho restaurant, so the price is high, especially if you have a regular bowl (as opposed to the large or dac biet size, which is inexplicably #13 on the menu instead of #1). Even the Thai basil that they hand out is pretty skimpy compared to every decent or good place in California. The rest of my table wasn't too impressed with the food either.

First off, their Pho Dac Biet was bland with no flavour. It seems as if they underestimated their peak hour business and so they must have ran out of broth and created some lame pho base. I can tell because it was diluted and also growing up eating so much Pho, one can tell what the broth consists of. 

Second day of dining, their dumpling broth was sour, meaning that this probably went bad. I turned it back and headed on over to Lee's sandwich for some edible food. Of course they credited the overall bill from a party of 12.

The only dish that looked appetising was their thit nuong cam tam. It looked very delicious from what my friend told me and also it tasted on par to normal thit nuong dishes here.

Would I come back? Probably not since Vegas is a hit or miss in terms of food.",0,0,0

I opted for a rice plate since I wasn't in the mood for Pho while is 100 outside. The grilled pork, pork skin, and egg dish hit the spot. Nothing fancy, just down to earth good viet eats. It wasn't the best ive had since i'm spoiled with good viet food at home but it sure hit the spot.

The ambiance is pretty nice- clean place, nicely decorated. Food-wise though, I've has much better. I think it's because of the volume of business they get. There is so many people that the kitchen churns out food at top speeds, compromising the quality of it. 

The portions are not bad noodle-wise but they are pretty stingy with the beef slices. It makes for a very incongruous looking bowl of pho- plenty of white noodles with 3 tiny thin strips of beef. Also, the spring rolls were just okay (at best) -I was not impressed for what was supposedly ""the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas"". I've had so much better in small mom-and-pop restaurants in Los Angeles.

Service is top-notch. The waiters\/waitresses are very attentive and see to your needs really well.

We visited one evening with a friend when our first choice in Chinatown had an hour wait. I should have trusted the instinct of not going to your last choice.

We ordered the Salt and Pepper Calamari to start. The batter was strange and oily, but still pretty tasty with the chopped chilies, garlic, and etc. Plus, the dipping sauce was good. Ruben ordered the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (charbroiled pork and egg roll with rice vermicelli noodles). The pork was flavorful, but the dish as a whole was not very cohesive and bland. I ordered the Drunken Noodles with the Vegetarian option. I really like the flat, thick rice noodles and lots of fresh vegetables, so I was immediately drawn to this dish, however, it lacked in flavor and depth. A bit of Sriracha sauce saved it toward the end, but any great dish wouldn't have to rely on a table condiment. Our friend, Juan, ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and it was okay.

Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the meal very much. The highlight was the Calamari and still, that was no where close to being the best calamari dish I've eaten. Obviously, I didn't try Pho and perhaps that may be something they do really well? I wouldn't count on it since everything else was so disappointing. Service was okay, no complaints.

We came here after an informal wedding for a quick meal and then back to the hotel to get ready to leave the day later.  I don't believe we had reservations for 30+ people, but they were quick to accommodate us when arriving.  It seemed there was a prefixed menu negotiated for our large party, and it consisted of the typical Vietnamese family-style menu items you would see standard in any restaurant worth their salt.

For a pho restaurant, this is probably one of the nicer looking ones I've seen... of course, this is targeted towards the touristy crowds, but still a breath of fresh air compared to all of the hole-in-the-walls I've been to.  I asked around about Vietnamese restaurants, and even the cab driver [local native Vietnamese] recommended this place, and it did not disappoint.  We had canh chua, ca kho, fried rice, fried shrimp, etc... and it was so nice to have home style food to end our weekend of debauchery and make us miss home even more.  [5 days in Vegas is overkill... 3 IS MORE than enough for me!]

The part that made me happiest?  The had fresh coconut juice there, and when you order it, they serve you nothing else but a coconut straight up.  I had oodles of fun scraping at the meaty flesh to round out my meal, and we all left stuffed.  If I remember right, we had at least 4-5 tables and I don't remember the cost, but I do know it was quite cheap because I heard no one complaining... haha.

I can't comment on some of the other offerings although when it comes to variety of Pho you can spend a few min sifting through plenty of choices on the menu or just call it as you like since it is (for the most part) made to order.

Then the last weekend I got the rice & pork chops. The pork chops tasted weird, it had this nasty taste after only on the sides and the part with the fat.

When the noodles came, all I can think was, ""is this pho?!"" My broth was mega salty and the beef flavors and aromatics were nonexistent. His broth was even saltier, which was quite amazing because I thought mine was salty enough. And even worse, our broths tasted completely different even though we both had beef based pho.

Their wings with special sauce were pretty delicious too. Sweet and slightly spicy.

 If you're coming just for a regular pho special noodle soup, I'd say that it's decent here, but not great.  The one big gripe I had was that their pho special does not have tripe in it.  But if you're not a tripe fanatic like me, I guess it wouldn't matter to you.

I am also kind of hesitant when it comes to Vietnamese restaurants that serve Chinese food. With that being my family's background, it is hard to eat at some places and not say that one of my parents could make it better.

It has been forever since I went to a restaurant with the intention of getting pho. I came here with a group of friends to celebrate one of them getting a promotion. None of us ordered from the Vietnamese menu. It is probably for the best, because I am unforgiving most of the time. 

Instead we got items off of the Chinese menu and did it family style. The eggrolls and crab rangoons are nothing special. I would rather skip the appetizers and just order more entree dishes. The Pepper Beef is generous and comes with a beautiful array of broccoli. Mongolian Beef was tender and had a decent flavor to it, but it lacked the kick. Kung Pao Chicken had me searching out for the hot peppers to make up for the previous dish. The Singapore Noodles came in a mountain sized portion and had a subtle curry flavor to it. The stand out dish was the Honey Garlic Porkchops. They are phenomenal. Large pieces of boneless and bone in meat fried crisp, tossed in a lightly sweet sauce, and topped with fried chopped garlic. I was grabbing piece after piece.

Not only is Pho Kim Long a place to sooth your hangover. It is a place to get it started. With a decent selection of mainly imported Asian beers and a few common domestics, you can begin the party.

Most people either hate or love this restaurant. I love it. I have been coming here for years and have never had a bad meal here. 

My go to order is the beef pho with rare steak $7.75.
I pile my steaming bowl high with Thai basil, fresh squeezed lime, and only two jalapeño rings (any more and it gets too spicy towards the end).

You can add extra meat or extra noodles for only $1.00, but I can never eat that much. I usually don't finish my broth and then take it to go and boil noodles for a redo the next day! Score. double meals. 

I've tried a lot of the menu and some of my favorites include:
the chicken wings covered in Pho Kim Long sauce;
the walnut-mayonnaise shrimp; and

What's worse was, one's pho dish got here after 5 min of sitting, while everyone else's took 20 minutes. My poor friend wanted to be polite and wait for at least one other person to get their food... so that was not fun. Probably did not taste that great for her, either. I ordered the grilled chicken and rice dish and the chicken turned out super dry.

We had a grumpy server who practically did not check up on us at all... man, it was a painfully long wait! I'd go to a different Vietnamese restaurant instead.

I've always wanted to try something down here but it's nowhere near my home and unfortunately, the most adventurous restaurant my family will try is Panda Express (bleh) Luckily, I FINALLY got my Vegas Chinatown cherry popped when Beau S. took me for dinner here on 4\/20\/11 after coming to see the show I worked for. 

We checked out the menu and prices for Beijing Noodle No. 9 at Caesar's and I quipped that the same food would probably be about $6 in Chinatown, about a 4 minute drive away from the Strip. After a quick car ride, we were here. 

24 hours is always a good sign to me because it means two things - the food is tasty, and it's probably not too pricey.  We were seated quickly and were asked if we knew what we wanted to order after a few minutes. Because I hadn't been there before, I needed more time to check out the extensive menu. 

Pad Thai is kryptonite for me. I absolutely can't pass it up. The spicier, the better. I ordered the chicken pad thai and asked for it to be as spicy as possible. The waiter looked nervous when I said I really did want it as spicy as possible. I want my food to be ""sinus clearing spicy"" every time. Delicious. Beau ordered a beef pho and the Thai Tea.

The waiter brought me a fork and a spoon and Beau... nothing. I didn't catch what Beau meant when he said he liked how the waiter assumed he didn't need a fork and spoon but I did, until I thought about it the next day. Maybe white people tend to not know how to use chopsticks? I don't know, but I know how, and I obviously wasn't offended, so the fork and spoon were left untouched. 

The waiter brought out our food fairly quickly and was giving me a look like they might need an EMT soon due to the spiciness of the food. I was actually a little scared based on how the waiter was acting. I took a bite.... MILD, borderline not spicy. Pssssh. Typical. Maybe it's because a girl, but regardless of what type of restaurant I'm at, when I order ""spiciest you can possibly make the dish"" apparently the waiters think I can't handle myself and it comes out mild. Wah. I doused my plate in chili sauce and Sriracha sauce to the point of ridiculousness. Perfect. The Pad Thai was killer and as usual eating things that aren't cut up, I'm sure I made a fool of myself trying to get it into my mouth semi-daintily. 

I liked that the waiters were on top of their stuff. My water glass was never left unfilled. One waiter even said he read my mind as he filled up my glass, and he was actually ahead of me. That's how it's supposed to be so not only was the food phenomenal, the service was great too.

Beau made a fantastic choice bringing me here and I would gladly go out of my way to eat here again.",2,0,0

It seems they have security problems here. There is security guards by the door and  inside walking around ""BS""ing with the waiters. 

This is only second time we have eaten here. We won't be returning here again.

It was like the ""hood"" in the restaurant. All sorts of people here late at night. After the meal, I have come to realization. They don't want you to get robbed in parking lot, because they want to rob you inside.

We saw some body ordered Hainan chicken last time we were here, so we asked the waiter about this off the menu item. ""Yeah, we have it, do you want steamed rice or Haina rice?"" Of course, we want Hainan style rice, they should not even have asked. That was stupid! Hainan chicken with rice. Very basic!!

It turn out they want you to say ""yes"" so they can charge $1.50 for this little bowl of microwaved-and-overly-nuked-dry-lump-tasteless rice. 

They sell half roasted chicken or steamed chicken for $11 on the menu. But if you ordered Hainan chicken, you get a small plate(almost a quarter of chicken) of tough and tasteless chicken for $11 also. Not including rice!!

Service was nonexistent. We asked for hot tea, and never got them. I mentioned it when I was paying and got two words, ""She forgot."" and no apology.

The pho was pretty good and is always good when you're still drunk or if you have a hangover! The rice plates here are also pretty good! Prices are comparable to that of the prices we have in SF for pho. The service was good, all the waiters were super nice! Overall the pho was good, but I've had better before.

Upon first impressions, I liked the decor of the restaurant. It was nicely decorated and roomy. We were also seated immediately. We all sat down, thought about what we wanted to order... 10 minutes had gone by after we were seated and no one came up to us to ask us what we wanted to drink. A couple of minutes later, an older gentleman took our orders. My friend and I both ordered Pho Dat Biet (special combination tender beef noodle soup, $8.75), my boyfriend ordered half of the Ga Chien Gion (deep fried chicken with fried garlic, $13.95 for half chicken), and my other friend ordered Com Chien Tom (shrimp fried rice, $11.50). 

Here came the most disappointing part. I'm not exaggerating when I say that 30 minutes had literally gone by before the first dish came out, and that was my boyfriend's deep fried chicken dish. I thought that this dish was pretty good. It wasn't too salty and I loved the fried garlic. Do note that this dish didn't come with rice so you would need to order it on the side. At this point, I'm starting to look around the room hoping to catch the attention of the workers to see if they had brought out our dishes. 5 minutes after the fried chicken came out, both of the Pho Dat Biet came out. Honestly, I didn't think that it was too good. The broth wasn't anything spectacular and for the ""special"" bowl of Pho that we ordered, there was barely any beef, tripe, tendon, and all the other components that goes in the special. 

At this point, my other friend who had ordered such a simple dish of fried rice STILL has not received has order. We started trying to track down the employees and finally managed to spoke to one about how we haven't received the last dish of fried rice. There was a couple who was sitting nearby us, who were seated way after we were seated and had managed to receive their food order BEFORE we even got ours! And how is it that the fried rice would be the last dish to come out? Makes no sense to me.... So about 10 minutes after both of the Pho dishes came out, my friend's fried rice finally came out. It didn't look too appealing either... He also mentioned that some of the parts in his fried rice were cold and not warm at all...

I don't know what happened with our order honestly. Pho Kim Long is open 24 hours, which is great for people who want to grab a late meal after EDC, clubbing, etc ;]. Since Vegas is the city that never sleeps, I'm sure many people there appreciate how late Pho Kim Long is opened.

I don't know if its cause this place is in Vegas and its nice to eat some good (relatively) cheap asian food after cramming your trap with casino buffets, or it also could be cause most of the people here are either drunk or hung over.  But I stand by my statement that this is probably the best Pho I've had.

I try to come here at least once every other vegas trip, once me and my buddies came here twice in 1 day, before and after clubbing, its just good.

One word of advice, the XL bowl is really that, EXTRA large, I normally finish my bowl or my rice dish and the rest of my gf's bowl, but man, I couldn't finish the XL bowl.

The broken rice dish here is ok, nothing crazy special, same with the egg rolls, the wait is pretty long on Sundays in the 11-12 time, I guess its a good hang over food before you head back home.  This place is also open 24 hours so you can come here at 4am and get the goods, its also a nice pick me up after losing a bunch of money on the tables.",0,0,0

The food is surprisingly fast especially if you're getting pho (soup).
It can get busy during their peak times, and the lack of waiting room is a bit frustrating but it's always worth it to me.

What I did enjoy was the bun thit nuong! Grilled porked was sweet yet savory. The bowl contains a good amount of lettuce to balance out the rice noodles. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Another missed opportunity was the boba slush. They use powder for almost every flavor so I'm not a big fan of that.

I'm Vietnamese so growing up I've had A LOT of pho (but it's true nothing beats Mom's :P) and this place is just so damn delicious. The broth is really sweet and flavorful but not in that dump buckets of MSG into the broth way. The meat (I always get the brisket) is so soft, so so soft and tender. The veggies are always fresh and even the broken rice plates (com bo nuong) are amazing! A lot of rice plates are meh with the rice being too hard or God forbid too soggy, but the rice here is always perfect. They even include a small bowl of soup broth to compliment the dish-a must. I've been here a few times and despite all the amazing buffets\/restaurants that Vegas has to offer, I need (NEED) to come here at least once. It's that good.

BUT and here's a reason why this place didn't get a 5 star review (trust me it hurts me too) the service is whack. I KNOW I KNOW, this is an Asian restaurant and they aren't known for their amazing service. Anyone growing up in an Asian community knows that (Asian restaurants ARE good for cheap prices, large portions, and amazing daily specials though) but I hate knowing that if I come here I would have to wait at least an hour. Because it's so delicious though the wait is something that just comes with the territory so I try not to get too stuck on it. BUT it's not so much the wait that bothers me, but the fact that I have to keep tab on the servers to make sure they don't skip us. I've realized that despite writing our names down, sometimes the server would skip our party (happened more than once) and we would have to wait even longer because of their mistakes. We would have to remind them and they would be like ""Oh sorry, looks like someone crossed it out, I didn't know"" and it happened more than once. Other people would come in complaining about the wait, and they would look on the clipboard and make some excuse about not seeing the name. 

ALSO we went with a party of 6 and a party of 7 that went in after us got the table? Why? When my mom asked the lady just gave her some vague answer about another table getting up with 6 people, but they probably just wanted to seat the bigger table to get more money. I mean, I sure hope that extra one person made a difference in the budget. *rant over*

So if the service was just a little better (and less ""forgetful"") this place would definitely earn 5 stars. It's spacious and clean, and overall a must if you are ever in Vegas and are craving some bomb ass pho BUT you have been warned about the service.",0,0,0

The BBQ'd pork was nice and smokey. I was surprised by the broth that came with the rice. Normally it comes in a dinky ass rice bowl, but it was at least twice the amount of a rice bowl. F yeah! Our hu tieu was good, but definitely a little too salty and that's coming from someone who loves sodium.

Keep in mind this place gets busy quick so bigger parties may have to wait a bit. Biggest downside though is it's off the strip so having a car is ideal.",1,1,1

Food order this time around: 
Calamari - Fried really well, but needed more salt\/seasoning. 
Vermicelli - Meat was really flavorful and they gave a amount of meat.
Pho - Pho with meatballs.. meatballs still the same as my last review, just falls apart. 
 
So when the time came to pay, the waiter came with the bill and my boyfriend gave his credit card, but instead of taking the card and ringing him up as usual, the waiter kept asking which tip option my boyfriend would like to put (15%, 20%, 25%, etc) and did not leave until he circled something. HE WAS LITERALLY HOVERING OVER US and pressuring us to give him a dollar amount or choose one of the pre-calculated amounts. When we received the receipt to sign, the tip was already charged but there was still a tip line to fill out? What's the point of asking us how much tip we want to give if we can still write down what we would like to give. Also, I've heard about a lot of restaurants doing this, but basically they calculate their suggested tips against the total bill with tax (should be on subtotal), and usually I don't really care\/pay attention but since they were so adamant to get our tip amount before even ringing us up I decided to calculate AND YUP the tip was calculated after taxes. We ended up paying like 25% tip (which really I don't mind if the service was exceptional, but it wasn't). I can't say I won't be back (cause it's pho kim long in vegas!!), but I'll definitely pay more attention.",2,2,2

The food quality isn't really the best, and the whole experience was just subpar.

The people working there, from the hostess to the waiter, were surly and gave attitude when seating us and taking our order. It wasn't really that busy inside because I think everything is a little slower in Vegas during this time of the year (people going back home from their vacations, the school year starting, etc.). I feel like at any dining establishment, the staff should at least try and be a little friendly... That's not the case here.

Anyway, onto the food. My friend and I ordered their crab rangoons, shrimp udon dish, and their shrimp fried rice.

When the crab rangoons came to our table, my initial thought was ""WHAT ARE THOSE?!"" because they didn't look like the conventional flower-shaped rangoons we are all (mostly) familiar with. They looked like they were made in a rush, but at least they retained the cheesy crab flavored filling. Fried to a golden-brown, these are a good appetizer to start off with.

The shrimp udon dish was basically filler (loads of green onions and bean sprouts) and a few sizeable shrimp. The noodles, which should be the main part of the dish, were lacking. The presentation wasn't too appealing, either. It literally looked like it was stirred and thrown onto the plate to go out to our table...

The shrimp fried rice was probably the only thing we really enjoyed out of everything we ordered. The shrimp seemed to be smaller in this dish compared to the shrimp in the udon, and even with the smaller sized shrimp, it was still sparing. The Sriracha sauce is the perfect thing to drizzle on top of the fried rice, I can't get enough of the unique spiciness it offers!

Anyway, if we're talking about food quality and presentation, then Pho Kim Long is in the same league as any average Asian take-out place... which isn't saying much. Pho Kim Long misses the mark on so many things: friendly staff, decent food, presentation of said food, cleanliness, etc. 

Overall, I did not have an enjoyable experience. I think that maybe it's alright if you're on the hot mess express at 3 AM and want something to eat in the late hours of the night\/early morning, but even that is a BIG maybe for me... Save your appetite for something better.",11,9,10

I did question whether it was the same owner as the one in San Jose, Ca. One perk is that this place is open 24 hours. It can cure anyone's hangover from a whirlwind night of drinking and partying hard. 

The menu was probably comparable to the expensive las vegas area. The bowls of pho were a little on the pricier end in my opinion. 

I thought that since this was supposedly the best rated pho restaurant, I would have very good pho broth. There were limited options for pho since they serve other things on the menu. You only had 5-6 pho combinations to choose from. Although, I did not bother asking whether they would change anything on the menu to your taste. 

I was very disappointed that the pho broth was VERY VERY watered down. I felt like I was just drinking a bowl of salted water with MSG in. The broth was pretty much almost clear and without color in the bowl. Must be because they couldn't keep up with the supply and demand of pho and watered it all down or this might just be the quality of the pho broth they had. 

I was so disappointed that by the time I got home, I went home to make a gigantic pot of pho broth. I'm Chinese and I feel like my pho broth was even better than theirs. At least it looked like pho broth by appearance. It may make you reconsider going out to eat pho ever again or especially at this place!",2,1,0

The servers are busy but they always come by to help you and are super efficient. I usually order their Pho Tai Chin or Pho Tai, depending on whether I want the cooked beef, and boy is it good! Regardless of the large or small bowl, they give you great portions of noodles, meat, and soup so you never really run out of anything.

On top of that the pho took forever to come, maybe they forgot, but the ones who ordered rice plates pretty much finished it before the pho even came.

I must say it's understandable for the ones including myself to finish our rice plates first because portion wise they were probably made for babies. I had one tiny porkchop and some rice, usually at Vietnamese restaurants you're not able to see the bottom of your plate because its filled with food, but this plate was very bare.

When you walk into Pho Kim Long, the first thing you see in front of you is a hostess booth, which is very out of place considering they don't have a hostess. You have to wait for a busser to seat you. That system is very inconvenient when it's busy. You'd have to wait until one of the bussers frees up to even put you on the waiting list, so essentially, you have to wait in line before you get the chance to wait ""in line"".

Although I have tried and liked other things on the menu, I mainly just order the Pho. For a place called Pho Kim Long, you'd assume they'd put their main focus into their pho dishes, unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case. The overall taste of the Pho is good, but it's the uneven portions that deduct from its rating. Too much meat and not nearly enough noodles. One visit, I ordered a large Rare Beef Pho, but the waiter gave me a small. I'm not upset about that. That's a simple mistake, but just out of curiosity, I reached into the bowl with my chopsticks and lifted up the noodles to get an idea of how much came in that order. It was pathetic. I was easily able to  hold every noodle up with one swipe. I thought ""maybe it's just because it's the small"". I then told the waiter about the size error and he came back almost immediately with the correct size, but when I checked to see what portions I was given this time, it was like deja vu. 
I received almost exactly the same amount. It's as if they just poured the small bowl from earlier into a larger bowl and added a few more scoops of broth. The lack of noodles is where the imbalance of noodle-to-meat ratio comes in. I was long done with all of my noodles before my meat. I had to resort to biting my noodles in an attempt to ration them so I had some for every new piece of meat, and this is a definite ""no-no"" in the noodle world. 

Customer service is friendly, when present. This place often gets hit with a high volume of customers during the night (probably because they are one of the few Vietnamese restaurants that stay open 24 hours) so if you like places where the waiter is very attentive, this is not the place for you. Although I do commend them for being able to keep a friendly demeanor under stressful conditions, it's just sometimes I'd prefer a refill on my drink instead of a smile.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous. The walls are aligned with live aquariums and decorative flora and for such a high traffic restaurant, it is kept extremely clean. To be honest, it looks like a fine dining establishment.  

Another positive about this place, that I briefly mentioned before, is that it is open 24 hours and conveniently located just off of the strip. It's close enough to not be a hassle to get to after a long night of partying, but far enough to get away from all of the chaos of stereotypical Las Vegas. 

I have a strong suspicion that their pho dishes are premade. The wait time from point-of-order to point-of-arrival is very short. Extremely short if you take into consideration how busy it gets; that's most likely why they'd do that. If I had to wait as long as it would take to make every meal made-to-order, the wait would not even be worth it. 

In short, I would probably never crave Pho Kim Long's pho specifically, but if it's after hours and I am craving pho in general, this would be the place to go only because there aren't many other options.",0,0,0

I can't even begin to count the many drunk nights and hungover mornings spent sipping the miracle broth of Pho Tai, or the awkward dates spent loading it with all of the bean sprouts, lemon juice, and hoisin sauce it can hold to sidetrack myself from the shmuck on the other side of the table.

I love this place. I'm a long time Pho-lover and have been to dozens of restaurants serving Vietnamese and Thai food, but Pho Kim Long is my favorite - and not just because of the daring name ;)

First, they're open 24 hours. Meaning you can stumble in wasted at 3AM on a Saturday and they won't blink twice - as long as you don't stir trouble, or enjoy a lovely non-traditional Thanksgiving day brunch to avoid family members - which I haven't done but have certainly been tempted to. You can also order for pick up. 

I enjoy that the atmosphere feels fitting for a plethora of different occasions. The restaurant is always clean and has the kind of feel to it where you can easily come here to enjoy a nice date, or to end a night of partying in casual attire. Or call ahead to pick up food and eat it at home in your pajamas - you know, whatever.

In general I've stuck with my time tested favorite, Pho Tai - thinly sliced rare beef thrown into a tasty broth and loaded with bean sprouts, noodles, lemon, onions, and what else your heart desires as long as the kitchen has stock. Expect to pay $7-8 for a generously portioned bowl. However, the many times I've been here with friends everyone has been satisfied with their non-Pho choices. If your stomach can hold it, they also have spring rolls to die for and delicious boba smoothies. The quality of food has always been consistent.

They lose one star because, unlike the quality of their food, their service is inconsistent. I've never received truly terrible service there, and it is certainly light years above many other Chinatown joints, but you do get the feeling that some of the young waitstaff is only there because they're being forced by parents who likely share ownership.

If you're in the area and enjoy Vietnamese\/Thai cuisine - check it out. You won't regret it.",1,1,1

They didn't understand a word I said and gave me the wrong type of pho. And the thing that pissed me off the most is that the cashier expects you to know how much your meal was. If you go up and tell them you don't know, they stand there and tell you to calculate it. And in the customer point of view, THAT IS THE EMPLOYEE'S JOB. Then they just throw out a random number if you don't know what it is. 

Second, the soup to noodle ratio is inefficient. They provide more soup and less noodles. I'd rather pay for more noodles, I mean that's what pho is right, A NOODLE SOUP. I want to get my money's worth. Also, they aren't careful with how they handle their bowls. Since their is too much soup, it spills over the edge. And they don't even clean it up for you. I also tried my cousin's boba, and it was garbage.

Overall. This was enough to influence my decision that I'm never going here again. The employees need to learn how to do their jobs and learn to have better customer service skills. I do not recommend Pho Kim Long for pho lovers.",0,0,0

Food:
1) Salt and Pepper Shrimp - this is amazing! I've become a huge fan of this ever since I came here.

I come here for two reasons. One because someone I am at lunch with people who picked the place or two because I really, really want Pho and the people I am with are newbies to Pho and might not order Pho. Since, they offer other Asian eats, it is almost a win-win for everyone.

With that being said, my service here is never consistent. Sometimes it is good, sometimes it is horrible. I will say it is consistent about one thing, it is NEVER great.

I have had problems with getting my food on occasions. One time I ordered Pho and my friend ordered pad Thai. Well my Pho came right when she was done eating her pad Thai. Livid. I was going to send it back but because my friend treated me to lunch, I did not want to be rude.

You aren't hearing it wrong. I would rather starve myself than eating here and getting food poisoning and must-be-paying for it. Avoid this place at all cost!!!! For detail, please read the following. 

I came here with a few friends and ordered a bowl of pho. My pho came out with the smell of drugs or some sort of medicines. But I just convinced myself that maybe the smell came from a different place. I proceeded for a little bit and that smell was so strong that I couldn't continue. And the smell actually came from my bowl of pho. I told the waiters that my food smells funny and tastes a bit bitter. He asked if I want a new bowl but I said no because my stomach felt weird at the time. A few minutes later, I had to run to the restroom inside the restaurant and threw up. When I came out, they gave my friends the check that included the price of that bowl of pho. They didn't want to take that $10 off the check regardless my reasonings. I would have tipped them $10 anyway if the service was good. So at the end, I asked him to remake the pho for me and put in togo boxes. Apparently I wasn't gonna eat it. Who would eat something at the same restaurant that gave you food poisoning a few minutes earlier? 

I personally think it was ridiculous and unethical. Indeed, it was absurd to charge the customers the food that poisoned them. They should be grateful that I didn't sue their ass for making dirty and poisoned food. This restaurant is crowded because it's one of the places opening 24\/7.

Pho Kim Long is located off the strip in Chinatown area of Las Vegas. Very popular late night spot for locals and frequent visitors. If you're craving pho, this is the spot to get it at!

Extremely reasonable prices for the food (very cheap compared to the Strip!) and good sized portions. Pretty much every dish is under $10.

As far as the quality goes, its pretty good! i'm from San Jose so I'm pretty familiar with Vietnamese food, and Pho Kim Long can hold it's own. No complaints with the pho, rice plates, or vercimelli bowls!

Only downfall is that it gets super busy around 3am. So if you're super wasted and don't have the patience (or ability lol) to sit around and wait, I would look for other options.But other then that, this is one of my favorite off-strip joints in Vegas!",0,1,0

     The dining room is buddhist-like temple  theme which is more of a cross between Chinese and Vietnamese.  There are lots of buddha figurines in different sizes.  The fresh water fish tank is nice with expensive variety of fishes. The plants need to be taken care of because they are covered with dust.  The restroom needs to be clean because toilet paper are all over the floor.  By the way they haven't upkept since the remodeling.  The place needs better ventilation because I can smell lot of pho flavors when first entered.  
     The beef noodle soup here is reasonable.  First, the soup come out really fast.  The broth has a distinct cinnamon flavor, which is typical.  I prefer a balance flavor broth.  The price for the beef noodle soup is fair.  The seafood soup here is overpriced because the content in the soup are 3 pieces of shrimp, 2 fishballs, 3 slices of cuttlefish, and egg noodle in a blanched broth.  The BBQ duck is tasty which has a balance flavor of crispy skin, duck with fair amount of meat,  and good price.
     The service is unpredictable.  They have all male servers with a serious look on their faces most of the time.  You have to ask for service. One upswing is  they give you the right utensil for your needs.  The 17% gratuity is added with five or more in your party.  Since there is not much service that seems rediculous.  You can't split check, boomer.
  Their non-alcohol prices are more than their beers.  Might as well order a beer for your thirst.  One more thing,  the servers dress in a nice tunic-like shirt which I thought stand out.",0,0,0

I've been to PKL a thousand times. Nine times out of ten, its 4 am and I'm really drunk. They're 24 hours and one of the few affordable restaurants close to the strip. But seriously though, food is supposed to taste better when your drunk, isn't it?

PHO: Sometimes my soup comes a little greasy. On occasion, noodles are under-cooked and I feel like their beef and other fillings could use some improvement. Also, pho is served with ""rare steak."" So why is my beef tai 100% cooked when it gets to the table?

CHINESE: I came here a lot with someone who didn't like Vietnamese food. He ordered off the Chinese menu because lets face it, who doesn't like Chinese food? The seafood combination pan-fried noodles and the beef stir fry with broccoli are pretty good. Entrees are usually served with steamed rice. The fried rice here is flavorless and not worth the $8. If you like Mapo Tofu, skip the mapo tofu here, it tastes strange!

APPETIZERS: Spring rolls are pretty good. But they're raw and  you drench them in peanut sauce--can't mess those up. Egg Rolls taste good but they're unusually small... For the same price, I can get decent size ones down the street at my favorite pho joint. 

CREDIT CARD FRAUD: A day or two after one visit, I realized I never got my card back from the server. When numerous fraudulent charges came up, I had to assume a shady server swiped my card. They ordered things online and sent them to a local address. PAY CASH. Can't trust shady asians.

SERVICE: The service sucks. It's god awful and when you really need water, don't expect them to give it to you on their own. Don't be shy, flag someone down and demand what you need.

Nothing to rave about but not a bad place to eat when your wasted and in desperate need of food.

Service was solid. No complaints there.

But the food was pedestrian. I eat a lot of pho, and Vietnamese food in general, and I left this restaurant feeling full, but not overwhelmed by the food quality. 

My appetizer was spring rolls--here, the spring rolls are the soft rice paper. The shrimp in my spring roll were over cooked and mealy, and the rice in them was also overcooked and had a pasty consistency.

For my main course, I had pho Tom, which is Shrimp Pho. I ordered a large bowl...and was somewhat surprised at the size of the bowl that was delivered. It was smaller than what I usually get when I get a large bowl at my go-to spot in MD. The broth was flavorful, but the shrimp and noodle quantity was so-so. I will say that the shrimp was cooked well and had a nice, firm texture, unlike those in my spring roll.

As an accompaniment, I ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee. It was overpoweringly sweet with a strange aftertaste. I drank it all; like looking at a car wreck, I couldn't help but do it. But I didn't quite enjoy it.

There are hit and misses when it came to the food. The beef stew rice noodle I got was made very well, but two of my friends' foods looked and tasted bad. The waiter will give out suggestions, and I think those usually are the most popular\/freshes\/specialty things that the restaurant is known for. Order that.

I heard this place is best for late-night hangover\/Pho fix. To be honest, If you were traveling here for vacation and was looking for good eats, I'd rather fork over a few extra dollars and enjoy a good buffet on the strip.",1,0,0

And yet, people just kept coming and patiently waiting with no rush at all. We even met a family who had come all the way from Colorado to Vegas to eat here. What a surprise! The Pho here is even better than some Pho I had in Florida and D.C. The broth was cooked so awfully well with the real taste of beef bones, oxtail (perhaps), with some spices like Vietnamese cinnamon sticks, cloves, coriander seeds, star anise, and cardamom. The Pho here is very Southern Vietnamese style, and I like it, even though I am from the North. Not only that, the Charbroiled Beef with Vermicelli which was not listed on the menu was delicious.  For those of you who want to try, just tell the server that you want ""Bún Bò Xào"", as ""Bún"" is the rice vermicelli, ""Bò"" is beef, and ""Xào"" is the method of cooking.

The staff made sure our water glasses stayed full (fail from last time)....but the biggest difference is the remodel.

This place looks like a brand new restaurant! Before, it seemed like your typical ethnic restaurant, but they've really cleaned this place up, and added plenty of seating. My guess is they took out whatever business was next door.

The delicious beef broth, light rice noodles, and strips of beef are sooooo delicious. Also, I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes to get seated here. Not only is this place open till the wee hours of night, long after you've consumed multiple shots of alcohol and danced your booty off, but there's nothing better to cure a typical Vegas hangover than some MORNING-AFTER PHO!! I know there's now places to get pho on the Strip, but Pho Kim Long tastes authentic and you can get a decent meal for under 10 bucks. 

I love this place. And it's a cult favorite. Literally every time I go I unintentionally run into someone I either know from 1) my sorority, 2) Los Angeles, or 3) other random people.

Virtually everyone who's a Vegas regular knows about this place and has been here.

And FYI - I have also had pho here when I was NOT drunk, and enjoyed it!

Recently they've had a restaurant makeover, making the place more classy. Yes, you can expect to see people there of all ages - from seniors, to children, to under dressed club hos.

Parking is easy as it is located in a small Asian strip mall. It's also about a 10-15 minute drive from the Strip, which is not exactly pedestrian friendly but definitely worth the trip if you have a car.",2,2,2

Surely this is better than any of the Pho I've had in DC, though curiously, the best pho I've ever had was in my home town of Syracuse, NY, not the most cosmopolitan place, I know.

However, of course the morning after some heavy drinking out in Vegas, the first thing that comes to a Bay Area native's mind is ""My God... some pho would be the perfect cure right now."" Hence, my cousins and I went on a hunt to find some pho. Funny thing is there is also a ""Pho Kim Long"" where we are from, so we thought we'd give this place a chance. Hopped into a cab and asked the cab driver himself if he had a favorite Pho place. And right off the bat he named this place! 

The restaurant itself is bigger than most pho restaurants I've been to, and definitely the NICEST looking. I'm used to cheap restaurants that look a bit dirty inside. This place actually has ambiance. Service wasn't too shabby as well, and honestly don't know if it was because I was super hungry (and slightly hungover) but I could say this was the best pho I've ever eaten... surprised it was in Vegas! Even my sister's vermicelli salad looked bomb and perfectly proportioned. Be warned as they only have one size and no ""larges"" for you hungry hippos. Or maybe they do, but it's not listed on the menu.

Definitely should open a location on the strip and they'd make so much money. I wiill definitely consider coming back to this place for my hangover cures if I am to return to Sin City.

As others have mentioned, some foods taste like they were bought pre-packaged and not made in house. One of my companions is Vietnamese and came from a family of caterers, to boot.  He ripped the place a new one over the food - spices were off, dishes were not done properly, etc.  I was genuinely disappointed as I love all kinds of Asian food and wanted to really like this place.  Unfortunately, I think they've gotten a little big for their britches, they know folks are going to show up no matter what and just are phoning it in now.

I've been getting spoiled with these fat noodle pho joints...Honestly, if it were 3am and I really wanted pho, I think it probably would be just perfect.

The FRESH SPRING ROLL and the FRIED SPRING ROLL were really good - the spring rolls were more of a hit than the pho.  Great peanut sauce and dipping sauce for the fried ones too.

The COCONUT was really tasty.  They give you a spoon and crack open the top as well, but just drinking the juice was so refreshing!

There is a clipboard with a waiting list at the front.  Not the friendliest service but just deal.

Small waiting area and crowded parking lot.  The restaurant is pretty big but it seems to fill up too.  It looks like the restaurant used to be a Chinese restaurant since the style doesn't look like your typical pho place.

SERVICE - 1\/2 ... FOR EFFORT?
FOOD - 3

I was excited to try this place since I always see that the restaurant is packed. I guess it's one of those places where food is decent but service is lacking - they take their time. My friend and I walk up to the counter and was greeted by a hostess. We wanted to order to go and she took our order, said it would take 15-20 minutes. Sure, it's a Sunday evening, restaurant wasn't full but it was getting there. This was 9:10pm. 

9:40pm rolls around. We've seen other people who ordered after us with orders fulfilled. So, we walk up to the counter further in where the register is at and talk to the guy behind the register who is clearly prepping orders to go and picking up phone orders. He says our order isn't in there; He can't find it. I clarified the hostess took down our order over half an hour ago, he calls her over, she says something in Vietnamese that, by the tone of it, she admitted she totally forgot. STRIKE 1. He apologizes to us and takes our order. which were repeated to him (once by my friend, second time by me just to make sure he has it), said it would be out in 10-15 minutes. Fine, I paid, wait again. 

He walks over to hand us the food himself, again apologizing. We feel better, even though we were really hungry, as we felt he knew we deserved better service. We then check the food and there's an order missing, and a missing side rice. Checked the bag and we couldn't find the order receipt. We approach him and he says we didn't order what we claim are missing. He prints out our order receipt and shows us. Clearly, he didn't add them in. STRIKE 2. We make another payment.

It was really hard to enjoy the food after dealing with this kind of service but by this time I was so hungry I ate up the whole thing. Food was decent, but I can't say it was great. I will make an effort to give this restaurant another chance and hopefully I can follow up to this with a more positive review and not a Strike 3.

Pork-Bowl Thing (Jason ordered it by photo): The pork was really good, but the rest of the bowl lacked creativity. He wasn't a fan of how much salad was in the bowl, and the sauce was bland.

Vegas clubbing leads to late night pho at the top spot for it in Chinatown. Twenty-four hours a day, crowds of people come and wait to enjoy a nice steamy bowl of noodles. This place is only good at night when you get the drunchies but that's not the point.

On a weekend in April when we were here, PKL's handling of a pretty scary situation left me annoyed and upset at the management. My friends and I were seated near the main doors where the bouncer and customers were waiting to be seated. We were eating our food and was simply letting time pass for us to sober up from going out.

Well, sober up we did. Before we knew it, something had happened where the glass door shattered and people started screaming and running into the restaurant. Someone shouted ""gunshots"" and immediately chaos ensued. A few of us in my party ducked and ran towards the back, while others used toppled tables for protection. You can't even imagine the level of uncertainty and fear that everyone was facing.

We ended up finding out that someone had smashed the front door with a crowbar out of frustration at the bouncer. We knew the restaurant had to close and we knew leaving was the best place for us to feel safe. I come to find out out later that the management demanded everyone to still pay for their food despite being completely frazzled- my friend included. 

It's one thing to demand everyone pay versus suggesting it when the entire restaurant had just erupted in pure chaos. To me, this came off as not caring about your safety and more-so making sure nobody leaves without first paying despite cops on scene and folks frantically trying to figure out what had happened.

The management will likely remain the same so this was simply story time for those out here late at night. Be safe because you never know what could happen!",2,1,2

One thing about this place is that it's open 24 hours a day and I was informed that they are the only pho place that has these hours.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  It was my bf, and two of our friends who shared this experience with us.  I never really know what to order from here so I had our friend order for  me.  
 
When the bowl came my way, I was very excited as I'd never had it before.  I believe it was pho with some kind of beef balls.  There were other meats in there but I forgot to ask what type it was.  The broth was good without the extra sauces that people normally put in there.  When adding the bean sprouts, mint, and jalapeno's the kick it gives is a whirlwind of pleasures in your tongue.

My boyfriend ordered the fried rice.  The color was somewhat orangey-yellow.  We've never had anything like it.  Per our friend, the way it's made is the cook adds just the yolk to give it that sunshine color.  It's definitely different but I can't say I'd order it for myself in the future.  The other dish we had was a spicy tofu.  That was really addicting.  Normally, tofu doesn't blend well with anything because of how bland it is.  But, they added the right amount of spice to give it a pleasing taste.

The atmosphere of the whole restaurant was very relaxed.  Most people come here to sober up after a wild night at a club or bar.  It only makes sense.",0,0,0

The ambience of the place is not bad actually.  The decorate the place well, its large, and its cleaner than most Asian restaurants.  I think the prices are fair also - about 10 bucks a dish (more or less), I think maybe 7 for the pho.  Portions are of decent size.

I can't say much about the pho here, because I never really order it.  The boyfriend does though, and I've tasted it.  I think it's just OK. 

When I go here, there are always dishes that I always have to get because it's DELICIOUS and awesome:

- House special pan fried noodles (chow mein)... Noodles soft in the middle, crispy on edges (AWESOME).  Saucy, flavorful and lots of goodies like bok choy and shrimp.

- The cubed beef with Chinese broccoli - Make sure you specifically ask for the cubed beef - they have regular beef and broccoli which is not so good.  The cubed beef is pretty much a MUST HAVE.

- Salt and Pepper Porkchops or Squid - Depending on my mood... love to have some deep fried pork chips or calamari with salt and pepper seasonings with my meal.  YUM.

The one thing about this place which I wish I could change is the wait staff.  It always feels like are trying to get you in and out quickly... and they aren't the friendliest either.  The service is usually pretty quick though I guess.  Also on the plus side, they are open all night so it's a great place to hit up after drinking.

I'm not really into their Pho soups here because they don't taste the way I prefer.  It actually has a hint of sweetness, and not enough Pho flavor if you know what I mean.  It's different; hard to explain.

I like to come here for the fried chicken appetizer, the spring rolls, fried egg rolls, and of course the Vermicelli bowls; you can never go wrong with Vermecelli because you pour the fish sauce in for taste!  I like the significant amount of vegetables they put in their vermecelli bowls - I like to think it's healthy!

I'm no expert at being a food critic, but I honestly can't find a complaint for this place.

Personally, I can find myself going here over and over again. There's nothing wrong with this place at all. Except for the parking. It's a total drag during the busy hours, which is usually night time-ish. However, Pho Kim Long is open 24 hours, which is just amazing.",2,0,1

We are greeted usually immediately, seated at a table, and given menus. The floorspace is open, a mix of 4top tables and larger round family size tables. We are quickly brought water while we look at the menu.
We normally order pho tai (rare steak slices that quickly cook in the hot broth) or pho tai nam (rare steak with well done flank) along with chinese broccoli and garlic. It averages taking 5-10 minutes to get our soup and a few minutes more to get our broccoli.

Here is the story. My mother and I had gone right now and had ordered some food and one of the many foods we ordered was Chicken Pad Thai. When our dish came out and we ate couple chopstick full & looked at this so called ""chicken"" that was thinly sliced, chewy and what seemed and look like fat attached was simply ""pork"". 

Like any customers would, we called over our waiter, he took it back unsure as well than ANOTHER waiter aggressively came back with the dish and claimed it was chicken. We argued about this for several mins & because we didn't want to make a bigger scene we told him to take the dish back. 

NOW, this next part gets better. As we continue to eat our rest of the food, the waiter and his other employees gather around near by we were sitting and have the nerves to talk about our situation and laugh about it. So, as a customer I was furious. Asked for the manager to let him be aware of his employees behavior. Of course -_- manager isn't any better with his behavior so possibly that's why his employees aren't any better either -_- so anyways, manager comes to our table, not making any eye contact with me and fights for his employees (which is understandable defending his employees). Finally got an apology and ended the conversation. 

This gets even better, once the check arrives, we were charged for Chicken Pad Thai (in most case in other restaurants, the dish is taken off the check) so we only paid for what we only ate and with that kind of a crappy service, we didn't leave tip. As we were leaving, the manager came out to our car and told us we didn't pay enough. This is how the conversation went:

Manager: ""you didn't pay enough!""
Me: ""no, we paid for what we ate.""
Manager: ""shut up!""

So at this point, I was beyond furious and got out of our car and went up to him and he had the nerve to say he didn't tell me to shut up. So now I'm apparently gone crazy and hearing things -_- then he aggressively argues with me that I didn't pay enough, so I had to RE-EXPLAIN to him that we ONLY paid for what we actually ate and not what was taken back (since we didn't eat it!). 

This is where he failed miserably as a manager...not only did he verbally fight back, tell me to shut up, but he had his biggest nerves to tell me my service was unwanted there and for me to ""go to hell"". 

Uhm, are you serious right now?! How in the world can a restaurant manager say all that to a customer?????!!!!!! My mind was so blown away. Un-freaking-believe-able! For sure NEVER going back there and it is such a disappointment cause I been going there for many years now. I seriously think they are so full of it!

Only down side is when we were served the bowls weren't steaming hot they were just warm, but that could be considered a plus cause we didn't burn ourselves.

Pho Kim Long is a Las Vegas culinary mystery to me. The restaurant is always busy, which is generally a good sign, and following the masses, I went to sample the pho. I was simply not impressed, and I am not alone, just visit this Yelp discussion: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/topic\/las-vegas-ok-gimme-the-best-pho-in-vegas

No mention of Pho Kim Long as the best pho, and even the 24-hour convenience does not merit more stars, as Pho So 1 is open until 3am, and after that you should really just be eating Korean BBQ. No need to go to bed on a stomach of noodles; you need protein to repair your party body!

Why didn't the pho impress me? Good question. The pho did not impress me because the broth lacked complexity. My favorite thing about pho is the deep sweet but savory flavor of a good broth-- the magic of anise, cloves and beefy bits-- but at Kim Long, the broth had the taste of a glorified, salty chicken broth. Without the broth, you might as well get the chicken noodle soup at Marie Callender's.

I think that Pho Kim Long gets overrated by hungry, sometimes drunkish visitors because it is close to the strip. I love visitors, I do, but we should try to get you some different late night dining options.",12,6,7

Just about every trip to Vegas, We have made countless  stops here at Pho Kim Long, Not because their food is good( not when a diner compares the quanlity and quantity with a more populous Vietnamese community like Westminster CA, San Jose CA, or Houston TX...Their pho's taste seems ok but the size is like a small bowl in CA and is far away from being on the top notch. 
Once in Vegas, when it comes to Vietnamese food, a diner does not have many choices. Even though there are better choices now( in compare with a few years back, thanks to the competition.)
But what really gets me to Stand Up:) and create a Yelp account to ""award"" the first so call negative review for Pho Kim Lonng is that I had a bad diarrhea in Vegas and really need a hot bowl of beef congee with green onions and ginger in it to wash down two caplets of loperamide HCL 2mg. So my wife called and ordered two bowls of the beef congee for me and for her too, since we were staying in a hotel room. 
Being so exhausted at 3am, I had to drive up there to pick up the food. Ohh my God!!! When I opened it there was literally Almost noooooo meat! ( something My body really need to digest for recovery). When I said Almost it means that there was just a few very tiny pieces floating up and down to the point that I would rather don't see them so my mind can do a better job of persuading the so disappointed stomach that they have forgotten to put the meat in!

Then the wall works...  it's a WOW!

The interior decorating is attractive Asian art.  I couldn't help staring at their money tree while waiting to be seated.  So there is a plant called a money tree.  But this restaurant had like folded money art hanging from plant trees.  I believe that is some symbol for prosperity of their business.  That is actually true; evident in the numerous people waiting, the well kept well designed interior.

We had about a 15 minute wait, but when we were seated I saw several open tables toward the back.  Not sure what was going on with their table seating management cuz there were plenty people standing to wait.  Perhaps they lack servers as well and didn't have the manpower.  

Except that our food came out pretty quick.  After being seated and already eating, I can see the activity going on was fast paced.  The kitchen was full staffed it seems.  Our food was great nothing wrong with presentation, or overcooked or blandness.  I just didn't like all the tendons in my soup.

I swear too our server would drop off food, very short or no interaction.  Only announced what the order was, set it down, and disappeared.  I get it they're extremely high volume.  But I'd like to be able to comment oh kind, friendly, or patient whatever... not enough interaction to mention.

We ordered our food and didn't receive our drinks until after some of us had been served, which was my first disappointment. We also had to ask three times for extra condiments for our table before someone had brought it to us. When the food came out, my boyfriend had ordered a Pho Tai Chin and our server took our order wrong and forgot the chin (brisket) and then offered to add it on the side. When our bill came out, he had charged us an extra $2.50 for it even though it was his mistake that he took the order wrong. We asked him about it and he said that it would've came out to the same price and I just double checked and he didn't and he actually charged us extra.

I had ordered bun bo hue and for $9.50 a bowl (over priced to me), it was really disappointing and bland even after dumping all of the extra mam ruoc into it and squeezing lemon into it. 

After coming up to pay the bill, the cashier charged us $3 when the check had said $2.50 for the extra side of brisket and when my boyfriend had told him that he was wrong he still charged us $3.

That said, I have tried pho at alot of places but I've been here the most. That partly is due to its proximity to the Strip and being open 24hrs. Who am I kidding, those ARE the main reasons I've patronized this pho establishment more than any other pho spot. Friends visiting out of town, want late night eats nearby after gambling and\/or partying all day\/night. 
I remember when it wasn't open late. Then it seemed like every year or 2 the closing time became 1hr later, next thing I know it's 24hrs! Pho spots are notorious for their horrible service. Although the last time I went recently the service was horrible. The pho came with a lemon wedge instead of limes and I got exactly one basil thai stem. And we could never find our waiter and ended up having 3 separate waiters help us. Besides that, the service has been pretty decent here. The broth doesn't taste noticeably better or worse than any of the other pho's I've had. I do get a little annoyed everytime I get my pho, the rare steak on top is already fully cooked from the heat of the broth. I should probably follow my one friend's lead and ask for the meat on the side so that doesn't happen but I always forget.
If you eat at the hours I do, there probably is not many other options but during normal times when people eat, there are alot of pho choices scattered along Spring Mountain Road in Chinatown. I think it's a decent place for pho and it helps that you never have to worry if it's closed.",0,0,0

I know back in Maryland after a night out drinking I just crave a good Pho meal.

WELL Pho Kim Long is open 24 hours!

When I visited here my friend and I had to wait about 10 minutes for a table which wasn't too long. It was pretty packed for a 5 a.m meal.
They have good amount of tables at least 30 and up. 
After your meal you walk to the back counter and hand the cashier your reciept. 

Now beware the service is horrible. The servers don't even talk to you.
BUT the food comes out fast and delicious. 

I ordered the #18 which was the dark and white meat chicken soup. It was awesome. The noodles were soft and the chicken wasn't dry like most places. 
Next, my friend and I split the crab rangoon appetizer. They were made perfectly. I like that the chef puts the crab mixture into a ball and places the breading around it. It made it so the crisp breading didn't overpower the crab and make it all greasy.

Anyways, if your out drinking and have the drunchies come here you for some Pho, but make sure your drunk so you can laugh a little at the service lol.",4,3,3

The restaurant itself is located in Vegas' version of Chinatown, which is basically an outdoor mall\/strip.

I've been their customer for about six and a half years now and probably visited this restaurant more than 80 times. Highly recommend their springs rolls (which is a bit over-priced but it's tasty so it's worth the extra few dollars $$), their fried egg rolls, lettuce wraps, and combination pho! They have other selections that aren't just Vietnamese cuisine but that of Chinese, Thai, Korean, and Japanese (very little but still present).

Their prices have increased over the years but their taste still gives them the huge reputation they have.

The chicken lettuce wraps were good- more chicken than lettuce, but tasty enough that we didn't mind and much better than the other way around.

Pho:
The pho here is definitely on point. The broth comes out steaming hot and the broth is seasoned so well. This is one of the places where the broth is so good you'd clean the entire bowl out. It's addicting how good the pho is here. My equally just as good favorite dish to order here is the calamari. It's literally the best calamari I've ever had. They deep fry in a way that isn't super crispy but also is kind of soft in a way. I don't know how they do it but its the perfect deep fried texture. Also, the portion that they give is enormous! It was just two of us and we couldn't kill the entire plate of calamari.

Service:
Service here is okay. They seat you quickly if it's not busy and the food comes out quick. If you get pho, it always comes out before anything else does. The waiters were quick with the refills but if you're there for a while the service get slower and slower. It took us a while for them to realize I was trying to flag them down. Then it took even longer for them to get the check out to us. Service here is my only complaint.

Best part to this restaurant is that it's open 24 hours so you can get your pho craving in anytime.

TLDR; Good Pho and Calamari. Bad service.",0,0,0

Pros
+ Clean and spacious with many tables. Our party of 8 only waited 10 mins to get seated.
+ Many food options to choose from the menu from salt and pepper chicken wings to pho.
+ Located across the freeway from the Las Vegas strip.
+ Great location near by other Oriental shops.

Cons
+ The waitress did not want to separate the check for us. The male server who originally took our orders said we could pay separately at the cashier, but the female sever who handed us a single bill practically told us to divide it ourselves by informing us that they accept multiple credit cards. She quickly left the table after that statement. 
+ Waters were not refilled.
+ More expensive than other Vietnamese shops.
+ Fresh coconut cost $5.95! 
+ Food does not come out at the same time.

FOOD:

+ Spring rolls: I was a little disappointed because for around $5 I received only two small spring rolls that mainly consistent of noodles. Only two layers of thin beef slices if I remember correctly. I do not recommend this as an appetizer. 

+ Pho Tai (regular): The broth is bland but still has taste. I find it refreshing. I like it because it's not oily but I don't love it. The regular size could use more beef slices. 

+ Pork and shrimp vermicelli: The pork had great char and flavor. It was perfectly grilled. The shrimp was medium size and average in taste. Noodles were soft and chewy and veggies were fresh. This entree came in a large sized bowl with a generous portion of meat and noodles.

This place has been my life saver for all of my Vegas trips. All my nights in Vegas are filled with a blur of major partying and drinking, while my mornings are filled with puking my brains out. Although I don't want to eat anything when I'm that hungover, I gotta say that Pho is the best cure.

Don't expect Pho comparable to the likes of Westminster, but it'll do. Just order your pho, drink lots of water, and try to sober up for another night of drinking!

Service was a little slow and I got my soup noodles way before hubby got his stir fried noodles. The flavor of the soup was good but a little oily, noodles were soft, and they gave a decent amount of seafood. I enjoyed the stir fried noodles also - the crunchy noodles, meat, and vegetables was covered with gravy.  

The place was crowded for a Saturday morning and people seemed to gravitate to this place for their soup noodles. It's lively and the service was friendly but a little on the slow side. Prices were decent: range $7-$10.",0,0,0

A pho place open 24 hours that's less than 5 minutes away from the strip?! GENIUS! Located in Chinatown, Pho Kim Long is a short drive or cab ride away! I arrived at 2am and they were packed. No wait though which was awfully surprising. This has to be the biggest pho restaurant I've ever been to. We ordered and within seconds our food comes out! Gotta love that! My girlfriends and I shared and order of egg rolls and each had a bowl of pho. I know what you're thinking... when you're drunk, everything tastes good. And although in some circumstances that can be true, but I gotta tell you, Pho Kim Long is legit shit. And seeing that I had pho earlier that day, I realy had a fresh comparison. This broth was savory and light. I could drink the whole bowl! The meat to noodle ratio was spot on. I got the rare steak and brisket pho and everything was tender and delicious. The egg rolls were scrumptious as well. Not greasy and not too meaty. 

I can see why this place is so busy. When we left one of my girlfriends decided to order some food to go and boy was that the smartest decision she's ever made! Bo luc lac for breakfast the next day? Yes!! I've never had beef this tender and I'm not even a fan of bo luc lac at all! But this just might convert me.

After eating here: This place is super sub-par! I'm so sad! I got the chicken pho & @ first glance, it lacked EVERYTHING. I guess l get too spoiled living in Orange County, California with quality fresh cheap authentic pho on every corner.

They skimped on ALL veggies especially scallions, culantro, thai basil, & white onion. Broth was below average. At least I had the option to choose big rice noodles after I requested it. The measly dry chicken BITS were floating around in the murky water. At other places, when you order chicken pho, these are the questions the waiter would ask you (but this place didn't):

-What bowl size?
-What noodle size?
-White or dark meat?
-Do you want chicken skin on your meat?
-Do you want gizzards? (Liver, Coagulated blood, heart, eggs, etc.)

HOISIN SAUCE!!! Watered down, much? It was runny, light brown, and extra salty-like a teriyaki sauce! How can you even manage to eff that up too? Wow...

Since I first came to this place, the quality of the restaurant itself had changed dramatically.. only for the good though! Since the management changed a couple of times, the cleanliness of the environment had skyrocketed. There used to be an open area seafood, like the tanks you would see at 99 Ranch or any other Asian market, which was cool and all, but they got rid of it and added an extra table. The drinking water (thank god) was also one of the many things that they had switched around! Oh yea, I think they charge on soda refills, so beware!

Of course, for food, you would most likely end up ordering the Pho whether it would be the soup or rice noodles, for example, the common  Pho Dac Biet (combination noodles). Sadly, they're kind of mean with the meatballs :( I would only see one floating around. On the other hand, also try the charbroiled pork chop, that one is pretty bomb as well. 

Girls, if you're looking for some Viet men or some late night attention, they would gladly tend to your needs and ignore majority of the customers.

Don't order any type of noodle soup if you want your food  quicker than 30 minutes. The tables around us had a mix of patrons who ordered rice dishes and pho. All the people with rice dishes got their dishes before pho came out. One guy at the table next to us had to ask where his pho was when his friends had already eaten most of their rice dishes. I don't mind the waiting since it's Vegas and we all wait, but don't selectively feed the table that came in after me because their dishes are quicker to make. At least three tables were filled before mine. 

The waiter only came to give us food and the check. No one refilled water or asked anything else. And, they were stacking tables next to us and moving chairs, which was fine. Then they miscounted and there were 17 guest so they needed our table and chairs. That was fine but we were waiting on them to return our credit card so we couldn't go anywhere. It was absolutely ridiculous and no paying customer should ever have to go through that at 11am (by now it was 11). 

I always tip 20% or more but this time, I tipped 10%.

In addition to terrible service, food was mediocre and nothing more. Bun bo hue was bland and the pho was meh. Listen to your yelper and go to another pho place. There's so many of them around here that probably has better quality food and service.

Service is absolutely terrible. The staff has a way of making you feel like you're bothering them for whatever you ask for. Waiting for a table has never taken long, but forget getting refills on your drinks or checking on how the food is. Your order is taken, your food is brought out, and good luck finding somebody to bring you the check. You basically have to wave one down like a taxi.
Now, their pho can't be knocked, it's fresh, tasty, and always comes out quick. If you're feeling adventurous and try tasting some of the other some 1000 options on the menu, such as pad thai or beef and broccoli (slight wtf, isn't this Vietnamese?) it's a real crap shoot. 50\/50 chance of getting something solid tasting.

Pho is pretty good, I guess if you open a vn restaurant but you screw up on the pho part, you're pretty much done.

Service is slow. You can probably know just by looking at the wait list and the line. There is ALWAYS a line. If not always, 98.9% of the time. That's why I usually go to pho so 1 for pho instead. But I miss the fried chicken wings soooo much!!!!",1,1,1

Okay, first off... as a teenager, I lived in San Jose CA - a city which has a ton of Vietnamese gangsters... and since I was always looking to get ""hookups"" on car parts, I ended up meeting and befriending alot of the aforementioned Vietnamese gangsters. Those guys ALWAYS used to take me to the best pho spots, so I'm no pho newbie.

I decided to try out Pho Kim Long with one of my boys right before he got married in Vegas, because it was quick, inexpensive, and let's face it, the name of the restaurant is awesome! Funny as hell!

After taking some quick Myspace pics by the sign outside, we ventured in the restaurant and ordered our food. My homie ordered Pho Dac Biet, and I ordered Pho Tai, which is my favorite because I love the thin, rare, red slices of steak (tai) that they throw on top of your steaming soup with hot rice noodles. 

As we waited for our food, I did my standard Vietnamese restaurant ritual of thoroughly wiping down my chopsticks and little condiment dishes with hot tea and napkins. You can never be too careful, especially since Pho Kim Long is located conveniently next to a platform shoes store for strippers.

The service was pretty good, I appreciated the fact that the waiter made an extra effort to hold our pho bowls on the outside! =) I've been to pho places before where they grab the bowl with their thumb on top, and the other fingers below the bowl... but I hate that, cause the soup splashes around, and the waiter's thumb often times goes into the soup! Aw heyllll NO!

The broth at Pho Kim Long was just ""aiight"" but I guess not bad for Las Vegas... I dont expect Vegas to have top quality pho anyways. Let's face it, people go to Vegas for buffets, gambling, parties, drinking, lap dances, and drive through weddings. Not pho. 

So I'm rating PKL (FHL hehe) with 4 stars. Cause I think it ain't bad for Vegas, and at least the guy's thumb didn't go into my soup. Good lookin out homie.",1,1,0

Personally, though I did venture into their Singapore Street Noodles once and was satisfied....I typically stick with their trusty Pho....beef ball to be specific. Once you load that bowl with peppers, mint, sprouts and lime juice (which it's served with)....be ready to enter a fit of delicious rage only to come to your senses when the bowl is empty and you're left wondering what just happened. Seriously, what I inflict on their bowls of Pho could probably be described as a crime of passion in a court of law.....but I digress.

I have tried other peoples' dishes and they are all also amazing. So I doubt you can go wrong.

Atmosphere\/Service:

This place is usually packed but that usually doesn't deter seating time or service. Unless you're rolling up 12 deep after a night of clubbing at XS or something, I doubt you will honestly wait more than 10 minutes to be sat...maybe 20 minutes if people have dignity and can resist eating their food like beasts in a blood rage or they're talking\/visiting too long.

Always, despite what you order....service is usually pretty damn fast. There have seriously been time where I have received my Pho before my drink....and I am ok with that. The only downside to their service is, it may take sometime to get your bill...so if you're going during lunch....start flagging down your server early. 


Overall, this restaurant is akin to a trusty sidekick: it's always there for you, it welcomes you in with loving arms and it won't judge you when you scarf your food down without shame (like me) or if you rolled in after night of hard partying, possibly with disheveled club clothes (like others).",2,0,0

My luck that the Sunday I choose to come in, they weren't offering it. We still sat down for dinner and this is what we got: 

* Hu Tieu Hoac Mi Bo Kho (Beef Stew Egg Noodle) - $7.95: The Big F enjoyed his noodle soup.  I was too busy with my plate to eat much of his.

* Dau Dua Xao XO Sauce (Stir fried String Beans with XO Sauce) - $9.95: Tasty string beans, a bit on the pricey side though.  A nice spice kick as well.

* Com Ga Hai Nam (Hai Nam Style Chicken with Seasoned Rice) $8.50: I've always liked Hainamese chicken since my friend's mom made it for me, along with the seasoned rice.  It's good here, but definitely not as good as my friend's mom's version.

Pho Kim Long II is a huge restaurant with lots of big tables for large parties.  A great place for families to eat and friends to gather after a late night.  Their menu is pretty extensive so there's plenty of choices for everyone.  And portions seem pretty decent-sized too.  (I wish they would get a bigger fish tank though because there are way too many fish in that tiny thing up front!)

From this experience, I give it a FOUR stars.

I love Hot N Juicy Crawfish up the road, and I definitely believe in some healthy competition.  So, last Friday we decided to finally check out their crawfish and see if it's worthy.

We decided to start off with two pounds and see where we went for there.     We noticed a neighboring table with their order of crawfish and was definitely excited.  It came in a large bowl with red potatoes, corn on the cob and sausage.  They also brought extra bowls for the shells and a plate for us to eat on.  The Big F requested limes, salt and pepper to make a dipping concoction.

I dove right in and noticed the big difference...the crawfish was not fresh.  It was old or way overcooked.  The tail meat didn't come off the shell easily and was broken up.  I thought it was just the first one and continued eating.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  There was little to no head juice either, which was very disappointing to me.  The Big F was easily disgusted with the crawfish and we were glad that we only ordered two pounds to start.  (We usually go for two pounds each!)  The corn, potatoes, and sausage were good though, but it didn't make up for the bad crawfish.  Since it comes in a bowl, there's no sauce on the bottom for you to dip your crawfish in after you shell it.  No bibs were provided, which explains all the stains on my shirt.

When I'm craving crawfish, I'll drive up the road and spring the extra cash over at Hot N Juicy.

For this experience, I give it a TWO stars.

Overall, a four stars for their Vietnamese food, and a two stars for their bad crawfish.  I'm giving Pho Kim Long II a THREE star.

All dishes that we have tried are very affordable in price and even more generous in servings. We have enjoyed most of the dishes they have served us. 

The usual night hostess is very sweet and helpful, always taking drink orders and actually paying attention to the patrons. I remember when she went out of her way to bring me my soda when our server forgot about it, very awesome.

Speaking of the service, it's sub-par really. Most of the servers we have received don't check on us often, let the glasses go empty for awhile, or don't seem interested in ensuring great service. Being a manager at a restaurant on the strip I have high standards, however I realize that not every business is like mine, and I can't judge other servers too much.

Pho Kim Long, HAHA sorry had to do it. 
What I usually order...

Pho w\/egg noodle: 4\/5 Don't ask me why but I don't like pho with rice noodle lol So I switch it up. At pho kim long the soup is a bit oily you can definitely see the bubbles floating around. The soup comes hot so be careful, it comes hot for a reason because the thin slices of meat have to cook in the soup. The regular size is more then enough for me so portions are good.

Egg rolls: 2\/5  I used to like their egg rolls until they decided to down size. Their egg rolls used to be fat and thick but ever since they changed their recipe they're friend super small and thin. The size of a lumpia basically, and they give you like 1 slice of lettuce. Everyone knows you wrap the egg roll inside the lettuce and dip it in that fish sauce they give you. 

Service: 1\/5 Even if your belligerently drunk service should still matter. This place is very fast paced and when your drunk you just want things to slow down at that point. The waiters are very pushy and they rush the heck out of you. Once you order and they bring your food out forget trying to get their attention later. Flagging down a waiter there just to get your check is a mission there.",6,3,2

This place seems to be popular with the locals as it was buzzing with people--for a random Thursday during the hours of lunch. The wait isn't that long though so don't fret. Our sever was semi okay, but my friends seemed to think otherwise as he made faces when my friend asked for a substitution. The food was average. I don't think any of us thought it was poorly made or anything great in nature. 

I had some sort of Japanese fried noodle. I really can't remember exactly what it was. It tasted okay, but I thought it was a bit on the oily side. I think other menu item choices would have been better. My friend's fiancee had the pho ga, he said it was good.

Pho Kim Long.
Pho Kim Long.

Yes, it's no mystery; I love the name. I also love the hours and the quality pho served during those available hours of operation.

My Yelp star rating: 4 stars

My reasonings for giving Pho Kim Long 4 (Yelp) stars, instead of the 3 I would have given, is for the sheer convenience and availability of some great-tasting pho. This is definitely not the best bowl of pho I've ever encountered, but it sure is good to be able to have ""good"" pho when I want it and need it most (at 4, 5, or 6am). Take-out pho from Pho Kim Long is my favorite after-Vegas-club remedy. And even though almost anything and everything tastes good when you're drunk, Pho Kim Long is good even while sober and\/or hungover!

The broth is flavorful, but thankfully without that overwhelming, aromatic star anise taste. And it isn't too sweet, either. I like the rare beef\/steak pho, and the meat tastes pretty fresh. And perfectly reddish-pink in the middle.

There is no question as to where I will be having pho when I'm in Vegas!

You can Pho Kim Long all day and all night!!!!!!

This place is supppper popular. I've been here a few times and I'm not sure why I do. I can't put into words how the service sucks.

The first time I was here, my family and I were seated in the back corner. Workers and waiters went back and forth our table but never paid attention. I mean we were obviously in the corner, but seriously.. what the hell? We got our food and all and then my sister felt sick. Instantly, she blacked out and my mom hurried and ordered a lemon soda to help her. It took forever to come and none of the waiters cared. I mean, even customers walking by the go to the restroom saw her unconscious and asked if she was okay. Such workers.. 

Food wasn't even great. The pho was watery and the bun bo hue was bland. I did enjoy my Rotisserie Chicken though but it's so not worth my time waiting and not worth my time dealing with the workers. 

Second time I came here, and OH MY GOSH... bad bad bad. My family was separated into two tables. I mean that's fine with us. The other table had 4 adults and were seated and served immediately. Like I mean they got the food before my table ordered fast.. In my table had 3 adults and 4 kids. I guess we looked like teenagers and so this was where the service began sucking. We flagged down at least 4 workers to take our orders. While taking our orders, the man was being so fucking rude. Excuse my language but I'm pretty sure it's because we looked young. Our food took awhile to get to us too.. the other table were done eating and my cousin didn't even get her food yet. It was reallllly bad. They also gave the other table their check too. I'm sure everyone knows what it means when the restaurant gives you your check right? It's the universal language to LEAVE. Uhhh why would they pay and leave if more than half their party was still eating? Like what? Then they got mad because my aunt questioned it. I can't express how rude and uncomfortable we felt. I knew they were annoyed so honestly one more gesture or request would result in them spitting into our food. 

IT TOOK FOREVER TO GET OUR CHANGE BACK. I am one to never leave less tip but I can't help but tip them bad. Honestly, this place needs a reality check. I'm really curious why they're so packed all the time.

Parking can be a bitch as the parking is shared amongst several other restaurants and stores.

Prices are cheap, portions are generous.  The quality, however, strangely varies.  I had Singapore Rice Noodles this week and it was kinda weak - not strongly seasoned or generous with anything but noodles and onions and kind of dry.  Last week, I ordered the same dish and it was delicious and kinda SPICY!  I was disappointed this week, to say the least.  

The service is always flakey with no personality.  They get your food out pretty quickly but refills are slow moving, particulaly with water.  I start singing loudly when I have to wait more than five minutes and they show up pretty quickly after that.  After they drop your food off, they are gone for a good ten minutes.  

That previous reviewer isn't kidding - this place is hopping ALL the time!  You sometimes may have to wait a few minutes to get seated... rarely because there's a line but because the servers are booking it all over the place

The food is NOT spicy enough for me, generally.  I have to tell them to make it super spicy since their scale for spiciness is a little off.

The Male waiter was short and unfriendly too, got our order and disappeared , forgot the spoons. 

The food was ok but ruined by RUDE service and the following: My guest (which happens to run a million dollar restaurant)  requested carbonated water from the soda tap (gas bubbles and water).... when we got the bill they charged it as a full flavored soda 

3 dollars for carbonated water! 
we questioned it since nowhere else in AMERICA they charge for Co2 and water, they went to get the manager (which claimed to be the owner). That younger male with an attitude of a major jerk, leaned on the table with both ""fists"" on the table, leaned over into our personal space and asked: whats your problem! 

The question of why in the name of everything that is 100% free anywhere in America he was charging 3 dollars for carbonated water and with a major attitude and tone of voice he said: 

""I don't care if I lose a customer that doesn't want to pay for carbonated water, Its 2.99 and I will not remove it from the bill"" .

Needless to say the rude waiters did not get tip and I will never go back and I will never suggest this hole again.

The egg rolls are very good. Crunchy and tasty, the sauce on the other hand it's not the best for me, but I'm sure someone out there will love it.

Take a tasty broth, add some expertly-sliced thin meat, scallions and rice noodles are offer the ingredients in a bowl.  Add some basil, bean sprouts and spicy peppers on the side (with an optional side of rooster sauce and other spicy, sweet and\/or sour sauces).

Simple enough, but get the right bowl of pho and your view of the world drastically improves.  Call it stomach psychiatry--a really tasty bowl of pho can directly stimulate serotonin levels in the brain (more serotonin = more happy).  

But all of that just speaks to the genius that is pho.  Here's why you should head to Pho Kim Long for your pho fix.  When I was there, I ordered the rare steak and brisket pho.  The beef broth was well-prepared and pretty rich.  Other reviewers seem to have complained about the quality of the broth, but during my lunch there it was spot on.  It was a very solid offering.  The side veggies were crisp and fresh and delicious.  

And Pho Kim Long offers a well-stocked selection of sauces if you like to tinker with your food--making it spicier, sweeter, a dash of sour, etc.  It all made for the perfect pho lunch.  The other folks at my table had the beef vermicelli (""bun"" in Vietnamese) and were very pleased, reporting that the bun was better than most.  All of which earns it about 3.5 stars (rounded up because of how popular the place seemed--gotta give some credence to the will of the people).

Good enough that Pho Kim Long has become a standard in my list of Vietnamese places in town.  And the crowd there at lunch suggests that this place has become a go to lunch destination in Chinatown.  It has a big dining space and every table was packed when we were there.  That might explain why service was a little slow when we were there.  But, to the wait staff's credit, they didn't seem to mind when we stepped over to the cashier without a bill in order to settle up.

It was very tasty.  I tend to get the same things with each visit. Egg rolls, chicken wings, and small #15.  All very satisfying and hits the spot each time a craving sneaks up on me.  I do have to say, I now find myself craving the wings (with TONS of fried garlic on top) more then the pho. My mouth is starting water just thinking about those crispy, juicy little things.

The baby decided she doesn't like the noodles, so I always get a bowl with a little bit of rice and add the soup for her.  She also, recently, decided she likes the egg rolls too.

Sure, Pho is the best hangover food you can get, but personally think they're a bit on the pricey side, and their broth isn't that special. They do offer a lot more different kinds of food other than Vietnamese food though.

However, their service is HORRIBLE. People always say, oh yeah you shouldn't expect good services from Asian restaurants , or oh yeah the worse the service is, the better the food is! No, just no. We had to ask them so many times for them to bring up waters, they came to us with the wrong food, server was very impatient when we ordered, and when the food came, they just quickly put the food down anywhere on our table, we had to move the food ourselves.

The food was ok, i had their Beef Luc Lac (sauteed beef filet pieces in traditional Vietnamese marinade served with salad and rice). Now the meat was tender, but what i wish they did differently was served me some flavor rice. Most Vietnamese restaurants serve Tomato Flavored rice with their beef, this place just had plain ol steamed rice which was a bit bland and dry for me. 

Also i had one of their lemonade drinks, it was warm and only had a few pieces of ice in it. My parents had the pho, which looked and smelled good but they definitely looked small.

I can't say much about comparing bun bo  hue to other restaurants as it was my first time, but I'm a fan!

Food: Overpriced, mediocre, nothing special, and not to mention my friend received a piece of a plastic bag in his bowl of pho and I crunched into a shell-like component in my spring roll. 
- Pho: We all ordered the combination pho (pho đac biet) and it was large, tasty, but lacked a key element that we all enjoy in our combination pho - tripe. Apparently they do not sell tripe there (said the waitress). But they did make up for it by giving us generous portions of brisket and additionally included meatballs (bo vien) which I typically do not see in combination pho at other restaurants. The broth was flavorful and not too oily so that was also a plus. But I do believe a bowl of pho for about $9 is on the expensive side. All in all I would give their pho 3.5 stars. 
- Spring rolls: I will post a picture of their spring rolls. They were composed of minimal elements for high-dollar. $5.50 for 2 spring rolls is super pricey in my book, especially because these spring rolls were far from anything special. Rice noodles, shredded lettuce, pork, and shrimp wrapped in rice paper (so basic!). They didn't even bother to add bean sprouts, mint leaves, or green onion to enhance the flavors. Also, their dipping sauce was a little too heavy on the peanut-side (some don't mind it but I prefer an equal balance). Never ordering spring rolls from them again (unless they actually read this post and start making better spring rolls and sauce). 

Service: They took the pho (with plastic) and an order of spring rolls off our bill which was nice - but is expected when serving non-edible components in your food. When we notified our waitress about the plastic in my fiends bowl of pho, she quickly took it away and had another combination pho delivered to us pronto. The service is what saved this place from getting only 1-star. 

Decor: Pretty modern but tries to keep an authentic Asian feel with the bonsai trees and fish tanks. 

I suppose this place had a decent rep because it's open 24-hours and the name is catchy. I wanted to like this place but all-in-all, my experience was not one to bring me back. I can get better pho for cheaper at plenty of other places. Maybe if I was in desperate need of pho at a weird time of the night, I might settle for Pho Kim Long... Until then, Yelpers beware.",0,0,1

What an amazing basin of goodness! Yes! That was my first impression of their Pho Dac Biet (#13 in the menu) a delicious bowl of thinly sliced rare beef, green onions, basil, bean sprouts, fresh basil, jalapeno slices and rice noodles swimming in this AMAZING broth! A dash of Sriracha, Hoisin sauce and a squeeze of lime slivers and you got yourself a bowl of Pho that is simply hard to forget! In an armada of buffets and pretentious eateries in ""Viva Las Vegas"" it is refreshing to find places like this! The best part is...They are open ""almost"" all the time! ( please see hours of operation )

The place is nice, roomy and clean, the servers are attentive and does their job well. There is plenty of parking as it is located in some sort of a strip mall but don't let the location fool you as this place serves some really well prepared dishes. Try their freshly made spring rolls while waiting for your order, it makes my mouth water just writing this review about it!

Drunk Girl: Pho Kim Long! Pho Kim Long! Pho Kim LOOOOOOOOONG PLEASE!!!

Cab Driver (language barrier): Me love you long time? *wink wink*

Drunk Girl: Yes, me love you long time if you bring me to PHO KIM LONG! FTW!!!

To be Continued...

Thank goodness, we came here sober because who knows what would have happened if we ""attempted"" to come to PKL DRUNK in a cab especially with a restaurant name like ""Pho Kim Long"". :X

On Saturday, December 11th, my friend and I came to PKL at 2:45 PM (OPEN 24 HOURS) to nurse our massive hangovers and our growling stomachs. PKL was half filled and we were seated immediately. PKL is only a 5 min drive from the Strip which is about a $8 cab ride. CC's are accepted.

F O O D:
The menu is quite expensive so you can satisfy your Vietnamese craving for pho, bun, com or your Chinese craving for chow fun, ma po tofu, or various dishes with XO sauce for example. 

*CHA GIO (Vietnamese Egg Rolls - $6): Meh! I like my cha gio wrapped in rice paper wraps because it creates a crispier and flakier shell. The ones at PKL is wrapped in the standard egg roll wrapper made with flour and water which seems to doesn't maintain its crispness long. 

The cha gio arrived room temperature and some parts of the wrapper was soggy. The filling pork filling was a bland and the nuoc mam cham (fish sauce) was watered down as it was missing the pungency from the fish sauce and the spiciness from the chilies. 

*COMBO PHO ($7.95): The PERFECT hangover cure! The pho was flavorful and comforting, but coming from SF it's not the best I've had. Nevertheless, it IS best and  most ""authentic"" pho you will get near the Strip. 

The rice noodles were tender and al-dente and swimming in a pool of rich and savory beefy broth that wasn't laden with MSG. The rare beef slices and beef brisket were soft and tender, while the beef balls had a nice chewy spring to it. The bean sprouts, basil, jalapeño and lime were fresh and were the perfect compliment to pho adding a nice crunch and freshness. 

My only gripe is there were no tendons or tripe in the combo nor was there any pho options with them. 

*FRESH YOUNG COCONUT ($3.50): The SECRET Hangover Cure!!! Coconut water contains all five of the essential electrolytes: calcium, potassium, phosphorous, magnesium and sodium needed for effective rehydration and has 15 times the amount of potassium as most sports drinks. So this is a MUST order along with your pho if you want to effectively nurse your hangover.

Coconut water taste a little but like metallic water with a very hint sweetness so you can add sugar to it but you should really drink it a la natural. Make sure to eat the creamy flesh of the coconut because it improves insulin secretion and utilization of blood glucose.

S E R V I C E:
The staff is incredibly nice, attentive and fast which is rarity for Asian restaurants. Our food came out within 5 minutes which is typical of most pho restaurants and the manager (?) checked on us numerous times to make sure everything was ok. 

A M B I A N C E \/ D É C O R:
Dark rich woods, granite tables, various Vietnamese and Chinese shrines, and elaborate fish tanks with exotic fishes create a very nice and upscale environment. 

There are over 25 tables that are well-spaced out, so you don't have to worry about rubbing elbows with your neighbor. 

With the festivities of drunken debauchery that occurred this weekend and the aforementioned scenario in my head, why do I feel like it WILL happen on my next trip to Vegas? *covers eyes*",4,4,1

""Fuh, kim, long...."" - ""fuhkimlong"".....

Ok, so it was funny for me for the first few times I said it..... 

The Pho here is pretty darn close to what I had in Vietnam, I mean it is just broth, noodles, and beef... but here you can tell their broth sits in kettles like they do at Pho 999s in HCMC. They don't give you as much beef as they do in viet nam, but it's still really really good. Can't say much for service, but food A+. 

Here at Pho Kim Long (^,^ he he he) it's almost a mixture of Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai with their dishes which makes it better than just a Pho house. 

Another plus is they're open 24 hours, which is probably why they're broth is so good.

I mean.....usually I don't get beyond the Strip, but I was feeling adventurous and I had major comfort food cravings that Earl's couldn't satisfy. This place proved me wrong!

The wait for 5 the Monday afternoon following EDC weekend was about 20-25 minutes. Not bad considering what a packed weekend it was and the families buzzing around.

Got the Pho Tai Nam with tai on the side. They confused my order. I ordered a small, I got a large. I ordered tai on the side, they gave me tai with an extra order of tai on the side. It's okay, though! It was really THE hangover cure. The broth wasn't too shabby, a bit too much sodium for my taste, but I don't inhale the broth so it was okay.

The smoothies are packed with powders, but still delicious. I'd get the avocado one over the mango one, though. The avocado powder is at least masked by the creaminess of the milk and had a better aftertaste. 

The decor is extremely modern! I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure why I was expecting something more rundown with 70s decor, haha. Maybe I'm just used to frequenting those types of joints. Just don't come in here with high hopes of having a deep conversations -- all the sounds are literally bouncing off the walls. I think it's the ""yay I'm cured from my hangover"" happiness that reverberates through the walls, but the yummy soup could also the case :).",1,1,1

I walked in and was very impress on how clean and nice the restaurant look.  It was packed but lucky the place was big so we didn't have to wait long.  I ordered a large bowl of Pho Tai and we had two plates of egg rolls for the five of us.  I would have to say my friends and I were very disappointed with what we ordered.  I couldn't describe the flavor in the broth.  It seem like they just bought the cubes you buy at supermarket to make pho and stuck in the pot.  The egg rolls were thin and barely had any meat.  One of my friends ordered Hu Tieu and didn't finish it because it wasn't good.

I googled it and it seems I have had it, and more than once.  I didn't know the official name of what I was eating, just knew it was good. So now that I know what it is, I am on a quest to find the best and thought I could start here.

According to a few reviews, this place is supposed to have some really good Pho.  I picked out a charboiled pork with egg and thought it would be a little bit spicy, but it wasn't.  It was hot and hit the spot on this late night.  Is it one of the best, I cannot say that, but it's just the beginning of a tasty journey.",2,1,3

My family and I always eat here at least once when we visit Vegas.  I don't really comprehend why we do, we just do.  Actually, here or some other Asian restaurant in ""Chinatown"" - but as of late, mostly here.  Last visit, we arrived at 8:00 pm driving from Grand Canyon, so we were all beat.  Surprisingly, the restaurant was packed so we waited approximately 10 minutes.

I found it strange that they have a ""smoking section"" of the restaurant, but that area isn't blocked off.  Wide variety of selections on the menu.  I think the only Vietnamese food they serve are pho and the dessert.  Everything else is pretty much from the Chinese\/Cantonese culture, which is why I don't understand why their restaurant name is in Vietnamese.  Oh well.

Stuff is average - pretty good at times.  Not the best pho I've ever tasted, but will suffice during a late night craving of Vietnamese food.  I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here.  Oh, and one of the waiters is pretty cute :)",11,8,9

I always check Yelp! prior to visiting places but we didn't have much time to read reviews this am so we just decided to give this place a try. 
The food was actually decent and would probably have gotten a much higher review if the service was not so horrible.
First, I asked for a high chair when we walked in and the server kind of rolled his eyes at me.  Then, prior to ordering, we asked if we can split the check two ways between 6 people and he gave us a face and flatly said ""this is one table, you only get one check!"" Then he said ""talk to the cashier when you pay"". This is supposed to be a sit down restaurant and our server is asking us to talk to the cashier? Huh?! Was this the first time someone's ever asked to split a check in this place? Their menu even said ""may only split check five ways"" or something like that. 
I didn't think we were being unreasonable for splitting the check TWO ways.  So I walked over to the cashier after our meal to ask if we can split the check and he said ""No... talk to your server"", then he came over and handed us our check. Needless to say, we ended up just splitting the check ourselves. It's not really a big deal, but I'm kind of peeved since it was such a simple and routine request as a patron that they couldn't grant. 
Anyway, there are so many other Vietnamese places around  to check out for Pho... not bothering to go back to  this one!",1,1,1

Good Atmosphere. but Slow Service.

Since they are so busy, the servers don't make too much eye contacts when they are walking by. No pro-active service. They Are Busy!! more eye contacts they make, more service to give for them. so I have to search for a server for help for about 3 minutes. 

However, they give you what you need. 

good environment to go maybe after partying or late-night hunger. 
Club music playing, very busy, loud but yet the design is neat and clean.

It is not like cheap table, interior. They made it nice and little a bit elegant. 
Even though it is more like casual menus, it can make it seem like a dine-in good restaurant with fun environment. not too serious.

good to hang with friends, date. Maybe not with your family. No quite time.

I'd been here before with another friend and it was much nicer. Lets start with the wait.

We came in and put our names on the list, but I could see there were other couples who had obviously been waiting awhile. The place was busy, but no so busy at that time that people should have been waiting very long. I could see open tables from where we were standing. The guy said a 10 minute wait, it was at least 20.

We were brought water and weren't asked if we wanted anything else to drink. They barely gave us time to look before we were being asked if we had decided. My friend is a vegetarian so he needed a moment more and said so. Not even seconds after telling the first waiter, a second one comes over and wants to know if we were ready...i said yes and ordered while my friend asked if they had a vegetarian option available. This is where the service got bad, because the guy got nasty and was like ""Number 21! That what I was just telling you, 21 only vegetarian option for soup"". My friend wasn't asking about soup, he was just asking if they had other options since the menu is ridiculously large and the vegetarian options were all over the place. There was no need for him to get snotty. 

Soup wise, it came fast, and the vegetarian soup was good. Mine was honestly lacking in flavor and I needed to add a lot of hoisen and siracha, which I usually do anyway but compared to Saigon 8 where I usually get my pho, it was still kind of lacking in flavor. I could also tell they ignored my request for completely cooked beef since they didnt have an option for one that wasnt paired with raw. My stomach is really sensitive so thankfully I didnt get sick.

Over all, the place is ok if you dont mind shit service, a long wait, and semi decent food late at night, but I will stick with Saigon as their service is at least nice and the soup has flavor.

Food is very good, prices are competitively reasonable, food delivery is quick but customer service sucks especially when they get busy which is usually most of the time.

I'm in the service industry and my job emphasizes respect especially to customers. I've never seen anywhere that I've dined in where in the middle of the meal, they already served us the bill even though none of us asked for it. Maybe not a Vietnamese culture but rushing the bill to the guests is like telling them to ""eat fast, pay the bill, and get the hell out because there are other customers waiting to be served.""  Then after serving the bill, they started to bus our plates and the worst part happened. I was still finishing my favorite dish when a waiter stood right behind me while extending his arm trying to reach my plate and asked me if I'm done?!? Was this f@&%ing guy serious or what? Not even a word of politeness like ""excuse me ...."". It was just plain rudeness. Sure enough, I got pissed off and hastily paid the bill and reported the incident to the bald-headed supervisor\/manager over which, he offered a free replacement of the dish which I was finishing. The damage was done and turned down the freebie, told him that WE will write some negative reviews about our experience and just walked out.

What really stuck out to me were the eggrolls. They were really good.

I love bits of tender tendon or well cooked pig's feet but this was dreadful. Add a largely indifferent plus inattentive service atmosphere and you have a restaurant succeeding purely on location.

I go to Vegas a lot, and I have yet to find a legit, authentic, reasonably-priced pho restaurant on the Strip. Chinatown is worth the visit every time. The drive is not far at all. $10 max. on Uber or taxi if you don't have a car.

What's even better is that this place is open 24 hours! I like coming here on Sundays for lunch before I head back to LA. There's usually a small wait, but nothing too crazy. The restaurant is pretty big, and food comes out fast. Service is okay. Some waiters are a little rude, but they get the job done.

I usually order the rare beef and well done flank pho. They give a ton of meat. The small size is the perfect portion for me - big enough to warm me up inside and cure any headaches, but not too big where I feel like throwing it all up along with the alcohol I had the previous night.

They have many other options in addition to pho. A lot of Chinese dishes served family style. Sometimes I crave rice when I drink, so this place really covers all my drunk munchies.",0,0,0

I came here around 3am craving crispy noodles. My friend was craving pho. The good was amazing. The service in the other hand wasn't.

The place wasn't busy at all but they did take a long time seating us. Then taking our order. I let it go when I got my food because it was so good. I was willing to give them a solid 4 stars. Until I checked out.

We paid in cash and I brought it up to the register. Instead of giving me the change to leave a tip on the table the cashier was very pushy about what I wanted to leave and leave it with him. The tip amounts were uneven numbers but the middle one 18% was a nice rounded number 5.25 I said that'll work. When he gave me my change back it was wrong. I didn't want to argue with the man at this point so I just let him have it. It was super uncomfortable being pushed as if I wasn't going to leave a tip or something.",1,1,0

I felt my throat was getting scratchy so I really needed to fix it. I had to work the next day so I definitely needed my voice to stay with me. My husband knows that at times like this I need Pho so he said he would find something to eat on Pho Kim Long's menu. He said he would settle for a salad because he wasn't really hungry. 

Well just as a heads up to others that may be seeking salad ...there is none. He did find Beef and Broccoli which is kind of like salad. He ate almost all of it except the little bit I took to taste it. The amount that was given is easily a good amount for two to three people but he finished it even though he wasn't that hungry! The meat was well seasoned and the broccoli was nice and crispy. I hate soft broccoli! 

I ordered the chicken fried rice for lunch this week at work since I came in on late Sunday I had no time to cook. It was pretty basic the chicken pieces didn't have any fat on them which is a good thing. I spiced it up with some Sriracha. 

The Pho was good it wasn't too salty the veggies that came with it were fresh but I was surprised that they served it with lemon. When I usually get Pho I 've always been given limes to go with it. I wasn't going to be picky about it though. My Pho had the beef strips in it but it also came with these round meatballs . I didn't try it though ...I was wondering what it was . I concentrated on the broth just so my throat would feel better by morning. The Pho did help my throat on Monday but had to call in sick on Tuesday.",1,0,0

Pho or vermicelli always hits the spot. Everyone has their own way of eating pho. Some people prefer lots of bean sprouts & chili paste or sriracha in it. It's all about preference. The last time I ate it, I was a little bummed that I ran out of noodles.

A good thing to take note of, is that you can order pho in a small or large size. Kalila is little and she actually finished her small bowl.

I busted out my phone, opened the Yelp app + in no time Pho Kim Long popped onto my screen. About 300 reviews, 2.5 stars average, one $ sign, + the words ""late-night"" as one of the highlights... Good enough for me! 

No need to detail my visits to the curiously-named hot spot as all it comes down to is needing a place to fill the stomach + to sober up whether it's the wee hours or late morning. It's in a strip mall right along Spring Mountain Rd so parking is not a problem... just expect it to be a bit crowded during late hours. The selection on the menu is a decent variety of Vietnamese dishes, but the pho options are pretty limited. Regardless, somehow I find myself ordering a bowl of Pho Tai (rare beef) http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=_jQ4QD84l_CUpsLD8L9LSg or something similar every time. A bowl of pho is about $7-8, which is on the pricey side compared to what I'm used to both in Northern or Southern California, but the portion size is good enough. Quality is okay... soup is filled nearly to the brim, but the broth could be more flavorful + the noodles\/beef are whatever. Average at best. We got spring rolls once, which were equally not noteworthy in any way other than that they actually gave us 2 peanut sauce dipping bowls... for the 3 of us. o_O http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=n7M27mi6yD0uqDjCHP6VPw  Perhaps next time I'll try something other than pho since most of the more positive reviews here seem to be for other items on the menu. 

In retrospect, I'm sure there's better late night eats of the soupy-noodley sort in the Chinatown area or elsewhere off the Strip, but Pho Kim Long does its job. I'd give 2.5 stars if I could... but I'm rounding up. 3 stars for a convenience of this 24-hour, clean place to chow down because sometimes there's just nothing more satisfying than a steaming bowl of noodles.",8,6,9

It may be that I just don't care much for pho in general, so I'm hard to please when it comes to the subject. 

Based on the outrageous line that exists nearly every time I've been there, be it 8pm or 4am, this is a definitely a hot spot in town. Fortunately, there were only two of us so we were sat quickly. The hostess seemed annoyed at the amount of ppl waiting for tables and was just wanting to get everyone out of the waiting area, so she barely made eye contact, and a smile was entirely out of the question. 

The server possessed the same quality of indifference toward us. I realize this place is probably quantity-driven versus quality-driven, so I tried not to let the poor service bother me too much. He only came by when it was time to order, and we had to flag him down for a refill on soda. Honestly, the ""water-refill guy"" was more attentive than our server. 

The food was mediocre, but again, that could be because I don't have much of an affinity for pho. The broth was pretty bland, so I found myself continuously adding to it throughout the meal. Even though I ordered my pho with rare steak, I only had about 3 pieces of meat in my entire bowl. Incredibly disappointing. I will say the shrimp and pork spring rolls we had as an appetizer were delicious, however. Better than the soup, in my opinion. 

It took awhile for us to get our credit card slips back after giving them to the server to pay. A tad annoying since we were in a hurry. 

Overall, I don't plan on returning here anytime soon, BUT if you are a pho lover who doesn't mind bad service and are just there for the food, this might be the place for you! Again, I know it's one of the most popular places in the city, and there must be a reason for that, right?",1,0,0

My husband, the chef, eats here weekly with the boys from the kitchen and a few chef buddies from around town...They always sit in Ben's section - he makes great recommendations when Chef is feeling like having more than #11 (pho) and some orange chicken (hey it's usually 2am so he's entitled to be a creature of habit of sorts...).  Since I work more normal hours, I rarely meet him -- but when I can, it's always a treat...

Last night, since I had the day off today, we went -- and it was yummy!  

Ben was there and in addition to my usual can't miss dish (the salt and pepper calamari -- with jalapeno, green onions and crispy garlic), he suggested the Vietnamese salad with chicken -- it was brilliant!  Crispy cabbage, crunchy crushed peanuts, fried shallot rings, crispy garlic , tender pulled chicken, cilantro and a miso\/ginger dressing that was perfect -- I love salads that are balanced in flavor, texture and acidity... he said they make it with duck, beef, shrimp, calamari, just about every protein they have in house...  

Then he suggested we try the lamb -- I know...lamb at Pho?  It was phenomenal -- tender lamb chops with Chinese spices, grilled to medium rare...over a cold, crispy romaine salad -- again another great dressing -- not sure about ingredients in this one though...

Then he told us they had venison...but by the time he got back with sauces it was 86d, so he ordered the beef for us.  Out came a large, smoking hot black river rock -- a plate of sliced beef, with chunks of butter and limes.   He melted the butter on the stone, then put the beef on it and we cooked it to our degree of doneness -- squeeze of lime -- a dip in the sauce, and it was tender and delicious and took seconds.   That rock wasn't going to cool down anytime soon...

Last night, the spring rolls weren't that great, and the dumplings were tough -- so I'll avoid them next time.  Hey, I can't eat everything...so it's fine with me -- but I'm still looking for Vegas' best potstickers... 

But for a chef to come, and when he's in the mood, for the experience to be totally different -- that many think is just same ol, same ol --  and for us to be treated like royalty (uh, we're not Asian...), is a real treat.  

I've been in a few times by myself for a quick lunch -- and they always remember me.  It's nice because I'm not the kind of regular that I'd love to be...",5,1,3

I got alllllll excited thinking I was going to try ""the best Pho in Vegas"" at this popular spot and when I walked in I immediately realized I had been here like 4 years ago and forgot.  I bamboozled myself! 

$45.96 got us a bowl of pho, chicken fried rice, two soft drinks, a coffee, and an order of chicken teriyaki.  Our servers were efficient and friendly and they called my son cute so they got extra brownie points for that.  

$8.95 Pho Dac Biet- Piping hot (but not burn-your-mouth-off-lava-hot) and savory broth chock full of noodles, onions, cilantro, tendon, raw beef, and I was dreading finding a piece of tripe but never did so......whew! Dodged that bullet.  It came with plenty of bean sprouts, basil, and lime on the side.  Many condiments were provided on the table such as sriracha, chili oil, etc.  This would be great ""sick food"" if you weren't feeling well.  

$10.95 chicken fried rice- It was average.  The rice was a bit small and mushy like it had been handled too much but it was full of peas, carrots, eggs, and chicken.  It was missing that charred umami flavor that I like in fried rice. I don't think they actually fried it which made it kinda mushy.  I wouldn't order this again.  But that's what I get for ordering fried rice at a pho place.

 Expect noise, bustle, several fish tanks sans ANY fish (overhead, lol) and nice greasy and fatty fare. 
 We ordered salt and pepper calimari to share and I got my fave, beef stew. My noodles were not ones I ordered, so there's the semi accuracy. Who cares, I ate them anyway. Chunks of beef were huge and deliciously fatty, broth was thick and savory and price was right. 
 Place was packed at midnight on Wednesday, good mix of couples, families with little kids (yup, at midnight), just friends hanging out. 
 I recommend this place if you are hungry, in the area, in the mood for noodles, and are familiar and comfortable with service model of a typical family owned Asian food joint. It's efficient, tasty and will fill you up at a good $.

When craving for pho, Pho Kim Long is the place to go to. Just a few miles off the strip, this place is not at all hard to get too. 

We were seated pretty quickly. I ordered the #18 chicken pho. And my god, if I had a glimpse of heaven, this would be it. The chicken pho was on point like a freshly opened exacto knife. The chicken was good. The broth was perfect. I usually order the beef pho with the special tendons and tripe but this time my cousin and I were really feelin the chicken pho. I'm glad we made this decision. Service was as expected. Just like other pho places. They serve you, you eat, and your group leaves. The pho bowls range from $8-$10. Not bad at all if this is what will revive you from the dead. Or put you on the right tracks of bringing life back to your body. 

In conclusion, I was very happy with my meal. I felt like a zombie from the walking dead, eating like there was no tomorrow.",2,2,1

Items that were $4-5 or $9-12 are now in the range of $8-12 and $13-18. This is just absurd for some chicken and broccoli. Chinatown is lined with good Vietnamese restaurants and same cold service without the wait. 

Pho Kim's food is delicious with a much bigger menu, but I'll rather take my business elsewhere since they have gotten so greedy and have forgotten the locals who have kept them in business for the last 15 years or so. Side note: I ordered chicken and string beans (which was always on the menu, now showing as chicken and greens) and there was a $3 up charge for the beans. REALLY? The cashier was so rude, saying how expensive the beans are and that otherwise I'll get bok choy. The order cost me $20 -- $20 for a dish that is $8,75 at ANY amazing Chinese restaurant. This was the last time I paid Pho Kim a visit. I was infuriated with the drive, the wait, the rudeness and extortion. 

On another note, a server was asked about MSG content and it was divulged that they use Massive amounts of MSG in all of their food. If you feel super bloated or tired after eating at their restaurant, know that it is due to this nerve impulse transmitter that has been known to cause brain nerve damage in lab animals (unfortunately, for those little beings). This is one of the reasons why their food is so tasty and addicting. Take away the MSG and it's just plain ol' cup of noodles.

Pho Kim Long (that name will never cease to get a chuckle out of me) is the go-to late night spot to get your drunk grub on. I've been here way too many times for my own good, as my state of sobriety while eating here is usually (although not always!) questionable. Regardless, the food is solid and the locals seem to love it.

When I came to Vegas this past June for EDC (yep, as in the Electronic Daisy Carnival 2012 ---- suuuuch a crazy experience, btw), company preferred ordering family style dishes like shaking beef, ong choy, pork spare ribs etc. Everything was quite tasty and portions were ample, but I got the impression that this place catered more to American tastes. The dishes, while yummy in my tummy, were more like something you might find in a mainstream Chinese restaurant than authentic Viet food. Still, no real complaints as it was delicious nevertheless.

During my last trip over Halloween weekend, though, I ordered more ""true"" Viet fare like seafood noodle soup and Bun Bo Hue. I was surprised that the taste and quality were above average. Definitely better than Tung Kee Noodlehouse and probably better than a good portion of pho spots back home! I can see why the locals took me here so often because if *I* was local, I'd probably become a regular too.

However, here's the issue:

NOT being a local, I'm on vacation. And should be eating Vegas-y thangs. Elsewhere. Thangs that are NOT pho. Since I can get plenty of it. Authentic, at that. At home.

So...... basically......

Eat it if you're a local, eat if you're drunk and broke, eat it if you want Viet food while in Vegas. Heck, I'd do the same. If none of these things apply, though? And you have a choice to eat something else? I would. Because dammit, it's called a vacation. Feed me fancy things. Because that's what I want. Hence.... 3 stars.",17,15,15

Bowl of pho runs about 8-9$ and they have other Chinese and Vietnamese plates if you don't want pho. Service is decent especially in such a busy establishment. If you have a part of 4 or less you don't have to wait but a bigger party has a bit of a longer wait since you want to get a bigger round table.

Open 24 hours. REALLY fast, efficient service. Clean (for the most part, if not a bit outdated). I got the bun bo hue, bro got the rare steak pho, we split an order of spring rolls. The rolls came out last btw (lol). Peanut sauce was to DIE for, but the rolls themselves were meh.

I loved my beef soup, bro loved his broth too. Standard accoutrement. I mean, the fact alone that this place is called what it is (hahaha), plus being chock full of young Asian patrons at 2am (we'd just cruised over from midnight Christmas mass, lol), they have to be doing something right.

Not only is the name great.. but the food is amazing!!  

And take that from a Vietnamese person!!

If you are new to the Vietnamese food world... stick to the basics and get a Pho Ga (Chicken Soup)... but if you're feeling a little adventurous... Pho Kim Long definitely has more... hence the name... LOL

I always, always get the claypot pork.  A perfect compliment to that is steamed rice and canh cua (hot n sour soup).  If you are in the mood for fish, they have a crispy friend fish that is really good.

You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu... so it's really about what you are craving that night... or morning (after the clubs)!!

when i walk into a place and notice, you have a waiting list, that right there tells me youre good enough but it doesnt hype me like a giant banner. lol

the pho was okay, the broth didnt taste bad, it just wasnt the best ive had. there wasnt that much noodle, like it was proportioned wrong. meat to broth to noodle ratio was off and i was left dissatisfied. the bill was cheap for 7 people so i guess thats okay

I've been to a good amount of pho restaurants here in Las Vegas and if you have too then you know that pho & drinks are served to you pretty fast.

Now before I go on to my little rant, I must add that their pho is never a disappointment. What I always get is number 13 which is the combination pho which has a little bit of most things & the steak is flavorful. So good job Pho Kim Long for yummy pho ! But BOO for the lack of service you offer ! 

My boyfriend and I went and we ordered two #13 combination phos and I also ordered a tai tea boba. About 3 minutes later our pho is served to us but not my drink. You would of thought my drink came first, right? Well, I thought, ""Oh, maybe they're still making it"" so about another good 5 minutes passes by & my boba is still not served to me & I started to question my thoughts about this place. So we asked one of the waiters where my boba was and he just walked off without any acknowledgement or reassurance that it was coming. So we waited another 10 minutes and my boyfriend and I are just about done with our pho and still....no....tai tea boba. I asked another waiter, ""Hi excuse me, I've been waiting for about 10 minutes for my tai tea boba now and I still haven't gotten it."" & he got the job done but he didn't even apologize for the long wait.

This isn't too far from the strip so it's pretty perfectly located.

I wouldn't say this is the best pho or anything like that. But it's pho and for about $8 a bowl. Sounds similar to prices at home in San Francisco for me.

why this place sucks more in service is because they are really rude and they get angry when you say you're going to ""share a bowl"". excuse me for buying a jumbo size pho and wanting to share with my bf. jeez. another annoying thing is they grab your bowls off the table when you're still in the middle of eating. it's really rude that they just ""assume"" that you're done with your food just because you're sitting and talking with your other guests at the table. 

3 stars only because i realized pho hung sucks more. minus 2 stars for service and PRICES. they are REALLY overpriced for pho compared to san jose.",4,4,5

I know Vegas is a city that doesn't sleep, but even at 12:30 am and 5 minutes away from the strip, this place was still pretty busy!  After eating here, I understand why!  The pho quality is so good!  The soup is delicious and the service is excellent!  Yes!  And actual pho establishment with great service!  Their portions are the perfect size and it comes out fast!

I tried the bun bo hue broth and it tasted exactly the same as the pho. I about got up and left and probably would have if I was by my self. They give you a side of the seasoning to add to the broth which is just plain lazy.

Let's see, where do I start:
1. Was rudely greeted as we walked in. We had an infant with us so I had to roll the stroller and etc. we were following her as close as she would've liked i guess, so she kept hurrying us and waving In a rude way. And by the way, the restaurant was half empty so it wasn't busy. 

2. We ordered pho and bun bo hue. This is the saddest part. Just a giant bowl of soup. Each of our bowl had 4 slices of meat, that was so small it was probably shredded from one piece of meat. 

3. That wasn't the worst part with our food, that the meat was almost non-existent. Worst part was when we couldn't find the noodles in the giant bowl of soup. We almost called them over that they forgot to put noodles in there before my wife said she found it, the barely 3-4 fully chopstick grip full of noodles. With so little noodles swimming in a giant bowl of soup, it was quite annoying because you only get a few strands with each grab. So annoying.

Decor was modern and restaurant was big - great for big group gatherings or late night munching. They seemed fully staffed so whatever you asked for was done quickly. 

Pho Kim Long serves many other dishes, both Vietnamese and Chinese food, so there's a lot to choose from. I ordered Beef Pho and was very satisfied with my selection.

Our waiter also forgot my sister in laws noodles and two beverages. How do you just forget an order that you wrote down? 

And my Beef Pho wasn't very flavorful and the beef was nearly inedible. It was so fatty and chewy. But, it was inexpensive. $7-something and came with add-ins. Like jalapeños, basil and mung beans. There's also house made sauces and spicy pepper sauces like Sriracha.

I can't even remember the name of it, but it had noodles, salad greens, small egg rolls, and shrimp in it. It was okay, not fantastic- but a lot of sauce helped add some flavor.

The waiting area is very small and most guests on the waiting list have to wait outside the front door (which is fine).  I literally stepped outside for 2 minutes to let my family know it would be around 10 minutes.  I walked back in and waited for around 10 minutes.  When I checked the waiting list I saw that our name was scratched out (party of 6).  I asked the young hostess why our name was scratched off and she very rudely told me that ""I called your name and you didn't answer!""  Which maybe could have happened?

This came in a big bowl and a plate with sprouts and some delicious herb on the side, which I guessed was some type of basil(?). I was very excited to try this soup and I'm glad I did, because it didn't disappoint. I loved the flavor it had and I just couldn't stop eating it.

After seeing lines going out the door 3 nights in a row at this restaurant, I decided I had to give this place a try.

The spring rolls were fabulous.
The pho was delicious.
The service was meh. 

The 3 color dessert was horrendous. You get a plastic cup, a mound of shaved ice on top that is impossible to eat with a plastic spoon because the ice hardens, and the green gelatin layer tastes like green hardened rice noodles. The coconut milk, instead of being liquid, freezes with the ice. Quite disappointing, really, to eat such a poorly prepared yet simple dessert.

The Good

-Establishment is big lots of seating and its open 24 hours.

-I had the Singapore Noodles both times and it was good.  The service is okay.

The Bad

-When I first walked in there are fish tanks in the restaurant, they were in serious need of cleaning it was really really bad.  

-The floor around many of the tables had napkins and food on it, which to me is a huge no no.

-the bathrooms were hideous both the men (which I used) and the women (which my friend used)

Overall
I wouldn't recommend this place to my family or friends. I feel if a restaurant can't keep the floors, or bathrooms clean then the kitchen is not clean.  The Fish tanks were just awfully dirty.  Many people who need some place to eat at night go here. I would consider it drunk food since at night most every customer has been drinking and there is lots of noise.",0,0,0

8\/12\/15. Normally I have no problem with this place. I love it a lot. My experience ranges from pho, pad Thai, to their clay pots. But tonight I was seriously upset. 

I ordered a number 24, the vermicelli with chicken. Half way through my meal, I find a dead bug in there. It was big. About the size of my thumb. I was so disgusted I lost my appetite immediately. 

I work at a restaurant myself so I tried not to make a big scene. We quietly called a worker over and explained to him what happened. Showed the bug on a napkin. He nonchalantly said ""oh it must've been in the salad"".  WHAT?! Noooo, sounds like it's happened before. They asked if I wanted anything else, but obviously not after seeing that. 

They took of my meal and gave me 20% off on our bill, which we only got Thai teas and crab ragoons but we shouldn't have even paid for anything at all.

First of all, the spring rolls were extremely small compared to other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to and the rice paper was hard and difficult to chew, as if it had been sitting out for a long time waiting to be served. The spring rolls definitely weren't fresh. Second of all, the broth in my pho wasn't very hot. It was just warm. Third of all, the shrimp fried rice was extremely bland. There wasn't much flavor at all. Somebody pass the soy sauce!

As I was eating my pho, I started to remember why I enjoyed my previous visit here. I came here with my cousins at 3 in the morning after a long day of getting crazy at Life Is Beautiful. Of course anything tastes good when you've been on your feet all day, you're intoxicated, and half asleep, right? Needless to say, the food is just okay, not really satisfactory. The quality isn't there.

Straight up, the customer service is terrible... That's me being nice. The servers aren't attentive and it took a few tries to get our waiter's attention. I asked one of them for some extra lime and as he was walking away, I caught him rolling his eyes. Of course, he never came back, so I had to ask someone else. They were definitely understaffed for the amount of customers they had!

It's unlikely that I'll be returning any time soon and if I do decide to give this place another try in the future, I'm definitely just going to stick with the pho and stay away from the spring rolls and fried rice.",6,5,5

I guess my issue when I went there was that whenever the wait staff would give me my beverage or check, it was placed at the end of the table away from me, which I found to be unusual.  For example, since I ate lunch by myself, I had a single table that seats only two people.  The bev\/check was actually placed at arm's length.  Is that a Viet thing?

After a long night in Vegas, what is the best cure to your hangover? Pho. The name here makes me giggle too lol.

Pho Kim Long is a little way off the trip. But the food is good and if you are in the mood for something hearty and soupy, this is the place to go. You seriously feel  like you are in Chinatown here. Every restaurant is of Asian descent and even their billboards are in Chinese. 

The restaurant is huge for a pho place. I've never seen a pho place so large! Plenty of seating but it is always PACKED. Even though it's a 24 hour joint, no matter what time you go, there is a crowd of people. But their service here is extremely efficient and I have a feeling they make a good amount of their food beforehand, so you won't have to wait long for your dish. 

I ordered their #14 which is their rare steak pho. The broth was delicious and very flavorful. My favorite way to eat pho is with plenty of limes, jalapeno, sriracha, and chili oil. I like it SPICY! What better way to get rid of your alcohol other than sweating it out? LOL. The noodles are soft that it soaks up all the broth. And they give you plenty of it. I think their small size is more than enough.

We also shared a beef dish for the table (forgot the name). It was more Chinese than Vietnamese but still good. The beef was very tender and flavorful. I just wish it came with a side of rice to balance out the flavors and saltiness of the meat. 

SERVICE:
It is clear they are trying to turn their tables around asap. They bring out the food quickly and unfortunately they constantly bug you to see if you are done with your food!! I was still picking at my noodles and they literally came up to me 3 times to see if I was done. wtffff just leave me alone and let me in peace!

ANDDDDDDD they are awful about the checks. My friend went to the bathroom when his bill came out and they came by like 5 times to see if he signed it. They even asked if he left without paying? uh no...... and they even put their own tip? LOL.",11,5,6

After indulging yourself for days in The Entertainment Capital of the World, give your kidney and wallet a rest and come here for some cheap good eats.  I like their egg roll bun with a side of spring rolls.  Nothing like a light vermicelli dish with all my favorite vegetables and some fried fatty egg rolls to soak up all the boozing and food from Sin City.  The prices are reasonable and service is fast.  I don't normally want something hot for the car ride home since it makes me sleepy so bun is the way to go for me.  Maybe one day I'll try their pho.

We saw something similar to it on the menu, so we decided to take a chance and we also shared an order of fresh spring rolls and a combination Pho.

The steak was kinda disappointing and the rice was okay, but the saving grace for our dinner were the other two items. Their Roasted Chicken with the Red Rice is actually a better option.

Start out with the spring rolls for a nice appetizer (peanut sauce = heaven) and then get the Pho Tai (just keep it simple, don't try to get fancy).

I repeat... HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE! 

Host doesn't notice you and won't seat you unless you're with a larger group. He was also extremely rude when we pointed out to him that he's walked past us several times and stood in front of us without even looking at us. I had to walk up to him and say ""Party of 2"" right in his face for him to realize I was standing there trying to be seated. And this was in the middle of the night when it wasn't very busy. There was a party of 5 in front of us which he was attentive to (and having a nice long conversation with); they all went to the bathroom so me & my boyfriend were the only 2 standing there. Instead of kindly apologizing, realizing his mistake, or trying to make our experience better, he was extremely rude about the situation. Because of that, we walked out the door and took our business elsewhere. 

If you're not going to be attentive to the people walking in the door and you're going to be rude, you shouldn't be working the front where that's the first thing people see. 

I know from past experiences here, you don't have just one server; your waiter is anyone you can catch the attention of, which isn't very easy unless you're part of a larger group.

I've tried some other items besides the Pho such as the roast duck and BBQ pork, and I suggest that if you want that just go to a place that specializes in it.
But if at 4am you're craving some pad thai, roast duck, and calamari rings then this place has you covered.

They do have some pretty tasty items such as the salt and pepper calamari, spring rolls and egg rolls.
But the main star here is the Pho, I like to get it with brisket and flank.

I've read other's reviews about this place and one of them gave a 1 star for terrible food and poor service.
Which I'll admit, a few times I've come in and they weren't on their game with the broth, or I've experienced somewhat terrible servic. But that's because usually it's packed and people are just waiting to get a table and with a full house,
it can get crazy for the staff.

I always end my Vegas trip with a bowl of Pho. This time, my husband decided to give this place a try. I remember eating here years ago and it was a bad experience. Since, they changed owner a few times, We thought maybe it's better this time.

First impression walking thru the door was good. Small waiting area. The decor was nice and unique. 

We got seated right away which was extra plus because we were starving. 

I always order my favorite Pho Bo Vien soup. 

While I was waiting for my food, I was admiring the remodeling and remodeled design. It looks nice and welcoming. The atmosphere was nice. Noisy was the usual loudness in every pho restaurant. Everyone having a good time chit chatting with each other. 

So, I got my bowl. It looked good. When I finished garnishing my pho and took the first bite.... Hmmm... Let me see.... I felt the broth was flavorful but the meat ball was nasty. The broth was unique in itself. But I wanted to like it but ended up being disappointed. 

I gave them 3 stars because of customer services. They were very attentive to filling up my ice water and asking how we are doing. 

Maybe other dish will be good. I'll come back and try something else

If it's the weekend or we're in the area, we are going to end up here since cheaper dining options are not really available. I really don't get the hype about this location.

I do enjoy the calamari with fried garlic and jalapeños as this fresh preparation style is not seen elsewhere. Their vermicelli noodle bowl is pretty standard with other locations and won't disappoint. Spring rolls aren't too bad either. 

They give you a filled water cup right away upon seated. They don't have pots of tea available; just a cup of hot water and a tea bag was presented upon ordering. Apparently they don't do that here, which is weird for this type of cuisine. Service can be good, but it can get busy as everyone really helps the other tables out.

We asked for Cafe Sua Da, and they prepared it in the back and brought it to us in styrofoam cups! No on- the-table filters!

-food is bland.  Usually when a restaurant has such a large menu it is hard to have great tasting food.
-food comes out at random times.  My husband ordered the Beijing beef and I ordered the tofu dish.  My food came out about 10 minutes after his food.

The service was pretty good, just the right amount of checking to make sure we had everything we needed, but not so much that we felt rushed.  

I was a little apprehensive at first but since my co-workers swore by it i decided to get whatever they recommended.  The Pho i got was amazing.  I loved adding the bean sprouts and other things they brought to the table for us to it, I especially loved adding the different sauces they  had at the table (mostly hot sauce was what i added since I'm sucker for spiciness). It was very filling and very delicious, i couldn't even finish it all and had to take it home!  The only food i didn't like was the spring rolls I think is what they were.  My friends had ordered them before I got to the restaurant so I didn't have a say in it, but seafood is not my thing and these had shrimp in them I believe so that pretty much killed it for me on them. Plus the dipping sauce was some kind of peanut based sauce......I've had other peanut based sauces at other places which I've liked, but this one was just too thick for my liking.

But I have been here a couple of dozen times and can honestly say: big venue, lots of tables, quick service, consistently good food.

TO START: Get the GOI CUON (SPRING ROLLS). Comes with four shrimp\/pork\/lettuce filled cold spring rolls with peanut sauce that is literally crack. Their recipe for it is so perfected, I can literally just eat it with a spoon. Also go for the CRAB RANGOONS. Eight perfectly fried wontons filled with cream cheese & crab, paired with sweet n' sour sauce. 

FOR HER: I ordered the SHRIMP PAD THAI once when I wasn't in the mood for pho... and was mind blown! Seriously the best pad thai I have ever had. Yes, at a Vietnamese place! How? I don't know. But it's so filled with flavor & perfectly seasoned & lots of noodles... I can never finish it on my own, meaning leftovers for later! Try the combination for a mixture of shrimp, beef & chicken too. Delish!

FOR HIM: This place has great (and cheap!) pho. He always orders the RARE STEAK & WELL DONE FLANK NOODLE SOUP. Cheaply priced, a generous amount of soup, noodles & meat... with a side of sprouts, jalapeños and all that good stuff to add as you please. More than enough to share with someone too! Add a little hoisin sauce, maybe a little sriracha for a kick. So good! The ORANGE CHICKEN is also a fave!

Went there after midnight and there were a decent amount of customers. The appearance on the inside looks very nice. Very comfortable place to sit down and have a nice meal. We got to sit next to one of their two aquarium. We enjoyed the company of the fishes. 

Now for the food part. We got their pho, bum bo hue, this beef with rice, and wonton noodle soup. Overall they were good, but not to the point that made us go ""wow"". We had much better Viet\/Chinese food, but the service+ environment makes up for it. The best part though was their Thai tea. THE BEST I had so far after trying many places that serves this beverage. 

Finally, it was nice that they open 24\/7. I read a lot of yelpers liking pho for hangovers. But as a person who isn't big on drinking, it it's still nice to know there is a nice pho restaurant that will serve well any time of the day. Can't go wrong with this place.",0,0,0

On another night that we went to eat here there was a 20 minute wait but that was around dinner time so that should be expected.

I had the grilled chicken on rice (loved it!) the chicken was tender and moist and it even had the criss-cross grill marks on it.
On another night I had the beef pho and it was delicious. As with all food in the US it felt a little heavy on the sodium but it wasn't bad like the places that put tons of MSG in their soups for flavour meanwhile inducing days of thirst after consumption.

Secondly, the quality of the meat! I usually get the combination, of tripe, tendon, and the rare beef . Lastly, the quality of, what I call the extras, i.e. Thai basil, white onions, bean sprouts, jalapenos, &etc. 

The second dish I usually judge a Pho joint is by the quality of the spring rolls. Now, I've been to many places where the spring roll just plain sucked! It's hard to find a place that has all the elements of a good spring roll. i.e. the shrimp, not too over cooked. The pork, is it flavorful? Is the vegetables mushy? and the overall quality of the flavor, not too much vinegar, a slight touch of mirin, and of course the quality of the peanut sauce. Makes me hungry as I write this! This place hit all the mark! 

Now, let me say this, when a place is called Pho Kim Long...Pho soup is the way to go! Enjoy what they are known for! With that being said, the bowls of delectable Pho has to be one of the better ones in Vegas. It's not to say that the Banh Mi sandwiches are not bad, to be exact, it's actually pretty good! 

Service is very prompted, friendly, and professional! Nothing negative to say about it at all!

Hu Tieu Rice Noodle Soup
We have definitely had better but the noodles were cooked very well - chewy but not underdone. The noodle to soup ratio was perfect but they could have used a little more vegetables in it. Most Hu Tieu Noodle Soups have quail eggs in them and this one didn't but that might just be something my boyfriend and I look for. 

Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio
Really great presentation! And the food came out very quickly -- but with that said, the egg rolls weren't fresh so they were slightly soggy and warm. The dish was served in a really small bowl and anyone who's eaten this before knows there's a lot of mixing to be done so not having a bigger bowl made it difficult.

After a long night out, my cousins and I woke up Saturday morning wanting something to fix that typical Vegas hangover. What else but pho, right?

This spot is located in Vegas's version of Chinatown, located right off the Strip. If you're taking a taxi, make sure you ask your driver for their taxi company's phone number so you have someone to pick you up. It's a frequent spot for taxi drivers, so it shouldn't take too much to describe where you're at.

Ordered the #13, which is basically pho with every type of meat. I don't know, it's not the world's best pho, but if you have the drunchies or need a cure for your hangover, this may as well be the best pho you'll have within the next hour.

Personally, my drunk Yelper self would say that they give a good ratio of noodles to broth. However, my sober and more critical Yelper self would wish there was more meat. But my drunk\/hungover Yelper self wins this review.

They're open 24 hours by the way. Pho after the club? You betcha.",0,1,0

This place is really a 1.5 stars for me, but I'm going to round up for these guys.  The hostess in the front desk was pretty cool, but not the rest of the staff.  Sadly that is about the only good thing I can say about this place.  Now on to the rest of the review.

I visited this place because I was in the mood for some pho and happen noticed this place while driving by.  Dropped in and the first thing was the massive waiting line to be seated.  There were lots of people waiting outside too.  Waiting outside on a HOT summer day is not fun.  After 30 minutes of waiting, we were finally called and seated.  This is where everything started to go down hill from here.

We were seated and we knew what we wanted because we were looking over the menu while we were waiting, so we ordered a coconut drink, the regular pho bowl and spring rolls.  The server wrote that down on his notepad and just disappeared.  We waited for at least 30 minutes and not one single item we ordered arrive on our table.  We then started to notice people that were seated after us got their order and they were chomping away.  After about 40 minutes of wait time I was wondering how long it takes to make just a simple coconut drink.  Are they sending a monkey to climb up a coconut tree to retrieve the coconut or something?

We finally saw our waiter and asked him to check on our order and he returned back to us to let us know they were out of spring rolls, therefore they did not make the pho or the coconut drink.  The thing was, the server said it in a way where it was OUR fault that we ordered something they ran out of and that's why they couldn't complete our order.  I just don't understand how when they ran out of one item that is no way related to the other items on the order could prevent the entire order to be made.  It's not like it was a combo or something.  I understand if I ordered a #1 at Mc Donalds and they tell me they ran out of fries, then I would order something else, not make me wait 30 minutes and tell me they are out of fries therefore they can't make the burger.  I really wanted to tell the server to GTFO here cause there is no way you run out of spring rolls in a Vietnamese pho restaurant.  It's the second most popular dish right after pho.  Its like a chinese restaurant running out of rice.  This is a MEGA CATASTROPHIC EPIC FAIL.  

The food finally arrived after putting in our order the second time, but the coconut drink did not.  I was about to take off my shoes and go out back to get the coconut down from the tree myself.  The pho dish was OK to average at best!  After waiting 45 minutes of waiting I have the right to have high expectations.  The size of the bowl was really small.  I wonder if they gave us the kids size bowl by mistake.  I can't believe they charge $8 for this kid size bowl of pho.  I can get a bowl of pho that is twice the size for $5-$6 at home!  The coconut drink finally arrived about halfway into finishing our food.  The drink was meh.  

In the end, the food was average, but the customer service just left a really bitter taste in my mind.  People think it is a good thing that they are open 24 hours.  No guys, that is not a good thing, they are there to FAIL 24 hrs a day.  Would you like to go to a place that fails 8-10 hrs a day or 24 hrs?  I personally would rather go to a place that FAILS less.",0,2,0

The pho with brisket is yummy, but I'd like to try the pho at Pho So(which somehow looks better) to compare.

Drunken noodles here are great(any or all meats); so are the potstickers.

I dislike: the spring rolls(they always taste old and bland); the Thai tea here sucks, so get a... Vietnamese coffee instead. Or an avocado smoothie!

We were seated and our waiter not the warmest individual (but it's ok we were warmed up from the weather outside).  Anyway we were given water, ordered our food..it probably took another 20 minutes or so...then silence!  All you heard was chewing..we ordered spring rolls & crab rangoon for appetizers.

Then the real food came..walnut shrimp, crispy house noodles, salt & pepper pork chops, beef with eggplant stir fry, and garlic ong choy, and roast duck.

Pho Kim Long Time!!!

L2: ""We Go Pho Kim Long""

L1: ""Then where do you want to eat?""

L2: ""Heyoooo""

The name of the business could be a joke... or there really could be someone named Kim Long out there that makes pho... either way, the food is pho reals. I wish there was Chili Oil in addition to the sriracha sauce. The iced coffee is super strong.

HORRIBLE, RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, DISRESPECTFUL ""MANAGER"" 

I was just at this establishment (at approx. 2:30am) and it was just appalling. I have been here a couple times before and I wasn't expecting such horrible ""management"" skills from their ""manager"". The service staff wasn't so bad. Throughout the meal our cups were filled and they made sure everything was up to par. Everything was running smoothly up until the bill arrived. I was in a party of 4 and we needed a split check. We went up to the register to pay and it took a while for anyone on staff to assist us. Once we ask for a split check one server gave us a dumbfounded look and walked away from the register. Then another man went to the register and flat out said ""We don't do split checks."" 

*Sidenote*
I have been here before around the same time and they were able to do a split check without any hassle. 

I told the guy that they were able to fulfill the request last time but he said, ""Thats impossible, not without my approval"". He was very rude and when I was explaining this to him he was practically ignoring me and a my group while he was counting money from another party. Flat out ridiculous. He also charged my friend our whole check before we were told we couldn't split it and faked a void.

Its super popular with the locals and its menu is wide and there are lots of choices.  The menu is visual and multiple pages so you can actually get lost trying to make a decision.  It can be pretty packed in the evening,  and nearly impossible to get a seat in under 30 minutes in the early am after the clubs let out.  The staff is pretty attentive and gets food out in about 15-20 minutes after its ordered.  The dishes are served family style,  meant to be shared,  but i often eat an entire dish to myself.  I usually order the delicious spring rolls (cold),  the deep fried tofu pillows,  and either the seafood phad thai,  or the honey walnut shrimp,  which melts in your mouth.  I highly recommend pho kim long.  The fact that it is 24 hours, makes this a super useful spot to get your Vietnamese good fix anytime of the day or night!

First of all, it's in a plaza with like 90 other stores. And they mostly cater to the Asian community. So imagine a tight parking lot filled with Asian drivers. Yeah, you get the picture. 

Next, it's always so busy in there. There's no room to wait while you get called for a table, so people are forced outside. Fine if it's spring time, crap if it's in the middle of summer or winter. 

There's no warmth in the service. Idk, maybe it's just me, but if I'm going to sit down at a restaurant, I like the server to chat a little. Even just a smile, a ""how are you?"" would be nice. Nope not here. They hurdle you to the table, take your order, bring your food, then your check. Good luck trying to get someone's attention if you need something extra. On my last visit, it took about 10 minutes to waive someone down so I could put in another order to go. I see this place as a fancy fast food pho joint.

Now the food. The egg rolls are pretty typical. They are fried so you can't really mess those up. Pho broth is on the oily side, like you can see the oil floating at the top of your bowl. Noodles are stuck together like they've been waiting in the bowl for broth to loosen them up. My last visit I ordered seafood pho and it was so gross. The seafood was not fresh at all and had a fishy taste. And the squid tasted like it was on the verge of expiring. Their smoothies are pretty tasty, but stay away from the boba. It's mushy at first and they get hard as it sits in your cold drink.

The only thing they have going for them is that they are open way late and can cater to the night crowd of Vegas. I don't eat here by choice, only by the choice of others. I'd much rather drive the few blocks down and eat at Kihn Do.",4,2,1

It literally is THE BEST pho for the price in Vegas.  It is the closest to what my mother makes!! The broth is always nice and thick (like it should be in good pho).  I can tell they didn't skimp in bone marrow and beef when they cooked it.  The special always has an abundance of meat.  Perfectly sliced beef, not too many tendons, and one of the finer qualities of meatballs (yes there are different ones in the stores that are better in quality).  The meatballs, better in quality you will notice that when you bite into them do not have a lot of those little white fatty pieces (which are disgusting).

The Goi Cuon looks similarly and perfectly rolled like my aunt's.  They stay in shape bite after bite, without lacking in pork and shrimp on the inside.  Most I've tried around town are either poorly rolled, like they rolled the rice papers too tight so it rips when it dries (also an indicator of freshness).  Or...when you bite into one of these delicious appetizers, all you seem to taste is too much rice paper, then I'd feel ripped off because I feel like I got gipped out of pork and shrimp.

Nevertheless, with how big the restaurant is and how busy it is, the servers are attentive.  The service is fast (waiting more than 5 minutes for a bowl of pho is ridiculous since everything is pre-made and just needs to be put together).  There's never a ridiculously long wait for me when I go there for a table (please be respective of the number of people in your party and and what time you arrive).",3,0,1

The restaurant is very big and offers a full menu of lots of different kinds of Vietnamese\/Chinese food dishes in addition to the pho, which was a bit of a surprise given the name of the restaurant (I find most restaurants that have pho in their name are pretty limited to phos, rice or vermicelli bowls and eggrolls).

The pho was 3 stars, pretty good but nothing special.  Same for the eggrolls and the clear roll.

One hostess has very bad attitude. She would not sit us (13 people) at the tables which could fit us in. Instead, she would split us into 2 small tables where they could only fit 10. When we questioned about it, she went on and on like we, customer, must follow her bad lead. She talked to her manager. Finally, the manager could sit us in the tables which she hid it for other guests. Afterwards, I saw her talking about that to other staffs and they both laughed at it.

The service was pretty good. Our server tended to our requests in a timely manner and did what we asked. The food came out on time, too. However, the quality of the food was mediocre at best.

I started with the fried calamari. It was drenched in salt. All I could taste was salt. I was a little ""salty"" when they did this. The plate also had shells of fried batter that did not have calamari. In fact, half of the plate was fried calamari and the other half was fried batter. This plate is probably for people who REALLY enjoy salty foods and have a small craving for calamari.

Now, onto the entree, the pho. I ordered the Pho Tai (rare thinly cut beef) Bo Vien (meat balls). The broth and noodles were average; they did not have me jumping out of my seat because it was delicious nor did it have me throwing up because it was awful. The Tai, on the other hand, was pretty good. It was what I expected it to be, easy to chew and flavorful with the hoisin and Sriracha sauces. I wish I could say the same about the Bo Vien. They were the worst meat balls I have ever had at a vietnamese restaurant. I ate one meat ball and put the rest of the meat balls on a separate dish to be thrown out later. It seemed like the meat was processed with plastic. It had no consistency and quickly broke in your mouth without even chewing. It was absolutely disgusting.

As a final thought, I think you would be best trying something else other than the Pho Bo Vien.",1,2,0

My friend and I were there for fun and we were craving some comfort food--her current obsession was Pho, literally once or more times a week. I also am a big phan (aha!) but living in SF, I'm more accustomed to Ramen places so I was also pheeling in the mood phor it (alright, I'm done). I wasn't super in the mood for anything really since I had food poisoning from 2 days before, but I figure the soup would help easy all of the quesy-ness

You can't get to this place easily via walking. Sure, on the map it's like 1ish blocks away from the strip but that is one long-a$$ block, more than 27 minutes!!! So we drove over, one block to Vegas's Chinatown which is almost basically a strip of places all connected with a long parking lot parrallell to it. The restaurant itself  is packed, (also supposedly open 24 hours) and whipping out pho every minute like they had a giant pool of it in the back. We got there at maybe 2pm or so and put our name on the list. Estimated 30 ish minutes so we went over to the Chinese bakery a couple doors down to buy some snacks to go and a little something as an appetizer while we waited.

Perfectly timed, we went back to the restaurant and within a couple minutes we were seated in the still busy, still crowded restaurant. There were even more people on the waitlist now than before! Talk about late lunch....

We ordered and pretty quickly got our food--I took a small combination pho and my friend took the larger with just the flank. It was pretty good and really did sooth my tummy just a bit. The small is actually quite a lot so I'd recommend that unless you're sharing with someone else and taking a couple other dishes. Everything about the Pho was good, the meat, noodles, broth. It was a solid choice. I don't necessarily know if it was really *special* per say but for the price and amount and the speed, it was perfect and beats any other place we ate at in Vegas.

Service is a little slow since there's so many people. When we finished, we waited AGES for them to bring the check, and then another couple of ages before they brought the card back with the receipt to sign. However, for about $12 a head, it was great and I'd definitely recommend it.",0,0,0

Even though there are a lot of pho places around, the competition didn't improve the taste of the pho. I barely touched my bowl because it just tasted bad. I like the egg rolls and dumplings. I have had dinner here several times and most of their items are tasty so its depressing that their pho is crap. 

As far as authenticity goes, if you go back to Vietnam you have to eat on a little table with flies every where if you want real pho.

They give you the usual plate of veggies on the side, but their veggies are not fresh enough and the plate is almost entirely bean sprouts (not enough lime, jalapeno, thai basil, etc).  Their fresh spring rolls were not good, they fried the tofu in them and wilted the wrapper (ugh!).  Do not come here if you are vegetarian, they have literally nothing on the menu (no veggie pho, no broth that is not chicken or beef, tofu spring rolls were special order).  Also important to note, this place is not authentically Vietnamese- their hot and sour soup was not the clear vietnamese style with pineapple but the chinese style with dark broth.  What is up with that?  Thai tea was mediocre, doesnt compare to anywhere in the area.  Service here is off the charts bad, I am talking waiters that are actually rude (not just neutral).

But if I don't share this experience, I'm not being true to my Yelp self or my fellow Yelpers out there. Every restaurant has a bad night and I have been going to Pho Kim Long since before moving to Las Vegas. The service is efficient and the food always delivers, whether you are there at 7pm or 4 in the morning. But recently I had an experience that has put me off of my beloved go-to spot possibly forever. 

It all started on a busy Friday night around 3am. I had a craving for some Pho after work. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table because they were jam packed, slammed, crazy busy. No problem. I get it. Not the end of the world. 
However, once we were finally sat all the way in the back in a corner, nobody came to take our order. There were servers, bussers and runners all scurrying around us too busy to even take a beverage order. The first 10 or so minutes I can forgive but when I actively am trying to flag someone down and literally every employee refuses to make eye contact, even I start to get frustrated. We became the table that time forgot. 

15 minutes...20 minutes go by.
25 minutes in and we still don't even have a glass of water. We have now been at Pho Kim Long for a total of 40 minutes with nothing to show for it. But I refuse to be that person who makes a scene and leaves, so I wait it out. 
I FINALLY flag down the guy bussing the table next to ours and he brings us some waters and promises to send the server over. She comes over looking rather (understandably) bedraggled and we very politely put in our order after explaining our situation. She offers no apology and acts as if it's not a big deal. So I'm a little peeved at the lack of reaction. But my pho is on the way and my stomach is growling. 
My beautiful bowl of soup is placed before me and I turn my attention away from the negative experience and grab my chopsticks. And then I see it...gently floating amongst my rice noodles, swimming in my delicious broth without a care in the world is...a...
COCKROACH. 

I stand up, push my bowl away and just point in astonishment and horror. My confused dinner companion sees what I am pointing at and flags down the nearest employee who proceeds to whisk the dish away before I have a chance to gather my wits and take a picture. So now we are both standing at the table trying to figure out what to do. NOBODY comes back over to inquire about us or make amends. So we look at each other, nod and start walking towards the front door. On the way I find our server and take her aside to calmly explain the entire situation and inform her that we are leaving. And I again get a complete non reaction. No apology, no manager. Just an ok and a bewildered stare.

Bun Bo Hue ($8.50ish): This noodle soup used to be REALLY good here. My parents wanted to come here specifically for it, so we ordered 3 bowls. The sauce they gave with it is SO yummy, better than the broth itself, unfortunately. This time, the bun bo hue lacked flavor. I was hoping for pork blood inside because that's usually how I see it served but nada. Disappointment this time around.

Pho Tai Sac ($7.75): Not bad! I ordered the small bowl and after 10-15 minutes of eating, my bowl looked like it had not been touched. It was like a magical bowl of never ending noodles! I didn't know how to stop it. I ate a little less than half and had to pass it onto my sister & dad to help me finish. Good amount of meat slices.

Been here twice and of the 1001 pho places in Vegas, this one inches higher than the rest, but still isn't perfect.

Food: I typically order pho with brisket, flank and tendon. Tendon is hit or miss in most Vietnamese places. Both times i've been here i've had issue with it, the first time i got one small piece and this last time i got several inedible hard chunks. The broth is quite good though. I also get a Vietnamese iced coffee. I am used to it coming in the drip brewer at the table and pouring it myself, its kinda fun, but here they brew it in the servers station and deliver it in a styrofoam cup. not a deal breaker, but i like doing it myself.

Service: Good. There is usually a wait to get in because of the popularity but there is ample serving staff and i never feel like i'm invisible or ignored. English is a second language for most of the staff so communication barriers exist but can be overcome with patience.

Atmosphere: nice place, nothing major to note.",0,1,0

Unfortunately, we were seated in a corner near the bathrooms where we were easily forgotten by our moody waitress. The time it took to track her down to finally order did award me the opportunity to view the beautiful interior decorations though; lots of faux wooded pieces, tree and plant life!  

I did finally go with *#23, vermicelli with charbroiled pork & egg roll* for $9.95. This comes with a giant bowl of fish sauce with no shredded carrots or daikon. Bowl of noodles I did eventually receive was actually rather large, but somewhat deceivingly. Mine had a decent amount of meat and sliced up egg roll with crushed nuts and chopped scallions on top, but there wasn't much noodle. Just a bunch of shredded cabbage underneath. The actual presence of vermicelli noodle in a bun is rather important to me. Thai tea for $3.50 also a bit 'meh', but welcoming on a hot day of death.",10,7,10

I ordered the combination pho and it came out very quickly.  In my mind pho is all about the broth. Broth is a make or break thing and a good pho will have those amazing multiple layers of anise, coriander, fish sauce etc. this broth was missing something. Couldn't put my finger on it, but the broth did not have the flavor explosion I am accustomed to in pho. I wasn't bad per se, but I've had waaaay better pho. Bland. 

The service on the other hand was terrible. I almost walked out of the restaurant because the server helped two other tables that came in after me and still had me sit there for 5 minutes after.

Ok enough of my overly Pho tastic experience. The place seems to be busy at 2am on a weekday so it must be fantastic! Especially if you see other Asians eating there. That is always a mark of a great restaurant when locals are enjoying the food. Service was ok, we did have to try several times to get ahold of our waiter for water or to give us our check but that's understandable when your taking care of several tables at one time. 

Definitely a new stop while visiting!",0,0,1

I had the ""pho"" (beef noodle soup) which was a little bland and my husband had the ""bun bo"" (beef with rice vermicelli soup), Husband said, it was so tasteless and flavorless.

After we received the pad Thai, it took at least another 10 minutes for our pho to come out. Everything tastes okay.

I ordered the beef balls pho and the menu said it was $1 for an additional topping so I asked for rare steak on the side (not knowing there was an additional charge for having the meat on the side in the first place) It was a regular bowl and when the bill came it was $10 dollars.

For Thanksgiving dinner, the fam decided we had enough of the buffets and went traditional.  My mom remembered coming here a couple years back and had to come back here for dinner.  (With a myriad of choices, she chose this place!)  Rightfully so, the place was packed and bustling when we entered!

Now, coming from California and the east coast, I have had the extremes of great and worst Vietnamese food.  However, here, they fortunately were in the middle.  I didn't order the pho (I know, bad Vietnamese girl!); rather, another  traditional favorite, I ordered the Vermicelli noodes with pork and egg rolls (translated from above; don't be too impressed, that's the extent of my writing in Vietnamese: just foods!)   :)

It was good--all the fixings of lettuce, mint and basic with bean sprouts and cucumbers.  I enjoyed the prompt service there as well.  The staff isn't all Vietnamese, but they were friendly and speedy. :)  Downside, I think they truly specialize in just Pho, but created at 'Vietnamese diner' style menu, meaning there was just about every Vietnamese dish on the menu and included some Thai dishes.

A quick cab ride away from Aria, roughly about $12-13 or so without tip. Located in a plaza or square, but we didn't look around and went straight for business. The windows\/doors were darkened so you couldn't peep inside. Once you walk in you will realized this place is rather big, and set like a Chinese seafood\/dim sum restaurant.
Had to use the restroom, and they have automatic flush. I don't believe I have seen this at any Asian restaurants before! And the bathroom had many stalls and was actually clean. BIG BIG PLUS!
Food came pretty quickly. I ordered cha gio (egg rolls), 4 stars. Sorry no pix as it was far from me since we had a large group. It was mighty tasty with a variety of fillings. 
Pho bo vien (beef ball pho) - 4.5 stars! I think that was about $7, so it is a little more pricey than your ghetto places, but I think I would rather spend extra money for clean, good food. Soup tasted yummy and authentic, and the regular bowl was actually not too big for me for once. They gave you plenty of bean sprouts, basil, limes, and jalepenos so you don't have to fight your friends...... PLUS!
I tried my friend's potstickers, they were crunchy with a pork and veggie filling. It was juicy and tender on the inside. The sauce that accompanied it was well seasoned. It was seasoned soy sauce or something with spring onions. YUMMMMMM.

Food wise i would say this place could do better, but it's not bad. The only problem i have with this place is when I ordered a Large Pho Tai i was given only 6 slices of meat (lol a large and all you get is 6 slices of beef??)

The prices at Pho Kim Long is a bit pricier than i'm used to for pho (around $8 a bowl), but since we were in Vegas I wont be complaining that much on the price

After a hard night of partying, my girlfriend and I decided to stop here for some late night recovery at 5am.  Keep in mind that we are both from Orange County where the pho is probably better than in Vietnam's.  There was a 10 minute wait and the restaurant was packed and busy.  You gotta love the bouncer looking dude who signs you in to be seated.  Chatted with a few drunks and finally got seated at a thankfully corner table away from most people.  My girlfriend went for their hot and sour soup and I went for a pho bo vien.  My girlfriend's hot and sour soup came out in a huge bowl and was very good.  It was perfectly season, flavored, and full of ingredients.  My pho was good but the bo vien (meatballs) took me off guard.  They were very soft compared to ones I am used to.  It gave it a weird texture.  Overall though it was decent.

It's about $8 for a bowl of pho here.  I liked that they had plenty of other items on the menu besides pho.  Service was basically like any other Vietnamese restaurants.  The inside is large and nothing fancy.  However, it's one of your only few options for pho late in the night.",39,27,35

- Open 24 hours- this is a great selling point. Sometimes at 11:00 pm, after a really really long day, or 3:00 am, perhaps at the end of a night out, a bowl of pho just hits the spot. 
- Rotating specials (e.g. this week included salt and pepper eggplant, szechuan eggplant, and pork buns.)
- Drinks include thai tea with boba and soda with preserved lemon

Cons: 
- The service was really pretty terrible. Water came quickly, but after that it took a while to get other drinks and about 20 minutes to get our check (after asking three different people). It would have taken longer, but we got up to go pay. They were pretty rude about it too, telling us it had only been 5 minutes. 

In-betweens:
- The pho was okay, although the broth was on the bland side, and my rare steak was faaaarrr beyond well done by the time I saw it. I would recommend ordering the rare steak and brisket, with the steak on the side. This will keep it rare when you add it to your pho =)",1,0,0

It's the fact that I've come here after the club - faded - with a bunch of friends who want pho! To me, it's not the best broth but it'll do.

The flavor has been okay every time I come back and with appetizers being ordered that taste kind of bland, it doesn't allow me to give more stars.

The broth is what makes the soup. The noodles are basically the same at every pho spot. The added protein, white onions, green onions, thai basil, lime and sprouts are all additions to the pho. The broth flavor has to define itself and that's how I decide which place is better than another and it's just okay over here. Actually better when you're super faded - lol!

It was really cool for a while to replace this place with newer, hipper places but the truth remains: this is the go to at 2AM on a cold winter night! That's the latest I have come here, though. I have heard that anything between 3AM - 5AM is hell. The lines are long, all the customers are people that go clubbing, and the atmosphere sucks. I can't speak to that, it's just what I heard! I'll stick with my latest being at 2AM, thanks. 

I don't wander when at Pho Kim Long. No experimenting for me! I know what I like from this place and I get pho tai with spring rolls and water. Boring? Predictable? Maybe! I'm okay with that, Phi Kim Long is a staple not an adventure.",4,0,4

So now on to the food. I got the spring rolls, which tasted fresh and better than average. Then got my combination pho with rice noodles. The broth tasted really good. Just added a little bit of the hoisin and sriracha sauce to give more kick. Service was also fast.

Yet, our server kept rushing to and from our table without so much as eye contact. And I noticed all of the other servers treating the other patrons the same way.

We ordered our favorite app, calamari. It was so over-breaded it was almost comical. A lot of the bites I took didn't even have squid in it.

Pho Kim Long has been my go-to for pho for the last few months for my lunch breaks. I like how their service is quick and the food comes out quick. Lots of people waiting for a table? No worries. The wait is never that long. Their take out is also quick. Therefore, I could get a good meal in before my lunch break ends. 

I ONLY come here for their pho and fried egg rolls. I don't order anything else other than that.

I typically order the pho tai, which is the pho with rare steak. 

The consistency, however, is not always there. Sometimes the broth is good, but sometimes the broth is really watered down. 

Best part of Pho Kim Long is that it's open 24 hours. Late night clubbing and got hungry? No problem. Pho Kim Long it. Late night hotel party and got hungry? No problem. Pho Kim Long it. Late night drinking and got hungry? No problem. Pho Kim Long it. Shitfaced and hungry? No problem. Pho Kim Long it. HAHA You get the idea!

There have been many incidents but this last one bothered me a lot.

Usually me being the foodie, I order the food... My daughter had to use the restroom and I didn't expect my BF to order but he did and mistakenly ordered beef pad thai instead of chicken. 

Nothing allergic, just a preference... I'm usually not picky and I am behaved until treated with disrespect that I know I didn't deserve...

My daughter and I weren't in the bathroom long because as soon as we got out and walked back to the table the server was leaving our table from taking the order. I flagged down the closest staff member to correct the order and this guy gets mad. Pissed off to be exact, a highly unexpected attitude. I thought maybe... 'He's just having one of those days...'

Now, for starters, I'm in the culinary industry for a living and I know how the kitchen works, hospitality and understand how irritable it would be to have to change an order once it's already rung in and we started cooking it... We literally just took the order and the place was decently busy... 

In the politest way possible I asked: ""Excuse me? If it's possible to change the pad thai to chicken instead of beef. We ordered beef by accident"" 

he said ""chicken pad thai?! you ordered beef pad thai""
Me: ""I understand if it's too late to change that's fine""
He points his finger at me as he said something angrily to where I didn't understand him because he was walking away and hits the wall... The people next to us on BOTH sides of us heard the whole conversation. 

He literally points, walks away, smacks the wall as he turns the corner and comes back and tells me ""it's too late to change, you ordered beef and it's already ready""

Just watching him, his attitude and how fast we ordered, him walking to the kitchen to check and come back telling us our food is ready before our appetizers, I knew he was BS-ing... I then asked him ""if it's already ready, how come you didn't bring it out?""

He walked away saying that we had to wait... I found the guy that ordered our food and asked nicely if it's too late to change it. 

Our server said ""yea that's ok, I just put the order in not too long ago... I'll go change it real quick before it is made"" As I was talking to the waiter, the other staff member who was rude to us, saw us talking to the server and came and started another scene, one which wasn't needed, I didn't mention the other server until he started the scene. He started yelling saying our food was ready and that we ordered beef. Luckily our server was very calm and spoke to him even though I didn't know what he was saying, I felt VERY uncomfortable not understanding what they're saying and him pointing his hand towards my BF and making my BF upset. 

Our server apologized for the fellow coworker but found it wrong for someone else apologizing for someone else's doings.

They rave about it and it's authenticity and that it's open 24 hours.  Their rating on it is exactly why I took my girlfriend out to it after a night at a ballet.

It was a Saturday night, and we were promptly seated.  I was happy about this, but they sat us at a nearly 8 person round.  Kind of odd and peculiar, but we were hungry so the size of the table didn't bother us.  We started with spring rolls, a favorite appetizer of hers.  They were good.  Hard to mess those up, and I can say they didn't do that.

Our waiter became the center of attention during our private conversation.  He didn't say much, just got our order and left.  He essentially threw our drinks and Pho down when he served it.  I know it was a busy night, but he just seemed completely disinterested in his job.  Several times he came to our table to fill supplies at other tables with customers.  He'd grab five or six spoons from our table, and put them on another table.  He took some chopstix and fill the empty holder on another.  Eventually we overheard others also noting his absent charm.  Where they found him to be a waiter is beyond me.  He should be retrained on how to do his job, or be demoted to customer.

Our Pho was eventually served to us and we both began eating.  She ordered the chicken and I ordered the brisket.  As far as flavors went, I didn't notice anything out of the norm.  Neither did she.  I finished my Pho, and she asked for a to go container.  When she asked for it, the busser sarcastically joked and said it would be $5 and just for that I felt compelled to tip beyond the lack of service.

She got the container and we left.  She noted that the waiter, seemingly looking for a larger tip he didn't earn, when he picked up the bill flipped us off upon our exit.  Very classy for an establishment named after a sexual innuendo.

When she went to have the remaining Pho at our home, SHE FOUND A WATER BUG FLOATING AND FLICKING ITS LEGS ACROSS THE PHO bouncing its body off of the container's inner foam walls.  To the trash her pho went....as well as their reputation in our household.",0,0,0

I got the Pho Tai (pho with thin beef slices), and requested that the beef come on the side so that they weren't cooked well done in the broth by the time I got to them. The broth was really good (above average, I'd say). Ironically I put the slices in the broth a little too late, and my last few pieces wouldn't properly cook because the broth was no longer hot enough. I asked for a little more broth too cook those pieces, and they happily obliged (probably with a chuckle, knowing the amateur mistake I made). This pho tasted better usual; to be fair, it could've been because of the previous night that I had, but it was delicious.

I also recommend ordering a fresh young coconut to drink. They give you a coconut with the top cut off, and with a straw to drink and spoon to scrape off some of the meat. Quite tasty!

One thing I was a little disappointed about was that they added $1 to my meal because I asked for the beef slices on the side. I know some other places do this, but it doesn't mean that it's cool to do so.

In the past I enjoyed super fast service and everything seemed to be running like a well oiled machine.  On the night I last tasted their delicious pho the machine had thrown a gear, and was stumbling on at 76% efficiency.  
 I would be in the wrong to rate this restaurant on one experience, but I feel that this restaurant has been going in a bad direction for a little while now, and tonight was the culmination of its backwards inertia.  Although the food in not in question as I think its still great tasting and fairly cheap for what you get.  Service counts, and because its never been stellar per say (the waiters are quick but not friendly), any small change (like to speed lets say) can turn a great place, to just an ok place.  One thing I noticed was the overall disconnect from the workers and front of the house management.  The place wasn't that busy and we still had to put our name on a list to be seated for some reason.  In the past this place would be packed to the gills and we would be seated right away, no problem.  Tonight we waited to be seated for 15 minutes even when it was relatively empty.  This seemed to make the workers who were standing around looking helpless and angry.  At one point I could see them pointing and talking about the host, and probably not in a good way.  Once we did get seated the food did take a little bit longer to come out mostly, I believe, because they were busy talking about the host.  
 When the food did come it was great as usual, and in all truth is actually one of Vegas's great late night eats.  Now I understand you have to take a place based on what it is, and appreciate that.  What is Pho Kim Long?  Well it's great Pho when you're out late on a Vegas night.  If you keep that in the forefront of your mind, you will enjoy it and forget about its faults.   However if you are taking this eating establishment as a whole, as I am trying to right now, then its shortcomings become apparent.  The truth is Vegas does have a ton of Pho restaurants some with better tasting Pho, and others with better service.  In the end you can call Pho Kim Long average with room for improvement, and you would be fair in saying that.

Ugh, unfortunately, I have to say that the folks that run this place ought to be ashamed of themselves. 

I already had a bad taste in my mouth even before walking in after seeing the large banner advertising that this establishment is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas. 

We waited approximately ten to fifteen minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad after hearing of the epic wait times for a table here. 

It wasn't worth it. The pho was extremely unimpressive, with a cheap tasting, salty broth that rendered my friend and me overly thirsty for the next twelve hours. The rare meat tasted as if it were ""improperly aged,"" as I like to term it, and was not fresh at all. Honestly, if it weren't for the dish's soft tripe, I would have given this place a one-star review. 

The pork chop that my ""aunt"" ordered was greasy and dry at the same time. I didn't think that was possible. It seemed like it had been recooked twice over. 

To add insult to injury, the basic tea was priced western-style at $1 per person. I'm sorry, but this place does not qualify as Asian due to that pricing structure. Tea is part of the dining experience at any formal Asian restaurant. 

The service was cordial but average. 

All of the above being said, if I were to give this restaurant some advice, it would be to remove that silly banner. If you need to advertise that you are the best, it means that you clearly aren't or you already had plans to reduce quality and\/or cut costs.",1,3,0

Today they were attentive, polite, and efficient. We had like 4 people help us.

It seems with the increased business they're getting they took the time to improve the service.

-Portion size for the food was worth it. $9 for a bowl of pho that filled me up. Also, their $4 Thai tea also was worth the money! It was so good and was served in a huge portion. 
-Customer service was absolutely fantastic. They checked up on us periodically. We didn't have to waive them down, or ask them for anything, because they knew absolutely what we needed and wanted. They topped off our water, and even asked to top off my hydroflask.

Sometimes it was to feed post-clubbing munchies and at other times it was to nurse a post clubbing hangover.  Pho Kim Long was always one of the first Pho restaurants that popped up on Yelp when you searched it and in my less than 100% state I remember thinking it as pretty good.  But now that I'm a little bit older, wiser, and more sober when I eating here, it is more like 2.5 stars (I rounded up for the good blurry memories).

A bowl of Pho is right around 7.50 which isn't cheap or crazy expensive.  You can pretty much order any combination of rare beef, tripe, tendon, meatball, etc. that suites your fancy.  They give you a very average portion of everything.  One of the things that stops me from giving them more stars is their broth.  I feel that it is all about the broth; it is what makes or breaks a bowl of Pho.  I just don't find their broth to have very much flavor like other places.

Another reason why I can't justify giving them more stars is because their service is on the slow side.  I've been there on more than one occasion and even though they have lots of room and should have figured out a way to handle to their customer flow, I still always find myself waiting for really long periods of time for my food.  I don't really order anything fancier than a bowl of Pho so it shouldn't take that long.

My bf's water was refilled consistently. 

My first impression of the pho, ""this shit sucks"". Literally that's what I said after one bite. I can't taste the beef broth that is supposed to be cooked for hours to develop this deep flavor, added with the specific spice that gives pho this mouthwatering aroma. And that's unacceptable for a place that is opened 24\/7. You should be able to monitor and develop the flavor of your broth. The beef is cut so thinly, I was expecting soft and flavorful. Nope, I assume you have to freeze your beef in order to cut it this thinly and somehow they've manage to lose all the flavor from the meat. I felt like I was eating ""soggy meat"". Did that sound nasty to you? Yes? It was. My fatty flank, there were two pieces with decent fat on it that gave my one spoon of noodle flavor because I scarcely used any soup. The rest of my fatty flank was chewy. The meatball? NEVER. Like no. The taste was not utterly unbearable, but the texture was wrong.

The fact that the restaurant is open 25\/7 alone gives it brownie points as you never know what time of the day you'll be craving pho. 

It's a pretty popular place on the strip, and there is a wait whether you go for Sunday lunch or for late night drunk munchies during the weekend. The good thing is that the waits are never usually that long; service is quick and efficient. 

My go to items: 
- Kim Long Fried egg rolls; comes with a dipping fish sauce, lettuce to wrap the egg roll in, and pickled veggies to top it off 
- Pho with brisket only; tender and delicious

I've also tried and enjoyed:
- Rice Vermicelli with charbroiled chicken or pork + egg rolls; rice noodle topped with fresh chopped lettuce, fresh veggies, charbroiled meat and sliced egg rolls, also comes with fish sauce to add in
- Crispy calamari; salt and pepper, very flavorful, comes with a Mozzarella dipping sauce

It had frozen peas, carrots, mini frozen shrimps, and a miniscule scatter of boiled pork   slices, thrown into a pile of yellow rice. It was soggy and also lacked any flavoring.

Also, you'll like what happened there: 

There is a nice looking girl at the front (employee) that drives an expensive benz, and my buddy quietly said ""oh, that's a nice looking girl"". Nobody at my table cared and our conversation moved on to gambling talk. Then, the bus boy strolled up to our table and instead of asking if everything was alright, rudely said ""how do you know my fiance, and why are you talking about her"". I almost started laughing because a thought it was a joke, but the guy was mad. 

I walked up to the manager and expressed my concern, then I asked the girl why her fiance was bugging us. She said she is not engaged, and definitely not to the bus boy, lol. Then mysteriously the bus boy became silent and disappeared. The kitchen cleared out like there was going to be a fight, in fact the waiter called them up front like an old kung fu movie. It was disrespectful to all the customers, my table, the girl, and embarrassing to mgmt and the bus boy. 

What a weird place, I also think he might have thought we were talking about the girl because my fiend's name is genny and maybe that was her name, but what a bunch of foolishness. 

Either way, if you are not trying out for a kung fu movie where you have to fight the whole staff, I suggest going elsewhere. This is not the best pho, and they are not the best listeners. They are quick to judge. It smells and has bugs.

The pho was okay. I guess I'm spoiled because the pho in Denver is just amazing. What I didn't like was their meatballs, it had a really weird taste, like it had just been thawed from the freezer or something. The veggies that were served with the pho were definitely old.

Pho Kim Long has bad customer service.  It's expected, so I won't dwell on it.
The first time I came, I was with a party of 5.  One of my buddies got a hot bowl with cold soup.  How that happens,  I can only imagine.
I tried the Pho, I asked for egg noodles and got rice noodles.  I then asked the waiter where my egg noodles were he replied with ""Are you sure you ordered egg noodles?""

I was there just yesterday and I must say that the Pho isn't all that great.  I had pan fried noodles and I received a plate that was drenched in sauce.  When my pan fried noodles are drenched in sauce, there really isn't a point to order pan fried noodles.  
I've had the chicken teriyaki and it was okay.  Teriyaki Madness makes just as good of a chicken teriyaki as Pho Kim Long.

I notice this place is voted best in Vegas, however it must be voted by non asian people as this restaurant is full of non asians and even the asians that review this place don't give it a good review.",2,2,1

First of all, let's talk about the name. Yes, it does sound like something out of an R-rated movie...that's that, and now about the food.

PKL was the first restaurant that I ever tried Pho at--clear broth noodle soup with choice of protein, and lots of fresh herbs and vegetables. My favorite is the seafood pho. It always comes with a good amount of sliced calamari, shrimp, and some imitation Crab meat. I add some chili oil and sliced raw onion, along with the plate full of vegetables. And just like that, it has become my favorite hangover food. While eating seafood pho, I often order Charbroiled Chicken & Egg Roll with Rice Vermicelli to go for my lunch at work. The way they pack it keeps all the ingredients fresh and easy to mix when I am ready to enjoy it.

They are open 24 hours a day, so if you are dancing or clubbing all night, this is the perfect spot to hit on the way home, or fill up on some yummy food the morning after to kill your hangover. You certainly don't need a hangover to enjoy Pho Kim Long though...you can always come in just because, and have a nice bowl of soup for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Their menu is lengthy, so if you like something else, come with friends and share.

At any given time, this place is always packed - we even had a 20-min wait one time at close to 11pm!  But we endure the wait, which turned out to be not as long as we anticipated. 
My favorite is their Rare Steak and Brisket soup. The broth is full of flavor. I've tried a lot of different places around Las Vegas but no one has broth like they serve here. 
I also like ordering their spring rolls. It comes with sides of bean sprouts, mint leaves and lime and you wrap it with lettuce leaves. Yummy! 
On our latest visit, we ordered the Japanese noodles. We keep forgetting to order it every-time we come here and finally this time we remembered it before we were already full. It was really scrumptious. No wonder why almost every table we saw had ordered this as well. 
The fish stew was also delightful. The fish was tender and not overcooked. It was sautéed with ginger, which gave it a clean flavor. It was so good, I was conflicted whether I wanted to make more room for that or the rare steak pho that I usually order. I ended up eating the former and took the rest of the latter home. 
As for my 4 star rating, as good as their food is, I take away a star bec of their service. The staff isn't very friendly and most of the time, their service is lousy. Lousy service won't keep me from coming back to this place though - I would just ignore it and look at my bowl of soup and it completely makes up for it.",0,0,0

I mean really how many ways is there to make Pho? Had the Beef tendon pho, it hit the spot. Aside from the pho, they're ong choy (water spinach) was sauteed well, great sauce. Fried Calamari, was probably the best i have had, I couldnt stop eating it. and the roast duck had a lot of flavor, and you could tell it was made fresh, not re-heated. I can't seem to get a grasp on what type of sauce it was. the salted fish fried rice was also flavor, and you could actually taste the salted fish unlike other places (sam woo). these items are some of the same dishes I get at several asian restaurants just to compare, and the version here are right up there to one of the best i have had. 

Just to comment on people talking about service and such, I don't mean to be harsh, or offend the asian culture, because I consider myself asian myself. But the bad service? first these types of places is not a pf changs or a pei wei. they're not here to ask you how your day is going. they're just not, some of them don't even speak english. yes when they bring out the food to you, sometimes they rush, or kind of pack all the dishes on the table, looking like they slam the plates on it., theyre a little rough and maybe your oolong tea spills a little from your cup. you know what thats a sign of? that it's authentic. Some of the best places I have eaten at in California were like this. actually my favorite place back home, was like this, won't exactly strike you as fine dining and not the most polite servers but best food hands down.

We were greeted by a hasty waiter who gave an angry disposition.  They gave us the menu and came back a minute later to take our orders. It would take me at least 5 to decipher their menu. 

In addition, one of my friends and I ordered similar pho but with slight differences in meat. One was large and the other was small.  After they brought out our food we started eating. 5 minutes later they came back to say that our bowls were mixed up.  For one thing, there is no noticeable differences between a large bowl and a small bowl. Well no use complaining about that anymore.

The pho quality was somewhat substandard, salty, and lacked effort.  I know its Vegas, but there are many pho restaurants in the area and I've tried one a few blocks down Spring Mountain that actually has tasty well made broth.  This place did not give a lot of meat either.

It does get very crowded and busy during lunch hours and parking can be tough sometimes.  Expect a wait when you come during lunch hours.  They have a full menu of dishes, including rice, bun, and chow fun.  But I always order pho every time I come.  The broth is tasty and super hot (just the way I like it).

Eventhough I've had better Pho, I'm a creature of habit when I'm needing comfort food. Pho Kim Long is open 24\/7, and both times I've dined after 1am. They were very busy both times. The Salt and Pepper Calamari was a suggestion from my waiter. It was the bomb! I decided to try the Pan Fried Cake with pork and shrimp. It comes with a heaping bowl of lettuce and fish sauce. I didn't know what to do with the lettuce. The bus boy was helpful and very friendly. We were never asked what we wanted to drink. At least we were given water. I had to call the waiter over to order a drink half way through the calamari. I ordered coconut juice which came in the coconut. I didn't have time to enjoy the generous portions of calamari and pan cake. The waiter rushed the two bowls of Pho (noodle soup) and condiments to our table. I wanted to order a dessert but the waiter dropped the check and ran off. We were seated for barely 20 minutes and were being rushed. When he came back to the table I was going to ask for dessert but he didn't give me a chance. He said abruptly, ""Sorry, please pay."" RUDE He stood there as I dug my credit card from my purse. I felt uncomfortable. My friend asked for boxes for the food uneaten. on our way out the door I heard our waiter rushing another table of 6 people. He mentioned something about a shift change. Then it clicked. Was he more concerned with the tip? WTH? Unlike my soft spoken self, someone at that table didn't take kindly to being rushed. With other Pho restaurants open late to choose from, I think I'll try the other late night Pho restaurants from now on.

I am a vegan, and eating vegan in Asian cuisine shouldn't be an issue.  I never had a problem with it back home.  And this is Las Vegas, the restaurants here are supposed to be better than the shitty small town I come from.  

But when I asked for the Singapore curry noodles with no animal products, and only vegetables, what they brought out was a plate of noodles that had been mixed with curry powder.  No vegetables at all.  I sent it back saying ""There's no vegetables here, I wanted vegetables with it"", and they asked what kind and I said ""Just mixed chinese vegetables like you would put into just about any other dish, just no animal products"". 

They then brought me out another plate of just noodles and no vegetables, but this time a different kind of noodles. I sent it back again.  Finally, starving, I got a plate of noodles with some vegetables and I ate it even though it was below par.  

I don't know what is wrong with these people.  It wasn't that they don't speak english, because they spoke perfect English, no accents or anything, a lot of the people who work there are american.

The servers were all very nice but they did NOTHING after several groups and tables complained about them. It got to the point where this drunk table started to splash and hit my family's table and at one point picked up his hot soup and splashed some on my dad's face.

As a restaurant, it is their job to protect their customers and this was not protecting my family and the others that were getting affected by this rowdy group.

When you come in, you know it's a good Pho restaurant when 100% of their clients are Vietnamese and they're all here to eat pho. As we were immediately seated, they took our order of pho and egg rolls. Like any pho restaurant, their food came out almost as soon as we ordered. The pho broth was light and flavorful. Even the GF that was dying said that there was so much different types of flavor going on in the broth. They also gave generous portions of meat in the pho as well. I would say that their meat to noodle ratio was almost 1:1 unlike the other Pho restaurants that I go to in L.A. 

The price here isn't that inflated as well. A bowl of Pho ran 7-8$ depending on which one you got and the egg rolls were 6$. The egg rolls weren't anything special but they were skinnier than the ones I usually get.

It's located in the heart of Chinatown on spring mountain. Parking was a pain but we managed to get one (not like there's a lot of space in Chinatown). Walked in and the place was pretty busy, about a 10 minute wait, not so bad.

Once we were seated the waiter took our order. We got the flank and brisket pho with an order of combination fried rice. Since I had never eaten pho before my boyfriend made my bowl for me. It came with a plate covered with greens to brighten up the dark brothed soup. I did add everything to it and also added a few dashes of chili sauce to have a kick. My goodness, this soup was uh mazing. The broth was hot but not lava and they are not stingy with meat. The bowl is big enough for my boyfriend and I to share and so was the rice. The rice was nice also, had plenty of chicken and shrimp the order is huge. 

The check with both the rice and soup (drinks also) was under $25 how can you go wrong. Left stuffed but satisfied. Been here a few times more because no other pho joint has been this good. The only reason I took off one star is because the service is very slow and sometimes you have to call for someone to seat you or take your order.

I ordered the shrimp spring rolls. Sauce was very congealed. The noodles inside melded into one thick strand that was not very  appetizing or pleasing but had to eat because 1. I was hungry and 2. I didn't want it to go to waste.

Service: I have been coming here since 2008ish and it has slowly just gotten worse over time. The wait staff is always rushing you.

We got our food and halfway through our meal a lady came over and gave us our check, said thank you, and asked us are we done? My friend and I were both literally sitting with utensils in hand and half eaten plates of food. ""No... We aren't"" I commented to my friend under my breath about how rude that was and she must've heard because she came back and took the check away.

Food: the pho is delicious, all the rice noodle\/egg roll combination dishes are amazing. I mean I would walk on hot coals if their egg rolls were waiting for me on the other side.

I'm going to be honest.. This was probably one of the worst vermicelli dishes I've ever had (and I've had this dish at many restaurants). The chicken lacked flavor.. It didn't have that Vietnamese ""charbroiled"" taste. And more importantly, the fish sauce was bland!! It didn't taste right.. almost as if it was watered down or they didn't make it correctly. I ate 1\/4th of the bowl and ended up wasting the rest of it.

My friends ordered the pho and porridge, and they also left more than half of their food because it just wasn't good. Maybe because we're spoiled with Viet food from Garden Grove? Who knows. Oh, and service here does not exist.. Typical for an Asian restaurant I guess.

I can tell you that after a night of partying or drinking, a big bowl of Pho here really hits the spot. This restaurant is located in Chinatown just a short drive from the strip. Pho is certainly a healthy choice and a great way to keep hydrated out in the desert here. It  will also help warm you up on a cold day.

After taking a cab ride to a Wells Fargo location to pull some funds out, the cab driver gave the terrific recommendation of this place and I'm so glad he did. What a way to cure a hangover after a long night of drinking!!! This place is amaze-ballzzzz. Just to put things in perspective, I spent $40 for two people (tip included) on:

2 bowls of Pho
2 fresh coconut waters served in the actual coconut
2 iced coffees
1 order of egg rolls

Only Pho I've tried in Vegas but they know what they're doing. 

You'll be greeted by a huge Sea aquarium the type you see in MTV Cribs worth thousands of dollars. This place must be doing good business because the decorations inside are pretty hard core. They have another aquarium with a King fish and black and white Nemo's. Pretty awesome! 

The staff at this place is excellent at serving the customers. I think everyone that was working at Pho Kim Long (I can't stop laughing at this name) came up to our table (except the cooks). We had a busy table so you know how it is when people like to add picky stuff to their Pho... garlic, limes, extra mint, chili paste, nguoc mum, sriracha... etc. 

I ordered the Bun with Egg Rolls (cho gio) and char-grilled BBQ pork. The bowl was a bit smaller than usual but it was very well made. This is a simple dish but the key item is the noodles. Sometimes they are too soggy or they can also be too dry and sticky. This place had perfect noodles for the Bun. 

The servers gave us some Pho broth since it was so cold outside. Very nice gesture! Everyone had a small bowl of broth which was very good in flavor. However, if this is the Pho broth they use for every dish then I would avoid the Pho since it was a bit heavy in texture. I thought it should be more watered down. We had an additional order of fried egg rolls which was pretty decent, nothing fantastic but still good. 

Something unique about this place is their variety of Asian cuisine. They are obviously mainly Vietnamese but you can also find Chinese dishes and even Pad Thai. Very unusual in my experience. One of my friends ordered combo #108 which was amazing. It was similar to Bo Luc Lac but with bigger meat pieces and with excellent steamed broccoli. I'm getting #108 next time.

Again pictures do help especially if you're drunk, but the actual meal was nothing like the picture in the menu. The rice was super dry and the chicken was not good. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=yBVkwiixnbBbSMCEUaHOnQ

No doubt, I'll be back....and no doubt I'll be drunk again. But hopefully I should have my mental notes in place and some rationale fortitude to order the good stuff next time. Still, you can't beat the open 24 hours a day and family style dining in this Vegas off-strip restaurant.

We ordered egg rolls and lettuce wraps for appetizer. Both equally delicious and fresh. I got the pho combination and they fill the bowl to the very top. To the point where it's almost spilling.

It's a pretty big restaurant so it can accommodate your group of friends or if you just want to go yourself. We came with a group of about 20 and were seated in the back. 

The reason for 3 stars is that although they're open 24 hours (which is amazing), their food is okay. It was mediocre compared to the food I've had in LA and D.C. Where I'm from. I ordered the crispy noodle special that came with an assortment of meats and seafood. And I ordered calamari as my starter. The calamari was good with a nice crisp, I could definitely tell there was msg in it though. As for the crispy noodle, it was a small portion for the price I paid. Others who ordered pho waited a long time for their meals to come out. They got it after mine. I would think that pho would come out first, either way the folks who had the pho said it was not bad. But either because we were all hungover or just hungry.

We arrived a little after 2am on a Wednesday night, there was a line and I didn't mind. I'd have to say that's the only negative thing I encountered.

So for starters I ordered the Fried Potstickers and the Crispy Calamari. The potstickers were just perfect and full of flavor. The calamari I absolutely fell in love with! Fried to a perfect golden brown crisp, on a bed of cabbage and peppers with a cocktail sauce on the side. All the flavors were right and it made me want another order soon as I was done!

For entree I had the Roasted Duck with Peanuts and a sweet and sour sauce. The duck was seasoned and roasted to a tee and the sauce along with the peanuts and cilantro really connected all of the flavors as one. One of the best plates of duck I've had in a while!

I saw that it had a ""Best of Vegas"" banner and after I walked in I realized that my friend suggested this spot to me before. 

I went for a rare steak and brisket Pho. My honey went for a three meat Pho. We also ordered Sweet & Sour Chicken, which was my favorite item of the night and by far the best sweet & sour I've ever had. 
Back to Pho. I like soup. I like noodle in my soup. I didn't like one of the greens they used. It had a light minty taste, but wasn't mint. Whatever it was (I think they also brought it out on the side for us to add into our soups), it distracted me in a bad way. The leaves look like basil, but definitely aren't basil. Anyway, if it wasn't for that, I think I would have become a bigger fan of Pho than I currently am. The meat was alright. Tasted too bland. But again, this was my first Pho experience.

I checked the reviews on Yelp and they were mostly positive, so away we went!

We went on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm. I had read that finding parking was a nightmare, but the day we went, we found plenty of available parking. 

Upon entering the restaurant, we could see that they were adequately busy. However, we were seated right away and handed menus. 

Serving staff was on it. Within minutes we had our drinks and our order taken. We opted for the Kim Long fried egg rolls (chicken) and chicken wings with Kim Long Sauce for starters. My hubby ordered the #13 (Special Combination Tender Beef Noodle Soup) and I ordered the #14 (Rare Steak Noodle Soup).

Again, within minutes, our egg rolls arrived. Delish! Crispy, hot and served with lettuce, mint and shredded carrot mixture. Wrapped our egg rolls in the lettuce, added mint and carrot garnish and dipped in the accompanying sauce...awesomeness!

Next came the chicken wings. These babies were tiny!!! I guess because they were so small, we received about 15 of them on the plate. Even though they were tiny, the skin was nice and crispy and the flavor was great! I thought they would be spicy according to the chili pepper listed next to it on the menu, but these were more sweet than spicy. Though they tasted great, if I come back, I don't know that I would order them again. I didn't really feel like I got a lot of meat out of them for the price.

While we were grubbing on our appetizers, our pho came as well. I ordered a large and it did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the flavor of the broth. Wasn't salty and had a nice aroma too. There was just enough noodles and enough beef to satisfy me. I added plum sauce, 2 limes, sriracha sauce, bean sprouts and cilantro to mine. Hubby really liked his pho too. 

All in all, we will definitely come back. The pho was great, serving staff was friendly and very attentive. It is just a great place to kick back and enjoy some tasty food...especially on a chilly, rainy day!",0,0,0

I have been here many times and will write more reviews as time goes on.  One of the things that amazes me with this place is it is constantly upgrading subtle things within the restaurant the staff seamed happy for years but lately the natives are restless...  The staff almost seems stressed which I can understand because they have become too busy.   You can no longer walk in at anytime and sit down, they have a security guard at the door checking you in and taking you to the table.  The problem with this is he is not trained, at all.  We walked in and were ignored until another couple walked in and I spoke up and said ""oh we were next""  he replied ""oh""  I said ""do you have a check in list?"" he said ""ahh..."" I said ""why don't you write our names on that and keep track of all the people? :)""  I am never mean and rarely rude or brash, this was getting close to my breaking point.

So anyhow he seats us and man things happen fast from there it has always been fast but this was crazy fast.  Kind of stressed me out a little bit!  No greeting from the waiter just ""are you ready to order?"" ""No but we will have a hot tea and a water"" ""ok be back""  he comes backs and we felt we needed to be ready at this point, we ordered and the food was being served within minutes.   So a plus for fast food and a minus for somewhat unregarded service.

I had the very tame but oh so good Charbroiled Pork & Egg Roll with Rice Vermicelli (a cool salad perfect for 112 degree weather that evening (boy we are having a hot summer! :() My pork was perfectly done chared to perfection, my egg rolls were also perfectly done (but you can't really mess that one up right) my salad was fresh and my sauce was good as usual, however my noodles were stuck together and really hard to get apart to eat and mix into the rest of my dish.  I think this is a sad casualty of a really big and really busy place at this point. 

I am totally ok with hardcore asian waiters\/restaurants and what not but this place has TONS of young, hip and many races and no longer has the excuse of ""we are an old school chinese restaurant"".  You want your favorite places to get busy but not so busy they lose touch with what and who got them busy to begin with...

So I am giving stars for my food taking away for my stuck together noodles and taking away as well for the kind of crappy service from the front and the wait staff.  I will be back and will write about my next experience.  I hope this place can find the happy medium for making big bucks but remembering why and who you are making those big bucks from...",1,1,1

Now the bad: I felt that the noodles were a little thin, and the soup a bit less flavorful compared to the SoCal variety. However, I was sharing with a friend who was too afraid to order flank and tripe in the soup, so the absence of these delicious meats might have led to the unfavorable comparison.

Another thing about my friend, she won't eat flank\/tripe, but she'll order an avocado smoothie...as if that's not weird.

I got the #15 - steak & brisket ($7.50) - and added meatballs on the side ($1). The broth is soo flavorful, it actually tasted worse once I doused my soup in sriracha & hoisin sauce (my usual routine) which is pretty crazy for a pho place if you ask me. The steak is cooked with a little pink in the middle and the noodles are chewy, not soggy like a lot of places. It is a bit pricey for a pho place, but the quality is what you're paying for.

I honestly can't tell if this is one of the best phos I've ever had, or if I was just that hungry. I was planning on coming back on my last day in Vegas but it took us near 3 hours to get out of the damn speedway parking lot...

Upside was that the vegetables (bean sprouts, jalapenos, etc.) seemed fresh, and there was SO MUCH shrimp in my shrimp pho

Misc:
Price was okay ($8 for a bowl of pho, $10 for my shrimp pho)
Off the strip in an area with lots of asian food options.

But! Five stars because I used to hate Pho and this place makes me crave it. Service was good - everyone was friendly and the food came out surprisingly fast, considering there were a few parties waiting to be seated when we got there. 

Like the majority of soups ( or food? in my opinion), they are what you make of them. There's only so much a chef can do to the food until it's up to you to make it exactly what you want it to be. You like kick-in-the-gut spicy? You add it. You like punch-to-the-face sour? You do it LOL. So, after jalapenos, half a bottle of Sriracha, some weird dark purple sauce my GF convinced me was plum sauce (prune sauce?), four limes, and chili paste later, my soup was perfect haha. Not that it wasn't good on it's own because it completely was, but I added my own flare and this Mexican likes ~fuego~.

I guess my only ""complaints"" (for lack of a better word) are..

1. more napkins, please. one is not enough.
2. the shrimp rolls in that kinda see-through, jelly-like wrapping were SO sticky that I had to cut one off the plate LOL.

Other than that, I'll be back.",7,7,6

Their egg rolls are delicious, and they have a great com bo luck lac dish as well as their mi xao don. Most dishes are prepared quite well. My boyfriend loves their pho, but I am not a huge fan. It's not bad, it's just not authentic. It tastes as if they didn't have time to allow all the flavors of the star anise and herbs to get pulled into the broth itself. Probably because of their high rate of table turns. All in all, great food though... available 24 hours which is a huge plus.
The only reason I only give them 4 stars is because they lack customer service and caring for their patrons. They seem to be so busy, that they just want you to eat and get the hell out. Lol! I guess I can't blame them... to go is always a great option if you're looking for quality food fast with no customer service. It's probably best to get to go so you don't get offended or upset by their service.",0,0,0

I feel like you have to go off the strip in order to get good authentic Asian food, particularly pho. And you will definitely need your pho fix after a night of drinking! It's definitely one of my favorite hang over meals...I loved the flavor of the soup, and the meat quality wasn't sucky like a lot of other places.

Since we had a group of girls, there were a variety of other dishes that were delicious. Since it's been a while, tho, I can't really remember each dish...but here goes:

There was a stir fried udon plate that was really realy good. Actually, it's one of the dishes that we took back to the hotel, to-go...and later had as a midnight snack. I know, gross right? But hey, it was perfectly fine!!! No tummy aches...

We ordered the pea shoots for our veggie dish, and it complemented all the other dishes so well. It really helps to have a veggie dish to go with the meat-y, rich dishes.

The calamari (or maybe it was fried squid?) was nice and crispy, with lots of extra crunchy flakes on top. We probably over ordered here, but at least we got to try a variety of dishes!",1,2,0

Cons- I have never been served cold-to-lukewarm food before.  The soup was so cold that the beef in my pho was still lightly rare.

PKL is a place I've been frequenting since moving to Las Vegas 6 years ago.  This 24 hour joint offers some of the best Pho I've tasted.  On my drive over, my mouth salivated with anticipation for what was about to happen!

It's located on Spring Mountain and Valley View in a super long Chinese themed strip mall.  To me, this building signifies the beginning of Chinatown.  It says, I have arrived in Las Vegas' Asian scene and makes me feel right at home!  When you get into the restaurant, there's a pretty tight seating area.  The idea, though, is to have a lot for tables for dining.  The place is decked out with different tones of brown, Vietnamese and other Asian inspired design and art.  Statues of elephants and Asian soldiers gives an extra accent to the place.  Our service was a little sub par.  The server wasn't the most personable.  Didn't greet us.  Just came over and asked if we were ready to order.  At the end of the night, we literally had to walk up to him to get our check.  Thank goodness the food was good...

For my meal, I always, get number 15:  Beef Pho Noodle Soup with rare steak and brisket for around $8.  This soup is on point!  The soup is packed with thin strips of brisket and rare steak.  The rareness continued to cook in the warm broth.  The noodles were thin but plentiful.  There was also green onions in the dish, served with bean sprouts, sliced jalapenos and basil stems on the side.  All components offer a different but pleasant texture and flavor.  All seemed to mesh very well together.  But let's talk about the star of the show: the broth.  The broth is what sealed the deal for the dish and real brought a flavorful effect.  It wasn't too salty or overpowering.  It's was just right.  Warm and packed with beef flavor.  SO GOOD!!!

Not very good customer service if you ask me.. She then proceeded to our table and asked me personally what was wrong with the calamari and I may have been a little rude but I told her it was disgusting and she got mad and walked off..

After years and years of experiencing a multitude of underground culinary gems to the most decadent restaurants, I've come across a restaurant that was the catalyst to my finally making an account. And hey, I have 4 hours to kill before I'm back in Cali ;-) Unfortunately, though it was an appalling experience that lead me to officially being here, it'll certainly open the floodgates to my culinary soap box for the good experiences as well :)

Anyway, I digress.. I've been to PKL several times over the years, and it truly has topped itself in the degradation of service each time. I came here with my in laws, parents, fiancé, aunt and uncle, to complete our Vegas Christmas gift to them filled with cirque shows, spas, and enough slot machine pulling to make my mom grow a baby bicep. It was 830 am on Sunday, and the restaurant couldn't have been filled more than a quarter capacity. The PKL gentlemen in the front didn't even look at us and started walking us to the back where he threw a few menus down. I immediately thought it was rude, but figured he may have been having a bad morning. Moving on... 

When we were seated Raymond our server stopped by to bring some glasses of water. My uncle, who was tickled to be here, asked him what the gentlemen next to our table was eating, since it looked delicious. Raymond didn't even glance at the other table, and immediately responded ""I don't know."". So in jest my uncle says ""if you walk over a couple feet, you may have a better idea"". He tells us it's pho, walks away, and is no where to be found for the next 15 min. Finally I flag James\/Jason, the older server with  spikey hair, that we're ready to order. Agitated, he walks over to collect our order. Each dish we named, he responded with disdain and contempt. My little old mommy didn't know that one of the broken rice orders came with a choice of 2 meats, and he begins yelling at her ""which one do you want?!!!? I can do double meat!!!! Just let me know!!!"". Which was totally unnecessary since she must've been confused for no more than 5 seconds. I would've walked out right there and hopped over to lee's, but a couple of the parents wanted to stay since we already ordered most of the food. Needless to say the food was delivered by the same disgruntled James\/Jason. The food (pho, broken rice, clams, water spinach, tofu and pad thai) was served cold and they forgot two of the orders until we reminded them.  Annoyed that large parties get automatically charged 17% for gratuity.

They were about to seat us, but said the tables had to be cleaned and asked for us to wait. The table looked clean. While waiting I saw a few two seater tables open that also looked clean. A party of four came in after us and got seated. I figured maybe because it's a party of four. A couple comes in after for a table of two. Keep in mind we were sitting on the bench right in front of the door. The couple gets seated. The guy looks at us so we left. It was a slap to the face. My buddy also mentioned another party of two got seated before the party of four.",0,0,0

~10 min wait for 7 people, not bad I'd say. 
~5-10 min for food. 

#13 pho dac biet. The classic. Broth was nice and simple, tastes like pho ga broth out west. Noodles were nice and tasty. Meat was tender and flavorful. Didn't even need to drown this pho in sriarcha\/hoisin mix! 9\/10

Soda Lemonade... It's basically club soda with Lemonade, but they put sugar at the bottom. While drinking, I could just suck up some sugar and it would taste awesome! 9\/10

If only SF had a 24\/7 pho spot..

However, I think everyone else knows this too, so those days after clubbing when you're finally able to roll out of bed and your hunger finally outweighs your need to lay in bed and you think man I need some pho, best of luck to you on the wait situation. If you're lucky and it happens to be short, you are in luck! But I've seen the wait be up through 45 minutes before as well. Longest 45 minutes if you are already barely at the state of crawling out of bed. The restaurant is pretty big and has lots of tables and service is fast, it's just THAT many ppl want to get some. 

PHO: The broth is very well made, this is pretty much the defining difference between pho restaurants and pho kim long is near the top of the list. I don't like it when place don't rinse the starch off their noodles and makes the broth cloudy, none of that here. Good portions of noodle and meat, yes! Also, no crazy obvious msg taste, here we go baby! Path to recovering so you can go hard again!

I used to take good pho for granted, but having experienced some bad ones lately, I really appreciate those that stay true to the craft! 

LOCATION: If you are staying around the wynn\/venetian side of the strip, you just go right across spring mountain a few blocks and you are in chinatown, not too far of a drive to get some tasty vietnamese beef broth in your system.",3,1,2

The wait staff were friendly and patient so that's always a plus.  The facility was CLEAN!!  Now, that's something you don't see very often in pho joints.
I also ordered the che ba mau (three-color dessert) and it was just okay.  It was in a small cup and I was charged $3.50.  Kinda pricey, but, meh, I've had better.  I took my parents here (who grew up in Vietnam and are self-proclaimed pho connoisseurs) and they really liked the food.  Score!  I pat myself in the back.
