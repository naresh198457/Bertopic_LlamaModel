It's a really neat building with a great story, appealing to my love of things local, natural, and organic.  Although....however natural my grilled cheese and french fries were, I'm sure they weren't healthy!  Definitely delicious with the texas toast, and a chocolate shake to top it off!  The boyfriend enjoyed the BBQ Bacon Blue Burger and garlic fries, although I had to stay away from him after that because those were stroooong!  

I'm not sure it's a good place to go on a date, since yes, there were plenty of kids around and this was just a Saturday evening.  In fact, several were playing in the ditch as we went to leave.  I can only imagine a weekend morning.  Great if you have kids since there's lots of outdoor space to run around in, not so great if you don't want to hear it.  

Overall, a unique and pleasant addition to Gilbert!",3,2,3

One negative, the wait in line was long and I didn't understand the ONE person taking orders seemed very inefficient.  However, I did overhear that it was by design to keep the cooks getting the food out in a reasonable time.  Once we ordered, the food, 6 meals, was out in less that 15 mins.  We stood in line for nearly 40 minutes.
The pancakes were amazing, the four cheese omelet, was scrumptious!

I've never been to a restaurant like this before. It's actually a little hard to describe. There are two places to eat. There's a cafe and a grill. I'm really not sure if there's a difference. We were going to go to the cafe but the line was really long so we went to the grill. This required walking through the outside areas and gave me a chance to take in the whole place. There are community farm plots outside and several interesting outdoor eating spaces. The coolest was one around a massive oak tree. 

The restaurant is in an old converted house and some dining areas still look like a 50s-style ranch--which I think is pretty cool. Anyway, on to the food. I had the Huevos de Farm Grill which was good but not exactly what I was expecting. It's scrambled eggs with pulled pork, beans and fried tortillas. It was good but I didn't expect the pork to be mixed in with the eggs. My husband had the breakfast tacos and they were really good. Everything was fresh and delicious. Nothing tasted processed or fake. I'd definitely go back for the food but probably on a cooler day so I could sit out by the oak. The drawbacks are that you eat on plastic plates, which somewhat ruins the whole eco-friendly vibe, and the bathrooms are outside. The bathrooms are really cool. They have Barbie and GI Joe dolls encased in backlit shadow boxes. They really went for the 50s nostalgia. It feels like you're in a spaceship. However, I just really don't like going outside to use the toilet unless I'm sitting outside. 

Like I said, this was overall a great experience and I would definitely go back the next time I'm visiting my family in Arizona.",3,0,0

The vibe of the place is really special and unique, feels like you're at a private farm. The food was amazing!! I decided to order a salad just so I could sample all the home grown veggies from the farm. The strawberry lemonade was also top notch and came in a very large cup!

I drove by a couple times and then finally pulled in and just parked and walked around until we found the place. It's a bit hidden. As far as ordering, we told the lady what we wanted and paid, making small talk with the cashier and I told her this was our first time here (in hopes of her giving us a little knowledge on how they run things). She just kinda gave me a blank stare and nodded. Let me just say - if you've never been here, it's a little confusing how they do things. She handed me my empty cup after I told her what I wanted to drink and I just stood there looking around for a drinking station when finally I had to ask her where it was which then she finally thought it was a good idea to let me know it was outside? I also asked her if my sandwich came with cheese and such which she responded with ""umm I don't know. I think?"" And that was her final answer, she didn't bother to try and find out for me which then I had to ask ""well can you find out??"" A bit ridiculous... so for newcomers- just know that everything is located outside as far as drinks, condiments, napkins, bathrooms, etc. other than the unknowledgeable careless cashier, I must say the food is very good! I had the buffalo chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and both were delicious which is why I'm giving 4 stars.

The worse thing is breakfast. We went at about 6:30 in the morning and got the green chilie pork and scrambled eggs. As much as people blow things up these eggs were cold and overcooked. Plain and simple.

I have tried just about everything on the menu and have not had one disappointment. I tend to go back to the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, Southwest Burger, and BBQ Platter most often. I believe the BBQ gets shipped over from Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert. The portions are more than generous and complimented by some really good sides. No alcohol, but just eat and then walk over to 12 West for a beer, or Garage East for a glass of wine! Avoid peak times if you don't want to wait in line.

At Joe's Farm Grill, it could easily be the amazing ingredients. So fresh and flavorful, and you know you aren't eating some strange lab grown tomatoes. I love sitting outside under a GIANT tree, looking over at the Agritopia garden... Joe's definitely has something you don't find very often here in the commercial, cookie cutter East Valley.

Like Joe's BBQ, everything here is perfect it its own way. My favorite is the burger. Yup, I said it. Veganish me loves cheeseburgers here. I don't eat burgers often, but when I do I crave Joe's. The bun is amazingly fresh and soft, the veggies are top notch and the meat... The meat is melt in your mouth delicious.

And it's expensive (which means you pay too much for it, not that it's high value). I think I had a bacon cheeseburger, fries and a serve-yourself-at-our-outside-in-the-heat-fountain drink, it it set me back like $14.",2,0,0

My two cents are: we ate here twice in three days.
In the land of Yelping that says it all. 
There are millions of restaurants to try on vacation and why go back to the same one?
Because every single person in our party of four LOVED it.

This place can handle a crowd.  Don't let the line out the door scare you.
It moves quickly and is also a sign of the goodness to be had here.

My recommendations: sweet potato fries OR the sweet potato pie. Do not get both on the same trip. (The fries taste sweeter than the pie if you do that.) Both are insanely good.
The pie is veggielicious. You can tell they mashed those taters from Joe's garden today!
The Fontina burger also is ""the best burger I ever had"" and he got it on both our trips there. :)

We liked sitting outside both times. We got to meet exotic birds on our Sunday lunch trip. A man had brought several different species.

One order taker, and that's all there could be because there is only one window to order...another window where you pick up your food.  So, a long wait would possibly worth it if, and I mean IF, the food was good.  The Farm Burger was absolutely nothing to write home about.  5 Guys, Habit Burger and In and Out Burgers are dramatically better than Joe's Farm Burger.  The lamb burger was so rich, it caused my wife stomach distress for two days after.  The full rack of ribs was dry and the sauce was non-exceptional.  Garlic fries were garlicky, too much so and the onion rings were just onion rings, nothing new or better.  Sitting outside in the evening was chilly--they do not offer heat lamps.  Prices are on the high side, especially considering the quality of the food.  I have no idea at all why people wait in line for an hour or more to eat this food.  Just because Guy Fieri visited the place does not a great dining experience make.  Joe's Farm Grill is a phenomenon way past it's time.

The vibe is relaxed, and you go up to a window to order and then pick wherever you want to sit. There's tons of families and kids running around, so if you're not in the mood for lots of noise and kids playing, this might not be the place for you.

First, the physical facility, while quaint and has some nice history behind it, is just uncomfortable and very oddly organized (drink stations outside, other things inside).  The trash cans suck royally.  While I can appreciate the effort to drive recycling, having a trash can that has shapes for everything is just dumb.  It results in piles of trash near the entry of them and not good for when you take a tray full of garbage to the can only to have to find a place to set it down to sort.

Food -- good.  I think the burger and the pizza are probably my favorite here.  Oddly you'd expecte more carryover from Joe's BBQ as far as BBQ options, but there isn't -- didn't bother me though.  Sweet potatoe fries are great as is the dipping sauce that comes with it.

Shakes when in season with fresh berries are yum.  Desserts sound better than they are, so I'd pass and head to Nielson's if you want a dessert instead.

As a place for larger groups it stinks -- tables are crowded and small.  If you want to sit outside that may be fine, but the huge trees sometimes attract unwanted insects :-).

Overall okay if you are in the mood for something different.",0,0,0

The food is great. I personally recommend the BBQ ribs. The full rack comes with cole slaw, french fries, and 2 pieces of garlic flat bread. The rack comes cut in half, with 6 or so ribs per section. What I also recommend is to ask for a side of buffalo sauce. I pour the sauce over the ribs to make them extra spicy (don't knock it until you try it, it tastes great). I would also recommend the Fontina burger and the chicken fingers. 

There is more than enough seating inside and outside. Outside seating includes 2 patios along with park type picnic tables. The place is very dog friendly, and expect to see some dogs enjoying themselves just as much as the people.

My friend, son and I had lunch here recently. We got there at lunch peak hour apparently since the line was outside the door! It moved at a decent pace. We got BBQ chicken pizza, Farm burger with onion rings, kids grilled cheese, order of sweet potato fries and drinks. Since it was my birthday, my lunch was free which was a nice surprise. Food was ready in a timely manner. My friend enjoyed her burger, my son grilled cheese was very good, on thick Texas toast but the portion seemed small to me( half a small sandwich)  I mean, with childhood obesity kids should be eaten less, it was perfect for my 19 months old but I don't know for a 10 yr old. The BBQ pizza was good, but not blew me away good. I think I'll order a burger next time.
Sweet potato fries were good and the portion this time was huge!!! Didn't like the sauce they came with. 
Like others mentioned before, the layout of the restaurant make things a bit chaotic when is crowded.

Joe's Farm Grill is a great  desert gym. I had the Fontina Burger with the Garlic Fries and I literally dreamt about it the next night. I plan on going back to try the other items. The only negative is the lack of indoor seating. I would recommend staking out a seat before you order so that way you don't get stuck outside with the flies.,2,2,2

Food was never anything amazing considering the price but was decent and the ambiance and atmosphere was always pleasant plus my kids enjoyed the sights and sounds. Ate here a few days ago following the remodel and aside from a little more indoor seating was surprised to see nothing else had really changed. Still one cashier who was rude and some good menu items now gone. Also, did the burgers shrink or buns grow?  Food quality was rather lackluster. 

The worst change however was the absolutely horrific drink selection. The tractor soda is without question the nastiest stuff ever created. I looked around and 99% of people were drinking water or tea and anyone who tried the organic fountain drinks immediately dumped them out. Joes farm grill will survive off name and reputation regardless of my review but man what a disappointment it is now. My wife and I agreed the day we were there that there was no longer any point in going there and added it to our list of places we no longer need to visit.

We both had the Waffle and meat breakfast and a fruit (bowl).  A customer had to actually point out where to order because I was being ignored by all of their employees.  The fruit bowl for $2.49 consisted of a total of 6 or 7 small pieces of fruit and looked rather rediculous.  I wouldn't even mind paying a bit more for more fruit served in a larger food tray.  The waffle was tasty but they could definitely give you 2 because it cost $7 for 1 eight inch waffle, kind of silly.  There was also no available portion cups to dispense my syrup.  I was still pretty hungry when I left and usually when you spend $25 for breakfast for 2, you usually leave pretty satisfied.  The employees were pretty rude and unhelpful and look at you funny when you ask where things are.  Maybe if things were labeled and more obvious, such looks would be warranted.  After we were finished eating we wandered over to the farm stand to check out the fresh fruit and figs that were advertised on an A-frame sign on the street but to our dismay, there was no fruit (or figs) in the farmstand, in fact it was closed.

Only problem is there are a lot of dogs! We went there for mother's day and a party showed up with 10+ dogs and one of them came and stuck his mouth in my plate. They also barked up the place and it was a bit annoying considering we were sitting on the grass. Needless to say they were peeing everywhere just arms reach of our food.
I think Joe's should have a limitation on how many pets you can bring. Don't get me wrong i looove dogs and cats but sometimes it's just too much. turns into a petting zoo.

best decision we made since we moved here!
Heres the thing, the slogan they use ""Common foods done uncommonly well"" is spot on!

We both had the burger with chedder, heres the thing, there was no amazingly different flavor, no crazy spices, no insane toppings, just good, fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection with pride and a level of quality that you dont find very much, especially in a burger!
the bun is both light and substantial, and even the pickles are amazing (they make them themselves.. which gives you a clue on how fanatic they are)
On our second trip, we ordered the garlic fries... Holy jumping Jack Flash! If you like fries, and you like garlic, GET THESE!
Drenched in garlic, these are some of the best fries I've ever had!
The decor is fun and retro-futuristic (think tomorrowland 60's retro future, but someones living room)

We really enjoyed our lunch and checking out the grounds, and I hate to complain, but I did have 2 questions.

I saw it on Food Networks Diners, Dives and Drive In's and it stuck in my mind as a place that I wanted to try. It was a bit of a drive from where I was staying in Chandler, but it was totally worth it. Before stepping a foot into the restaurant, we fell in love with the grapefruit trees surrounding the building, such a cute area with a lot of outdoor seating. I ordered the special of the day, which was a grilled salad.  It was Romaine lettuce, topped with bacon, tomatos and blue cheese. Oh mama... so damn good. BUT what made me stop in my tracks was the GIANT slice of lemon- seriously it was almost as big as my hand. The salad was really good, and since it was grilled, it gave a nice smoky flavor but it was not over powering.

My only complaint is that we only ate their once.  They had plenty of items on their breakfast and lunch menu that I wanted to try.   I like that they use local ingredients when they can and look for healthy ingredients (natural beef for the burgers and transfat free oils)",3,0,0

The prices are pretty average (compare to Chilis), but like European restaurants, it seems the tips are included in the price of the food, as there really is no wait staff. The burgers were as good as we'd expected. The chicken tenders were of quality as well. The butter pecan shake was tasty. Most importantly, we left full and satisfied.

The kids had a blast running around in the courtyard, which allowed for us to enjoy our meal. The place is visually appealing, sort of blend of past, present, and future in it's design. Not sure if that was the intent, but those restrooms are very otherworldly, almost like being aboard an alien ship, with dolls encased in neon lit boxes in the walls, while Thunderbirds, a 60s television series starring marionettes, plays on a screen that can be viewed from the john.

And it was.... okay. 
I'll make this short: The food was okay, the service is fairly non-existent (because of the counter-style eating, which is fine). The atmosphere does save it a little bit though, because dinning underneath the beautiful trees and plants that gave your food substance is pretty cool anywhere. 
The place seems a little over-blown to me, and when I ordered my food over the phone the nice lady said there would be a 2 hour wait (which is just crazy, but I really wanted to try it anyway). When I got there and picked up my food, it was cold and soggy like it had been there a while, even though I was early. So on one hand the wait time wasn't as ridiculous as they stated, but on the other hand my food was room-temp. Maybe if they notice an order hasn't been picked up for 15 minutes they could call?

I first heard of this place through watching Food Network on Guy Fieri's show, 'Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives'. The onion rings that were featured on the show looked absolutely delicious. I also liked that the place was not too far from my house and everything they had came from their own farm- hence the name.

Upon arriving to the location, it was near a suburban community and right next to a little farm where you can pick your own vegetables. I was surprised at how green and cookie-cutter perfect the neighborhood was. There also appeared to be a lot of people since the paved parking was full and I had to go to the dirt lot. The place looked popular enough, so it couldn't kill to pave that parking space.

The architecture of the place seemed really funky, but fitting for the scenery. A huge downside though was that I came at the lunch rush so there was a line that spread all the way to the outside of the restaurant. That was my first indication that the place must be really good. However, after waiting 20 minutes, I was starting to doubt if it was worth it.

Boy was I in for a treat. I decided to order their 'Farm Burger' with bacon and mushrooms, which was an extra dollar for both and their infamous onion rings. Looking at how pricey things were getting, I opted for just a water cup. I was given a buzzer to notify me when my food was ready. I had the choice of sitting inside or eating outside, and I chose sitting outside since it was a nice day. On the side of the restaurant is a counter where you can get all your drinks, condiments, and dipping sauces. There was even a hand washing station where I could wash my hands, which was a huge plus.

I decided to sit underneath the huge tree in the middle. Once I was settled, I was happy to find that my buzzer was beeping and I could go get my food. Once I got my food. I realized that for the money I was paying, I was given huge portions. I put the vegetables that was separated in the burger and took a bite. Let me say that this was probably one of the next burgers I have ever tasted. Juices were running down my hands so you know it was good. I couldn't get enough of it. Finally once I got off my momentary food high, I took a bite out of one of my onion rings. I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy what seemed like Rosemary in the seasoning. I savored every bite to the last crumb.

Overall, it was a great experience. I want to come back and try their other burgers. They always seem to have a special everyday, so I want to try that one day as well. I highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a great family-friendly restaurant and fantastic burgers and onion rings.",1,0,1

My husband, daughter and I went to eat at Joe's because we saw a menu in the Hotel where we were staying nearby.  The Menu mentioned that the TV show DINERS DRIVE-INS AND DIVES had done a show about the place and indicated the menu items that were highlighted on the show that were supposedly delicious!

I called ahead for directions and was greeted with an attitude when I explained that we were from out of town, staying at a hotel that has their menu and needed directions to get there.  I assumed since the menu was in the hotel room that the employees at Joe's  would know how to direct someone to get there from the hotel.  After I explained several times the cross streets and the name of the hotel where we were staying, explained that we were just north of the 202 freeway etc and was just about to give up, the girl finally was able to give me directions.  Was that an omen of things to come??

The first irritation that we encountered was standing in line and trying to decide what we should order while there was only ONE cashier.   So when we did reach the window to place our order we could practically feel the irritation of the people waiting behind us while we tried to ask a few questions about the menu.  Feeling pressure to hurry up by the impatient look on the cashiers face we ordered a variety of things for the three of us.  The Fontina Burger, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and Fresh Beet Salad.

With the variety of what we ordered you would think at least one of the three of us would taste something we liked, but the only adjective that we could come up with for everything was BLAH.  
I am not exaggerating....we were all hungry and we are not picky eaters, but we just couldn't get a good bite of anything.

Also when I placed our order I asked for side orders of the onions rings and sweet potato fries but the cashier rang up full orders which I didn't realize since my husband paid the bill not knowing it should have been less.  Our bill for the 3 of us was equal to what we would pay at a restaurant with someone serving us!!  I wouldn't mind so much if the food tasted good but......  
TheFONTINA BURGER was cooked very well done (I ordered it medium\/well).  It had a very slight smear of pesto (so slight that I couldn't even taste it) with a few small pieces of mushy grilled pepper and the fontina cheese.  The burger was so unremarkable that I can't even remember if there were ""greens"" on it our not.  I would describe this burger as DRY and BLAH.
The ONION RINGS had such a crunchy exterior that it actually hurt our mouths to bite into them.  Besides that, the onion pieces were so thin you could hardly taste the onion.  It was like eating a basket full of crunchy fried breading.
The SWEET POTATO FRIES and the WHITE POTATO FRIES were also just BLAH....how can you mess up fries??  After some serious thought we decided it had to be the type of oil that they were fried in.  It was just tasteless.  Even salt and ketchup couldn't help these fries!  
The BBQ PORK SANDWICH was just okay as was the COLESLAW.  Not really much to say about them.  
The BEET SALAD tasted like dirt.  My daughter and I both love beets but neither of us could take more than one bite of this salad.
The PICKLES that they put on top of everything are just gross.  What they heck is wrong with just a dill pickle?  Why the sweet and sour wierd flavor combo??

There is only one DRINK MACHINE and CONDIMENT BAR and it is OUTSIDE!  So to fill your drink or get your napkins and ketchup you have to go out the door and stand in line then try to get back in the door while juggling everything.  Irritating!

More irriation came in the form of the FLIES swarming our table which made for a very frustrating time of swatting them off of our food between bites. 

We were all hungry but none of us finished our meal because we were just bored and frustrated trying to get a good bite.  We even tried to doctor stuff up by dipping our fries in the bbq sauce and adding ketchup to the burger but we just couldn't fix any of it!

We left feeling ripped off, vowed to never return and decided we deserved to stop for an ice cream someplace on our way back to the hotel to get that IRRITATING, BLAH, SWEET and SOUR, DIRT flavor out of our mouths.

PAY ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS would be my recommdendation to the staff of this place because everything really adds up or takes away from the dining experience.  We were overcharged, irritated by the set up, atmosphere and flies and we were still hungry when we left!  

I am submitting this review because I don't want other people who have never eaten here before to be fooled by the FOOD NETWORK show hype the way we were.  The only reason I gave two stars is because I like the ""farm fresh concept"" and wanted to give the place credit for that.",1,0,0

Joe's Farm Grill is pretty inconveniently located for me (I am in north Phoenix, Joe's is in southeast Gilbert) but every so often...it's worth the trip.

Joe's angle is that it literally is a farm, and much of what they serve is apparently raised on that farm. This translates into basic diner faire of outstanding quality.

Their burgers and fries are out of this world, and their onion rings are possibly the best I have ever had. Homemade cheesecake, lemonade, pizza, all kinds of things on their menu that you would see anywhere but much better than everywhere else.

The location is very clean, and if the weather is nice, their outdoor seating is gorgeous. Even their bathrooms are something to admire (you'll see what I mean)

I don't get out in that area much, but when I do, I always try to get out to Joe's. Highly recommended.",2,0,0

It is a walk-up window order system. Got there around 6 and the line was clear out the door. It took a really long time to get to the front because they just had one window open. 

53 minutes later and a free milkshake later we get our food. Something got screwed up with our order. Ughhhhh. Why me...?

Finally we eat. The fontina burger was delicious. Beet salad yummy. Sweet potato fries were average. Garlic fries, deelish.

The line can be a little ridiculous but I will say that it wasn't as bad because an employee came out and educated us all about the menu item's and the daily deals. Hence the Burger for Two, which really could've fed four!!  The deal also included side of fries, coleslaw, one slice of tomato (not enough for that big burger), lettuce, some onion, and a few bites of cheesecake. Overall it was all very good!!! Price was decent too, cheaper then us both getting two separate orders of burgers and fries. My favorites are the Farm burger, sweet potato fries w the yummy pineapple goodness it's served with, and the Date Milkshake!!! Not so good was the Chicken salad sandwich, it was just meh.

Same with the drink station.  Fill up your soda and move along, it's not time to experiment with all 32 beverages and fill 12 cups of ketchup and ranch while a line of 15 people wait behind you because your whole party is blocking the station.

I absolutely love their selection of foods.  Everything always tastes so fresh and delicious.  
In the past I used to constantly order the ""Buffalo Chicken Sandwich"" which is absolute heaven, blue cheese and hot wing sauce so tasty and not annoyingly spicy and the chicken was juicy not dry.   Get napkins for this one  

I recently switched back to being a vegetarian so this past visit I ordered the ""Portobello Mushroom Sandwich"" and it was really tasty, very juicy.  
Get more napkins for this one too!   

They seem to really know how to marry flavors together well and make fresh tasting, juicy, delicious food.

I also always get their garlic fries which are a dream if you love garlic as much as I do, their sweet potato fries are also delicious.  

I took of one star just because the indoor seating area has a lot of flies, it seems it's just due to the environment of it being a farm with lots of fruit trees so I think they just make their way towards the food indoors.. It's not from uncleanliness because the place is clean.  But I feel they can correct this buy installing some kind of anti-fly system.

I really enjoy their coffee, though sometimes it's a pain to wait for the only carafe available at one time. A suggestion would be to put out some kind of coffee bar like they do with the condiments bar and fountain drinks area (and have more than one carafe of reg\/decaf out). MUST COME AS EARLY AS YOU CAN because the lines will be outrageous, especially on the weekends!

Their fresh fruit garnishments are fresh and delicious and I do like the taste of their syrup and Belgian waffles. I'm not a fan of the piece of flatbread they put on the side when you order the meat and potato scramble because it's really just that - flat, but not tasty.

Apparently this used to be an old house turned ""Dinner"".  My friend kept telling us how great this place is, so we thought we would give it a try.  It's and interesting place but honestly wasn't much different than going to In & Out Burger (walk up - place order -  pick up at window).  It did have a few stylish décor items and kitchy concepts like the soda & sauce fountain station outside (next to the bathroom).   The food was pretty good but my friend got the pork dinner (Shredded Pork, Cole slaw, and he ""upgraded"" his fries from regular to sweet potato, and a drink) and it was over $16 so kind of pricey.   

The grounds are cool, because they have a coffee shop next door and it has a sort of  ""Retro"" feel to the whole place.   

There did seem to be a TON of kids there, screaming, etc but I guess that's because it has mostly outside seating, or maybe that was just the night we went.  

Would I go again?  Probably because the food was good, but just a little concerned about their pricing.  I don't mind spending money on food, but it just seemed overpriced for this type of establishment.",0,0,0

joe converted his old home into a fresh, order-at-the-counter style grub hut. the menu has all the essentials: ribs and pork sandwiches, chicken everything, hot dogs, grilled cheese...and sides galore. the fountain drinks and condiments are located outside (restrooms too!). be patient with the poor mayo. it comes slow, but steady.

i've only been here a handful of times, but so far: so wonderful. the pulled pork sandwich tastes just like the one at his bbq restaurant. the fire-roasted broccoli is a yummy side. i like to eat outside under the misters and soak in the children's laughter as they frolic to their heart's content. the farm grill has such a wholesome vibe. it's a good day in the neighborhood at joe's!",2,1,1

Didn't have much time and could only try one place and settled on Joe's.  What a treat!  I had the BBQ Bacon Blue Cheee Burger...Amazing.  My DH had the BBQ chicken Pizza.  Both were nicely flavored, not overwhelming but done perfectly.  We had a few sides...Baked Potato Fries and Onion rings.  Tasty.  Not overly greasy and great flavor.  We sat outside under lovely fragrant citrus trees as the sun set.

Blame Yelp for this review... I would have never found this attraction on my own!

Joe's Farm Grill is housed in a Tomorrowland-like building construction with Glass and Steel framing that was pretty popular during the 50s when architects during that era deemed the use of a lot of Glass the wave of the future. A ""get-it-yourself"" fountain drink dispenser is located outside the building... which makes it available for the people sitting in the outside Patio and at the Picnic Tables... but it's kind of a hassle for diners inside, that do not prefer the ""fresh air"". As I walked into the establishment... I was very surprised to see another Disneyland-like feature seen only at amusement parks...  a snake-like waiting-line area. I had to pinch myself... Where was I? Disneyland or Gilbert, Arizona? 

The actual Dining area is divided into two spaces... the front area has a dual function of being an ordering area and a dining area; there is also a rear dining area more suited for larger groups such as families separated by a see-through wall. 

First impression after ordering and being handed a beeper to notify us when our order was ready... Dang, it's HUMID in here! At 10am on a Sunday, with the restaurant only 2\/3rds full... the humidity was a little irritating... I would not like this place later in the day when occupancy reaches 100% and the temperature reached 110 degrees.

FLIES, FLIES... and more Flies!!! This was my second observation... In the waiting time for the Buzzer to go off, I had performed the following entomological analysis... You have two kinds of this nuisance at Joe's Farm Grill... Before you get your food, you get buzzed around your dome by these real-small flies that are attracted by your body orifices. Then... after you get your meal, the small guys disappear and then you have to deal with larger flies that are attracted by your food. I don't know which ones were worse... the Big Flies going after your food, or the Teeny-Weeny ones trying to use you as a human incubator for their progeny. Yes, I had THAT much time while waiting for the Beeper to start Flashing! All this despite the Orkin fluorescent Bug-Killers! Take me out of this friggin' Healthy Outdoors!


SWAT! SWAT! SWAT! Now for the Food Review... 

PLASTIC PLATES??? 
All entrees are served on Black Plastic plates - another AMUSEMENT PARK feature!!! When I picked up my meal for my friend and I, I thought to myself... ""Joe's Farm Grill is actually receiving 4-Stars... for using Plastic Plates?!?!"". Of course, the plastic must be recyclable or environmentally friendly. I don't know of any other restaurant on Yelp that can get away with this without getting penalized in the ratings...

Pancakes & Fresh Fruit (**** 1\/2 $6.49) Stack of Four, Fresh Fruit, Whipped Cream and Syrup. Smaller than average Pancakes, but the Pancakes were made just right with very good consistency; Fruit consisted of quite a bit of Blueberries, Raspberries, and Strawberries. VERY, Very good.

Meat & Potato Scramble (** 1\/2 $7.99) Skillet Potatoes, Bacon, Sausage, & Ham with four Cheeses. A less than memorable Scramble... maybe because it was SALTY!!! Healthful? NOPE! 

This Scramble could have been the Freshest Scramble ever... Would have never known that with the Saltiness masking everything.

Iced Tea (*** $1.99) All you can drink in a smallish cup... if you get it yourself... OUTSIDE... in the 110 degree HEAT!


Afterwards, my friend and I walked outside, to get away from the architectural masterpiece I refer to as a humidifier, where the most impressive part of the restaurant location was... the humongous Trees! But, I have to wonder why anyone would Picnic underneath these trees, though... You have to wonder why all the limbs are supported by HUGE steel Stanchions, as large as the limbs they're supporting, embedded in the ground. And... hasn't anyone that pic-nicked under the trees read the warning signs for falling branches and the danger of climbing on said branches?

Last observation... which is the most disconcerting... With the restaurant 2\/3rds of capacity.... only two couples of ""color""? Look around you when you arrive at Joe's... you can perform the math yourself. Unfortunately, I notice things like that...

I also noticed quite a few reviews that mention the TV show, ""Diners,  Drive-In's & Dives""... When has a TV show been the arbiter of what is a good restaurant? Frankly, I'd rather ""find"" my favorite dining establishments myself.


I really admire the idea of Self-Sufficiency and Sustainability in the Joe's Farm Grill which supposedly results in better Health for the patrons and Fresh Produce for the restaurant.

So my brother, SIL and a couple other locals suggested we go here. Had I not pigged out earlier in the day, I would have ordered one of the burger or sandwich options. Instead, I ordered the BBQ chicken salad minus the dressing. For something I was expecting a side salad size, it was a big size bowl full of greens (spinach, arugula and romaine lettuce mix), BBQ chicken pieces, some corn, and tortilla chip strips. I loved everything about it but unfortunately couldn't finish. I stole a handful of my dad's hot and crunchy sweet potato fries. My mom liked her BBQ chicken pizza but there was just too much of it to finish. And she can eat for a tiny person.

I know there's always a line that many complain about, but it's not because Joe's has a poorly run kitchen or skimps on their service. It's because it's arguably the most unique and popular of restaurants in the East Valley.

My ""go to"" item here is the Bleu Cheese Bacon burger. My wife and I are fairly enthusiastic foodies, and I can say without reservations that that burger is the best I've ever tasted. After a few years I started asking for extra bleu cheese on it because it seemed the longer they've been around, the more stingy they are on it. And that stuff, which I think is homemade, is what makes that burger. They also have sweet potato fries with pineapple salsa that my wife raves about. Every once in a while I get a yummy chocolate shake too.

This place was also featured on The Food Network's ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives,"" and they definitely are good and proud of it. TVs are everywhere showing the episode on repeat, even in the bathroom. (Something that while cool, I think patrons make a bigger deal out of than necessary. Nothing against the restaurant though; I just laugh when people go crazy over a tv in the bathroom. If it was playing the Suns game on it, then maybe you can freak out.)

Once or maybe twice a year they do customer appreciation day and give out free burgers all afternoon. This restaurant has a loyal following and I think it's pretty cool for a business to show value in it's customers in such a manner. With that being said, I NEVER go to Joe's on ""Free Day."" You think the lines are bad on a normal day? They're ridiculous on Free Day, requiring even DPS traffic control to maintain some sense of order. What people won't do for a free handout! My time is worth more than saving 7 bucks on a burger. Just to make a statement to all the freeloaders (and I say that in the nicest way possible, hardy har) that show up, I'd love to come in on Free Day and pay double the normal price for the burger if it meant cutting the line or something. Not saying it should happen, but it'd be funny. But that says more about people in general than Joe's, and again, I commend them for valuing the community like that. I think one year we arrived at Joe's not realizing it was Free day, and all I could say was ""Ah crap."" lol.

Joe's is the best. I'm telling ya, try the Bleu Cheese Bacon burger, and make sure to ask for extra bleu cheese on it, even if they charge for it. It's SOOOOOOO good!

And if you ""Like"" their Facebook page, you'll get all their announcements, including the year's ""Free Day,"" so that you know when NOT to go to Joe's, which should be the only time you shouldn't. I haven't had their breakfast yet, but I hear it's equally thrilling.",1,1,0

The buzz about this place (after Guy Fieri's visit on Food Network's Triple D) is amazing.  You could feel the freshness in the air.  Out near Agritopia, a master-planned community in Gilbert, this place REEKS old-time farmer cookin'!  

There was a line out the door, but the crowd was in a convivial mood, so we enjoyed standing in line.  After approx. 15-20 minutes, we got to the order window.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna sandwich with a side of fried zucchini, hubby ordered the BBQ bacon blue cheeseburger with a side of fries, and a BBQ chicken pizza to share (and take home for leftovers).  We also ordered a side of onion rings and a cheesecake.  Hubby ordered a sprite, I had their fresh-squeezed lemonade.

The Ahi Tuna sandwich was delicious.  The slaw and wasabi mayo added great flavor.  The bun was fresh, fresh, fresh and probably the best hamburger bun I've ever eaten, melt in your mouth, I kid you not. However, not being a fan of raw fish, I ended up eating around the raw parts, which left very little to go down.  I will get the tuna cooked ""well done"" next time.

The zucchini was really good, but the pieces were so large, they really needed a fork & knife.  The house-made marinara was obviously house-made, and it had very rich flavor, delicious.  The lemonade was a full quart and, believe me, I drank it all.  It was the best I've ever consumed.

Hubby's BBQ Bacon Blue cheeseburger was awesome!  So huge, he could barely get his hands around it.  When he asked me to take a bite, I asked him to cut it in half.  Delicious freshly-picked veggies (lettuce, tomato, and red onion).  His fries were ""meh,"" but the onion rings were da bomb!  Thick-cut, sweet and delicious morsels of onion and fried panko, some of the best I've eaten.

The BBQ Chicken pizza was spectacular, but I thought it would be bigger.  It's definitely enough for one hungry person, but we had leftovers, so it's all good.

I did love the lovely outdoor patio and my burger was fantastic.  I tried the Fontina burger.  A creative and tasty burger, but I think the Fez Burger is the best ""creative"" burger in the Valley.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed mine bunless to save a few calories and carbs.  

The pizza was not very memorable, but we did order the pepperoni pizza.  It tasted just fine.

They must have one of the coolest restrooms in the Valley.  Very neat.  Definitely remember to wash your hands before you eat.

The problem is ordering to-go. Every time it's annoyingly slow. I get they are trying to avoid people calling in to avoid the long lines, but the wait to actually place the order is often 10 minutes.  

Then after 10 minutes wait I placed my order. They said it would be 30 minutes.  I paid and finish driving. I got there 8 minutes early and let them know I was here. They informed me it would be 8 more minutes. Eight minutes later it wasn't ready. I had to wait four more minutes.  So 45 minutes for a burger and there wasn't even a line. It would've been faster for me to walk up and place my order. 

So the one star review... Management, you are the friendliest woman I may have ever met, and when you're there your customer service skills are evident, and yet your team is consistently unfriendly, and unwilling to make substitutions, and your phone ordering process is terrible. So please, either don't offer to-go orders or do a better job with them.

The first time i had the bbq pork sandwich with onion rings. I loved the sandwich as the pork was perfectly cooked and the sauce was wonderful. I love pulled pork sandwiches and this is winner for sure. The onion rings were ok and well flavored but a bit soggy and not as good as i was expecting after seeing them on TV. The garlic fires were another story though as they are excellent and leave you wanting more, the only abd thing is the last few in the bucket get so soaked in grease and oil that they are pretty much un-edible. Also had a milkshake that was ok but nothing to write home about nothing i need here again but if you have a major craving with your lunch it will hit the spot.

The next time i went i got the seared ahi sandwich and it was wonderful. This was worth the trip itself as it has so much flavor and is  just melt in your mouth good. The wasabi sauce is great, not to strong to burn but enough to get a good wasabi flavor. This is something that will keep me coming back for more and more. I loved it. also got the chili cheese fries and they were good but lacking in the cheese department but the chili was very good and the fires are good too.

Food - A wide range of food that is both tasty and fresh, I have yet to go with someone who couldn't find something they liked on the menu. Personal favorites are the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Sweet Potato Fries. I also like their milkshakes, though they tend to be more tasty calories than I should be packing these days. Most of the veggies and food comes from the nearby farm.

Restaurant - Retro furturistic farmstead? I don't know where Joe gets his concepts, but they are fun. The building is the old Johnston family house, and the fireplace in the inside dining area still looks like it is from the 1950s. Also, be sure to visit the restrooms.

Outside Area - My one downside to this restaurant is the free for all often found around the building. The grass area is a great place for kids, but too many parents seem to think this is a license to let their kids run around unsupervised. I usually opt to eat inside as a result, which is a shame because it is such a beautiful area.

The onion rings are the best I've ever tried. Not that I'm a big fan of onion rings but this ones are a mandatory dish.

However, I did love the decor!  The place is literally on a farm.  We sat outside near the big tree (beautiful) and had a nice view while eating.

Don't forget to use their restrooms. It's pretty cool (I know, weird to write a review about restrooms) because it looks like a spaceship inside.  You'll see a flatscreen tv with a puppet space movie playing, and barbie dolls in space capsules in the walls.  Yup.",1,0,0

I had the ribs and my wife had a veggie burger. Fries were cold and limp, BBQ sauce nothing to write home about. We compared notes and did not feel that the food was worth the wait or the price. MEH.

Onion rings were amazing.

It felt like marketing and style over substance.

This is a truly unique concept. Food is cultivated on the adjacent farm property, or sourced locally whenever possible. As the menu states, it's common food done uncommonly well. Quality is the watch word. 

Food is prepared and served in a central building where you wait in line to order, pay and then are given a beeper device which signals you (in short order) when your meal is ready to be picked up. Seating options are inside, outside in a covered area immediately adjacent to the building or throughout the grounds (in an orchard kind of setting) at picnic tables. There were seven of us there on a late Sunday morning, the weather was sunny and about 70 degrees so we opted for the picnic table, which could not have been more pleasant. 

Breakfast is served till 11:00AM, followed by burgers, sandwiches, salads, pizza, Bar-B-Q and sides until 9:00PM. A kid's menu is also offered. Our group choose a variety from the large number of menu choices, and without exception everyone was happy with their selections which included the farm burger with cheese and grilled onions, the Thai chicken salad, the Ahi tuna sandwich (rare with wasabi mayo), excellent rosemary dill panko onion rings, farm milk shades (that day offered in Agritopia Medjool date, pumpkin, as well as the more traditional flavors) and for Izabel, our granddaughter, corn dog bites. 

This was a thoroughly satisfying dining experience all around, and will be my first meal on my next trip to the Phoenix area.",0,0,0

At first, I wasn't sure what I was getting into as I drove from Tempe out to the country-esque suburb known as Gilbert for dinner, but as soon as I saw the neon signage and gravel parking lot for Joe's Farm Grill with picnic tables outside and the line out the door, I knew I hit the jackpot.  

As I stood waiting in line and trying to figure out the system of ordering for JFG (it's not confusing at all.  you just order like normal.), I saw posters up of Guy Fieri, the guy (no pun intended) from Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network.  Apparently, he had been there to tape a show on JFG and feature their onion rings (which i then promptly ordered, which were not only good, but HUMONGOUS).  In all honesty, though, I liked the sweet potato fries better than the onion rings.  Anyway, I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich with a side of cole slaw, the onion rings, and a vanilla shake while my friends ordered burgers and sweet potato fries.  Everything was DELISH!  The price was also perfect, and the people were totally friendly.  

What makes JFG great in addition to everything else is their attention to detail like their focus on local ingredients.  I'm a big fan of supporting local agriculture (including fruits, veggies, and meats), so it's great that JFG supports it, too, to the extent that they can.  I noticed that at the bottom of the menu, it said: Spring 2010, so I'm assuming that the menu changes seasonally based on the farm goods available.  JFG also tries to not use prepared foods much, so they create their own sauces and bread their own onion rings.  Joe's Farm Grill is everything that other restaurants should strive to become, and I HIGHLY recommend you go.  They also have what appears to be a killer breakfast menu, so I might have to try that out in the NEAR future.

Note: If you notice that no condiments or drinks were given to you on your tray or filled in your cup, don't do what my friends and I did and stand there looking for them.  You have to walk out the door.",1,1,1

When I explain The Farm Grill to people I tell them it's food on a farm in a high tech, modern environment. I mean where else can you eat at a farm restaurant that has a condiment flushing system, TVs in the restrooms (that shows the same movie every time) and broadcasts 90s indie music on the speakers?

Remember the scene in Pulp fiction where Uma Thurman orders a milk shake and Travolta asks for a sip because he wants to know what a $5 milk shake tastes like? Well these shakes, particularly the chocolate malt, is worthy of the $4.30 price tag. I've never tried the ribs 
but my friends enjoyed the salmon and tuna sandwiches.

The biggest problem with the Farm Grill is flies. I stop eating there in the late spring \/ early summer each year because the flies are unbearable, even indoors. 

Depending on the time of day the lines get very big and the place doesn't open multiple registers. Food usually comes out quickly though no matter how crowded it is.

Due to the fact that this place is in east Gilbert the clientele is very white and very mormon. There are more pregnant women and young children at The Farm Grill on a weekend afternoon than there are in some maternity wards. 

If you can stand eating among large families and battling traffic to refill your own drinks and condiment cups, the Farm Grill is a good choice for the meat loving crowd. Just avoid it during the warm weather season because no one should spend $12 on a meal and feel the need to devour it as quick as possible just to avoid a fly infestation.

They are now open for breakfast too.",3,4,3

The line to get in the place was just ridiculous. There is only one register open which, more or less, forces you to tip..which I absolutely despise in any restaurant, not just here. The food didn't take too long but the constant battle with aggressive indoor fly's was just gross and probably some kind of heart code violation. When was the last time you ate INSIDE and were bombarded with fly's? The food was overpriced...I mean WAY overpriced and was average at best. Plan on spending about $70 for a family of four. Onion rings were not good and tasted like they were cooked the day before and warmed up. Burger was okay and the chicken in the salad tasted like a burnt grill. I won't be returning there again.",0,0,0

During the course of my sister's stay at a hospice close to this location, I was a regular patron here for a few weeks.  Family from out of town were excited because of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives so I spent much time here.  TWO stars for service:  when I double checked my $140 carry out order, about five items were missing (no apologies, only excuses).  My aunt had problems a few days earlier with a partial dine in order.  On a separate occasion, I only got an order of onion rings to go because I had just eaten at the cafe.  My cousin's were so tasty, I had to get some for my hubby.  I had to ask about them after 15 minutes of waiting (with no line and an empty dining room) and at least this time I got an apology and an excuse as I watched them drop my forgotten rings in the fryer.  BUT the coffee shop gets five stars for service and food!  Very courteous and knowledgeable!  Love the prairie bread that was recommended for my club!  Because all the food is so delicious and deserves TEN stars, but the service left me hanging, I gave this place three stars.  The girls that take the orders are very courteous, the people that shove the  food at you are the ones who need to work on their people skills.  I will more than likely eat here again when I make it to the east valley because the food is just that tasty!

  If I was forced to choose: I'd rather get ten star food with 2 star service than phenomenal service with a bowl of poop. 

 Favorites:
Sweet Potato pie, Onion rings, Asian salad with seared ahi (FYI: the ahi is pre-seared and served cold atop the salad), RIBS ARE OUTRAGEOUS, milkshakes, Mexican coca colas, burgers.... Basically it is ALL AMAZING  The whoopie pies at the cafe are scrumptious!  And anything on prairie bread!!

Joe's has a retro theme, so the look ends up being misinterpereted by some. The flies are a problem, though I don't know how you get around something like that in an open air setting. I can't remember if the farmhouse at South Mountain had the same issues, probably because I wouldn't go near it in July.

I dropped by for lunch today. My timing wasn't so good, as they were featured on The Food Network last night. We arrived at 11:45, stood on line for about 5 minutes and ordered. The food came out in about 10 minutes. My wife and I split the Ahi Tuna sandwich and the Portabello Mushroom sandwich.

This is my first time going to a farm-to-table restaurant. I was very happy that there was a walking area to view the farm. It could be turned into something extremely romantic, although I was more interested in the agriculture myself.

There was outdoor seating as well as indoor seating, but the outdoor seating was by far the best. You're able to sit in a very lush green area while enjoying your food. This is most definitely a luxury in southern Arizona. 

I can only speak on behalf of the breakfast foods. So for the breakfast foods they were absolutely amazing. I had some eggs as well as a Belgian waffle, and I have not had a Belgian waffle that good since my visit to Europe. The environment could have had an influence on how good the waffle tasted, but isn't that the point?

As for the food I love the pesto chicken. They offer gluten free buns and are rather tasty. Sweet potato fries are a bit on the sweet side. But with a side or ranch it doesn't matter.

You almost forget you are in Arizona, because of the green grass and aged shade trees. It was a nice change without the zeroscape gravel or cactus landscape you commonly see all over the Valley.

There was a line out the door. Grab a menu while you wait in line under the Easy-Up tent.
There was only one cashier, then a second cashier showed up for about 5 minutes, then it was back to one cashier again, even with the perpetual long line.

Place your order, pay, they give you a pager, find a table and wait until they buzz you. When they buzz you, your food will be waiting for you from the pick-up window, but show them your pager and place it in the basket.

There were flies while I waited in line. There were flies near the beverage station, flies inside, flies near the restroom. Flies everywhere. Gross!

I had heard great things about this place, so I pretended not to notice all the flies. All of the swarms of other people eating there must not had been bothered by all of the flies either.

Seating is available inside or outside. They had unisex restrooms just like their other place, Liberty Market, but at this location, there were only two restrooms. However, there were sinks for hand washing available outside, in case you just want to washy-washy.

I love onion rings and  don't eat much salt, but I though that the onion rings were a little of bland for being some sort of panko flavored o-rings. They weren't greasy. It was $4.99 for an order. I think I would order them again if I ever came back.

BBQ Chicken Salad was pretty tasty. The greens were fresh, I guess from their farm? Dressing was made from scratch. 

I think most entrees are about $8-$10. Three entrees, plus o-rings was about $36. I think their menu items are made of fresh ingredients, so I don't mind paying more for fresh.

We sat inside, which was so loud from a large group of very loud old people sitting at the next table.

Atmosphere is definitely a good casual setting. Very spacious, love the bench seating, outdoor seating, etc. Also really enjoy the garden that you can take a stroll around. 

Now to the food. the first time I came I loved loved the garlic fries! However, this last time, I bought an actual side of it (not just the upgrade) and it was sitting in a pool of oil. That was a bit disturbing, but nevertheless, they were still good! (until you get to the bottom)

The fontina burger was great! Must try. The BBQ chicken was ok. The cheese and ingredients that it's made of is good and a good combo, but the crust was too burnt for my taste (and I like crispy). Ahi tuna sandwich was a disappointment. It looked decent, just based on looks, but wasn't as tasty and tender as it could have been. I felt like the wasabi mayo didn't have enough taste. The chicken pesto made up for the ahi tuna. 

I did also go there for the customer appreciation day, which was definitely a bonus in their book! The burger and regular fries were very good and for free, even better! 

My sister got the fried zucchini slices. She absolutely loved them. I thought they were decent. Their onion rings and zucchini are done well in terms of good crispyness on the outside and good on the inside too.

My boyfriend had a rough day so I wanted to treat him to something I had faith would be good, and with all the good reviews I thought we couldn't go wrong. 
The line was only partially out the door, so we thought it wouldn't be that bad. 50 minutes later we finally were able to place our order. That was rough. 
I had the tuna sandwhich and my boyfriend got the buffalo chicken sandwhich. It took about 10 minutes more to get the food. I'm not sure why people repeatedly wait 45 minutes plus for their food - it's just okay. I know places that I can get an Ahi tuna sandwhich for that are cheaper and much better quality, like LGO. There really is nothing remarkable about any of it. 
Then when my boyfriend got home he started feeling sick and proceeded to have the worst bout of food poisoning I've seen. Undercooked or mishandled chicken is one of the worst types of food poisoning you can get - it took him a full 36 hours to recover. He never gets sick, and this was the only thing he ate all day, so I'm pretty confident that was the issue. Plus, there was a sauce on the chicken so it would've been hard to detect if it was slightly undercooked. 
I called the manager and he said they haven't had any reports of this in the past, and sounded skeptical that it even happened. At a place where so many kids eat I'd expect this to be taken more seriously.

It's a nice community, and we just happened to be visiting. He felt bad that we had such a bad experience at Joe's Real BBQ that he wanted to buy us dinner to redeem his dreadful recommendation. 

Therefore, he and his wife take us to another one of his Gilbert Faves - Joe's Farm Grill.

He talked up a storm about this place, and he also mentioned that this place was featured in the Food Network show entitled Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.

This would have probably been a big deal to me, if I had actually seen this show. Seeing as that I barely watch TV, I really wasn't that overly impressed. 

That quickly changed when we got to Joe's Farm Grill, which was just around the corner.

As we pulled up, both my wife and I just marveled at the exterior. It was such a throwback to a  past era, and it was quite inviting. Definitely very ""urban farm-like"" and fits right in with the overall surrounding neighborhoods.

I just wanted to hang out, and this time around we weren't really that hungry. So, we opted for a light fare. I chose the Salmon Combo, and my wife had the Hotdog. Nothing too fancy so that we could spend more time talking, rather than obsessing about the food quality.

My wife really enjoyed her Hotdog. Not sure what was in it, but she had nothing but good things to say about it. My Salmon was just marginal. Probably more hype, than actual flavor. 

However, the surroundings, the atmosphere, the company, and the other friendly customers made up for whatever was lacking in my particular food selection. This time around, we chatted up a storm with just about everyone around us.

We came here after seeing a posting on FB giving the fried pork tenderloin an excellent review.  Being originally from IL, my husband and I are always looking for places to get this beloved sandwich.  I wish I had my phone with me when we were served this greasy, stomach upsetting mess.  The pic would have proven what we got was not even close to the sandwhich pictured on FB.  
First of all, the fried coating was not the normal golden crunchy as all tenderloins are.  The coating was an odd darker brown with pools of grease settling in the dips.  It was literally sliding off the pork due to the amount of grease between the meat and the coating.  
I really think this tenderloin had been cooked earlier then when we ordered it the chef threw it back into the fryer that was filled with inadequately temperatured oil.  All this for almost $18 (2 cokes and 1 sandwich)

I knew it was on that TV show so I made the hour drive from Scottsdale just to try this place. it was a huge let down. they messed up our order twice and we had no compensation. for a place that is supposedly ""farm fresh"" the vegetables sure didn't taste like it... especially the lettuce as it was old and wilted. when they finally brought out the correct burger it was lukewarm and very mediocre. the meat just didn't taste all that great( although I have had some pretty amazing burgers so that might just be me). I would go as far as to say that my gym, the dc ranch village, makes a better burger than this place.a friend had the buffalo chicken sandwich which they forgot to bring out at first. he is not a small eater and he threw it out after a couple bites. the sweet potato fries were okay but nothing special. the regular fries were pretty good, very salty and reminded me of McDonald's fries. after they finally brought out the beet salad( after bringing out a random side salad that did not taste good at all) it was good but not great. they were out of a lot of condiments as well. the only thing that really stood out to me was the medjool date shake. that thing was freaking amazing! it had these delicious chunks of dates in it. if you like dates then you will enjoy this shake. I would come back just for a shake. another plus was the manager( I'm assuming? a nice blonde lady) came around and asked us if everything was alright multiple times. although she should of comped something after we told her they messed up our order multiple times. most likely will not be back unless it's for a milkshake.",0,0,0

My wife and I had been to Liberty Market, one of Joe Johnston's other restaurants and we wanted to try Joe's Farm Grill. After a trip to Schnepf Farms, we decided it was a good opportunity to try Joe's for lunch.

I had a Fontina burger with fries and I was highly impressed. The burger itself was juicy and flavorful, without being greasy. The meat itself is lightly season with a mixture of herbs and spices, probably including salt, pepper and thyme, but I don't know for sure. Regardless, it made for a great patty. The mushrooms, red pepper, and arugula on the burger were fresh and yummy. I would have gone a little lighter on the pesto spread, but it was good, so I won't nitpick too much.

The fries were done just right, cut to a good size with the skin on and fried to perfection...crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My wife had garlic fries with her meal and claimed they were the best garlic fries she's ever had. I tried some and I'm inclined to agree. The garlic seasoning mixture was done very well and wasn't loaded too heavily on the fries, nor was it too skimpy.

I look forward to returning to Joe's for many meals in the future, especially for a breakfast.",2,0,0

I've had lots of people recommend Joe's, so I was looking forward to my first trip out to Mesa to have breakfast with my sons there. My first issue was simply that I went in the middle of summer, and at 8:15 it was already hot out, and all the inside tables were taken. By the time we got our food and ate it, i was more focused on finishing and getting out of the heat, than enjoying my breakfast. None of this is really Joe's fault, but if you haven't been there, you should be warned that the majority of the seating is outdoors. 

Secondly, I wasn't really able to enjoy my meal anyway, because of the many flies swarming around our heads and plates. I was constantly shaking them off me and trying to sweep them away from my kids' food. Again, I get it... It's a farm atmosphere, it's outdoors... But be aware if that kind of thing isn't your thing. 

As for the food, it was nothing nearly as memorable as the fly situation. 

Steve had the kid's eggs and bacon. A couple of eggs scrambled (I wasn't given an option to get them any other way) and thin cut bacon served in a paper French fry tray. The eggs were a little over cooked and ""tight""' so they were sitting in a small pool of egg water. The bacon was closer to under-cooked and flaccid. The eggs were seasoned and didn't taste bad. The bacon is described as ""Apple cider smoked"", but it didn't taste any different than mid-grade supermarket bacon. 

Sam had the waffle and fruit. Right off the bat, it looked the most appealing. A malty, Belgian-style waffle with about a half cup of ripe berries and some whipped cream. No complaints, but nothing magic either. It's not hard to make a waffle, and a bit pricey for what you get at $7 bucks. 

I had the Breakfast Burger. It's an average sized, somewhat thin, griddled burger with one over-easy egg (again, I was not asked how I would like it cooked), two slices of the same bacon, and cheese. It was served with lettuce, tomato and pickles, which I didn't use, and a choice of breakfast sides. I asked for Farm Beans, and got breakfast potatoes. The potatoes are  a small portion of those factory sanded, pre-cooked potato cubes, and perhaps my biggest disappointment. When I read ""Farm Grill"", I think skillet made home fries, not Aramark fast food. At $10 bucks, definitely not a solid value. 

Again, for those who haven't been there, the food is ordered fast food-style at a window, and you're given a pager to notify you when it's ready. It's not served fast food-style other than the paper plates and plastic-ware, because it took 21 minutes for the pager to buzz. 

Overall, it's mediocre breakfast fare, somewhat over priced for what you get (a few pennies under $40 for two kids sized portions and one adult), served in what could be a nice atmosphere if it weren't for the heat and the flies. 

It seems like the place might have potential, and it's gotten generally good reviews, so if I happen to be out on the east side on a cooler spring or fall day, I might be tempted to give Joe's a second chance.",2,1,1

It is one of the cutest little diner-ish restaurant surrounded by the trees and acres of land.  The ordering process is pretty much the same as the original Joe's real bbq in Gilbert but the decor and ambiance is way different.  It is much more contemporary.  I must say, until last night, I had the assumption that this place is a restaurant...you know, like Cracker Barrel and such.  But It is pretty much as casual as the Joe's real bbq which gives more character to the place.  After all, real bbq should be done self-serve style :)

My bf tried the Fontina Burger and I had the Baby back ribs with Mango milkshake.  (note:  Mango milkshake is limited time only so you should try it NOW)  We got our pager and waited maybe around 20min?...yeah, it was a little long but it's all good.  We were enjoying the nice, calm breeze outside.  

The food was great!  We were a little skeptical since we didn't really have a wonderful time at Joe's real bbq.  But the baby back ribs were very tender and juicy with great flavor.  The winner though was the Fontina burger.  The little hint of pesto did the trick we think.  The fries...we preferred the regular fries over the sweet potato.  It tastes wonderful the first few bites but afterwards, you kinda feel like you had enough...you know?  

Overall, it was a great experience.  I know that I have the tendency to complain saying ""it is not as good as L.A."" but this place is different.  There is no way that a place like this exists in L.A. and we love it.

The concept is great.  A family farm turned into a touristy farm-to-table restaurant.  The family turned the house they grew up in into a restaurant and it's still surrounded by a wonderful vegetable and fruit garden.  They have also added so many other amazing things to the property, such as a winery, a coffee shop, a craft brewery...but I will review those separately.  My point is that a visit to Joe's isn't just about the food...it's an experience.  BUT, of course, I'm going to review the food as well.

The concept is fresh food.  I believe their original concept was to use everything they produced, but as they have expanded, they have reached out to other local producers.  I had been here on a few other occasions, ordering various menu items, but was never quite wowed.  That is until my birthday this year.  You see, they offer you a free meal on your birthday up to a $10 value so I had my kids take me here.  As we waited in line, we reviewed the menu trying to decide what to order.  A short time later, a woman walked out of the kitchen to let everyone know the specials of the day.  She pointed out that the specials were also on the screens at the front of the line, but from the way she described them, we were sold.  We went with the Gouda Garlic Bacon Burger and OMG...one of my top five burgers ever! We also got the garlic fries and I probably wouldn't order them again because they were way too garlicky but that's just a taste preference.  But oh that burger!!

The service was also exceptional.  The cashier wished me a Happy Birthday, of course, since I was there for my free meal.  He also asked if we had the burger before and when we said we hadn't, he let us know that it was one of his favorites.  I can see why!  I already mentioned the woman who came out to tell us about the specials.  Well, as we were enjoying our meal, she was walking around from table to table to make sure everyone was enjoying their meal. Such great customer service!

I really have no complaints and urge everyone to check it out when in the area.  I really don't think you'll be disappointed.",18,6,16

Joe's was highly recommended by friends.  We got there about 6:30pm on Monday.  The line was long, so we had a chance to review the menu and history.  When we got to the window and started ordering, they then told us they were out of most everything except burgers, grilled chicken & fries So, that's what we ordered.   There was no pizza, no BBQ, no onion rings, etc.)  Wish the would have told us while we waited.  Heck, they had fancy TV monitors promoting their products while we stood in line.  Why not tell us the update before getting to the window!?!

And, it was just OK... basic grilled chicken either on a bun or on-top of a salad.  The dressings were nothing to write home about.  The menu promised greens from their farm.  Well, sorry to say, I've grown & purchased local, farm fresh greens and Joe's tasted pretty mass-produced and bland.

My biggest concern would be that we arrived OFF season and waited at least 30 minutes to order and they were sold out of half of the menu.  I shudder to think what it would be like when the whole garden is full (meaning 4x more crowds than last night.)

Go for the concept, but be prepared for a long wait for basic food.",3,0,0

I think that it is probably a little more of an emotion pull than anything else.  My hubby and I almost bought a house in Agritopia, the neighboring subdivision.  I had dreams of riding a cute turquoise Vespa with my little dog in the basket to Joe's, the coffee shop, and Cosmo dog park.  It is SO Pleasantville slash Edward Scissorhand's neighborhood and I love it!  

We have been there many times and always bring out of town and new to town visitors here.   It's always a great story and people love that a lot of  the food comes from the farm.  Where else can you go that there's a TV in the bathroom showing some strange vintage video cartoon?

My favorite thing on the entire menu is the garlic fries!  They are a must but make sure that EVERYONE in your party at least tries them if they are going to be in close quarters to you for the next several hours.  This is especially true if you are going to be driving together!!  Everything else on the menu is great!  Love all the burgers, the pizzas are good, my hubby loves the beet salad, the portabella mushroom sandwich is flavorful and satisfying and if you have a sweet tooth, make sure to try the french toast, peanut butter, banana, chocolate chip, pineapple, strawberry sandwich!!! After that, don't forget your shot of insulin!  The ice cream is okay...I'm more of a hand scoop ice cream fan. I haven't had the shake but whenever I go, it seems like everyone else is having one.  I prefer to walk next door to the picture perfect coffee shop to get a special bakery treat.

Food wise, there were two of us and we had burgers.  Their burgers are one of those really big really thin patties.  I think they even say something about 1\/3 pound of meat.  That would be 1\/3 pound of meat before cooking and it is probably with 70% because they were just really thin and really well done when they were served.  The burgers were DRY.  I had no idea what people were raving about the food for.  It was not all that!  I substituted onion rings and those were mediocre at best as well.  The shakes were tasty though.

A big plus is that you can bring your dog.  There were tons of dogs there on a nice spring day just chillin'.  I didn't see the fly problem that people were talking about but have to admit that I was put off by the signs that said ""do not climb on trees, fall hazard and scorpions.  SCORPIONS!???!!!

Well this is the setting everyday throughout the fall and spring at Joe's Farm Grill!!

I can't believe I haven't written a review on Joe's Farm Grill already.  It's an awesome place to take the family and friends for breakfast or lunch.  Their menu is built around things people love to eat now a days and it starts in their garden rather than in their restaurant.  They actually grow most of not all of the produce they use in their dishes on site. They will offer some seasonal sides, dishes and deserts based on the seasonality of their fruits and veggies.  

There are loads of reviews already written about specific dishes that are favorites at Joe's Farm Grill, so I wont go into a lot of details concerning their menu.  Some of my favorites at Joe's Farm Grill ~ BBQ smoked chicken pizza which is grilled with some char, topped with plenty of blue cheese, some veggies and BBQ sauce.  It is DELISH and the perfect app to share with friends. 

Some of my fav's: 
~Fontina Burger, Chicken Pesto sandwich,
~Sonoran Dogs ~ get the X2 for $9.99 with either their tasty onion rings or sweet potato fries with their Pineapple-serrano dipping sauce,
~Ahi Tuna and the grilled peanut butter and banana sandwiches
~Thai Ahi Salad and Chicken Caesar Salad 

All of these are a flavor-fest your mouth and tummy will thank you for later :^) 

Don't forget to leave room for desert at ""The Coffee Shop"" or a tasty shank\/malt!  Everything at Joe's Farm Grill is is well prepared and they are consistent in delivering quality, fresh tasting food.  

This place can get insanely busy on the weekends especially when the weather is nice.  You may want to plan your visit to Joe's either early lunch or late breakfast during the week.

First the food is excellent.  We have been there twice.  I've had the burger, and signature item BBQ pizza.  We also had the onion rings as a side item.  The burger and rings are great.  My kid had the veggie burger and raved about it.  The pizza was burned, especially around the edges.  I should have returned it, but I ate around the crust.

The grounds are beautiful.  Nice green grass, big trees, and a working farm in the background.  It is cool that this is the farm that Joe grew up.  No wonder photographers use it for a location for their shoots.

The only thing that gets me is that it is very pricey for a walk up to window to order- get a number-get your own drinks, condiments, and plastic silverware- cleanup up after yourself place.  We paid $10 -$15 per person.  The $5 dollar milkshake, okay $4.49, reminded me of ""Pulp Fiction.""  I'm sure its a ""damn good milkshake"" but....

When we pulled up, the line was out the door. We decided to brave it though and a manager came out and asked if we wanted breakfast or lunch. My boyfriend responded, ""I'm not sure"" to which the manager said, ""Well, breakfast ends in a minute so here is a lunch menu."" Not a problem at all. Until another party arrived behind us and when they were asked the same question, they were lead to the front of the line to enjoy the breakfast menu while we waited in line. 

After waiting the longest to order the food, we sat down and shortly after, our buzzer rang and our food was ready. Well, mostly. The two milkshakes we ordered were not prepared and we had to wait additionally at the counter for them. Good thing we did because they were the best part of our meal. 

My hot dog and fries were cold. So cold that I thought they had been sitting in a fridge. My boyfriend's pulled pork was also cold. And surprisingly, his coleslaw was warm. He did say that after heating up his pork at home, he enjoyed it.

I was not disappointed.

When I was looking at the menu while in line out the door I could not decide what to get, everything sounded great. However I chose the BBQ sampler which came with enough BBQ pork to make a big sandwich, two large chicken fingers smothered in BBQ sauce, ribs and coleslaw.

Even with high expectations I was very surprised.  The BBQ pork was very flavorful and juicy, the smothered chicken tenders were still crisp yet smothered in sauce and the chicken was very tender and even the coleslaw was awesome. Small pieces of cabbage and carrot so it's not unwieldy which came in a tasty slightly peppery sauce.  I was stuffed at this point so I took the ribs home. They look great and I look foreword to eating them for lunch today.

I also ordered a pecan caramel shake which is a current special with roasted pecans and homemade caramel sauce, it was top notch as well.  I tried a sip of the chocolate espresso shake which had bits of espresso beans, wow.

This place lives up to the hype and then some.  I love the hand washing station so you can easily wash up before and after as well as the condiment dispensers including what I assume is homemade BBQ sauce. You can also get huge cups of free homemade ranch to go with your meal from the counter.

I had the BBQ Bacon Burger and it was was absolutely delicious (I'm craving it right now just writing this review) with their regular french fries. The fries were also very good. Fresh and crispy. The burger was topped with cheese, BBQ sauce, an onion ring, bacon and blue cheese. Unbelievably good. And we couldn't pass up having milkshakes for dessert. You can pay for them at the time that you order your meal and go to the pick-up counter to get them when your done eating and bypass the line.

The restaurant itself is pretty cool, lots of outside seating and room for kids to run around. 

The food, I felt was OK... better than the majority of fast food places, but nothing over the top or begging me to come back tomorrow.

Two things that sort of bothered me, were the FLIES, ugh, everywhere, even inside, AND - all of the drinks and condiments were located outside, which might not necessarily be a bad thing, was just weird to me. Oh, and the ranch.. was... weird, like runny? And the taste was.. different. I'll admit I am kind of a ranch snob, so it wasn't HORRIBLE, just weird.

The food is fresh with lots of local ingredients, many from the Agritopia Farm just across the street.

I'm a big fan of many of the regular dishes, especially the Ahi Tuna Sandwich. But one of the best things about Joe's Farm Grill are the specials that feature fresh seasonal ingredients. Keep an eye out for real milkshakes with local, fresh fruit.

Joe's Farm Grill is definitely a local favorite and has been featured nationally on the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. As a result, the place can get pretty busy but the line usually moves pretty fast.

Cons: my salad was lacking flavor (dressing wasn't doing it too much justice); kind of pricey for burgers \/ fries (my salad was a steal for $13.99 though)

There are a few popular things in Gilbert that have mass followings and this place (and its sister restaurant Joe's Real BBQ) is one of them. If crowds bug you, DO NOT go at a typically busy time (Thurs - Sunday). 

We went on a Tuesday night and it was not busy at all and we experienced wonderful customer service (multiple managers asked us how we were doing, another employee overheard my sister say you have to go to the window to get ranch dressing and he was quick to offer to get it for her). 

I think I am in love with the idea of this place more than the place itself. I like that you can sit outside at picnic tables under huge old trees overlooking the massive Agritopia garden.

I had always wanted to try it, since I frequented Joe's BBQ, but it's so far out, that I never found myself in the area.  I went there once with a friend from out of town who saw it on TV and had to go there, so we made the trip.  I had a bacon cheeseburger, some garlic fries and a drink.  It took a while to get the food, which is fine since that way you know it's fresh.  I was really looking forward to the garlic fries, as it's one of the things I love about Gordon Biersch, so I wanted to see their take on them.

Once we got the food, we actually were fortunate enough to get a table inside (this was in June).  I was disappointed that they didn't have fresh lemonade like Joe's BBQ.  They had that 0% juice Minute Maid stuff.  Then no Dr. Pepper!  I am surprised that for the money they charge for a small drink, you get the totally basic Coke fountain with Mr. Pibb.  The burger was good, but nothing to write home about. It was fresh, the cheese had good flavor and the bacon was good.  It was the best part of the meal, which was unfortunate because the garlic fries should have taken the cake, but were so loaded up with oil that they weren't that enjoyable.  I don't know how to describe the feeling, but once you get about 3\/4 through them, you end up with a soup of sorts and it's tough to finish them.  

I was hoping that it would be different the next time, but they're consistent.  I won't say no to it if I'm in the area and someone wants to eat there, but it's not good enough to make the drive from where I live in Central Phoenix.  I'll take Joe's BBQ first.

Review:
I'm giving this place 5 stars, because in the category of casual food, this place is great! They have some tasty burgers and flatbread pizza that'll leave you full, garlic fries that are totally addicting, and delightful shakes.  

My absolute favorite menu pick to get at Joe's is their waffles and ribs on their breakfast menu.  I'm not even a waffle person but their waffles are perfection, lightly crispy on the outside and salty sweet.  Add ribs on top, and it's pure deliciousness in your mouth! 

Finally, the venue itself is a fun atmosphere with picnic tables amongst the shade trees, plenty of grassy area for kids to enjoy, and quirky bathrooms. Note that if it's too hot\/cold outside, there is inside seating as well. Just be aware that when there's great weather, lines can get  long but they seem to move pretty fast and you can always call your order in for pick-up. If great tasting casual fare is what you're looking for, then Joe's Farm Grill won't disappoint!",4,3,3

Usually I get pretty lucky with the green eggs and ham- and I don't think my husband has had a burger here he doesn't like... But- sometimes the food just isn't up to par. Recently we were there for breakfast (New Years Day) and got waffles and ribs and Joes Big Breakfast. The ribs were burnt but we ate them... The Big Breakfast was stone cold. We brought it back and they said to come back up in five to ten minutes- well, it was clear they just reheated it in a microwave and I find that unacceptable- especially for the cost of food here.

This restaurant is situated on a real farm.  Well it used to be a lot bigger. There are fields and gardens in the back.  There's a huge grassy area with lots of trees, benches and shady spots so families can bring their kids and let them run and play while they eat.   Families with young kids seem to enjoy it here.

I ordered the Fontina Burger with Sweet Potato Fries.  Note the burger runs about $7.99 and includes fries.  To get Sweet potato, you need to pay a $2.00 upgrade fee.

The burger was huge- 1\/3 pound!  It was not a shriveled, dry, meat patty that you would find somewhere else. Definitely low fat content, moist and flavorful.  I loved the veggies on top, grilled mushrooms, roasted red peppers, homemade pesto, and fresh greens.  And the cheese was just the right flavor for the veggies.  I also added a multi grain bun which was just right.

Of course the sweet potato fries were awesome.  They came with a pineapple-serrano dipping sauce which was not needed.  These fries have enough flavor on their own.

Fresh food, fresh taste, homemade goodness!  Try Joe's Farm Grill!

Oh by the way, follow them on Twitter! @joesfarmgrill.  I found out too late that they were offering a free fry upgrade that night for their followers.

I later found out via Twitter that the milkshakes contain a splash of lime juice in them because when the owner was a kid his local drug store made them that way. Apparently, the lime juice adds complexity and cuts out the richness. Are you kidding me? Isn't the entire reason milkshakes were created was for the richness. This is almost sacrosanct.  I'm surprised the ice cream didn't curdle because it tasted like old goat's milk. 

That being said, the food is finger linkin good and not all that bad for you either. Our group of four enjoyed the BBQ chicken pizza, Ahi Sandwich, Ribs and Onion Rings.

Joe's Farm Grill violates some of my food rules; 1) NEVER order a burger made of anything but cow. Joe's Ahi tuna burger is amazing (I AM NOT KIDDING).   2) ONLY order pizza at a restaurant that specializes in pizza. At Joe's they grill the crust and then cover with BBQ sauce, chicken and bacon. Delicious.

Also must try: fried shrimp dinner, apple fritters (breakfast), cream puff with chocolate sauce for desert.",2,1,2

Don't get me wrong, I still love JFG; I just didn't care for its BBQ pulled pork sandwich and fries.  The coleslaw was good, but not so fantastic that it's worth the pain after.  I thought that the pork had too much of the cloyingly-sweet sauce.  Wasn't so sweet when paired w\/ the garlic toast points.  However, if you look at the included photo, you'll see that the two pieces of bread were under the pork, and therefore completely saturated w\/ sauce.  I like accompanying bread to be crispy\/crusty (love that crunch!), so all I had to enjoy that afternoon w\/ the pork was the part that stuck out from under all that sauced meat!  What a waste (tsk, tsk)!  The boat of fries was just a complete soggy mess.  I should've asked them to sub sweet potato fries instead, but why must I pay extra to get a perfectly crisped product?  Then again, one (wo)man's treasure is another (wo)man's trash, and vice-versa, eh?

My dad had the pancakes with fruit. Same thing: light and fluffy. He put his away, and he and I are about the same size. Yeah, shut up.

Several employees in back messing around.  We ordered the ahi tuna and the chicken BBQ pizza, both featured on the Food Network.  The tuna came out first and we had to wait another 5 minutes for the BBQ pizza.  The tuna was so fatty that my husband could only eat about 4 bites.  He said flavor was good but quality of meat not good.  The BBQ pizza was so bland, chicken (very little chicken) was dried out.",1,0,0

Went by the place at around 1245, parking lot was full and there was a line out the door.  Left and came back about an hour and half later...no line, lots of parking.

Ordered the farm burger and 2 hot dogs...that and two drinks....$23.  

Hamburger -- nothing special.  Came with two leaves of partially brown lettuce and two rather anemic looking rings of red onion...not two slices...two rings.

Hot dogs -- actually not bad.  Came with onion and ""homemade"" relish.  

Fries that came with the above we ok, but again nothing special.

So what's my assessment?

- Nothing special.
- Way expensive.
- Odd that they're a ""farm"" restaurant but yet they had such sad looking produce.
- Glad I didn't have to wait in line...I wouldn't be a happy camper if I did.
- Places to get a better burger...especially on a price to quality ratio...In and Out, Five Guys, Fudruckers.

One final point that ranks somewhere between weird and disgusting.  The drink\/condiment station shares the same drainage trough.  So when you're down stream from the condiments getting your soda you get to watch ketchup, mayo, ranch dressing, etc float by you as you get your soda.  Kind of a nasty sight in my book.",3,0,0

I don't like ordering fish in AZ, however, the food here looked so good and fresh and so many people ordered it, I gave it a try.

Luckily for me, I wasn't stupid enough to order bbq pork again.  Joe's Farm Grill is a pretty cool concept and probably the only decent place to eat on this side of the 202 (since Mobsters INC closed, at least).  There are enough review here that clearly he is doing something right.  Suburbanites love to feel like they don't live in a city and, I'm sure, love the idea of a restaurant with picnic tables and trees.  They must because the place was a freaking day care when we went, with snotty brats running all around and climbing on everything.

Anyways, back to the food.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Burger.  I didn't bother to specify how I wanted it cooked and it was, surprisingly, cooked to a decent medium-well.  I subbed some sweet potato fries with it and they were pretty good.  Little more pepper would have made them great but oh well.  The wife had wanted to sub the veggie fries with hers but they made us order a side of them.  That side was literally 3 pounds of fried veggies and was way too much for any human to consume.  They weren't really my thing but the wife enjoyed.

This place does a lot of things well but they suffer from a lot of the logistical problems that Joe's BBQ does.  The line is better and it keeps people from getting backed up but they seem to run out of menus quickly.  People grab them, carry them in line, and leave them at the window.  As a result, there are no menus left when people walk in.  I refilled the thing twice while I was standing in line.  Also, the condiment\/drink counter is outside and all in a row right by the door into the restaurant.  These weird clusters of people trying to get a drink or some sauce develop and creates an obstacle course for people going in and out of the restaurant.  This leads me to my final problem - the indoor pickup window.  While the summer is long and hot (and I'm sure leads to a lot of people usually sitting inside), the day we went had tons of people sitting outside.  When their buzzers went off, they had to go inside to pickup the food.  The single door seemed to be all sorts of hazardous for people going in to get food and people coming out with food.  Finally, and I know this sounds stupid, but the trash can outside has the smallest opening ever.  You cannot actually stick your plastic basket inside the trash can and turn it over to dump your food out.  You have to pick the stuff up out of the basket and throw it away with your hands.  I just finished my meal, cleaned my hands, and now I have to wash them again because I had to handle a greasy, sauce-covered piece of paper to throw it away.

I know this sounds nitpicky but it turned what would normally be a 4-star peaceful lunchtime experience into a logistically stressful nightmare for me.  When you make it hard for me to get in and out with my food, it makes me feel like you don't want me there.  I know they are going to read this and I know they are going to dismiss it just like my gripes about Joe's BBQ but do me a favor, when you build your next restaurant, hire someone with a degree in urban planning to help with the layout instead of just cramming things wherever you think they will fit.",3,2,1

I would have given 5 stars, except the last two times I have been there the lines have been HORRIBLE.  

I don't mind waiting in a line when I think the restaurant is doing everything it can to get me through it, but both times I have waited in a line for over 30 minutes they have had ONLY one register open. Once was on a Wednesday night, and once was in the middle of the day!  JOE, if you read this, make sure that if the line is out the door you get them to run both registers.

3. The person who appeared to be the manager had a full beard and didn't have a food net on.

It's definitely a Farmstand concept with a bit of a modern twist. Reminded me of the roadside farm restaurants back east.

Fontina Burger with onion rings- Excellent
Grilled BBQ Chicken Pizza - Somewhat tasty but I was full from my burger
Vanilla Shake - The blue cherry hit the spot

Also had a bite of the Peanut Butter and Banana sandwich which is somewhat great but I couldn't eat it as a meal.

Today, a Sunday, at 12:45pm the line was relatively short, and by relatively short, I mean not out the door.  My husband ordered while my son & I went scavenging for an inside table (104 degrees out today and the indoor seating is scarce), which I cleaned off with an anti-bacterial wet wipe from my purse. 
The food was okay.  I won't be rushing back.  Actually, I probably won't be back at all.  My son ordered a strawberry shake, which the strawberries were clearly frozen, not fresh.  The onion rings, that are boasted as being on ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives"" is nothing to brag about.  As matter of fact they came to the table luke-warm and with very little flavor. My husband and I had the chicken pesto sandwich with coleslaw. Sandwich was ok, mushrooms had good flavor, but otherwise it was pretty bland. Coleslaw was much of the same, bland. Good crunchy slaw, but nothing special about the flavor. 
Overall, the food was edible, nothing outstanding, but nothing horrible. I was really expecting something incredible, especially since we love Joe's BBQ.  :(",2,0,0

Pneumatic. Condiment. Dispensers.
Okay, folks, I'm a condiment lover.  I freaking love me some condiments on any day from anywhere.  Put out Ranch Dressing or BBQ Sauce in your condiment line-up and I'm even happier.  But put all the ketchup, mustard, mayo, ranch, AND bbq sauce in a shiny metal display and dispense it to me PNEUMATICALLY?????
Freaking hell ...I'm distracted all the time now because I want to go back and order five different things that I can put condiments on just so I can use the pneumatic dispensers.  
SO FUN!!!!!
Oh, and the food.  Okay, I'll be honest, I expected good food.  I expected REALLY good food.  And I was overwhelmed at the sheer selection of food on the menu, and the flat-panel displays flashing clips of video, pictures of food, and offering me fresh ice cream shakes or fried green beans (which I didnt get but will next time).  Ordering (meaning I had to actually CHOOSE) was an exquisite agony.  I dithered for no less than 17 minutes, circling the dining room with my iPhone (to read what other Yelpers ate) and clutching the laminated menu to my chest like a crucifix.  Once my lunch partners had all arrived, my time was up and I had to enter the line.  I couldn't concentrate on the conversation because as we wound back and forth in the line, I was able to see what other people were eating, and what was being served up in the window (yes! you can watch them preparing the delicious food!) which caused me to change my mind several times.
I'm the kind of person who HAS to order last, simply because I MUST KNOW what everyone else is having. It serves to lessen my post-food-arrival regret and that painful longing of ""I should have ordered that....""
The moment of truth came and I decided upon a wood-fired BBQ chicken pizza.  And in a gluttonous moment of ridonkulous insanity, blurted out 'FRENCH FRIES' fully knowing that no amount of hours on the treadmill watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes on DVD could ever redeem my choice of lunch.  But... DO NOT JUDGE ME!  You weren't there watching the orders of fries being shunted out to happy diners... it wasn't completely in my control.
Food arrived.  I did admire my fellow luncher's selections, but did not suffer overmuch from longing or regret.  I had a giant wood-fired bbq chicken pizza with globs of melted fresh mozzarella on it... a paper basket of the most delicious french fries of my life... and (drumroll).... PNEUMATIC CONDIMENT DISPENSERS!
It's no business of yours, to be sure, why I might have needed ketchup, mayo, mustard, ranch AND bbq sauce for my pizza and french fries.  But I just did.  
To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.",1,2,0

We returned the order and they offered to make another one, however it was inconvenient as we were not able to enjoy the meal as a family while she waited for her food to get done again.  The fries were loaded with salt, perhaps to compensate for the bland burger.

There was a line out the door, as usual, but it moved relatively quickly, and it gave us time to look over the menu while we waited.

We ordered the Fried Zucchini Slices and the Ahi Tuna Sandwich. The milkshakes looked very tempting, but we decided try them some other time. We went and washed our hands (they have an outdoor washing sink; hooray!), and sat down with our buzzer to wait for our food.

Granted it was busy, the food did take a little while, but it gave us time to use the restroom, etc. Seating was plentiful; there are selections of benches and regular tables.

With my Tuna Sandwich I ordered a side of fruit. The fruit amount was tiny; enough to fill one of those little to-go containers for salad dressing. Eh, fruit is expensive, I get it.

When I picked up our order I noticed I forgot to request a multi-grain bun. I asked the server at the window if I could get a new bun. She was very accommodating and allowed me to get a new bun.

The food was delicious. I like that they use honey in their slaw instead of refined sugar. The entrees were well portioned, but as I mentioned the sides are a little on the small side. Ahi tuna usually is served as a smaller portion because of its high cost, but the size of the cut was enough to fill out the bun!

To be completely honest,  there was nothing extraordinary about the burger. It came with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a pickle on the side. It was a good burger, satisfying and filling, but nothing more. The onion rings on the other hand stood out and were none like I've had: extremely hott and fresh, not too oily, and the onion was plump and juicy, none of that half withered crap.

The environment of the place is great. It feels as if you are in a mix of a place is disneyland thrown in the midwest. You just have to be there to understand. There were more seating inside than out, which is awesome during the winter. I can see this being a bit iffy during the summer though. You walk up in a line to order your food, then wait around 10 minutes for it to be made.

For food, I personally opted for BBQ Ribs with a Side Caesar, Fries, Garlic Flatbread, and a Peppermint Shake at around 25 dollars. This was as expensive as it gets. The burgers and salads were around 8 dollars each. The ribs were fall off the bone and very messy, but oh so worth it!

Overall, Joe's Farm Grill is a must for anyone to try! Now, what are you doing reading the end of this review? Leave your place of residence. Get in your car. And go to Joe's Farm Grill. NOW!",3,2,1

It's always been a big hit with my clients who see it as a great change from the usual fast food restaurants their children want to eat at for lunch.  Joe's has some delicious food items for adults and children alike. They have plenty of comfortable seating inside, or if you'd prefer, you can eat outside under a big tree. I just don't recommend the outside seating when it's 112 degrees here in the valley. Before you leave, and even if you don't have to, check out the bathrooms.

4 for locally sourced, fresh ingredients, community farming plots, fun\/retro atmosphere, beautiful, spacious groves, light-strung trees after dusk
3.5 for variety of offerings
2.8 for execution \/ pricing

3 Fontina burger (4 fixings, 2.8 burger) - the fixings definitely made the burger (roasted red pepper, grilled mushrooms, field greens, farm-made pecan pesto, fontina), but was disappointed with the bland, well-done burger, which was on the dry side

3.5 garlic fries  (tossed in olive oil, Pecorino Romano, fresh garlic, herbs) unexpectedly stole the show - not too heavy, excellent seasoning

3 onion rings - high quality, the hand-breading is evident, panko coating is a nice thought, but was overly fried to a hard crust, which  completely covered any rosemary\/dill notes

3 bbq chicken pizza - chicken breast is very smoky, mild blue cheese - great flavor but as prior reviewers warn, be prepared for some sogginess w\/the bbq sauce

2.8 ribs & pulled pork platter - ribs pack a light heat, dry rub with some sauce; pulled pork is a tiny side - found the sauce overly sweet, a bit heavy, lacking tender\/moistness that you might expect from pulled pork; for being average bbq, on the pricier side

3 beet salad - refreshing but found the small portion overpriced (3 oz for $3)

They tend to be busy, but it's well worth the wait, I promise. There's a very relaxed atmosphere with seating inside and out. The outside seating is especially nice if you have kids (like my cousins) who enjoy running all over the place and doing what kids do best- adding a little extra excitement to any family outing.

When it comes to the food.. where do I begin.. burgers are slabs of thick patties grilled to juicy perfection on a toasted bun. Their Southwest Burger is my personal favorite. It has a nice little kick, but I added some of the hot sauce available at the drink\/condiment station because I like my food to the point of unbearably spicy (it's a curse, really.)

Pizzas are the bomb. Crusts are thin, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and covered in a mound of sauce, cheese, and toppings. In my attempts to be healthy I get their vegetable one, and even my picky sisters will eat it because it's just that good. Only odd thing I'll mention is they sprinkle fresh basil on top, which causes me to get migraines from a strange allergy, so if you suffer from the same weird disease I have be sure to ask they omit the garnish.

I am dying for their grilled wedge salad as I write this. I've heard of wedge salads before, but this one is grilled and that makes all the difference. It's plain, simple, and divine. Be sure to squeeze the lemon over it for that extra tangy-ness to cut away from the richness of the dressing and bacon.

Thai Chicken Salad was on point. Only I didn't realize it was garnished with basil leaves until it was too late, and there was no way to successfully separate the basil leaves from the rest of my salad. I don't have that kind of patience. Once again, if you dislike fresh basil, ask for it's removal. It would've been perfect had I done that.

Last thing I'll write a review on is their Medjool Date Shake. Personally, it's one of my favorite shakes. I've never heard of such a thing until I went here, and I enjoyed it so much I now try to fashion my smoothies after it (once again, my healthy attempts). It's not so thick that I have to give my cheeks a workout just to get it up the straw, but not so think that I feel like I'm drinking milk. My dad is weird about textures and wasn't a fan of the pieces of dates in the shake, but I thought it made the shake better. Just personal preference. 

They do free meals on your birthday if you show them your license or kids' birth certificate. Best deal ever,.

Her idea of good eating is to go to a restaurant she's been to a billion times to order the same item over and over.  So getting her to eat anywhere that she's never been is hard work!

I convinced her to try out Joe's Farm Grill with me today.  I drive by it on my way to work and on my way to the dog park on a regular basis and was curious about the place.  Was it a farm?  A restaurant? A produce stand?  But I'd forget about looking it up as soon as I drove by!

Well finally I looked it up and was delighted to find out it was a retro-style casual eating place that had (also) featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  So, I named dropped Guy to my sister and she reluctantly agreed to try it out.

I had the fontina burger (dip it in ranch AND ketchup!) and the onion rings, while she had the grilled cheese sandwich and chili fries.  Everything was fresh, hot, not greasy like you'd expect, and amazingly delicious!  Afterward, we walked across the lot to The Coffee Shop where I had a yummy iced latte and we both had ""glam"" cupcakes.

This place is a great place for a casual lunch or dinner.  It's definitely kid-friendly, and even a fun and casual place for a date!  I could even see the potential of throwing a party outside in their patio area.

As for my sister?  She's a total convert.  As soon as we got home, she was on the phone with her boyfriend, gushing about the delicious place we'd just been to, with its retro layout, delicious food, and the too-cute coffee shop!",1,1,2

I'm sorry, but if your on Yelp giving this place four and five stars, you should not be reviewing food, the food is edible and ok, certainly not worth all this fuss, a waste of a 79 mile drive.

When you arrive outside you can see all these trees and the environment in a whole is just outstanding. The way you order is kinda weird you walk In grab a menu and wait in line. The menu tries to help you out on what's like popular like some of the items have been on the food channel so it tells you that which is cool. But after all that I still did not know what to order, everything sounded so good! I just went with a slab of ribs and 2$ up charge for garlic fries and a drink was about 26$.. Isn't bad to be honest it's like going to any sit down and getting ribs but with sit downs they do everything for you while here you have to do it that's the only down side. This place is like a fast food joint with high prices. They give you a buzzer device so when the food is ready it starts vibrating. The fountain machine is outside and so are the sauces and all the things you need for your meal even a sink which is different and nice. My meal came out in like 5 minutes while they were busy and it was incredible. The ribs were tasty, the garlic fries were perfect and the coleslaw was probably the best coleslaw I have had. The food the environment is just so cool sitting outside with a heater and so much green around you. Very nice place I will

Their burgers are just amazing and so are their salads. And if you haven't tried their breakfast yet you're missing out. Don't even get me started on their fresh squeezed lemonade and orange juice.

I love that they do a free burger day every year in the fall to celebrate their anniversary. Don't let the line around the building intimidate you. It goes SUPER fast. We got through the whole line AND ate our food in less than an hour. Highly efficient. Brilliant business.

The one downfall is that because there is the indoor-outdoor setup where people are constantly bustling in and out and leaving doors open, there tends to be quite a few flies inside at certain times of the year. Not unbearable, but a little annoying.

For a perfect winter day in az, this is the perfect out door place. I had several things on he menu because it was fat day. 

Two hot dog combo: Sonora dog and BBQ dog. 

Sonora was excellent, though mine didn't come with bacon. Baked camp beans piled high on kosher beef with cheese and jalapeños. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and an especially good lobster role fried to perfection. Second was a pulled pork: exactly as it sounds. Pork was a tad dried out, but not big deal. 

The day we went, they were running Super Bowl specials. Seattle special (go hawks) was a seared salmon sandwich. This is the first place we had salmon that was 1. Pacific and 2. Not cooked to oblivion leaving behind gum textured fish swimming in its own oil. Absolutely fantastic.

My wife has a lot food allergies. Joe's seemed to pass her allergies test with the grilled salmon at the last visit. I had the double Sonoran Dogs. I thought the food was ok. 
What we really enjoy is the farm itself. We enjoyed this visit and the last by just walking the farm and relaxing at the prayer garden.
Our visit yesterday was a bit more crazy. I guess families and sweet hearts go the the farm and grill. We arrived at 2:30p and the line was out the door. We walked the farm until 3:30p. The line was out the door but only by 4 people. We place our order at 4:03p and found a table outside. I had to go to the bathroom and waited in a line. We sat for 30 min to finally get our food.
My wife went with the plain burger since the beef was local and unseasoned with a salad and milk shake. I went with the BBQ Chicken Pizza because all the Yelpers placed a bunch of awesome photos of this beast with a soda.
My wife liked her burger and loved her shake. I was rather underwhelmed with a grilled pizza dough with a chicken tender cut up(seriously like a single tender chopped up maybe 1once of meat) and placed on top. Little cheese and a squirt of BBQ sauce. I wanted to take a photo but thought better to embarrass the farm. It's overall flavor was dough because the toppings were missing.
Over all food was ok and the wait is too long for ok food that cost almost $30. We tried to get in prior to the dinner rush as we did for our first visit ( 4pm).

Yes, this sweet spot has been around for some times and always a pleasure to visit.  Service here is always on spot and just having the ability to walk around the yard is fun.  The Coffee Shop next doors bakes up a storm and the farmers market is always cool to explore.  

I came to Joe's after a run with a friend so we were pretty hungry!  I went for the Fontina Burger with Onion Rings, while she ordered the Ahi Sandwich with Beets.  My burger was cooked to perfection while the peppers and fontina cheese gave it a lovely sweet pop.  I would say they have the softest bun around and it just literally melts in your mouth.  The Onion rings were fresh and crunchy with every bite.  My friends Ahi Sandwich had the same bun, but within was a large slab of tuna with some slaw.  Overall, a crunchiness of the slaw gave it some texture while the wasabi mayo provided some heat.  The tuna itself was cooked lightly seared so you had somewhat of a sashimi taste to it.  

In the end, Joe's Farm Grill is always a recommendation whenever someone ask me about a great place to eat.  The experience itself is always great because of the atmosphere it has and the food is always consistent! - Enjoy!",12,7,8

We walked in during the night time and it wasn't crazy busy. Hot but not crazy busy. We ordered the Fontana Burger, Onion Rings, Garlic Fries, BBQ Chicken Pizza and two chocolate shakes. Bill came out to be around.. $50ish I believe.. or even higher than that--I can't recall. I had high expectations of this place for the food Guy Feiri had and said about them. Boy, I was deceived. 

The Fontana Burger we had was dry and tasted bitter. I loved the fact that they kept saying their veggies were grown fresh and yes, I love that but I don't think it went well with the burger, especially for its cost. The onion rings were large and crispy but the inside was raw and when I bit into it the onion came right out. Batter still intact but the onion came straight out. Garlic fries were amazingly good yet still extremely oily from its cooking process. The Chocolate shakes were too very very delicious, rich chocolatey taste not too thick not too viscous with a nice little hint of bitterness in its after taste. The BBQ Chicken Pizza was the only entree that kept it's hype from DDD; moist, full of flavour and an orgasm in your mouth. Was truly delicious now only if I could add some sort of hot sauce on it to give it a spicy taste. I always keep coming back to this restaurant because its just one of those restaurants you hope to get better every time you go visit. It stayed relatively the same.

When we arrived, there was a line to order, however it moved pretty quickly.

I rarely order a chicken sandwich because usually a grilled chicken sandwich from a restaurant is inedible, but here the chicken was moist and flavorful.  I was not disappointed.  The onion rings were great too.  

My man ordered the double dogs with chili - two chili dogs - they looked really good!  He also had fries that I shared.  :)

We sat outside since we were lucky enough to have 80-ish degrees in the middle of a Phoenix summer.  It was so nice!  The sounds and the smells of the Farm reminded me of BBQs and picnics I enjoyed as a child in Illinois and made me realize it was probably time for a visit again.  :)

We'll be return customers, no doubt.  My only complaint was that the bun with the ahi sandwich was a little too sweet for my taste; it detracted slightly from the Asian flavors.

As for other reviewers who complained about flies....yes, there were some, outside, around the tables on the grass.  When you eat al fresco, that's the chance you take.

The first visit I had the BBQ chicken pizza, hubby had the amazing fontina burger. That burger was spectacular. It has 6 oz., roasted red pepper, grilled mushrooms, field greens, farm-made pecan pesto and fontina cheese. I think its the pesto that makes it so special, but hubby thinks its all of the ingredients together that makes it.

My second visit I got the fontina burger, without the red peppers, with bacon and once again; it was outrageously delicious. I also got the fried green beans which I loved!

We didn't realize that until we got home, but i really would have loved that celery. I was splitting the sandwich with my gf and asked to have the sandwich cut in half and when i got the sandwich they told me there were knives around the corner...essentially saying, ""do it yourself."" Not a huge ordeal, but still would've been nice if they went the extra mile.

All in all the sandwich had a good spicy kick to it, exactly what I needed. We got fried zucchini as the side and the breading that came with it was perfectly crusted. Definitely went well with the marinara sauce, but I always prefer ranch with my fried products. 

When we first got here, the line was out the door and pretty long.

Pros:
Beautiful outdoor space
Good quality food

Cons:
Inside eating area was dirty\/out dated
Customer service is definitely lacking 
Long lines (only one cashier at lunch time)

About customer service: 
My salmon was raw on the inside. Not under cooked- it was raw. I took it back up to the counter and they gave me attitude. The guy said ""that's the way we make it here."" I felt as if I was inconveniencing them. They said ""we can make you a new one but you're going to have to wait- there's a lot of orders ahead of you and the salmon takes time."" I waited, and waited. Everyone in my party was done eating already when I finally say down to eat. I think for the reputation they have they could do a better job making people feel welcome. I didn't actually kind having to wait- but I do mind the way I was treated. 

Also, there were so many flies and Mosquitos when we were there this last time. They are re-seeding the lawn and there were puddles of standing water. 
In the inside dining area there were stains all over and it smelled musty. 

I might wait some time to eat there again.",0,0,0

Finding out that I was being taken to some fast-casual burger place without alcohol was slightly disappointing to me. I sucked it up and went on Yelp to see what's good here, and imagine my surprise to see over 700 reviews with an average of 4 stars. Suddenly, the afternoon started to look up.

Based on Yelp reviews, I ordered the Fontina Burger with garlic fries, my friends ordered The Farm Burger and BBQ Bleu Cheese Pizza, and together we shared the Butter Pecan Shake.

The first bite of my burger made me forget all about cool refreshing margarita waiting for me at some hole in the wall Mexican restaurant. My burger was better than alcohol --- fuck that noise. This is clearly going to earn my five stars.

After I embarrassed my friends by moaning out loud while eating my burger I was actually stoked about my garlic fries. Imagine my surprise to find out that I hated them. I hated the garlic fries. I love garlic, I love fries, but I HATED these garlic fries. Actually, I hated them so much I forgot how much I loved my burger. They were just so pungent and strong and overwhelming. I was eating raw garlic on soggy, oily fries. Eck, just remembering it makes me queasy. 

I had a five star burger and a 1 star side of fries, that unfortunately averages out to 3 stars. However, my friends raved about their food so I'm bumping up to four and calling it a night. A good margarita will surely erase the taste of garlic fries from my person.",3,3,1

It's out there for people in the city... like, wayyyy out there, but it's worth the drive. It's been hyped up on the Food Network and stuff, but all the talk is earned. The food here is supremely fresh (they pretty much grow everything steps away) and cooked in inventive ways (see: GRILLED pizzas. Yes, I did just say that.) that makes me actually eager to try just about everything on the menu. I like that Joe's has created a little complex of different concepts on their land. The Coffee Shop next door is about the coolest that Gilbert can get and the little farm stand with refrigerated veggies and herbs is oh so convenient. 

One more thing: the slaw on the ahi tuna sandwich is heaven. Purely a delight.",5,1,3

My wife and I came here on Saturday afternoon after doing some shopping in the area.  Having heard about this place while watching ""Triple D"" we had a feeling it would be popular.  We arrived at 4pm and they were busy.  It only got busier while we were there too.  

We ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza, BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, and a Regular Cheeseburger.  We also tried the onion rings and garlic fries.  Everything we ate was awesome!  Not just good but awesome.  Here are the standout points for me.

1) Fresh ingredients matter!  They use locally grown produce in their food and it shows.  You just can't replicate the flavors when the food is frozen and\/or processed.

2) Reasonable pricing.  We ordered 3 entrees and 2 drinks and the bill was less than $40.  Works for me!

3) Great setting.  Starting with a retro looking building and adding in a farm setting you have a great place to enjoy a meal.  Large trees behind the building provide ample shade for the picnic tables too.  For the winter time they have heaters on the patio too.

So in summary, we loved it.  We will definitely be back.  2 thumbs up!",3,0,0

After the wedding festivities, we had a few extra days to unwind and soak up the warm Arizona rays while New York was still getting a few passings of snow. As my sister, her fiance and I are all Food Network fanatics, we searched for Triple D places in the area. We like going more so for the novelty, but if you ask me, Anthony Bourdain is far, far superior to Guy Fieri. However, I love the opportunity to eat where so many people have said 'you need to go here.'

Which is how we came across Joe's the day before our departure. We arrived just as the breakfast menu switched for the lunch and decided to get everything and then some that was featured on Triple D. My sister got the Fontina Burger with sweet potato fries, her fiance got the BBQ Bleu Cheese Burger with onion rings, and I ordered the Ahi Tuna Burger with garlic fries. We also ordered 2 caramelized banana milkshakes, a BBQ chicken flatbread pizza and a strawberry lemonade. We were very hungry.

I fell in love with Joe's even before my first bite. The ambiance alone was enough to sway me. The open farm area, Agritopia, the ancient and massive trees in the picnic area. 

The food didn't take long, and before I knew it my fork was scraping the bottom of my tray collecting the droppings from my burger, since it was just so massive. I'm always a bit skeptical when ordering fish when somewhere landlocked, but wherever and however Joe's gets it's tuna, is done the right way. The spicy wasabi mayo spread on the bun with the purple cabbage was just all so beautifully blended together.

I immediately became obsessed with the garlic fries. They did not hold back from laying on the garlic or Parmesan. You didn't even need to have a fry with the toppings to get the beautiful and fragrant taste. Interestingly, these fries taste similar to another Triple D place I've been to, The Red Sparrow in Queens. So, while I will miss these very much, at least I know where I can get my fix.

The caramelized banana shakes was super rich, like a thick liquid version of a bananas foster. I saved most of it for after the meal and couldn't finish the whole thing, but know that I so dearly wanted to. 

Part of the reason why I couldn't finish the milkshake was because of the flatbread pizza. By the time I finished my burger and fries, I was already stuffed, but charged through to have my share of the pizza. The flavor was crazy, smoky, and I'm thankful the flatbread was crunchy and not soggy like so many places get wrong.

We finished eating before noon, and for the next few hours, while walking around Scottsdale, I felt full the whole day. We had a late dinner, and even at that I ordered the smallest thing on the menu at the place because I was still so full.

Before leaving to the airport the next morning, we grabbed my grandparents and took them here for breakfast. I ordered a waffle with fresh fruit, super simple, but so well done. My only gripe was the maple syrup, but perhaps because I live close enough to get Vermont maple syrup at any time, I'm a bit spoiled. Either way, there was nothing bad about this. Even the coffee was strong, which was the first time I had strong coffee in Arizona. We also enjoyed the apple fritters, I was not expecting them to have the chopped up apples inside, but it was unique.

By the way, my grandparents had a lot of fun, and loved the kitty that came and visited us as we ate under the big tree. The lucky cat got a few pieces of bacon from them. They also let the cat clean their plates. 

I will recommend this to any family or friend who visits the area in a heartbeat.",7,0,2

He had seen an episode of Diner's, Drive Ins, and Dives, and thought the food looked really good. Since my brother was in town, I thought going to eat here would be something to do in my dad's memory. I had also seen the Diner's, Drive Ins, and Dives show about this place and thought it looked worth a try. After reading some of the reviews I must say I believe they are buying into some of the hype created by the aforementioned show. We went around noon, so we expected it to be busy, but the line to order was like standing in line waiting to board an amusement ride, as you circle through metal line dividers. You grab your menus from a menu holder up by the window. You figure this out on your own by the way. So after about a 20 minute wait, we get to the window. The woman taking our order could have cared less. Her hair was long (past her shoulders) and not tied back, or clipped up which I think isn't a good idea working around all that food. She was obviously not having a good day and got the order wrong. I didn't realize the order was wrong until we were outside at the fountain drink place. Thankfully my daughter went back inside to clarify the order. There was another line at the fountain drinks\/condiments area, but again, it was lunch time. They give you a beeper that signals when your food was ready. Our beeper went off, we gathered our food, and went to sit inside. There were plenty of people sitting outside, but being that it's June in Arizona, inside felt a lot better. This was especially true for my brother visiting from Seattle. He had almost melted in Texas due to the humidity, lol. My daughter had the grilled cheese, and sweet potato fries. She liked them both. My brother had the farm burger, and I ordered the barbecue chicken pizza. We ordered garlic fries, and onion rings on the side for all of us to sample. The pizza was ok. Granted I expected it to be phenomenal after watching the TV show, but it was just ok. The garlic fries, and onion rings were good. My brother said the farm burger was good as well. Now, the dark chocolate shake was heavenly! I ordered one of these as my dad loved chocolate shakes. He would have loved it. It is a cute place to eat as it's has such a retro feel to it, but the line was something my dad would not have enjoyed. After looking at some of the pics reviewing this restaurant, and reading the reviews, I think breakfast here looks really worth a try. The food is good but the experience was a little lacking.

Ordered their big breakfast which consisted of 3 scrambled eggs, 2 pcs bacon, 2 sausage links, cottage type potatoes and two pancakes. Let start with the time I ordered and the time I got my food. Try 21 minutes. I get buzzed to go pick up my food at the window, was never greeted at all. They just opened the sliding door and pushed out my orange tray with two black plates full of food. The scrambled eggs were cold and dry and unflavorful. They did add green chopped onions for color I guess but they had no flavor at all...quite bland. The potatoes weren't bad but neither anything to write home about. The sausage links as well as the bacon were on a second 8inch black plastic plate and were greasy, very greasy. My guess is that they put them over the pancakes so they will absorb all the grease. YUK!  The pancakes were some sort of a bright yellow color with brown glow to them. Huh, never seen anything like them before. Pancakes were cold,very flat and awfully dry.  No syrup was give to me and I had to go ask for it after the fact. The utensils and napkins are all out doors, you literally have to go outside to the backyard and get them yourself. It was raining this morning when I went and there just seemed to be alot of confusion going on with even the amount of customers they had.

Food menu item are way overpriced as well. I have been here before a few years back and it seems that the quality,service and attitude toward the business has somewhat declined.  I will more than likely stay away from this place for sometime and try it again in a couple of years again. They need to do some serious house cleaning if you know what I mean.",1,0,0

There has only been a few times where it hasn't been 100% satisfaction but by and large its been great. The onion rings are phenomenal and pretty much everything else is amazing. I am a stickler with burgers and their burgers aren't bad. I would always suggest getting something you probably couldn't make at home i.e. don't get burgers. The jumbo shrimp are some of the best I have ever had (and I come from South Carolina which says a lot). Their Tuna sandwhich is also 5 stars. This past time I got their BBQ sampler platter and it was as usual amazing. I am usually not a huge fan of coleslaw but it went great with the fried tenders and ribs. I always recommend going to Joe's Farm Grill at least every other month :),1,1,1

We had the Thai Chicken Salad and the pork ribs\/pulled pork combo.  The Thai Chicken salad came with 2 small grilled chicken breast, assorted greens, sugar snap peas, bean sprouts, sliced radishes, shredded carrots and celery along with a Thai vinaigrette dressing.  You could barely taste the dressing and it really didn't add much flavor.  The combo came with coleslaw and French fries.  We upgraded to onion rings for an additional $2.50.  Definitely worth the extra cost.  This was the best part of the meal.  The ribs were on the dry side, although the meat did sort of fall off the bones. The pulled pork was so so.

Looked up triple D locations and saw this place. My first impression was that I wonder if it's any good. My second impression was, I don't remember watching this on TV. Did not matter as it would have been a place to try anyway.

So before heading out we looked at the menu and wrote down what we wanted. We were driving from Phoenix and I didn't want to eat cold food. I called and placed the order and said it would be ready in about 10 minutes. Well when we drove up we were shocked to see a long line.

I went in trying to figure out what was going on. I saw the window that was for pick up and went is this where I pick up my order? It sure was. I was happy I called ahead and had paid for it in advance and was on my way. I saw the line for food and it was pretty long. I can't imagine the wait. 

Finally at the destination we sat and ate. We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and onion rings that were featured on the show as well as a burger. The pizza was pretty good and the onion rings. The first thing that came to my mind was it reminded me of another place I went to that was featured on triple D. Taylor's Refresher in Napa. It has that sort of feel to it.

Here are my highlights:

1. The pesto chicken sandwich. I order it without the bun, so it comes heaped with crisp dark lettuce, tomato, fresh sauteed mushrooms, and enough (house-made!) pesto to cover every bite.

2. The sweet potato fries with spicy-sweet pineapple dipping sauce. Never have healthy sweet potatoes tasted almost unhealthily delicious.

Ahi-Tuna - Excellent tuna, cooked rare, just the right amount of sauce to give it taste without being overwhelming of the fish.
Fried Fish - served on that Friday, I think it's seasonal?  Very well cooked fish, good tartar sauce as well.
Strawberry Lemonade, there's lots of chunks of strawberry. It's perfectly sweetened and sour at the same time. 
Fried Green Beans - pretty good, could have done without them though
Lamb Burger - it was the last day they were offering this, very well cooked mid-rare burger, great tazaki sp? sauce.  My favorite out of this and the Tuna.

The foliage on the burgers come from their Organic (according to the owners,but not certified) garden right on the premises.

And the fries that come with are super yummy. Definitely worth the $8.99 price tag. And for the sustainably-concious consumers, the menu states that the beef is local.

I've been to Joe's Farm Grill at least a dozen times and being a sad creature of habit have only ordered the one meal because I had hoped for more Organic choices.

The food was awesome. Very fresh, delicious and wholesome - you actually felt like you were eating food that was also good for you. Granted we just had the burgers and ice cream but there's a whole menu there to explore on future visits. I loved the signature burger with pesto & fontina, neither of which I had ever thought of but worked very well. The onion rings were good, as were the milkshakes and sundae. It really fills you up fast though, so try to pace yourself!

I was equally enchanted with the setting. Beautiful place. Just like a farm oasis in the midst of suburbia - I hope it doesn't vanish in the midst of the houses all around it. Even the bathroom was noteworthy - clean, black and white with dolls and a closed circuit tv. It reminded me of the Jetsons - you know, the 60s idea of space age. 

Sitting outside wasn't too hot, as it's the one place I've seen so far where the misters really work and don't just spray you and puddle down.  The only down side was when I asked where the farm stand was and the cashier pointed it out, but without mentioning it was closed.

A friend who used to live in AZ highly recommended Joe's to us.  After getting confused in the Loop a few times, we finally made it.

The Belgian Waffle and BBQ Pork Ribs was the dish of choice.  Waffles and Ribs for Breakfast?  We were in heaven!  I've told others of this combo and even showed them our photos.  They were disgusted and said that was the most unhealthy breakfast they'd ever heard of.  How can 4 smoked baby back ribs be worse for you than say 4 link sausages or 4 slices of bacon, both of which are fried?  Although the meat didn't fall off the bone, the ribs were tender.  I wasn't fond of the sauce, it was a little too tangy for my taste. (see photo)

The fresh apple mini fritters were also a hit.  They're fried fresh to order, served hot, and rolled in cinnamon sugar.  (see photo)

We also had the chicken and mushroom scramble.  Grilled chicken, mushrooms, caramelized onion, fontina + cream cheese.  It was good, but definately not my favorite of the three, and I probably wouldn't order it again.

Sure enough the drive over from north west mesa was worth it. Everything from the parking on the unique looking pavers from the tall trees said this place was special!

The friendly young lady at the counter tossed out a suggestion for the Buffalo chicken sandwich and I went for it. Now here is the kicker.. I firmly dislike anything that has to do with blue cheese.. So when i received my amazing looking platter and inside the burger there it was I almost took it back.

I tried it anyways rather than order something else or scrape it off.. and WOW. My taste buds loved it! My girlfriend knows I talk a lot.. well I was all but quiet for once as I finished every bite lol


While out side the place has a very warm, back home, family feeling, just a very positive experience! I was told this place was amazing, looks like Ill be saying the same thing to others!

One thing I was hoping for on the wonderful drink station was the red cream soda you have at the BBQ rest.. but the tea was well enough to put away my dismay.

Don't get me wrong I will always love their breakfast tacos even though on occasion their potatoes are overcooked.

Which isint a big deal if you eat there but when you take it to go, it's not something you wanna drive back for. They don't open your food when they give it to you to go so always make sure you check it yourself. Because it will save ya the drive and having your food half cold by the time you drive back home. Also today they told me they don't do ""no ice"" on drinks.  I ordered a lemonade and when I ordered the drink with no ice they didn't tell me anything about their policy. So when I got the drink, it had ice. I tried to get one without ice and they told me their manager tells their employees to put ice on their lemonades regardless if the customer asked for it otherwise. Had the lady told me at first I probably wouldn't have ordered it. With this order alone not only did they forget to tell me about their no ice policy but the girl over the phone forgot to add the extra side of beans I had ordered over the phone.

There's still not a whole lot going on in this area. It's still cow-town, farming central for Gilbert, although a lot has popped up recently. When this restaurant rolled into town, I was thrilled. 

First, they try to get all their produce from their local farm 1st. If they can't supply everything for their restaurant from their farm, they buy from local farmers 2nd, and then (and only then) will they go out-of-state for their produce. Also, their meat is naturally raised from AZ. Local produce + local meat = are you kidding me?!?! They deserve 5 stars for that alone! They also have recycling bins for your cups and plates. If more restaurants would follow suit in these aspects, do you know how much waste can be saved, or how much this BOOSTS our local economy, or how much healthier we would be as a society? Supporting business that buy locally is not only FAR nutritionally superior because the transit time decreases, but people generally don't get a side of pesticides, herbicides, hormones, and antibiotics with their meal when you buy locally. So, A+++ for the fact that Joe's Farm Grill has gotten on board with this and really taken it above and beyond what most establishments in this price range are willing to do, or even want to do. 

I didn't know they had naturally raised meat until I caught it on the Food Network, and that made me even happier. I've always been amazed at their charbroiled hamburgers- they've been some of the best I've had. The fries are groovy too. I've had a salad as well as the grilled cheese. The salad was large and delicious but there was something lurking in it that was making it taste ""strange."" I think it was just my own personal preference though. The grilled cheese had Fontina in it, and as I found out the hard way, Fontina is gross. I should have known...I don't like weird cheeses on traditional American white trash food. They taste like dirty socks in my mouth. If I knew what Fontina tasted like I wouldn't have gotten it, that's my bad.

It's more expensive than your average fancier burger joint, but nothing too outrageous.

At Joe's you place your order inside a vintage 1960s farmstead building.  Don't let the line deter you - it will give you time to study the menu and read about the history of the farm.  After you've ordered, they'll give you a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready.  

I went with a group, which gave me an opportunity to sample several of the house specialties.  My favorite was the grilled peanut butter and banana sandwich with strawberries, pineapple and chocolate chips.  It sounded bizarre enough that none of us wanted to take a chance on ordering it, so we agreed to get one to split.  It was so amazing - with crispy toast and bursting with fruit and nut flavors - that I instantly regretted not ordering a whole one for myself.  If you try one, I recommend substituting some crispy sweet potato fries for the regular ones that come with it.  These fries are served with a delicious pineapple and jalapeno relish.

For my main dish I got the fontina burger.  The pecan pesto nicely complemented the fontina cheese and grilled mushrooms, and the burger came with a generous stack of garnishes like lettuce and tomato.  With this one I'd substitute in the garlic fries - I could sit down and eat a whole dish of these scrumptiously seasoned beauties for dinner.

 First of all, the layout is just kind of silly.  I totally understand that this is an olllldddd building, so you work with what you're given.  That being said, the entrance\/exit is too small and the condiment line backs up into that exit.  It's really frustrating that people feel some need to create a single file line to get sodas, napkins, utensils and condiments when really, there is A LOT of room to share.  It's a really long condiment bar!  Second of all it's way out there for us.  Living in Downtown Phoenix makes the trek out to Gilbert pretty rough sometimes.  Finally, they wouldn't let me sub a smaller version of the green bean fries for regular fries, even though I was willing to pay more than the normal sub fee.

On to the good... The grilled cheese I got was really yummy.  It was made with really thick Texas Toast style bread, had some great cheese on the inside, and it was toasted\/grilled just right.  It was a very hearty grilled cheese!  The green bean fries that I wanted just a single sized portion of turned out to be like 3 pounds piled high in a basket!  They were really good and garlicky, and for only 5 bucks a great value.  However, I really just wanted enough for myself because as it turns out, I continued eating them until I made myself sick. 

Overall, I liked the place, but it seems to be constantly busy and I just don't like getting crowded when I'm trying to eat a nice relaxing meal outside.",3,1,3

You can walk 2 minutes away down to the farm and look at all their beautiful flowers, plants, and produce that they grow. GREAT place to let the kids run around.

Highlights from the menu:
Salmon Salad (If you are a Salmon fan, this is for you)
Farm Veggie Burger (LITERALLY the best one I've ever had, no lie)
Any of the pizzas
Any of the BBQ plates
Garlic Fries (A MUST)
Any of their shakes (they vary from season to season, all used with fresh ingredients from the farm!)

Vegans: Eating here is limited. All bread items, including pizza crust, contain dairy or eggs. The buns, I get it. But pizza crust? I don't understand why restaurants feel the need to add milk or eggs to the pizza dough. It doesn't add anything. And I was hoping to try the veggie pizza sans cheese, but no dice. The good thing about being a vegan and eating here is they have an allergen folder, that has the list of ingredients in all of their items. Which was nice. The girl who took our order was super sweet and gave me some options. Which basically includes all of the salads, without meat or cheese, and any of the vinaigrette dressing options.  I opted for the portabello farm salad which was a mixture of fresh veggies (beets, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, carrots, corn) on top of lettuce with a sliced portabello on top. I got the balsamic vinaigrette dressing. The good thing about the salads here is you can tell the veggies are really fresh. Everything tasted really good. But the salads are huge!! Which is good because they are expensive. My salad was $10 and I barely finished half of it. So I took it home to eat for lunch today. I also got the sweet potato fries with the pineapple and serrano dipping sauce. Those were also awesome. So you can eat here as a vegan, you choices are just limited. But the cashiers are willing to help find you options, which is nice.

Now for non vegans: My sister got the farm burger with mushrooms added and said it was the best burger shes ever had. My mom had the barbeque pork sandwich and loved that as well. My husband had the portabello burger. The food here is really good. All fresh and delicious. 

Suggestions for Joe's: How about looking into some dairy\/egg free bread and pizza crust options? Maybe some wheat bread options as well? I would love to come back here and have something other than a salad. Pretty please??",2,0,1

The onion rings were hand dipped and fried in panko breadcrumbs, crispy and hot.  The ribs were fall off the bone and so lean!  The burger was melt in your mouth.  
The only issue I did  have was that seating was hard to come by for us and the other couple we came with.  Their son needed a highchair, so we ended up outside.  Which seemed to be nice, even cool, (in June)  but as soon as the boys brought the food out there was a swarm of nasty flies!  They were everywhere, I literally couldn't eat without having to move my arms around my plate to keep them at bay.  We had to take the party inside.  It was croweded and difficult to get the highchair to the table.  So maybe not the greatest if you've got kids.  Otherwise, worth the trip.",2,0,1

It's a little pricier than your average burger joint but this place has a unique appeal to it with it's farm fresh food.

We even tried a strawberry milkshake - a total treat for us since we hate wasting calories on beverages - but this one was worth the splurge.

Took the wife there tonight.  We had the pork sandwich.  I had cole slaw.  She had onion rings.
She had unsweetened tea, I had diet coke.

1.  The price is fair for the meal but outrageous for the drink.
2.  Without a doubt, this was the worst cole slaw I've ever had.  Raw cabbage would have had more flavor.
3.  Her tea tasted funny.  I didn't like it either.  Threw it out and got something else.
4.  The onion rings were different.  Very large.  about 5-6 in total.  Tasted good.
5.  The pork was good, similar to Joe's BBQ, except no real selections on BBQ sauce.

Mission impossible.

The place was busy since it was a holiday, but we still ordered and received our food within 40 minutes of parking!
The menu was diverse! Date shakes, home made onion rings, ribs, burgers, pizzas, salads and lamb! There was a lot of opportunity to personalize your food with topping and sauces as well. 
We sat at a picnic table surrounded by grass, trees and a farm was in sight. It was beyond charming!
I ordered the veggie burger (made in-house from beans and 10 veggies) and sweet potato fries. C got baby back ribs and Cole slaw. We were both very happy with our selections!

We were visiting Scottsdale and took a minor detour to check this place out after we arrived at Mesa Airport.

Atmosphere\/service: 5\/5 This place is basically in farm country, with a community garden you should definitely check out behind it and farmer ""joe"" on the tractor giving us a big smile and wave in 90 degree heat in a button up cotton shirt driving by on his farm which is adjacent to the community garden.  This restaurant is one of a kind.  It's an old building redone in a modern fashion with ""gardens"" and huge trees surrounding it with a ton of picnic tables for you to take your grub outside and chill.  Check out the bathrooms, they are ridiculous with old school movies playing on the tv above the urinal amongst other things. Crowds were large but the lines moved fast, they have their logistics down.

Food 4\/5
We ordered the BBQ plate which was out of this world.  amazing rubs and bbq they use was delicious.  Their famous onion rings were somewhat of a let down, they were good but fell short of expectations (especially being featured on the food network).  We also had their coleslaw which was  5\/5 and then their beet\/bluecheese salad which was also very good. We also had their chocolate milkshake and added peanut butter which was redonk-good.  So many bomb sounding things on this menu I could go back 5 times and still not try everything I wanted to.  I'm into sauces too and once you get your food you can go over to the fountain drink station and there is literally 10 awesome sauces you can choose from.

I personally enjoy supporting local establishments and so, I was very stoked we finally made it in. I LOVE veggies! I mean, it's apparent at this point through life that I only eat meat when I'm craving it. So, I've tried a whole heck of a lot of veggie burgers and mushroom burgers. I am never quite sure what to expect and though there are a few joints that have a decent ""veggie"" burger many of them never have exactly what I'm looking for. Up until this point there has  been no mushroom burger that I would order again, anywhere... Typically, if I'm paying attention and see the veggie burger is a Portobello burger or Boca burger, I will change my order....Until now.

There is an awesome outdoor seating area and though it was pretty busy, we sat inside, it seemed like a pleasant spot to enjoy a meal. I went with the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich with side beets and a strawberry lemonade. Holy moly! The first bite of my burger was exceedingly impressive. I could tell the mushroom was marinated or something because it was packed full of flavor rather than just a plain bland mushroom on a  bun. The bun itself was obviously fresh and delicious as well. I'm not sure one can go wrong with a side of beets and they were just that, fresh beets. The lemonade was in high demand and that was really the only thing I ended up waiting for.

I would absolutely go back to Joe's. In fact, I look forward to our next meal there and an opportunity to try some other menu items, although, the mushroom sandwich alone would bring me back again.

I've been eating burgers a long time and have never experienced this before. This was by far the most undercooked burger I've ever seen.  Usually ground beef is always cooked thoroughly due to increased risk of hamful bacteria such as e.coli.  This is of particular concern for small children and the elderly.

I urged him to consider Agritopia.  I extolled the virtues of the charming neighborhoods, tree lined streets, real front porches, alley accessed garages, the centrally located elementary school for our son, the availability of fresh produce raised within the subdivision, and I went on and on but he wasn't having it.  I think he secretly suspected that I was trying to indoctrinate him into some new fangled 21st century commune or something.  

Now I realize exactly what I did wrong.  I didn't force him to come get a meal at Joe's Farm Grill, which just happens to be within a stone's throw to Agritopia and also uses Agritopia's produce garden.  (Or maybe it's Joe's Farm Grill garden and Agritopia uses it?  I dunno, but I do know the two are somehow linked.)    If I had only dragged him into Joe's Farm Grill I could have sealed the deal, I'm sure of it.

Joe's is a really neat little place, surrounded by towering Tamarack trees that have been there forever.  The structure was originally the late 1950's to early 1960's ranch style family home (and former farm) of the same family that now owns Joe's.  Also the family has two other top-notch restaurants, Joe's Real BBQ and Liberty Grill.  The house has since been professionally and radically retrofitted into be a sleek, yet still somehow retro, restaurant, with bathrooms that are so fun and funky that you just have to go there and see for yourself what I mean.  (Trust me.)  The restaurant still retains the old front room of the original house, including the fire place, and it is now a dining room.  It's not hard at all to imagine Joe's family settled around their Christmas tree in their pajamas in the mid-1960's opening presents, completely oblivious to the fact that someday their front room would be a seating area for one of the best places to eat in the whole damn Valley.  Yep, I said it: One of the best places to eat in the whole damn Valley; that is NO exaggeration.

The food here is amazing.  It's wildly flavorful, perfectly cooked, and deliciously paired with different sides and it's all reasonably priced to boot.  They know what they do here, and they do it perfectly.  My personal favorite here is the seared Ahi Tuna sandwich with a Wasabi dressing.  I can't even describe how good it is.  It's just a flat out flavor bomb.  (Tip: I will reiterate that the tuna is seared, so if you get it and are expecting a fully cooked tuna steak you will be confused and perhaps even disappointed; don't be, just eat it and savor the deliciousness of a perfectly seared tuna steak on a toasted bun with a wonderful Wasabi dressing and a zesty Asian slaw.)  It is my favorite sandwich from anywhere, ever.  I have also tasted their pizzas, burgers, hot dogs, shakes (come topped with a green cherry!) and French fries and all have been outstanding.  I really cannot find a single criticism for this place.

Oh wait, I just thought of one criticism; that there isn't a Joe's Farm Grill closer to my home, since my ex refused to let us buy a house there.   *pout*",19,8,17

The first time I ate here, I had the Fontina Burger, and was quite underwhelmed.  I also had the date shake, which had barely any date in it.  I didn't want to write the place off, however, since Joe's Real BBQ is one of my favorite restaurants.

This time, I went with the hot dogs: Carolina and Sonoran.  The Carolina dog sounded pretty good, with its pulled pork, BBQ sauce, and slaw toppings.  It was decent, but not as awesome as I thought it'd be.  The franks seemed to be decent quality, and the buns were nice.  If you get a dog, this is probably the best option.

Now, I knew going in that the Sonoran Dog would not be an authentic Sonoran dog.  Sour cream?  Really?  But I tried it anyways, hoping it would at least be good, even if not a Sonoran Dog.  It was underwhelming; seriously, guys, at least make it spicy.  If it doesn't even have that in common with a real Sonoran Dog, why is it called that?  A Sonoran Dog has pinto beans, bacon, mayo, mustard, pico de gaullo, tomatillo sauce, is served on a bolillo roll, and is served with a grilled hot pepper.  You can't just slap some bacon and beans on a hot dog and call it a Sonoran Dog.  This should be a crime.  This is a blatant affront to all of the hardworking Mexican immigrants who, through their efforts, created Arizona's finest contribution to the culinary landscape.

The chicken finger looked very good and I guess they were.  The hot dog was nothing special but the ribs were finger lickin good.  The burger looked juicy and the date shake was full of pieces of dates but the end result was that it didn't taste much different than the vanilla shake.

Usually what gets them going is the fact that I mention that this place was on Food Network. I remember seeing the show and being very interested in trying it since it was nearby.
My favorite thing about this place is of course the food. It is all grown on their farm and if it isn't, it is locally grown and organic. The food wows my every time. I love it. My all time favorites are the Ahi Tuna Sandwich, the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich, and fried green beans (although I no longer see it on the menu, which saddens me). I have also had their burgers and I can seriously tell the difference between their beef and beef from other restaurants. To explain how I can tell the difference, my family bought a cow years ago and had it cut up to produce various selections that we split with another family. To me, a lot of beef tastes disgusting except for what I buy straight from a butcher AND from Joes Farm Grill. That alone is my reasoning for instantly loving this place.
Joes Farm Grill has many different food selections to choose from and I suggest trying all of them. All are very delicious in their own right.",0,0,0

Head outside when the weather is nice and sit under one of dozens of huge, gorgeous old trees to enjoy your meal at a picnic table. The kids love running around in the grass and chasing the birds. The building has a cool history, if you're from the area and remember when the land was all farms. Try the hamburgers with grilled onions and the sweet potato fries- DELISH!!! Get there early for the lunch rush, as lines can stretch out of the building and down to the parking lot during spring and fall months. The staff is always courteous and the tables are sparkling clean. Even the bathrooms are kinda fun, with retro cartoons playing on small tv's in the walls. Make sure you hit them up on your birthday, for $10 towards your meal.

I think this place however is a bit over-rated just because it was on TV. To me it seems like diner food but with better ingredients, but I guess that's the point. It's the kind of place, if I rolled up and one of the obscene lines were forming, I would go somewhere else. 

Eating outside, where the majority of the seating is located, is a pain. We had a ton of flies around last time, which my daughter kept freaking about. So we try to stick to the limited inside seating. We've also had 2 orders incorrect in the past, which were corrected, just not ideal when a hungry 3 year old is in the mix. Another downside is they do not serve alcohol, so a beer with a decent burger is out of the mix, and frankly seems just wrong.

I will say this is a neat place to take the kids, and yeah will go back for them and my wife who really likes the veggie burgers. Service is always friendly and even when it's busy they seem to be pretty quick with food delivery. And the food is actually pretty tasty and menu is pretty good selection wise.

The food is so good, it is delivered in a casual atmosphere you have the choice of eating indoors in what used to be the living room of this farm or outdoors in a patio setting or under the trees on picnic tables. This place is good for young families.

The ambiance is very cool and many people come here regularly. But, it's called Joes FARM grill, so get something that's grown on the Agrotopia farm.  It's super fresh and tasty.  I recommend the Thai chicken salad, Beet salad, Farm salad or BBQ chicken salad.  All have fresh vegetables straight from the farm.

Admittedly, the burgers are good, especially the Fontina burger. Yum. Add fresh homemade onion rings and garlic fries and you can be in that naughty little zone of eating fast food that you know isn't really healthy while at the same time justifying it by  having a salad too!

It has been featured several times on the Food Network, and was on an episode of Guy Fieri's ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives,"" which have definitely put the restaurant on the map. 

Everything about the place has character.  For example, the menu has standard hamburgers, as well as unique and tasty items like the Ahi Sandwich, or whatever special they happen to offer that is not on the menu.  When I was there, they were offering Pork Tenderloin and fresh-squeezed lemonade.  Everything we got was great. 

The restaurant itself is located on a working farm, and has a nifty little outdoor seating area with benches underneath a huge and ancient pepper tree that provides some shade from the heat of the sun.  There is also a little grassy area where kids can run around, play, or have a picnic.  After you eat, you can also walk through various areas of the farm.  You can make your visit here a short one, or stay all afternoon.  There's a lot to see. 

Though there are only two bathrooms, they are clean, and feature old school barbies and G.I. Joes in stainless steel, LED-lit cases in the walls.  They've also got old episodes of the Thunderbirds playing on small T.V.'s.  It's unique and compellingly awesome, like so much about this restaurant. 

Be advised, however, that it can get slammed with customers on the weekends, and if you don't get there before the rush, be prepared to wait!  This is despite the fact that they are prepared to handle volume and pump out the food at an incredibly fast pace.

Than Joes Farm Grill is the place for you. Even if you have simple tastes Joes Farm Grill will have something to suit your needs.  It has beautiful decoration, great food and affordable prices, so why not pay a visit. 
Joes Farm Grill has a long historical background, with a house originally built in 1966 by the Johnston family. In later years it was decided to turn the farm into a restaurant with its food being home grown or locally brought in. The house development around the farm is Agritopia, and was dedicated to permanent urban farming. In fact if you live in the development surrounding the restaurant you can rent a garden lot to grow vegetables.  All of their products are certified USDA organic, and their focus is common food done uncommonly. They feel fresh food taste better and are better for you so why not share all that with the customers. They take the foods taste to a new level with all of the recipes and ingredients. 
Joes Farm Grill is delicious, unique and a fun experience. I feel most restaurants are chains and don't have the history behind them like Joes does, and because of this it makes the experience much more special. Knowing your food is organic makes it taste ten times better, and knowing you don't have to spend a fortune for organic makes me want to go again. It's really stands out among most and everyone in the chandler area needs to stop by and visit. 
 First walking up to the twelve acre masterpiece is like going through a farm, with orange trees covering the path and large oaks surrounding it which gives a beautiful green glow of a garden.  It smells fresh and gives you an earthy vive. They are enormous and full of green vegetables that look extremely appetizing. They are covering most of the land and you can walk through them and see your food growing.  The building is white with large windows showing the back and the front equally, and the inside has simple decorations with light blue and green accents not to overpower the beauty of the vegetation growing outside. It holds no more than a hundred people and is rather spacious seating. The entire restaurant is very simple with a 60s feel mixed with a futuristic time. I ordered the jumbo breaded shrimp with fries, French toast banana peanut butter sandwich and the barbeque chicken pizza. I went with my sister because the portions are rather large and I could not have eaten it by myself. This was my first time visiting the restaurant and my sisters second. Everything so far was very pleasant and the employees were very nice. No more than ten minutes later our food was ready and it looked and smelt great. We sat down and I tried each dish, starting with the shrimp which were very large. The shrimp was crunchy and juicy and was simple and not overpowering. I thought it tasted very good and wasn't too rich which is a problem I normally find when ordering shrimp. Then I tried the French toast peanut butter sandwiches that surprisingly had strawberry's in it too. This was one of the best tasting things I have ever had! It was a house specialty and lives up to its name. It tasted like a gourmet peanut butter sandwich and was so flavorful and sweet. I had to order another one. Then I tried the barbeque pizza, I liked it but it wasn't my favorite. It was thin crust and slightly burnt, but it did taste good with the cheese and chicken combination. It just tasted like there was too many ingredients on the pizza that overpowered it. The prices weren't that bad either, the shrimp was the most expensive at 14.99 when I go again I probably won't order this again, just because it wasn't a to die for dish.  The peanut butter sandwiches were 10.99 and I crave these every day it was amazing! Than last the pizza was 12.99, my sister liked it more than I did so it depends on your taste but I probably will try something else. 
The most important part though is the food, and not to leave you hanging was no matter what spectacular. Fresh fries galore. The most appealing part to me was the decorations and the gardens surrounding the place. I think the set up as if you're in a food court is a really interesting concept; you have to throw away your own food on trays, and clean up after yourself. I didn't expect that and I think it's a smart move on the restaurants part.  The calm and relaxing atmosphere, and no rush pace is really nice. 
I enjoyed Joes Farm Grill and I plan on visiting again. I think the organic concept and urban farming is a really nice thing to hear about in today's society. I feel better knowing I'm eating organic, and knowing there are still places that are going strong with the idea of organic. I hope the success of this restaurant shows others they can do the same. This restaurant meets all my needs as a customer, clean, green and tasty what more could you want.",0,0,0

Over all cool place with good food .  It is what I would consider to be a bit hyped and way to busy to be enjoyable on a consistent basis .   The food usually has a good quality and is not greasy and well cooked and they will always take care of any issues but it's over priced for what you get .  I recently went for breakfast and got the ""big breakfast "" which has 2 sausage 2 bacon some pancakes and eggs and potatoes which is a lot of food but it's still $10 and then $2 for a coffee ( which the coffee was definitely Burnt ).  The manager is always kind to us and we generally like the place when we have more time than normal to wait in line and a bit extra to pay since $30 for breakfast for 2 is costly ( in my opinion ) .

The building is modern and funky, the surrounding green space is cool and inviting, and the food is reliably good.

Order at the walk-up counter and keep up because the line can move quickly. The line can be long during busy hours, so I try to avoid peak times, especially because the wails of poorly managed children echo painfully loudly in the high-ceilinged counter area. (And unfortunately, there always seems to be at least one family ignoring a screaming kid in the place.) Once you've placed your order, you can take the order-is-ready buzzer and go find a seat inside or on the patio or yard seating.

I've tried a number of things on the menu, all of which have been good. The Ahi sandwich has a generous portion of perfectly seared tuna. It was too much food (and the wasabi dressing was a bit to spicy for me) and the meal turned out to be a drippy mess, but I liked it.

The barbeque chicken pizza is good but usually too wet (I like pizza crisp), and I also recommend the pepperoni pizza. The Asian salad is delicious; Joe's salads definitely show off how fresh all the ingredients are. I recently tried the ribs and pulled pork platter. It was big enough to feed two adults, and both meats were excellent.

The best item on the menu is the sweet potato fries. It's a large portion of not greasy (maybe baked?), mildly seasoned thin-sliced fries with a mango\/pineapple chutney on the side. I upgrade to them at every opportunity. I also suggest keeping an eye out for seasonal\/special items; I once tried a date shake and it was fantastic.

You must try the garlic fries.  I simply could not have enough of the garlic fries.  I'd be happy if I can just have the garlic fries, next time.  

My husband loved the fontina burger. 

I liked the ahi sandwich, but I wish it was a bit more rare.  It said 'rare' on the menu but it not the sushi kind of rare (barely grilled on each side kind of rare).  It's a tad more cooked than to my liking.  The asian coleslaw is not your typical kind of coleslaw.  They add a very nice touch to it, making it light, with a slight asian flavor, but the maker is the mild wasabi mayo.  The mayo simply put, is the BOMB!!

Honestly I hadn't thought that far yet. So I acknowledge and ask her to call me when she is on her way or at least close by. I figured by the time she arrived I would have a place selected. Naturally I opt for Joe's Farm Grill for two reasons: 1) she said she was buying and 2) for the fact I had never been there.

We jumped in her new car and speed off like two kids chasing down the neighborhood ice cream man. As we pulled up we noticed the Joe's Farm Grill sign and what appeared to be a combination of a large vertical bush and very large tree that resembled a hand flipping the bird. Well it looked like that from our angle. From the looks of the place they had plenty of outdoor seating in the front and back of the place. However today being as windy and rainy as it was we parked ourselves inside. Inside at the counter there were three windows and each window had flat-screens nested above it. Not sure what they were for because they all were off, but I suspect during their peak times it may display the menu. I walked up to the first available window which was the only one open at the time. With the kitchen noises in the background it made it a little difficult to hear. That was pretty much our only interaction with the staff aside from the brief interaction at the pick up window.

When my sister was handed her cup the teller quickly mentioned that the soda fountain machine was located outside. We both turned and looked at each other and paused for a moment and thought, Outside? We walked towards the seating area and we noticed a door to the outside and just steps passed the doorway reviled the fountain machine and sauce dispensing stations. Groovy. Just slighty beyond that is a unisex bathroom which has dolls in small display cases embedded in the walls. Two by the toilet and one by the sink. Also strategically placed is a flat screen monitor above the urinal (plays movies about dolls from what I saw), which you can also watch while on the commode. The best part was a small sign implying ""Use the lock button for privacy"" for those not used to having locks for the bathroom.

I have read about Joe's Farm Grill before and every time I review their menu the Fontina Burger always catches my attention for what ever reason. Perhaps because it comes prepared with roasted red peppers, grilled mushrooms, arugula, pesto and fontina cheese. Joe's Farm Grill is known for their use of locally raised and natural beef which is a major plus. Also they have a nice selection of cheeses: American, Cheddar, Swiss, Fontina and Blue of course. For the health conscientious customer they offer any of their 1\/2 lb burgers with multi-grain buns upon request. Last but not least all burgers come with a side of fries which can be substituted for an additional fee, but cooked with trans-fat free oil no less.

I decided to follow my instinct and ordered the Fontina Burger, but decided to upgrade my fries to onion rings and opted for a strawberry shake. My sister ordered the Farm Burger with the fries and water. Seeing that the place was not busy we chose to sit in the front dining area.

It wasn't long before our buzzer began to vibrate and like a well trained ninja I spring out of my seat (tip toeing through the air) and within seconds I was at the pickup window. Did I mention I was starving? Both meals were served in black baskets lined with tinfoil. The aroma alone had me hypnotized and the roasted peppers had me salivating.

Typically I reach for the condiments and begin to pour on the ketchup, mustard or what have you. This time something told me to give it a whirl as-is. Just add the lettuce, tomatoes and red onions and try it as-is. So I go with my instinct again and I am glad I did. Wow! Juicy, tender, flavorful and delicious. The combination of the arugula, pesto, red peppers, mushrooms and the fontina cheese hits you all at once like a fierce side kick to your taste buds. I am talking about (Whack! Pow! Bang!) as if I were in an old batman episode.

This was one heavenly treat and I must say that I found a new favorite. The Fontina Burger takes first place knocking the Haunted burger down a notch. The onion rings on the other hand were ridiculously crunchy to the point of over crunchiness. To put it simply I should have stuck with the standard fries because those were awesome.  I almost lost a hand as I kept sampling my sisters fries and the shake, oh the shake... wonderful. I love shakes especially when they are made with fresh seasonal fruits. Delicious!

I liked the fact that I did not have to add anything to this masterpiece. It was perfect as it was served, hot, juicy, tender and wonderful. I was very impressed with quality of the food and the establishment is fantastic. I honestly wish I had known about Joe's Farm Grill much sooner! Thank you for the great experience... expect us back real soon!",2,0,0

It is indeed a ""Farm to Table"" experience in Gilbert.  Very nice area, and a very neat, well kept farm.  At least you know where the majority of what you're about to eat came from.  This part of the Phoenix metro area was all agricultural at one point.  As the borders of the city expanded, farmland got bought out and became residential areas.  There are small areas still located within these cities that are farmed, and this is one of them.

My wife and I had the special ""Double Swiss Mushroom Dijon Farm Burger"".  It's not on their regular menu and we thought we'd give it a try.

It was a decent burger, but not the best I've ever had.  Needed a little salt.  Can't say it was bad.  We had the onion rings, which is in their specially herbed Panko bread crumbs.  It was fair, but not particularly flavorful.  The fresh lemonade was a very good, tart lemonade.  I had the date shake.  Good, thick shake, but I tasted mostly vanilla--didn't get a whole lot of date flavor.

It was Sunday at noon, so it was a good crowd.  We only had to wait 30 minutes though.  I have to say a good farm to table experience, and I'm glad the food is very fresh.  Service was just table busing.  You order your food at a window, sit at your table, and pick up once your buzzer goes off.

I was hoping for more in terms of flavor though.",1,0,0

This, of course, meant that the rest of the world also read the many positive Yelp reviews and knew it was the perfect day to stop into Joe's. Why waste a sunny, cool day inside?

I waited in the half-hour-long line while Husband sat in back with the dog at one of the picnic tables once the line started getting inside. There was a worker dude who would helpfully hand out laminated menus to us line-standers and answer any questions we had. He highly suggested the Fontina burger, but I already knew what I wanted: a cheeseburger with sautéed onions, a side of onion rings and fried zucchini, and a chocolate milkshake. 

After I ordered, I was given a little buzzer\/beeper thingy for when the food was ready. It took just long enough for me to check out their super clean bathroom with the dolls in the walls and the doll movie on the tv before the food was ready. YUM that milkshake! I really liked my cheeseburger, but Husband wasn't too impressed. We both liked the onion rings, but left a lot of the fried zucchini in favor of drinking our milkshakes (he got vanilla bean). My biggest problem actually ended up being the ranch that we requested for the sides... it tasted really off. The consistency wasn't right and it didn't compliment the food at all. I am a firm believer that onion rings need to be dunked in something, so I ended up dunking in my ketchup. It worked, but I wished for something better.

There were a lot of other dogs lying around under picnic tables, so that was pretty cool to see. There is also a bird group that gathers (I'm pretty sure they were parrots, but I can't say for sure. I know they were very colorful and friendly!) some weekends out at one of the front tables while they eat. Parents and kids would wander over to talk to the bird handlers, which was neat.

This was so yummy the crust in the meat was perfect and very little fat. I discovered the cheesy potatoes my new favourite side. I actually think the other sides are not so good   The only consistent downside of the meal is the bread. What ever they spray on the grill or the bread just leaves a really bad taste on the bread. The bread would be a wonderful vehicle to sop up extra sauce but the taste of the oil (whatever it is ). Leaves such a bad taste I usually throw the bread away. I always get the bread in hope the bad taste has gone,1,0,0

Cons: Long drive unless you live way out in east Gilbert. The wait was WAY too long for no reason. The line was long but nothing crazy. There was only one cashier even though there were two windows. This was at 12:30 pm on a Tuesday so you'd think they'd at least have 2 cashiers going at that busy time. 

Bottom line: It took us 30 minutes to drive there from Elliot and 48th, we waited in line for another 30 minutes and our food came within 10 minutes. While the food was good, you can definitely find something as good if not better much closer to a central location, like the Farm or House of Tricks, which is very similar but with much better service.",0,0,0

So one day my daughter got out of school early, and we rushed to try it before the line starts. Which worked, only two families in front of us.  To start, the atmosphere was NOT my thing (note one star missing).  It reminded me of a concession stand at a zoo (flies and all).  

But the food was sensational. I ordered the Blue Cheese and Bacon Burger, which was one the best burgers I've had in AZ.  My daughter ordered the chicken tenders, which were delicious (we always share a bite, just to compare).  We don't usually eat fries, but even their fries were good.

The fruit was good and fresh.

I mean, if it's been featured on ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"" and Guy Fieri approved it, it must be good. *sarcastic eye roll*

But to be real, Joe's Farm Grill is next level. Just to point out a few of my favorite things on the menu (though everything I've had here has been delicious), I love the Southwest Burger (topped with taco rub, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo, chipotle mayo, and avocado), the Buffalo Chicken and Farm-Made Pecan Pesto Chicken Sandwiches, and any of the grilled pizzas or BBQ items--I realize that that's like a third of the menu but seriously all of these are bomb. The pizzas and barbecue are similar to what's available at Joe's other restaurants so you can't go wrong there and the Burgers, Chicken Sandwiches, and ""Farm Favorites"" are all welcome additions to the already delicious spread. Make sure to get either the Onion Rings (my personal favorite), Garlic Fries, or Sweet Potato Fries (which come with a delicious pineapple-serrano dipping sauce) on the side of whatever you order!

Aside from the food, I love the setting here too, with plenty of outdoor seating at picnic tables for nice days and room inside to eat when it gets too hot (or cold...but let's be honest with ourselves here, this is Arizona).

After crediting me back for the drinks he ""thought"" i was getting he had chased me down and humiliated me for 40 cents! Not a very good manager. Secondly, they sure do use a lot of throw aways, plastic and paper- not great for the environment. Food was OK, not great- lots of fried items, if that is healthy? I defiantly will not be going back or recommending them to my friends and family in the area, especially after their mistake ringing up our drinks- and then chasing me down for a measly 40 cents.

My wife and I live near downtown Phoenix\/Mid Town, so when people give us restaurant recommendations to trendy spots, we love to check them out. This place was horrendous. First of all the wait, when we went, there was a line, we later discovered the reason for the line was they had one person on the register. Even though the owner was out shaking hands and getting ready to leave, the second register was never opened. By the time we got to order, 50 minutes had passed and we got to the point of where ""maybe"" the food quality may make up for the horrible wait.

Nope! It took about 5 minutes to actually get our food, so the issue wasn't food prep, it was just the horrible logistics of this business. I ordered a farm burger, medium with bacon and cheese. What I got resembled something that had been marinated in grease for about 12 years then under cooked and served on a delicious bun, but 2 minutes into the meal the bun resembled a soggy rag. The fries had a weird taste to them, I ended up not eating my meal. My wife got through about half of her burger before she complained about the greasiness.

I put the burger quality on par with an in-and-out, smash burger, five guys style burger. However, would you wait 30+ minutes for one of those?

There is indoor and outdoor seating, and the outdoor is nice and relaxed, some people even bring well-behaved dogs and children that can go on the grassy areas down the yardspace.

Also... in terms of the line... THEY HAVE ONE PERSON TAKING ORDERS!!!  The line is huge, and they have 2-3 registers...  They could easily make it go more quickly if they were organized... but it appears they like to make their customers wait for mediocre food...  

The shame, is that a lot of things on their menu sound and look good... but the flavor isn't there overall, or it has a TGIF Friday's kind of vibe to it...  Just having farm fresh ingredients isn't enough JOE!  Where's the flavor?  Where's the technique?  

I had their famous burger, it was thin and in need of seasoning...  My fiancee had the BBQ Pork Sandwich... which tasted like chain BBQ...  Not a ""bad"" meal, but definitely not worth all the hype... or the line... or the price tag...  

Overall, it should be three stars, but I'm giving it two because it doesn't live up to its own hype!  If you're gonna talk the talk, you need to walk the walk!",1,1,1

The atmosphere is cute for sure. It is an order at the counter sort of place but their branding is nice and it doesn't feel like every other place in AZ. While I do think that's great, it wasn't even close to enough to bring up my review of the food. 

The food was not good. And not just mine ... nobody at our whole table particularly enjoyed their meal (and we are talking 10 people eating like 6 different things)? The burgers were under cooked and juicing out bloody burger juice. The veggies on the burgers didn't look or taste fresh. My chicken was super gristly and battered with the blandest batter I've ever had. The ribs were dry and mediocre. Even the kids barely touched theirs? It just wasn't a good experience. I know we sent back two burgers to be cooked longer but with how busy it was and the sorts of issues we were having, the rest wasn't even worth trying to fix. 

And the thing that made this all even worse is that this place isn't too cheap? If I want to have a crappy burger or chicken I'll go to McDonald's and spend $5 but just my boyfriend and I paid like $30 something bucks for food that we hated and were literally so hungry we ate another meal at another restaurant about an hour later? You can eat MUCH better for that money.

I will say their garlic fries were ok - definitely the best food on the table (which is kinda sad). And the chocolate shake was DELICIOUS. After trying mine, two other girls at our table ordered some. So I guess if you just want a shake and fries I recommend it but I travel to AZ often and I won't be back to this spot.",3,1,0

I went with some of the items sampled by The Food Network. I had the Fontina Burger and the onion rings and figured, why not, let's try the dark chocolate shake too. I don't like mushrooms so I added avocado and took off the mushrooms on the burger. It was a very tasty burger. And they made substitutions with no issues. The onion rings were crispy and good, but not to-die for. The shake was average. It was just chocolate not dark chocolate in my opinion and not worth the calories. I think the favorite item by consensus in my group was the ribs. 

The outdoor seating is beautiful. I loved being surrounded by gardens and sitting under a gigantic tree. Very tranquil, peaceful setting. So after our nice pleasant dinner I got up to ask where the recycle bins were for the plastic drink cups. I mean, come on, this is Joe's FARM grill adjacent to Agritopia's organic gardens and their own 24-hour ""FARM"" stand where you can pick up items and pay via envelope. And the answer I got was, ""WE DON'T HAVE RECYCLE BINS."" Are you kidding me? How can a place like this NOT have recycle bins much less a composting bin? Which leads me to believe that Joe's is all hype and slick marketing. I didn't expect them to be cooking with solar ovens, but seriously?

I decided to have the grilled chicken caesar salad. Mmm everything tastes fo fresh at Joe's.  My husband ordered the Farm Burger (our family fave) and my mouth is watering just thinking about it, luckily I live down the road and can grab one for dinner tonight.  I don't know where they get their beef but it's amazing and always juice.  Some places when I ask for well done I get a ""hockey puck"" but NOT at Joe's.  We decided to have the best of both worlds and split the burger\/salad between us.  A great choice.  I always order the fresh cole slaw.  It tastes like something my grandma might have  just made it fresh for me back when I was a kid growing up. I think that is part of the appeal of JOe's Farmgrill.

It does get crowded at the typical feeding hours, especially weekends. Plan ahead as the wait for food can be over 45 minutes.  Problems I've had, filled wrong order for to go, got home and found it was wrong and overcharged for what I did get. It was resolved by manager on the phone but still frustrating.  Another time my food sat for 20 minutes before they got around to paging me. Very frustrating. The flies have returned, I eat inside and am still constantly brushing them away from my food, I just cover food with a napkin until I get to it.

I worked on a horse farm and there are ways to discreetly address fly issues.  
Good things: the fried zucchini and onion rings are great.  The Chicken Farm salad is great when they get it right. However I've noticed the chicken serving seems to have gotten smaller.

The food is fresh and well-prepared with tremendous selection for every palette.  We went on a Saturday night after 6 PM and the line was quite long (it took more than half an hour before we ordered), which apparently is par for the course given this place's popularity.

I went for the Ahi Tuna Sandwich, which was fantastic, paired with fries (I asked for jalapenos on them), and a ginger ale made with sugar cane.

Despite the long wait on line and for our food to be ready, it was well worth it.  The prices are a bit high for food that you order at a counter and then pick up, but I was pleased to support the locally grown harvest and I don't mind paying for gourmet quality.

Maybe one of the two cooks on break or the cook who kept running back and forth to the bathroom texting on could have made some.  I got something else (only because the counter girl made me feel uncomfortable, becuase I was taking too long thinking about a plan B) - it was ok.

Service was mediocre - counter girl just set on our empty drink cups on the counter, forcing us to reach inside their stupid window while she watched.  The maintenance guy (after a good 30 minute BS session with another maintenance guy) proceeded to stink up the outside (how hard is to stink up the outside?) using ridiculous amounts of stainless steel polish.  

I was visiting friends, who said they don't go becuase it is always crowded. Every time we drove by this week, the parking lot was empty.  10 minutes after open - you are already out of stuff for the after-church breakfast crowd - now I see why.

My second experience was definitely better than the first.  We switched it up and tried the pizza and fish sandwich. had to get the onion rings also, to see if the ones from my first visit were unusually bad.  I am happy to report that the food this time around was much better.  The onion rings this time around were crisp and fresh.  The ingredients are fresh, and you can definitely taste it.

I so want to fall in love with this place - partly for the agrarian atmosphere (it's conjoined with Agritopia), and partly because everything on the menu sounds so appetizing!  But with a few exceptions (garlic fries, strawberry lemonade), the food has been a let-down.  My last time here, I had a sonoran dog and a side of fried green beans.  The hot dog was just ok; flavor wasn't outstanding, and there was so much sour cream on it that it cooled off the hot dog and other toppings pretty quickly.  I couldn't taste much bacon at all.  The green beans had a wonderful garlicky aroma, but were very greasy and too heavily breaded.  They quickly turned limp from their own steam as they cooled.  I also tried some regular (not garlic or sweet potato) fries and onion rings.  The onion rings looked beautiful, but the onion was undercooked, and the flavor was bland.  Similarly, the french fries were bland, not particularly crispy, and needed salt. 

I love the outdoor seating under the beautiful old trees, but I feel the prices here are a little steep for the quality of food and the fact that you're eating off of disposable everything (it generates a huge amount of trash; I saw an employee emptying an overflowing trash can when I arrived, and emptying the same trash can -- now overflowing again -- when I left).",1,0,0

Anticipating a cute restaurant on a farm.
Organic veggies.

I got exactly what I was looking for- and absolutely nothing else. It is a cute restaurant on a farm. It does have an interesting menu. It does have prices that would attract a former NoSco resident... but the social atmosphere? I might as well have been at McDonald's. Usually I would not blame the other patrons on a restaurant. This time, the crowd was so overwhelmingly obnoxious, that I had to mention it. It seemed like it was coming from everywhere- noise pollution from every angle. There were children running around with no shoes on and one mother was actually throwing fries at her child because he was misbehaving. Right- that will teach him.

I had the veggie patch pizza and hubski had the grilled tuna sandwich featured on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives. The food was mediocre, although the sweet potato fries were tasty. Hubski liked the cole slaw.

Joe's is another one of those wonderful places that have been featured on Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives. Joe's grows just about all their produce right on the farm so its more than fresh, and all their meats and everything else is Arizona grown or as close to it as possible.

Breakfast- awesome.  I recommend the pancakes, with anything.  They are the best pancakes I have ever had in my entire life.  Seriously.

The atmosphere is awesome. There is plenty of space, unique decor, pretty landscaping, etc. It's a nice place to be. 

But a nice place to eat? Maybe not so much. Don't arrive hungry, because you'll most likely be waiting in a long line - just to order. This seems to have gotten worse, even just recently. The past 2-3 times I've been, the wait has been over an hour. It's definitely frustrating. 

And then there's the price. It's pretty expensive for what it is. Count on at least $12 a person. Probably more like $15, especially if you drink something other than water. 

Now, I'd be fine with the wait AND the price if I felt like the food was worth it. But I've yet to be blown away by anything on the menu here. I actually usually have a difficult time ordering because there are only a couple things that even sound appetizing. I'm usually reasonably happy with what I get, but never to the point that I felt it was worth the time and money. And most of the people I've gone with who have gotten burgers have said they were good, but nothing special.

The one thing I LOVE there is the fried zucchini! If it was possible to run in and grab an order of these real quick I'd be stopping at Joe's a lot more often. 

So, Joe's doesn't really do it for me. If you still want to give it a try, I'd recommend checking out the menu online first and making sure there's something that sounds REALLY good to you, because that meal will cost you time and money!",2,0,0

So of course I had to try the Ahi Tuna Sandwich and instead of getting fries with it I substituted it with the beets salad and got myself the strawberry lemonade.

The sandwich literally just melts in your mouth! and the wasabi mayo they used in it gives a little kick to the taste. Their bread is a bit glazed on top and it tasted so fresh like it was right out of the oven. Their beet salad with pecans and blue cheese was good too and their strawberry lemonade was great!

During my last trip to the land of AZ, I found this place on Yelp and asked some of my friends if they were aware of the place.. Almost everyone I asked highly recommended some dish there, so I had to try it.  Highly recommended was the waffle and ribs breakfast, which I didn't try.

We stopped in for lunch and I had the grilled wedge salad and sweet potato fries.  The salad was a good reprieve from my previous week of gluttony from visiting my old favorite places (Yoh, *bertos!).  The topping to plant matter was good, but I was a little bummed that the ""wedge"" was a halved head of lettuce instead of a wedge and the grill marks were fairly light, almost non-existent.  Despite that, it had all the smokey and bright flavors that I was hoping for.  The sweet potato fries were tasty and plentiful, served with a sweetish\/savory but too-chunky-to-get-on-the-fry pineapple-serrano dipping sauce.  Somewhere else in the mix was this HEAVENLY date shake.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.

I really liked the building and the surrounding areas.  It's surrounded by a community garden (awesome) which you can see from the outside seating area or walk through.  I remember when there was mostly only agricultural plots around there, and it's keen to see this place keeping true to the roots of the area.

Overall, AZ definitely appears to be upping it's game with new eateries and this is one of the new bloods breathing life into the culinary scene.  I look forward to trying more of their foods.",0,0,0

Very thin and the whole sandwich just looked like some beginner cook put it together.  My hot dog was warm at best, the bbq pork was just thrown on there with some type of scooper and had cole slaw just dumped on top of that.  The bbq pork tasted like it was from the day before and the temp also matched that.

I'd been to Joe's Real BBQ and heard tales of their other restaurant, but it wasn't until I took a wrong turn one day and drove by Joe's Farm Grill that I was compelled to try it. 

I convinced my family to have a Saturday lunch here. It wasn't busy yet, and I think that changes the experience for the better. 

Let me get the cons out of the way. It was expensive, especially because we ordered more expensive items and I wanted the beet salad as well. We also got expensive drinks: their fresh lemonade (worth it!), bottled premium soda. Also, yes, flies. And scorpions. But we live down the street and have flies and scorpions as part of our daily lives. It's not avoidable. 

It was hot outside, naturally, but the back was shady and all the plants made it cool. It was quite nice to sit out there even midday, and I usually hate eating outside so that's saying a lot! 

Everything else was wonderful! My family was so impressed including my worldly teenagers and skeptical 8 year old. The decor drew me in. It's so retro and modern at the same time. Just my style. The food will make me go back. 

I had the BBQ sampler, even though I'm not a fan of pork. But I liked their pork! The ribs were not greasy and tasted smoky and of this delicious sauce. Yum. One of the kids got the garlic fries. Oh, they were so good! We all stole them off her plate and plan to get them next time. No other garlic fries compares. The burgers were well prepared and were rated ""better food than el pollo loco"" by the 8 year old. This is very very high praise! Another kid got the shrimp. It was a generous portion and fresh enough to satisfy the New England natives. Caesar salad was fresh and tasty. No one complained about anything! That never happens! 

Overall it was a very pleasant experience. So fun, so comfortable and kind of magical to sit out back with those big trees and silver buildings. I can't wait to go back soon!",1,0,0

1) It's a beautiful farm atmosphere in what some consider ""the middle of the desert""
2) It was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, and I'm a sucker for Triple-D
3) A fresh and tasty take on fast food
4) Unique wacky bathrooms
5) Must-see pneumatic condiment fountain

In fact, one of the times I visited, it was ""Triple-D Month"", which meant they had a lot of promotions relating to their appearance on the much-heralded Food Network show. You could even score a $10 gift card if you showed up dressed like Guy Fieri. I might've been able to grow out and two-tone the goatee, but since I'm bald, I'd never be able to pull off the spiky-haired thing. I will admit, I was tempted to ""borrow"" my neighbor's blonde kid and costume him up just to save a couple of bucks on the fine burgers here.

All the item menus in red type are the meals featured during The Blingy One's visit, so I've been working through them one at a time. I give a thumbs up to the Fontina Burger and the Ahi Tuna Sandwich, but I'm not terribly crazy about the sweet potato fries with the pineapple-serrano dipping sauce. I did fall in love with their garlic fries however, and have to recommend them dipped in the Joe's BBQ sauce (available at the fun-to-use pneumatic condiment fountain).

Not in the way you might think, but in an admiration and respect kind of way. Johnston owns some of my favorite southeast Valley eateries, like Joe's Real BBQ and Liberty Market. He also has another place, Joe's Farm Grill, that's been featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives.

Built out of his childhood home, Joe's Farm Grill is at Agritopia, a neighborhood being built around a farm in Gilbert. Many of the vegetables and herbs come directly from the farm and right into Joe's kitchen. It doesn't get more local than this.

You'd have to squint really hard to figure out what the house may have looked like before it was converted into a restaurant. The place has a retro-modern flair with a nod to the 1960s. The lighting fixtures are groovy, baby.

The ordering process is as straightforward as the menu approach the window and place your order. You're given an electronic buzzer that gives you a good scare when your food is ready. I swear, I jump every time.

The interior is relaxed and comfortable with plenty of open seating, though the best seats are actually outdoors under giant shade trees.

Also outdoors is the condiment bar with ranch dressing on tap. Any place that has one of my favorite dips for French fries on tap is a winner in my book.

The mainstream menu of burgers, pizzas and salads caters to the stroller pushing set that frequents Joe's as well as anyone who enjoys fresh, well-prepared food.

My mouth started watering instantly when I saw how good the food looked. I quickly sank a bite into the Farm Burger ($7.99), which was well seasoned and perfectly juicy. Weighing in at 6 ounces, then covered with a choice of cheese and grilled onions, this is one tasty burger.

The Thai Chicken Salad ($8.99 small\/$9.99 large) takes local greens and veggies, crispy rice noodles and peanuts, then tosses them in spicy Thai vinaigrette. This one was a disappointment because I felt that the dressing was unbalanced with too much sweet and sour and not enough spice.

Joe's pizzas take on a slightly crisp char from being grilled rather than baked. Knowing that Joe does barbecue right at another of his restaurants, ordering the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($8.99) was a no brainer. Smoked chicken breast, bacon, blue cheese, fresh tomato, red onion and with Joe's Real BBQ sauce sounded like a lot of ingredients, but they worked surprisingly well together. The tangy bleu cheese and smoky sweet BBQ sauce created a yin and yang of flavors, a great combination.

For dessert, Joe's has milk shakes ($3.99) including vanilla, chocolate and seasonal fruit.

So it's with much love that I say I'm looking forward to visiting again soon.",7,2,4

I was impressed by the amount of great views and not to mention Guy Fieri approved! This place can be somewhat difficult to find as the building is surrounded by trees. What first appeared as a line out the door, quickly was shorten as the service is fast here. Menus are strategically placed before you enter the front door so you can view the selection as you wait in line. Staff member went around greeting everyone and asking if everyone was good. Appreciated that their staff immediately cleaned down tables as soon as parties left. 

Plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor. Great for big groups. Loved the picnic tables underneath the trees. Both kid and pet friendly environment. Also, very interesting unisex bathroom! Dolls displayed behind a case and a tv in front of the men's stall! Only thing I wish they would fix is the amount of flies both inside and outside. =[ I initially sat outside to enjoy the scenery, but was quickly turned off by all the flies. I thought by moving inside I would escape the flies, but I was wrong. There were not as many flies as outside but was really annoyed that i had to constantly hover my hand over my food to deter the flies. 

Fontina Burger ($9.99) was point. Perfect amount of crisp on the bun, tasty patty, and generous amount of pesto. The sweet potato fries (extra $2.50 charge) were great and included a sweet tasting dipping sauce that completed well. The fresh strawberry lemonade ($3.99) is enough for two people to share.

     I just had to give them one more chance. Maybe I caught them on a bad day when I went there in June. I was initially going to go to El Taco Loco to give them a try but alas they were already closed. So I made my way back up Higley and I thought I'd give Joe another chance.
     I ordered the Farm Burger with cheddar and grilled onions which came with regular fries and the requisite chocolate shake. The burger this time came out nice and juicy with the grilled (they should be called caramelized) onions giving it the finishing touch. Also this time I noticed that the pickles had a kinda sweet kinda dill flavor to them. Very interesting in a really tasty way. The fries, like the sweet potato fries I had earlier, came out crisp on the outside and tender and pipng hot inside. And the shake, oh the shake. It's sooo good!

The surrounding area was filled with trees and there was lots of green to be seen, which is nice seeing as Arizona is full of all things brown. The building was practically made out of windows, which I also love, and it had a very inviting look to it.
After browsing the menu I decided on the Fontina burger with their garlic fries. My boyfriend got the Farm burger with a fresh beet salad. We took a seat outside and waited for our food. The food didn't take very long to come up and I liked what I saw. Even better, I liked how it tasted. I couldn't wait to dive into the garlic fries. They were delicious. My boyfriend thought there was too much garlic on them, but I didn't mind.  The Fontina burger had roasted red peppers, grilled mushrooms, field greens, pesto sauce, and fontina cheese on it. My juicy burger tasted amazing. As for my boyfriend's Farm burger and beet salad, he enjoyed those as well. 
Overall, it was a great experience and the place had a great atmosphere. If I happen to be in that area again, I'll surely stop by and try something else on their menu, but I won't be going out of my way to get there. It's a bit of a journey for a burger joint.",1,0,0

Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was very put off by management's lack of humane treatment toward the handicapped. After expected the handicapped to endure long lines STANDING outside in the hot sun, you would think management would at least offer a chair when asked if there was anything they could do for the handicapped. And not being 20 years old anymore, you would think they'd accommodate the aging category with a foot long hot dog that ISN'T loaded with the chili and cheese on it. (You can ask for it, but they charge you $10.99 for a hot dog, the same as the fully loaded one.)  And the outside dining area, which really brings in the farmhouse feel, isn't really wheelchair friendly, with several inch drops off the sidewalk to the picnic tables.  That's a shame because aging and handicapped individuals deserve the same opportunity to enjoy their nostalgic ""food stand"" goodies as much as the next guy.

The look from the outside was great and covered in orange trees. Once you get out of the car, you forget suburbia is so close. It's truly an urban farm. We walked into the retro former Johnston home and walked right up to get our food. The menu had so much to choose from that I got a special bbq chicken sandwich and garlic fries. The garlic and herbs were pulled straight from the farm, diced, and spread over the fries. Awesome.

My friend told me I had to check out the bathroom, which was something out of the Jetson's or Buck Roger's. I don't know what old skool show they were playing (something from the 60s). 

Out back was a huge huge tree with tables all over. I loved the sign that said to keep off for fear of falling and scorpions. Lol. My 5year old definitely stayed away. We walked around, took pictures, ate, and checked out the gardens by The Coffee Shop (which I will hit next time).

Well, Except for one 2 star review, I dont seem to see any negative reviews.  Its either because ""The Family"" keeps the reviewers in check...or, Joe's is legitimately an amazing place.  I guess it's the latter but I'm going to go on thinking whatever I want!

Joe's was the second food stop on our trip througout the southwest.  Although we had breakfast only a few hours before we got to Joe's we still did our best to push our gastro abilities to the limits.  

At first I looked through the huge menu at a ton of options that sounded good.  From the BBQ Pork Plate to the Ahi Tun Sandwich to the BBQ Pizza, there are a ton of great options that you would never expect at a Burger place.  But Joe's is so much more then a burger place.  The ingredients are fresh, not just fresh but actually from the farm next door fresh.  

That being said...I got a burger 

Well I got a burger, chili fries, a vanilla bean milkshake and a ginger ale to wash it all down.

The menu appeals to everyone, from foodies to Applebee's addicts. It's a unique spot that's great for taking out of town visitors.

Service has been great the many times I've come here. The restaurant is run efficiently, and the few times that we've run into problems (like a burnt pizza), the situation is remedied quickly. My dog once escaped and ran to Joe's (can you blame him?), and the manager was sweet enough to feed him chicken and watch over him until I could leave work to pick him up.

I love that they added a veggie burger to the menu. It's a good one, too! It comes with a vegan 1000 island dressing, but I like to have it topped with the fixings from the fontina burger. Their portobello burger is one of my favorites which says a lot because as a vegetarian, I've eaten my body weight in ""token vegetarian option"" sandwiches. It has an awesome grilled flavor and is simply dressed. I love the grilled pizza too. No one near by does this, and the leftovers make an awesome breakfast.

Speaking of which, breakfast at Joe's Farm Grill is wonderful. My husband swears their pancakes are the best he's ever had at a restaurant, very close to his mother's version. He also goes gaga over the ribs and waffles (but a nap is required afterwards) and the breakfast tacos. I usually get the veggie scramble with a salad, grilled flatbread, and a great fruit cup that *doesn't* include cheapo grapes and cantaloupe.

Patrons wait in line (snakes around and out the door like an amusement park) to place their order at the window. Laminated menus are provided for perusal while in line. Once the order at the window is placed & paid for, then seats and drinks are next. Seating inside is limited to a side room that seats approx 40-50 and a long pub height table near the line to order.

I have heard great things about the chicken and zucchini though, so I'll probably try it again. Everything was very clean for how busy they were.",2,1,1

The ingredients were quality ingredients and they all taste very good. If it wasn't so far I would try more often. Please open more stores in the valley! Prices are a bit too high but the atmosphere and quality food makes it worth it. 

Great for kids and families!",1,0,0

There was a line out the door at 11 on a saturday morning, and they only had one window open. You could see from the line that the cooks were often standing and doing nothing because they were only taking one order at a time. Overall, 2 stars for the service, 4 stars for the food.",0,0,0

I've been lucky to eat at Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert in the past, which has given me pretty high expectations of any of Joe's food ventures. The Farm Grill did not disappoint. 

I ordered the Jumbo Fried Shrimp and the hubs got the Farm Burger. My basket came filled with ginormous jumbo tiger shrimp fried to perfection, homemade cocktail sauce, coleslaw, fries, and garlic flat bread. I'm not big on slaw, but Joe's was good. Very fresh. The shrimp and cocktail sauce were absolutely delicious as well as the garlic flat bread. I substituted the fries for garlic fries and I thought that I had reached heaven. 

Hubby's Farm Burger was THE freshest, juiciest burger that I've ever tasted. Add a little of Joe's BBQ sauce and you're good to go. 

I loved the pneumatic condiment dispensers, I thought it was the bees knees. 

I cannot wait to go back to Joe's for my next food adventure. I would (and have) recommend it to my friends and any body out there who is looking for food that is fresh, local, and just plain divine.",0,0,0

They have awesome customer service. My wife ordered fish and when our order was ready they informed me that her meal was overcooked and it would take a little longer. We were happy to wait and I was impressed that they didn't serve us the overcooked fish. When her food was done, I picked it up and they gave me a gift card with the price of her dish on it. This was not the first time we've eaten there but it was the first time our order was not perfect and not only did they fix it, they paid for it. 

It was a great experience and the food is excellent.",0,0,0
